		<shortDescription>Fidelity to the incredible stress of modern warfare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a combat soldier in the Vietnam conflict. The first thing that comes to my mind watching this film was the equipment used by modern soldiers. In Vietnam we had the clothes on our back, just underwear and shirt, pants, boots, and our weapon. Some soldiers wore "flack vests" but where I served with a small unit in the jungles of the south, I never saw that. It was just your weapon and the clothes on your back. As to the story, it raises from the very beginning all sorts of moral questions. The film opens with actual footage of the over the top training and stress imposed on elite fighting units such as the Navy Seals. We see signs right from the beginning of the film that such severe and brutal training regimens set up a trauma and stress situation inside the emotions and lives of soldiers. There is a critical point in the film where the choice to kill "innocent" people or not to kill them changes everything that happens later. A lot of people will argue about what the choice should have been, and how it might have changed the soldiers chances of survival. That moment is a key to understanding what comes after in the film.Field Command Incompetence. Another issue defined, if not focused upon directly, is how often the field command, Colonels and up, what are called "field" officers, seem to be incompetent, arrogant and often ineffective. Recent published studies of the history of military service of American Generals, for example, show us that the field commanders of armies on the ground is often a tragic disaster.Emotions. Like many who watched this film, I found the long combat sequence very riveting and yet repulsive, in that they are hard to watch. There are several sequences that caused me to have a strong emotional reaction and I had a lot of tears on my face by the time it was over. There is a point in the film where we see a photo of the soldier who survived (Whalberg's character) with the Afghanistan man who gave him "hospitality" and saved his life at a great cost to his village. It is very well acted by an very talented Middle eastern actor. It is very easy in this film to become angry about the bad people that are represented by the Taliban fighters. It is easy, honestly, to just become very angry about all Muslims everywhere in a film like this. Suddenly, right in the middle of this intensity of revulsion towards "terrorists" there is an incredible emergence of human dignity, beauty, that lifts the film upwards, that changes the whole narrative of the film from soldiers captured inside a desperate fight to stay alive, toward the greatest attributes of human society; that of respect and refuge, of personal honor and dignity even in the face of the most terrible events.The film was executive produced by Whalberg, who also stars as the "Lone Survivor", and you can see in his performance and from the credits that roll at the end of the film, that he was very invested in this story. While it is a sort of "classic" Hollywood soldier story, the film has many surprises. It is incredibly effective at showing us, using dramatic events, the stress and trauma a modern soldier fighting the "war on terror" endures over a short period of time in their lives, one that leads to suicides and many other problems for our returning veterans; not to mention the villages and lives changed forever in Afghanistan and the other locations where this kind of warfare continues to this day. I think this film does a much better job at showing this dangerous stress than most other films; but this also makes the film hard to watch. This is a very mature film, very violent. The violence is showed inside of an honest context, but viewers should be prepared for a highly emotional and violent film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor - Brutal and touching piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story - that is the most haunting part of this film. From the title and story itself, audiences already know what the inevitable ending will be, but through the determination of the four brothers, you can't help but hope for a change in their fates. At its core, Lone Survivor is an American war film. The team members are heroes, the Taliban are enemies, and the heroes are able to fight on like in video games or movies. For the opening 40 minutes, it is a somewhat cheesy show of soldiers bravado and training, but it works. Incorporating real footage of the Navy Seals mixed with the actors lets viewers feel for the real life persons and their portrayed characters in the film. Soon after though, they are dropped into enemy territory on an operation to take out a Taliban leader. The mission goes awry when they encounter a small group of locals there, and they are faced with the decision of killing them and letting go. From here, the intensity begins to climb. What is the right thing to do? What would you do? Faced with that moral situation, they decide to cut them loose - soon after, Taliban forces are hot on their tail. The next 40 minutes or so are an action-packed, non-stop brutal war scene. Tension builds as a scope lines up with an enemy head. The shot is fired, blood flies, and the chase begins. With an abundance of slow- mo shots, clear close-ups of kills and wounds, the excellent direction and cinematography provide a painful journey that makes you cringe or tear up the same as the four soldiers. And all of these men in the film play their roles greatly. Just listing them off - Walhberg tough as usual, Hirsch strong and vulnerable, Kitsch pulling off the difficult decisions as leader, and Foster frighteningly embodying cold but caring.These forty minutes of intensity must be attributed to the whole team and crew though. Beyond the camera work and editing, much of the scenes work well because of the locations, the costuming, the painful makeup and design for all the wounds, the typical and tacky war-epic music. The writing and delivery of lines keep the pacing quick and engaging. Regardless of the how the majority of the movie is taken, the conclusion of the film is a nice touch and shows - even with the bloody action and cheesiness - what the film's really about: giving the story of these men who served the country. Lone Survivor, while it can be perceived as more American propaganda, still gives a brutal yet touching look at this journey of four brothers through war. Yes, there were tears. RATING: [8/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and realistic, it opens eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing that this film will accomplish is to make you feel something. I assure you you will not get bored watching it. Now, what you will feel will no doubt be up to you.For myself, I felt mostly rage against a botched mission in an ineffective war. Raytheon should be annoyed that a movie about a mission failed primarily because of communication issues showed their red flashy brand on the comms equipment.I wanted the characters to succeed, to survive, but I could not ignore the fact that they were soldiers being there only to kill an enemy commander. Having all Americans die in slow motion while scores of Taliban died instantly and kind of stupidly didn't help with the empathy. Also showing pictures of dead soldiers with their families with a pathetic American remake of Bowie's Heroes singing in the background at the end of the movie just fueled more rage. People in the field try to carry out their mission and survive, while their deaths become political and mediatic material. I didn't enjoy that.On the other hand, the fights were realistic, the subject based on real events and, outside the pathetism described above, I did not detect a bias towards one side or the other. You will witness two hours of low tech war in all of its horror and stupidity. The actors also play well, although I like Mark Wahlberg in almost everything he does.The story, while showing the preparation, courage and resilience of four soldiers in enemy territory, also showed other things, like the logistical blunders that lead to stupid deaths, over-reliance on technology that doesn't really work as you expect and how choices have consequences on the ground that are beyond the ability of normal courts to understand, whether looking from the legal or moral angle.I liked a lot about the movie how it made you think long after it was over. What would have happened if they just killed the herders? What would have happened if they tied them up, went a bit down, risked a sniper shot at the enemy commander, then just ran? What would have happened if the Pashtuni would have ignored the wounded American or would have killed the Taliban scout force when they came to them? How would the mission have gone if the four guys would have known from the get go that they would be completely alone, with no support or hope for extraction?Overall, a very emotional movie, two hours long, that shows more a general type of heroism than one with a specific purpose. Nicely directed and acted. A bit over dramatic, but then that's to be expected. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lousy on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing Lone Survivor, I was disappointed on many levels. I can handle a bad movie, we pay $10.75 and hope for the best. Lone Survivor, however, is propaganda, and I was insulted by the movie's lack of integrity and general stupidity:1) Bad guys brandishing weapons traditionally struggle with accuracy in movies. Fine. But these four guys face an onslaught of hundreds of soldiers (many with automatic weapons), fall off multiple steep cliffs, survive direct hits with boulders and trees, yet spring to their feet for another round with the bad guys. Even when struck by bullets, they tough it out and continue to fight on. Look, I have nothing against our Navy Seals and root for them while in battle, but even they must abide by the laws of physics.2) The underlying message was that our guys are smart and brave, their guys are wicked and stupid. If this were true, the war would have been over ages ago. Incidentally, the makers of the movie were granted full access by the U.S. military.3) Speaking of which. . .according to the LA Weekly, the producers of Lone Survivor are convicted cocaine dealers and have ties to Russian oil and an alleged contract murder. And while that isn't necessarily an indictment of the movie (for example, I enjoy Polanski movies but realize he's a convicted sex offender) it does give me pause for the movie's motives.4) The symbolism of the cute little village boy was kind of like, "Oh look, they're not ALL bad. A cute little kid, just like one of ours!"5) I'm dismayed and frightened to learn how well this movie is faring at the box office. Putting aside its political overtones, this movie is plain lousy: dreadful character development, false New Mexico landscape, overlong and poorly executed battle scenes, and midway through the movie, poof, it gives up on the narrative back at the base.6) I suspect this movie is for people with yellow "I Support the Troops" bumper stickers. Let's watch our brave boys fight and kick ass, from a safe distance of course. Or hackneyed sports announcers who love to talk about "fighting them over there so we don't have to fight them over here." Calling yourself a patriot, while voting for politicians who would deny health care to a soldier suffering PTSD, a lost limb or worse. If you think that's exaggeration, look it up.7) One star, but only because zero is not allowed. I am heartened so many others also rated the movie poorly. After all, Lone Survivor isn't a Disney fantasy, and we simply would like better screenplays and realism in our movies. I recently viewed Twelve O'Clock High and was extremely impressed by its portrayal of the brave American men who flew daylight bombing missions against Nazi Germany in World War 2. Here we are 65 years later. . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well meaning but self-conscious post-9/11 war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't wish to offend anyone with this, but whenever you have a film like "Lone Survivor" that resonates so strongly with the movie going public, it's easy to be labeled a certain way if you don't follow the film's attitude. I respect director Peter Berg's intentions; he wanted to make a film about this group of soldiers performing their duty, what they are trained to do and what so few are capable of, and the consequences of that job. However, I feel like real life soldiers are more humble than this film is subtle.The film's opening credits feature archive footage of actual Navy SEAL training rituals, which enables the first portion of the film to feel like an extended commercial for the branch, only with movie stars. I wasn't surprised afterward to discover that Berg and his team were given unprecedented access to military resources while making the movie. You have clichéd narration by Mark Wahlberg in the beginning along with some pretty cheesy opening segments that establish our characters. Despite the star power, Ben Foster is the only one that comes off with a lived-in presence, mainly due to his acting ability with not much help from the narrowly minded patriotic script. Once the four man team lands for their mission in the Afghan mountains, the film gets slightly better."Lone Survivor" doesn't attempt to answer any big questions, like, what were the soldiers doing there in the first place, or why is the longest war in American history a failure? However, you can't fault the film for this; that is not its aim. Instead, Berg and company boldly attempt to show what it is like to be a Navy SEAL in the field. He creates a visceral portrait that at times really puts you in their shoes and can be hard to watch. There are two separate sequences of the soldiers literally falling off a cliff that made me wince multiple times. But these battle scenes are undermined by too much shaky hand-held camera shots with quick cuts and zooms that can make it hard to understand what's going on.My biggest problem with the film is the post-rock band Explosions in the Sky doing the musical score. Their instrumental, contemplative and profound music is at odds with the gritty approach the filmmakers take, giving the action a sentimental and over-the-top quality. You only need a few slow motion sequences with their music to understand why people are so taken by the film. Berg used the band to score his 2004 film "Friday Night Lights", which with their score, made high school football look like a matter of life and death. Here, it can almost be played for laughs.At the end of the day, "Lone Survivor" comes off more like "Act of Valor" in an extended celebration of the branch it depicts, rather than the cold, clinical and procedural approach of a film like "Zero Dark Thirty". The final act of the story is very different from the real life event. My theater erupted in applause when the Taliban villain who loves to behead people gets killed. In real life, there was no such threat on our main character's life once he was taken in by the villagers. With exaggerations like these, and lines like, "You can die for your country, I'm gonna live for mine," the film really doesn't do a good job at being anything other than a feel good and proud patriotic product. And don't get me started on the closing credits, with Peter Gabriel's slow and over-the-top rendition of David Bowie's song "Heroes". Not that there's anything wrong with such a film, but let's not pretend that this is the greatest war film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conduct unbecoming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor, the movie, is based on a (supposedly) true story. The source of that story is the book with the same title by Marcus Luttrell, who was indeed the sole survivor of a four-man SEAL team in the mountains of Afghanistan. Endorsing this movie requires ignoring basic military protocols, suspending the laws of physics, and disregarding the capabilities of the human body. The Devil, as always, is in the details.Love of country and reverence for its armed forces runs deep in the United States. This is as it should be, and is unsurprising. We want to believe in the honor, strength and heroism of our men in battle. It is, therefore, relatively easy for a film maker to successfully appeal to our emotions. For example, in the case of this movie, the Director Peter Berg makes it very painful for the viewer to watch as our men are cut down and fighting till the end; the viewer is also inspired. The emotions squeezed from the audience makes almost irrelevant the actor's craft. Instead, we are preoccupied with the images of our bloodied countrymen fighting for their lives.This movie further muddies the water about the catastrophe that the SEALs brought down on themselves. Now we have to contend with the movie, the book, and military reality. Most of us will have a grossly distorted view of that reality by way of Schwartzenegger-like movies, or this one, Lone Survivor.In some ways, this movie improves on realism when compared to Mr. Luttrell's book of fantasies. The Director seems to have found Mr. Luttrell's imaginings too hard to accept. For example:1. MOVIE: When the Afghan goatherds are taken prisoner, the commanding officer (Lt. Murphy) decisively orders that the prisoners not be killed in cold blood, and sets them free.Mr. Luttrell says in his book that there was a vote taken on whether to kill the prisoners, and the author plays a starring role--as he does throughout his book--in the final vote to release them.2. MOVIE: The Lt. Murphy character recognizes that their mission has been compromised and so orders his team to move to higher ground and seek extraction ASAP.Mr. Luttrell says in his book that his team merely moved a few hundred meters, and continued the mission.3. MOVIE: Jumping over cliffs was kept to a minimum--two, I think.Mr. Luttrell describes, in his book, jumping over cliffs and down slopes 6, 7, 8, 9 times or more, with nary a broken bone, and an unsecured weapon close at hand.Unfortunately, the Director chose to accept Mr. Luttrell's wild (and unsupported) claim of 200 enemy soldiers poised to engage the SEALs. In the movie, the SEAL team actually see 200 armed enemy in the village. Mr. Luttrell, in his book, sees 80-100 enemy directly above his position--and notes each enemy soldier's armament; he later just assumes the estimate of 200 in all. Mr. Luttrell has remarkable observational abilities. The number of enemy is vastly reduced in the SEALs' own commendations. Furthermore, other very respected sources give the number of enemy as 8- 10. The SEALs placed themselves in a textbook, tactically worst-case position. A single enemy rifleman could have been fatal to one or more members of that SEAL team.The Afghans in this movie are shown as ambulatory targets, without a hint of soldierly virtue. They know nothing of cover, or how to aim a weapon. Yet, they discovered the precise location of the SEALs, maneuvered on them, and caught them flat-footed.In both the sanitized version (the movie), and in Mr. Luttrell's book, the SEALs' incompetence and disregard for basic military principles is manifest. War is unforgiving, and the SEALs paid the logical price. We should not forget, too, that their failures cost the lives of 16 other American servicemen. Had Lt. Murphy survived, rather than Mr. Luttrell, he should have been court-martialed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy Action Like a Sgt. Rock Comic Book - wait for cable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have already seen Lone Survivor and it was not to my liking unfortunately. I feel the film is completely absurd with 4 Americans shooting and killing about 100 Taliban who continue to attack in waves and are slaughtered while the Americans spend about half the film rolling down a mountain and slamming into rocks and trees...the film is based on a false premise of killing 3 goat herders or releasing them...the actual answer is you hold on to them until the exact moment you get safely into the rescue copter and then you let them go. If you have to march miles and miles you take the goat herders with you. If you can't march them any further you tie them to a tree. In addition, the 4 Americans hunker down on a mountain top and don't appear to have any clay-more mines with tripwires. These are normally set up around the perimeter of an area where Americans are hunkered down. The Americans also went into a combat mission with crappy phones...since their cellphones suck it makes the rest of their fancy equipment and diagram drawing of targets seem silly and pointless. The dialog in this film is poorly written but the acting in and of itself is decent with the best work done by Ben Foster. Mark Wahlberg plays it straight and does not try and over-act and gives a good performance overall. In this movie, the Taliban are brainless and have no problem with losing dozens of seasoned fighters in order to try and kill 3-4 Americans. This is a film where every single time the Americans fire a bullet there is a Taliban going down in a large blood splatter and it seems like it takes about 300 Taliban bullets to kill a single American. Yeah right. This film is a propaganda recruitment film for the US military which in and of itself is not such a bad thing. To be clear the US military is filled with heroes fighting for America's freedom everyday....but this film is more like a Sgt. Rock comic book....you have been warned...now go see the film and write your own review!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional powerhouse film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor depicts the failed Operation Red Wings mission in 2005 in which 18 members of the US Armed Forces were killed in action. The film delivers a heavy handed patriotic look inside what happened during those fateful hours. Right off the bat, the film starts with honoring the men and women who serve the United States in the military via a very powerful, if not, melodramatic montage. We then are introduced to Navy SEALs, Marcus, Mike, Axe, and Danny, all played brilliantly by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster. The actors in this film exude the necessary chemistry for the audience to really feel these characters as not just characters in the film, but in real life as well. From Wahlberg to Foster, all four leads play their roles very carefully and it pays off especially when we see each of them in peril. With such a connection made in the first slow building hour, we are then dropped into a forty five minute, pulse pounding shootout between a huge Taliban force and four trained Navy SEALs. As the title suggest, the shootout does not end pretty and never even comes close to sugar coating the brutal nature of war. The entire shootout sequence is filled with hard edged moments of brutality, gore and truly gut wrenching scenes. It is by far one of the most heart racing moments in recent cinema and considering the end results, it is very heart wrenching that by the end of it, you feel as if the wind has been knocked out of you. By the end of the film, Lone Survivor makes you really appreciate the freedom you have, a feat that has not yet been achieved in film up until now. This film is as good as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, it is absolutely worth seeing on the big screen and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was traumatized by this film. Never in all my years of sitting through war films have I been so offended. I've played Call of Duty games with more authenticity and conscience than this travesty. I expect this level of soulless drivel from Bana and Wallyberg but Foster is going to be yogic flying for the rest of this life and a few reincarnations to make up for this one. Kitsch, well, Battleship looks pretty good in retrospect.S P O I L E R S (as if there was anything here to spoil)The story goes something like this. 4 no neck meat-heads try to out macho each other in a vain attempt to keep their homosexuality buried deep in each others closets for half an hr before they are dropped into Afghanistan where they kill a hundred or so Taliban whilst running away, falling down cliffs (on purpose), being shot and blown up until 1 of the 4 is left barely alive and is extracted after being helped by some locals who receive no thanks and will be targeted for doing so (except for Wallyberg, he squeals a few thanks in his prepubescent shallow breath tone before being carted off). These guys make The Terminator look frail. Actually, that synopsis makes it sound way better than it is. I'm sure there are a bunch of intellectually impaired patriots out there (some on here already) for whom this film will bring a tear to the eye, prompt a swift foot stomp and heel click before an obligatory salute to the stars and stripes. If you breathe through your mouth a lot and think you might be one of them, feel free to imagine an extra 9 stars on my review. For everyone else, this is only worth watching if you're feeling masochistic and want to see how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four soldiers are taking 30 (thirty) 7.42 caliber AK47 bullets to different body parts, a bullet that tears a limb in half. They keep moving and keep killing dozens of Muslims which blood is sprayed in huge amounts of grape juice. Four Brave soldiers are taking 2 huge falls hitting rocks and trees with heads and spines at high velocities. They keep moving and keep killing dozens of Muslims. Four American Soldiers getting hit by RPG HE rounds. They keep moving and keep killing dozens of Muslims. Four Brave American Soldiers keep killing dozens of Muslims with their godly M16A4s while they literally couldn't be killed by shitty terrible Soviet/Russian weaponry (most reliable and deadly weapons in the world actually).Yes, this movie is actually that bad. It brings disrespect to the actual soldiers. When a professional in this kind of stuff watches this movie, all he/she can do is laugh at the level of fiction and facepalm at the stupidity of actions.Lone Survivor is rated 7.8 on IMDb and 90% on RottenTomatoes. This shows the level of intellect and how brainwashed typical American viewer is. The target audience the movie was aimed at.Mark Wahlberg should take some notes from Matt Damon, when the first is taking part in retarded propaganda for dumb target audience, the latter is bringing water and toilets to Africa, traveling there himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some have cast doubts on the verisimilitude of parts of this picture. Of course, those who impugn whether some events really happened or whether they happened the way they are depicted in the movie neither underwent the kind of training Navy S.E.A.Ls do nor did they ever find themselves in circumstances remotely approaching those of the four comrades. We do not know what punishment the human body is truly capable of withstanding until we are put to an extreme test, gods forbid.All I can say is that, regardless of whether this movie is accurate 100%, 0% or anything in between, it brought me to tears. I can honestly not remember the last time a Hollywood movie did that.Very moving, very poignant, very touching. For that alone, as well as for keeping me riveted for the whole of two hours (which is quite a feat given my cynical and jaded nature), it deserves unalloyed plaudits.</fullReview>

They tried to fix bad image of American soldiers and the things they made &#x200b;&#x200b;in the recent wars and have made some bad mix of Superman and Rambo. People are dropping tens of meters down a rocky mountain, strike with a head in stone but firing unerringly, killing hundreds of opponents, who are naturally evil, dirty and sad examples of human beings. Do you remember the worst war movie you watched? This one is several times worse. I can not believe that anyone could give this movie a positive evaluation. In war, people can overcome their opportunities, especially superbly trained soldiers but there are limits to what the human body can not handle. Header into the rock after tumble at high speed down the mountain is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.I read some reviews about "Lone Survivor" where it was mentioned alongside to a "Saving Private Ryan" - you can throw a rock at me if this comes close to "Saving Private Ryan" which is beyond many moons and seas compared to "Lone Survivor". "Lone Survivor" is good action movie, with some heroic stuff (they definitely couldn't avoid that...), and i know that it's based on real events, thats why i'm giving it 8, because many of things displayed in picture were sadly true, many, but definitely not all. When someone is being killed in this movie (exept for bad guys from Taliban), it's shown in a similar way as Jim Caviezel aka.Jesus was suffering in "The Passion of the Christ" - only true American heroes die like that, not afghans who are more or less just a meat between bullets and Americans in this movie.Overall, i liked this action picture, the sound design and sound editing were really top notch (no wonder it got 2 Oscar nominations) - you can hear every detail in the forest, every breaking bone (ye, the fall from cliffs scene was gripping). Actors were just OK, nothing special. The gunfight was terrific at least in the beginning of battle, truly terrific sound design and camera work. Later, well, when bad guys were shooting with RPG's every 2 min to our heroes, and they were suffering real good but still were able to do some heroic stuff, the tension was kinda lost.Overall, 8/10 for me because of good production values and for that it is based on real events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy sh*t......You get so many action movies nowadays following familiar formulas that when you watch one of them you know that just when the good guy is about to get overcome by the enemy, the backup arrives and helps him. The formula desensitizes you.But when a movie is based on a real story, the good guys sometimes do not come. They do not come in an hour; they do not come in a day; and if they come, they are not invincible. Real problems do not follow formulas. Real life is sobering in its beauty and its horror.Lone Survivor does not have a very original or interesting premise for an action movie. A squad of US navy SEALs is dispatched on an assassination mission. Things do not go as planned.However, the quality of the cinematography, solid acting and good action is what makes this such a great film.Out of all the actors getting to play a part not one is bad. Not one fakes it. It feels that everyone is trying to do their best.The film is also gorgeous. It didn't have to be. It is. The Afghanistan these guys are in is fake because the entire movie was shot in the United States, but it looks authentic and breathtaking.The action is raw and graphic. Not in a guts-on-the-floor kind of way, but falling-down-a-cliff-side kind of way. Again, you can feel that the people have tried to do a good job. You know how just much they tried? Broken ribs and punctured lungs were involved in the making of this movie.If there is one problem I have with the film is that it has a self-imposing limit to how big or interesting it can be. It is a story about one military operation and nothing else. No background stories for the characters, no side events, and barely any relationship development. I remember as a kid I was really fascinated by the military ops and wrote a story, as good as I could, about an imaginary mission. Even as I was writing it, I realised that it can never be truly interesting to read because the range of the story is too small. And this film is like that. What's worse, the title of this film gives away the ending. It is basically a giant spoiler.But it is a testament to the movie's quality that, even though the movie gives almost no background information to the characters, it still managed to really make me care about them. Even with weights on its legs, the film still manages to make such an interesting run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful. However I enjoy war films that make an impact, showing war for what it is. This film was miles off that mark. Making comedy to please the arena. Rather then actually paying the proper tribute to the fallen with their acts of courage, bravery and valour. There were absolutely no combat tactic's of any real battle significance shown as established.This film was a machine-gun'slasher, in it Rambo meets Sparta. The frogmen aka sniper-ninja's. Try to fly off of mountainsides a few separate times. Headbutting granite, smacking their necks, backs, limbs into tree's and rocks. When being riddled with .45 calibre rounds from enemy Ak47's. The enemy who engage with superior numbers, die overwhelmingly to single shot kill guns. Even when having many RPG's but not grenades. After the insurgents claim the elevated positions, they can not really create any shrapnel explosions of any kind, even when the frogmen are but a few yards below. The Talibunnies die in numbers to the holy hand grenade, in this propagated comically attempt at heroism. The scenery shown was within a lush forest. I am wondering what part of Afghanistan that region is? Perhaps bordered with Pakistan wouldn't response EVAC been more timely, if being backed by air support or drones? Would the insurgents not have planted IED's and mines where the radius for optics on their stronghold was in location. Despite of arming their goats with cell phones? Alas the frogman's tale is spun on the title, once being peppered with so many bullet holes they eventually. Well....Action film's could be made with realism when showing specific war events in honour of those that have fallen. Or they are turned into fiction. This is Sparta, NO, not at all..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best War Movie since "Saving Private Ryan" only an actual story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read the book and heard the interviews with the actual "lone survivor" you know that this movie got as close to the real events as possible. The 4 actors really gave it their all. Beginning long before shooting when they started their training so they would look realistic. This movie is also the most visceral experience since "Saving Private Ryan". There were falls in this movie that actually hurt more just watching than when I broke my foot 2 years ago. And in the making of you see that crazy stunt people actually did those falls, supposedly without dying. It's of course impossible to spoil this movie given it's title but it's important to note that the guy who helped him risked his whole village for "The Americans" Safety. And he didn't think twice about it. Sometimes we forget that not all of them are Taliban. After all is said and done this is a must see if there ever was one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As believable as WrestleMania 29</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's for a moment abstract away all the blue team good, red team bad stuff and focus on the facts of this movie as we are told them. In the left corner we have the blue team consisting of 4 guys armed with three M4A1 Carbines and one Mk. 12 Mod 1 Special Purpose Rifle. They each carry a couple of hundred rounds of ammo and some M9 pistols. In the right corner we have the red team consisting of a couple of hundred guys armed with AKMS, PKMS and type 69 RPGS. Already things are looking bad for the blue team but things are about to get even worse when we learn that the blue team members consists of guys who will be airdropped into a foreign civil war where team red is currently fighting. They will know nothing about the local customs and language and will have to make their way on foot using only maps and a radio. Their task will be to kill the commander of the red team and get back safely.Having only this basic information any reasonable man will conclude that team red will wipe out team blue and he will be correct 99 times out of a 100. What is perhaps more surprising is the amount of damage that this 4 man team is able to cause and absorb. And this is where we leave the realm of the possible and enter the real of WrestleMania. I would have much preferred the depiction of what probably actually happened. They where spotted, engaged and finally subdued. At least this way we would all have learned a valuable lesson. That being; if the mission sound crazy, it's because it probably is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure intensity, action, death, and bravery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor (2013)A more-or-less accurate depiction of four highly capable SEAL soldiers dropped into enemy territory in Afghanistan. They were then discovered and attacked by dozens of area Taliban. The recreation is riveting, disturbing in its intensity, and eye-opening. Whatever you feel about the war there, or even about soldiers killing other soldiers, you end up admiring the sheer abilities of these fit, smart, determined men.And only one survives (this is told in the title). So you go into it knowing it will end badly, and also that one of them (probably Mark Wahlberg, the biggest name here) will make it. If the fighting, which makes up most of the movie in the center core of it, is seemingly endless, that's part of the point. But when it shifts to a local village near the end the tale has another kind of intensity, and a welcome change.This is straight up action material. It lacks even the layers that other movies with similar settings add (see "The Hurt Locker" for one example). But in a way that makes this distinctive. It moves in linear fashion through time, through the events, and so you barrel along without mental complication to the end. It forces everything on the action, and the realistic portrayal of the unbelievable hardship and pain, and death, that comes along the way.Check out the overly-long Wikipedia page on this movie for lots of facts about production, and about the liberties they took with the facts. Or just watch the movie knowing that there are the usual permitted changes that dramatization requires. Even as pure fiction the movie has enough kinetic and heroic acts to succeed on its own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as well those Taliban can't shoot straight huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or this movie/true story would have ended after 45 minutes, but thankfully for the 'true story' the Tallis could only shoot toes and buttox and elbows and fingers with their Ak-47's and rocket launchers and such and any actual body shots were thankfully not immediately fatal, compared to the headshots popping from the marines left right and centre it just became comical (almost bullet for bullet at one point). At that rate of accuracy i am amazed there are any Taliban fighters left on that planet with the headshot ratio in regards to bullets fired and headshots acquired, don't think i was ever even that good on Counterstrike back in the day.I am sure as mentioned by the other reviewers that kit details, camp set out and beards and sunglasses details were very accurate and I am thankful for that aspect of the storytelling, which is what this is storytelling, only truth being is that a bunch of Marines went in and only one came out and as we know from the title at the end of this misery there was a lone survivor so is there any need to even watch it, obviously the lone survivor he can the tale however he likes with as many Marines getting headshots as he needs and he clearly did, unless the producers felt the story needed embellished to keep us watching and are responsible for the headshot count.I mean no offence to any soldiers out there fighting these corporate wars, out there doing their duty but i see no justification in ever taking a human life, i don't care what religion, colour or creed they hold true, or what they done or didn't do, life is either sacred for all or not at all, it is black and white not shade of grey. History will look back on this era with shame and we all share it equally, we have global awareness for the first time in human history and we turn a blind eye to the disgraceful behaviour of our political elite and the wars they have us fight in their cause, through inaction we are as much to blame as those who make it happen.All in this is the worst war film i have ever watched, true story or not.RIP everyone on both sides who died in the making of this true story(all the human beings, yes that includes The Marines and The Taliban soldiers), my condolences to all your loved ones left behind in pain, don't worry no goats were harmed (just people) in the making of this true story although they are everywhere when the shizer hits the air circulation apparatus the marines were focusing on Taliban headshots and the Taliban fighters (although clearly inhuman as depicted) did not feel the need to slaughter the goats to get to the Marines.</fullReview>

But it will be apparent a couple of moments later, that there is a lot of Death to follow. It's almost a case of what can go wrong will go wrong. And while there are a lot of other outcomes that this could've taken, decisions had been made, consequences had to be taken (upon).What really gets you though are not some clichés about soldiers (and I think this stays as much as possible away from them), but the fact, that this feels as real as it can be, without you actually being in a war. Mark Wahlberg and the other actors have to go through a lot, when ... well you know what hits the fence. And it does hit pretty hard.

		<fullReview>As many war films have surfaced along the years, Lone Survivor is one of the better depictions of true events. Lone Survivor stands as an outstanding account of bravery and comradeship under fire, with acts of selflessness abounding. And director Berg (Friday Night Lights) could not have presented it more humanistically, or with more compassion for those who gave their lives on a mission that was doomed from the start. As it observes one of the four SEALS originally dropped onto Sawtalo Sar, the rugged mountain near Asadabad where insurgent leader Ahmad Shah was believed to be commanding a large band of Taliban fighters. "No curse," Luttrell replies, "just Afghanistan." But cursed they were, as Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and fellow SEALs Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster) and their leader, Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), encounter nothing but horrible luck after confirming Shah's presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor- A Brutally Authentic and Nonpartisan Portrayal of the War Time Experience Told Through Peter Berg's Respectful Direction and Honest Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An undeniable aspect of war, whether or not you make rationalizations on its regrettable purpose or demonize its existence entirely, is that it's an utter hell that tries the mentality and physicality of the courageous men and women who fight in the conflict. Most war films have captured the hellish and nonsensical brutality of war through challenging cinematic portraits, either through the allegorical heart of darkness showcased in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, the apathetic political influences in Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory, and even in cinema's first triumphant reflections with the adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front. But while all wars impact people there aren't enough films that showcase true examples of wartime heroism which neglects a chance to embrace the humanity in the soldiers who are put into these tumultuous and life threatening circumstances. This is where Peter Berg's ominously titled latest film Lone Survivor differs from the a vast majority of the war film experience because rather than postulating on the reasons or criticisms for war it only seeks to depict the strong links of brotherhood involved in our armed forces ranks through an effective nonpartisan slant. Returning to his attention to detail roots showcased in The Kingdom and leaving behind an unfortunate deviation into the ridiculous with Battleship, Berg has concocted a relatively solid film in Lone Survivor that follows the real life events that happened in 2005 to Navy SEAL Mark Luttrell and his team in the Afghanistan Mountains when a secret operation is compromised. Though the film could have had deeper character development and interaction in the first quarter of the film, an aspect that slightly detriments the overall impact of the picture, its solid and intimate middle core of brutally authentic wartime conflict captured in real time is a technically astounding, emotionally engaging, and definite pulse pounding experience. To the film's creative credit in staying true to the events that transpired it demonstrates that the relentless pummeling of war doesn't always come with the Hollywood convention that is graceful relief giving the film a true experience of modern warfare. Lone Survivor might have its storytelling flaws, mainly due to a conventional structure and some fairly assumed character involvement, but when it erupts into the focused intimacy of soldier bonding amidst the chaotic brutality of battle in the middle of the film it becomes a relatively involving homage to the relentless dedication of spirit within our soldiers.More on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-Cx; Other reviews: generationfilm.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very big, and full of pretty American movie stars with bad beards, but it is just a remake of Bravo Two Zero. Right down to them getting spotted by a goatherd and arguing about their options, and then still not coming up with the more obvious ones.Try:Option 4. Cuff them together before you let them go. Still safe for them but means they take much longer to get help.Option 5. Take them with you for an hour before you let them go. That means you are 3 hours further away by the time they raise the alarm. From there it all gets a bit Hollywood. I can ignore the seemingly infinite ammunition, because at least you see them changing magazines, it just seems they are carrying about 20 magazines each. Every time a taliban gets shot by an American, it is instantly fatal. Every time an American gets shot, or blown up, or hit by shrapnel or falls down a 50 foot cliff into a tree/rock, he just gets up and carries on as if nothing happened. One of them even gets shot in the head and carries on! This gets even more ridiculous near the end when this skill becomes transferable to the helpful Afghani, who is able to win a fist fight with the taliban leader despite being shot in the arm.</fullReview>

They are on the run and have no where to go...so you think they might do some cool rambo sh*t, go booby trap some c4 and gangster....but instead they jump off a cliff and all live... um lmfao who is writing this crap? oh yea, and then they do the same exact thing again from a higher cliff 5 minutes later...HAHAHA.. I'm surprised they didn't jump off more cliffs and walk it off, this bad movie could have gone on forever....D. Just some little things like they had no GPS, just running around like idiots not knowing where they going, not being tracked by their officers, they have no translator - and undercover navy seals team in Afghanistan and not one of them speaks one word of the language....The baddies shoot like 20 RPG's in the movie, never hitting anything, then when the copter comes for a pickup...BULLSEYE right through the door...lol nice.E.

		<shortDescription>A Good Film But You Do Feel It's Embellished A Bit Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A NATO special forces mission in Afghanistan sees a four man team capture a senior Taliban commander and they manage to extricate him without firing a shot A rather boring premise for a book which is why you'll never see it used . People don't like hearing about success in this context hence we get the horror stories of things going wrong in war . It appeals to both sides of the divide where war porn addicts can immerse themselves in gore and courage and jingoism while grief whores can gnash their teeth and tell themselves nothing in human nature is worse than war - not even eternal defeat and tyranny by a victorious enemy . This film LONE SURVIVOR based upon the true life account of a firefight in Afghanistan written by Marcus Luttrell might actually appeal to both sides but at the same time you can say it's guilty of having its cake and eating it . A four man Navy SEALS team goes in to hostile Taliban territory to keep tabs on a local warlord . As I said no one wants to hear about a mission that goes right so within a short period something goes wrong and things from bad to worse and even worser and we're not even halfway through the film yet LS shows that war is hell but overdoes things and has embellishment . It's not enough for someone to be knocked off their feet by a grenade blast - they must be blown off the top of a hill , and bounce off rocks , bounce off some more rocks and bounce off even more rocks then their fall is broken - by rocks. It does seem difficult to swallow what some human bodies can endure where physics is concerned but I wasn't there nor am I a USN SEALS member either . But even so the film often hits wrong notes like a lengthy scene where the team discuss the possible execution a trio of goat herders in order to make a clean get away to their rendezvous point . Again I wasn't there but why would a special forces team consider what is effectively murder in order to keep their cover ? If the bodies are found then that would invite counter-murder with extreme and painful prior torture from the Taliban if captured . Likewise it's almost as if the unit have been able to predict that they'd be unable to contact base once they arrived at the rendezvous point . I don't want to accuse anyone of lying especially when I'm sat here on a safe sofa out of a war zone but little things like the things seen here don't really ring true . But as I said I wasn't there Where LS deserves some credit is not portraying all Pashtuns as violent savages . Several years ago I had a brief online chat with a former security contractor who spent several years in Afghanistan . I asked about the Russian film 9TH COMPANY and if it was true of the Pashtun tradition of "Haram" seen in that film where if you're a guest of a Pashtun you're not allowed to be harmed . The former contractor whose name was Nick informed me that only was true but if you're a guest of a Pashtun village then the hosts have also a duty to Allah to defend you with their lives ! Despite all the understandable bad news coming of Afghanistan for decades Nick also told me if he hadn't met his wife he'd still be there if only because of Pashtun uber-hospitality .This is recreated in detail were the titular lone survivor crawls in to a local village though again the film overplays its hand a bit after this by having another action sequence And maybe this sums up LONE SURVIVOR perfectly . It's another film on the war is hell theme but the trouble with war porn is unlike sexual porn it ends up becoming ironically and unintentionally erotic . It's a good film from a technical point of view but you're left with the feeling it's more of a patriotic flag waver rather than being genuinely anti-war</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disbelief suspended... right off a cliff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pretty much tuned out at that moment and gave up on the film altogether a short while later. I looked up the actual events on Wikipedia because I genuinely could not believe that anything I was seeing could have happened. The fact that most of the story is the sole recollection of a critically injured individual then fed through a Hollywood filter shines an unlikely light on most of it.The four men take rifle rounds like they are BBs and receive only superficial facial wounds after jumping off cliffs and crashing into rocks and trees. Therefore the events in the film are either grossly exaggerated or the laws of physics had been suspended that day. Either way I just lost interest. Mixing 'based on a true story' with 'Rambo 6: Revenge of Rambo' doesn't work.Besides that though the film just generally angered me as I couldn't understand the motivations behind what the characters were doing. The beginning of the film which showed a montage of the incredibly harsh training they go through painted a really amazing picture of the physical prowess required to become a Navy SEAL. It didn't show any kind of tactical training or any tests involving logic, reasoning or just plain common sense though and that is probably for the best.The team faced a tough choice when confronted with the goat herders and no option was palatable. However why they chose the one which was guaranteed to give their position away and see them hunted to extinction was just baffling. They knew they would go back to the village and alert the large ruthless militia yet still the option of simply taking them with them as they bugged out didn't even merit consideration apparently. They could have remained unnoticed and released them when they were out of the woods (literally). But no...So then, with the knowledge that an army was likely coming for them they decided not to put some extreme distance between them and the village but instead to hide in a forest and get discovered in short order. Then they choose the brilliant tactical option of jumping off a cliff thus leaving themselves injured, unarmed and with the high ground in the hands of the enemy.Nothing in this film made sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine Patriotic rabble Rouser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a formula Hollywood shoot-em-up, more commonly told in the past as a Western or in Vietnam. As a piece of film making it is fine, but well short of classic status. Its popularity is due to its simplicity- the good guys triumph over the bad guys against overwhelming odds with heroic sacrifices and, ostensibly, having occupied the moral high ground.The film-makers had the assistance of the American military, and it shows. The hardware, uniforms and operations are authentic, unfortunately the New Mexico location does not double well for Afghanistan, because of the differences in vegetation.The opening training and team building sequence is pretty much a recruitment advertisement for the American military. There is nothing wrong with that, but it sets a tone which ultimately condemns the final result as routine. The Taleban ( with black turbans) are shown as bad, beheading an informer. The SEALS are shown as good, declining to execute an unarmed goat herding party that stumble upon them with mortal consequences for the group. At the end, villagers sympathetic to the Americans save the day ( wearing white turbans) and the Taleban are ritually routed with some USA shock and awe Apache and fixed wing gunships.As in any good western, the bad guys die with every shot and are tactically inept, the good guys sustain multiple gunshot and other injuries but fight on. Patriotism, valour and rugged determination are the order of the day, with three good guys dead, but dozens of bad guys wasted to sweeten the pill.First and foremost this is a piece of patriotic entertainment, and it scores highly as such. But beyond that the American public are cheated of the bigger picture. The Afghan people did nothing to warrant having their country invaded and occupied again ( Saudi Arabia post 9/11 would have been a bit awkward). Locals collaborating with invading forces have never been popular, the Americans themselves were not that impressed having the British on their soil. Are Afghans, unimpressed by having foreign execution squads on their soil, really the bad guys? Furthermore, do local militia, battle hardened by fighting the Russians, on home turf, really make such easy targets?I have much time for America as a country, and its people. But they do occasionally deserve some war films a little more thought provoking than this.Director Peter Berg has a distinguished film making record behind him and acquits himself well with the story and action. Although Mark Wahlberg is the eponymous Lone Survivor, he is by no means the star in a well- cast team effort. The action sequences are dynamic and riveting, but the crudely set context lets it down both in terms of the enemy, and the ineffective rescue response. This film is perfect for the "Call of Duty" crowd, but unsatisfying for those hoping for something a little more cerebral.</fullReview>

Cuff these captured suspected Taliban, retrieve into an area to establish Communications FIRST, try to hide your tracks the best way possible or even lay down a false track.Furthermore, once Com is established and you don't have a interpreter on hand, then use Com to rely intel from the bad guys (if they are talkative), use an interpreter on the other side of the call and have him/her translate whatever you need.......but don't let go of your bargaining chips - EVER!Time is of the essence once you are compromised, and no matter how you look at it, these guys were compromised; however, the mission could still be a "Go" if these Seals had taken a more conservative strategy into consideration and just refined their tactics and overall approach, remember, the goal was to kill/capture this Taliban leader, and he was still in their sights. And by the way, the Rules of Engagement are always established prior to any encounter in the field on foreign soil which appears to be another issue giving that this movie is supposed to be based on real encounters.I have a huge respect for anyone wearing a uniform fighting for his country but to be honest, this disaster could have been avoided. Now some will probably push the "in hindsight" button, but sorry, what I tried to elaborate here is just the way we were trained and I'm certain it could have been a different outcome.So I can not give this movie any higher rating, all the equipment, weapons and tactical plays may have been accurate or close but from my point of view, it is a display of poor judgement that unfortunately cost the lives of a few brave man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective but sits awkwardly in the middle of impacting horror and flag-waving heroism (SPOILERS ? although the title did it already)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To get it out of the way ? what a terrible title for the film. I am sure that many will know this story but I am equally sure that many more will not, myself included; so to essentially suggest from the moment we buy a ticket that there is a lone survivor is a very strange choice for a title. I am used to trailers giving the ending away, but I can't think of many other titles that do it like this. Anyway, that out of the way not, this film is a dramatization of the failed Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan where four Navy Seals are hunted by a small army as they try to escape ? and just in case you don't know the true story, and don't know the title of the film, let me just say that it does not go well.Assuming that we know how this will go, the film is still pretty effective in what it does and I do think that Berg has done an overall good job of directing but at the same time I get the feeling that he wants to do too many things that don't all sit well together. How you take this film will depend on you and there are really several ways to come at it. On one hand this is a terrible waste of life across the board and it is a story of human suffering and death in a war that is full of it. However on the flipside of that, to think this way is to not "support the troops" and the other way to watch it is to cheer when the Seals valiantly try to hold their position, and remove your cap and let a single tear fall when one of them fails to make it. It is difficult to do both but this is what the film tries to do because we have a sense of flag-waving pride while also the real horror and impact of what we are watching. Which side of the film you feel is the "right" direction is up to you, but for sure having both makes for an awkward pairing.For me I think the film worked best when it was horrific, when fear and pain was being shared with the viewer and the hopelessness of the reality is allowed to set in. I would have liked to have known the men a bit better to have had more of an emotional connection but for what it was I felt moved and impacted by the action ? not excited. At times the action sequences seem to back this up and they are not so much exciting as horrific ? I doubt few people would be thrilled by the waste of life as a rescue helicopter loaded with men is downed. However at times the action is quite thrilling and it does seem to be trying to get the home fans on their feet almost. Such moments are capped by the heroic and manly deaths that are often delivered in stylish and respectful ways albeit with the problem that you do feel they should have a superimposed American flag fade into the background of the shot at the same time. This mix of aims never settles down and while it is all still effective as a story, I often felt like I did often wish that Berg would get off the fence and do something a bit more and other things a bit less.The cast are good and they do what is required of them, albeit this changes. The use of familiar faces helps overcome some of the lack of characterization, because in a way we "know" the men, albeit as faces not people. Wahlberg is an obvious bit of casting and I don't know if he was the best for the job albeit he is a big name and gets it done. Kitsch, Bana, Foster and others are all as good as him and I did appreciate the respect they showed the character but yet their performances didn't hide the fear, the desperation and the ultimate tragedy of what happened. Lone Survivor is an effective film which tells a tragic story in an engaging way. It is a shame that it flips around from "brutal horror" to "posed heroic death" mode because the two approaches undermine one another whereas to make one the goal would have made a more consistent film (and which is "right" is really down to the individual in this case). Worth seeing for the story and what it does well, but I would have liked it to hit me much harder than it did by simply taking the parts that it did really well and focusing on doing them more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regrettably, nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad movie, but it will soon be forgotten.If you have read the book, you will have already noted that there are some serious disparities between Luttrell's account, and the findings of the military investigation. Luttrell's book claims he and his team fought 'hundred's' of Taliban, killing large numbers of them. The militaries own investigation showed around 10 Taliban were involved, with an unknown number killed. Given about 20 odd American military personnel were killed in this engagement or in the flawed rescue attempt, that's a significant 2:1 butt-kicking at least the Seals took from the Taliban. A fact conveniently ignored in the book and the movie.Secondly, there is a fair bit of liberty taken by the director that doesn't give Luttrell credit for the far more severe hardships he endured in this event, mainly by compressing the period between the gunfight on the mountain with his rescue into just a couple of days or so. Read the book: the author is one incredibly tough guy!Finally, just too many clichés that are now becoming standard in these types of movies (or have been long established archetypes).1. The portrayal of pre-battle Seals as lovable, cuddly guys just there to do a job, who spend a lot of their time talking about choosing colors for the kitchen, or just being darn cute. This imagery seems to have replaced the usual cliché of the doomed soldier who pulls out the picture of his girlfriend and tells his foxhole buddy "This here's Mary-Lou, she's the girl for me", and subsequently gets shot (Platoon has the best portrayal of this cliché).2. Slo-mo deaths. No idea why this is necessary, but it's been common for decades.3. The cavalry arriving in the nick of time. Didn't happen in the book, doesn't happen in real life, but happens in just about every American war movie I have ever seen. Yawn.4. The cliché that people, for some reason, pass out when pain gets extreme. I don't know where this comes from. Admittedly this would be a handy physiological mechanism, but it doesn't happen in real life: ask a paramedic.So all up, ridden with cliché's. An OK movie, but will disappear out of memory pretty swiftly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into the movie, I had high hopes, with ratings on this website, word of mouth, box office receipts. I must have missed the memo because I was thoroughly disappointed with the overall message the movie was trying to get across.Why was this movie made? What was the point? How many more movies do we need to exploit our brave Navy Seals? It doesn't put them in a very good light, as many mistakes (according to Hollywood) were made during their fateful mission.Overall, I can see the allure of the movie to those Patriotic Americans who need to validate their belief that we belong in Afghanistan. For the rest of us who have been against this atrocity before we even went there, it's another reason to shake my head.Also, people who claim they are Seals here? I have to call them out...what "real" Team member would want you to run out and watch them fail?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love war movies that convey a message to the viewer. The message here is : America 360 no scope head shot! We the best, go to hell Isaac Newton your theories do no apply here! This movie try to appeal to basic human emotions by showing that American soldiers can survive against 200 Taliban soldiers equipped with bazookas and automatic rifles. One thing that especially annoyed meis when the lead actor hid below a little cliff around the last part of the movie. Let's be real, why would the Taliban just let you rest/recover for the night? They have been following you around the whole mountain for god knows how long and all of a sudden they decide to call it a day. Next thing you know, dude is saved by "good" Afghans because if we didn't have a nice third party the viewer would have almost asked himself : Huh, why are they there to begin with? That's exactly what I would be asking myself if I didn't know anything about this whole conflict. Oh but yeah, they did tell us that Ahmed Shad has already killed so many American soldiers without giving us the explanation behind it as well so that should warrant enough cause to go and kill Shad without any explanation. Anyways, I'm not defending the Taliban here but I think the viewer should have at least seen their side for 30 seconds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found myself covering my eyes through a lot of this movie because I know a lot of people in the military and it was just too personal to watch these soldiers being killed so brutally and needlessly. I also felt a lot of anger during this movie because of the ridiculousness of the assignment given especially in light of the failing equipment and lack of response by the commanders. It is because I know these failings are true first hand and that the fighting man's back is not the first concern, this movie stuck in my stomach. I loved seeing the part about the men who helped him survive. This is something that is not often shown in war movies but is a part of the reality of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo III feels more realistic than this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We get it. It's another war film to tribute American soldier's fallen comrades in Afghanistan. But lets be truthful for a moment. This film has all the honesty and realism of say... Rambo 3. The gratuitous punishment taken by these soldiers is about as realistic as a Power- Ranger on PCP wrestling with Godzilla. Without giving too much away, it's another depiction of American Military tech interwoven with heavy machismo glib. Being seriously outnumbered and constantly riveted with bullets is another day "on the job" for these seasoned Spartans of American might. Taking a tumble down a hill that would kill any rock climber is walked off with a shrug and a sneer and a typical high- pitched Walberg quip. Berg's telling of this story is about as cliché as it gets. His depiction of Afghans are of sneering and villainous head hunters, save for the few Pro-American villagers dropped into the plot to avoid the film being completely Islamophobic. If you're a yellow ribbon tying, parade loving supporter of all things military, this is the film for you. The film has all the squib exploding, RPG blasts, and gunfire flashes a pimple faced recruit needs! If you're looking for a Ramboesque romp through patriotic American eyes, this film will have you cutting your jeans off at the pockets and tying star spangled bandannas around your forehead. If you're looking for a sincere and unbiased story worthy of serious discourse on the role of American presence in Afghanistan, move along. Berg's impassioned story of the Navy Seals has all the sincerity of a very long "Call of Duty" commercial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Patrol.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Style and acting, fine. Format, familiar. Message -- I don't know.The true story of a group of SEALS inserted behind Taliban lines in Afghanistan. They are discovered and try to abort the mission but are ambushed by Taliban forces that outnumber them. One by one, they die until only the character played by Mark Wahlberg reaches a Pashtun village. The safety is only temporary. The Taliban soon arrive, demanding the American soldier but are forced off by the villagers. When the Taliban return in force, they are driven off by the arrival of helicopters bearing American troops, and Wahlberg is recovered.It's a brutal tale. The men suffer multiple wounds before dying and there is blood all over. When these guys jump from a cliff to escape their pursuers, it really HURTS when they hit the ground and roll the rest of the way to the bottom.None of the performers stands out much because it's an ensemble movie, and, really, not much acting is called for.At heart, it's a familiar story, like Custer's last stand or John Ford's "Lost Patrol" or "Bataan," except for Wahlberg's titular survivor. It's never been done better but it IS a familiar narrative.I don't know about the message behind the movie. Of course the invasion of Afghnistan was more or less necessary and the heroism of the real SEAL team can in no way be criticized. Yet, the movie condescends to the viewer in a way that, say, "Saving Private Ryan" or "Blackhawk Down" did not. The movie tells us over and over, and has the characters voice it, that these men are heroes. But that's something we already know. The message of the movie is turned from "These men are brave" into "The audience is pretty dumb." The direction is okay except for the now-trite slow motion deaths and falling bodies. But I don't know just how stupid the director thinks the audience is. After one cliff jump, a character finds that he's landed next to a sizable rattlesnake -- in Afghanistan. Just an added and unnecessary thrill.A few incidents ring truer than that. The mistake of calling off support from the gun ships, for instance. I can certainly believe THAT happened. The last-minute rescue by the cavalry, no -- not the way it's presented anyway.It's well worth watching despite the fact that it's regressive and resembles a flag waver from World War II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good God, this was a terrible movie, and I can't quite understand how people like Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg let themselves get caught up in such a piece of propagandistic hogwash. Marcus Luttrelle is hardly an uncomplicated figure?his numerous right-wing comments in interviews since his book came out, for instance, make clear the extent to which he's the typical brainwashed 'Murrican soldier?and there's absolutely nothing here to raise this film above the thoughtless, hoo-rah level of a period John Wayne flick (with much more fake blood). Numerous slow periods are punctuated by gruesome violence. Is this supposed to teach us something? Like "war is hell" or some other profound thought? Only a person with a heart of stone could fail to burst into laughter at the scene in which Marcus?near death and barely able to walk?stops to embrace a small Afghani child before climbing onto the helicopter that is going to carry him to safety (where he immediately codes and has to be shocked back to life). That level of flagrant, unsubtle pandering is exactly what makes this film a waste of everyone's time. This is a film for people who have drunk the Kool-Aid; if you retain the capacity for critical thought, you'll find it a bloody bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>things i learned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few things I learned from this flaming pile of garbage 1) the u.s. military would rather send a team of 4 seals on a suicide mission to kill 1 Taliban "leader" than call in a drone strike, or helicopter strike, or jdam strike, or ac-130 strike, etc.2) the military will give said team full air support with 2 apaches, and an ac-130 spooky gunship while they are hiking in the middle of nowhere, but as soon as they get to the most dangerous part of the mission will leave them on their own for no apparent reason. only to be called back later when all but one is dead.3) one 5.56 round will kill a Taliban fighter instantly, but 4 (or more) 7.62 rounds from an AK or PKP wont kill a navy seal.4) you can apparently sprain you foot, then get shot in the other foot and still be able to run around just fine.5) you can tumble 100 feet down a mountain slamming into boulders and trees TWICE and be able run around and continue fighting 6) sat radios will work just fine halfway down a valley amongst many tall trees but will stop working on top of the mountain in a clearing with no apparent reason.7) navy seals don't wear body armor 8) an RPG hitting 3 feet from you wont kill you 9) same RPG can change course mid flight and fly right into the back door of a Chinook helo from 150 feet away and rip it in half.10) afghans apparently have an honor code that forces them to protect COMPLETE STRANGERS from "outside dangers" even if it means giving their life for said stranger. YET for some reason cant be compelled to take up arms and defend their own country from terrorists.11) (and the most aggregous of them all) Trained navy seals would rather let Taliban fighters go and scrub the entire mission, knowing they would be found and killed in about an hour. as opposed to tie them up, finish the mission, and then let them go later.If this is at all how it went down, then I just lost all respect for navy seals. if this isn't how it actually happened, then the writer and director need to be black balled and never work again for portraying DEAD navy seals as complete morons.I'm sure there's more, but that just about summarizes it. could have been a decent movie, but it was so over the top, inaccurate, unbelievable that made it borderline unwatchable. if I had paid money to see this in a theater I would have walked out after the first mountain fall scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than Rambo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had got good reviews, so I sat down with my evening meal to enjoy. Half an hour in and I was beginning to wonder. One hour in and I was thinking, this is going nowhere, it's a five out of ten, and I think I will register my vote. Super American heroes under overwhelming fire power are retreating. They fall down a couple of cliffs, bouncing off granite rocks, their bodies bent 90° as they hit trees. Still they get up, and the bullet tally mounts. All four seem to have taken a dozen or more body shots. And still they go on.By this time I'm thinking how bad can this get, it's a 3 out of 10 now. Amazingly three of the four fugitives finally succumb to all they have been through - at last, though totally improbable that they lasted this long. The remaining hero with all his wounds pushes a broken patella back into his knee (2 out of 10 now) and then takes refuge in a village where the locals take him in. An extremely unlikely situation!Here is where it gets worse than Rambo. Our hero takes a knife and performs delicate operations on his leg, removing bits of tree, bullet or bone - whilst wincing and biting on some cloth in his teeth. Who cares by this stage - we know he can't die!I easily guessed what was going to happen next - the American helicopter calvary swings into view, strafing everyone in the village (apart from the 'goodies') and rescuing our remaining hero. 1 out of 10. Why are people still making films like this? Great sets, acting and camera work, but a film story that beggars belief! The previous evening I had sat down and watching an intensely exciting movie - one actor, two bits of dialogue, but a thoroughly gripping hour and forty minutes - 'All is Lost' - but that's another (far better) story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie caught me by surprise. It was a great watch with action and drama. I did however have several issues with it. For me to really love and get into a movie, I need to know and love or hate the characters. In this movie I found that I couldn't tell some apart, even at the end. Another issue, was the visual effects only by way of the filming location. This movie, set to take place in J-Bad, was way too obviously filmed in the US or Canada, or so I thought. At the end of the movie I had to look up filming location because it was not real enough for me. I don't want to spoil anything so watch and make your own decision, and check out the filming location if you feel it seems strange.

		<fullReview>When you see a movie that depicts any kind of war conflict it usually borders on propaganda or something similar. It's inevitable. Having said that, I really enjoyed this movie as it seems and was more real than many others that I have watched! You can say whatever you like for the training and tactics of the Marines and you can agree or not, or find this really unnecessary and violent or whatever. But what's true is that what you see is what actually happens in the real world. And being inspired from a true story, makes this movie really really worthwhile. The fact that these four guys are left against all these enemies and the way in which the fight for their lives is truly remarkable and well depicted! It's not your usual thing where the lead man always dodges bullets and gets out of a gun fight without a scratch. As far as war movies are concerned, it's a 7.5 for me, closer to 8 than to 7... If you like this kind of movies, you will definitely love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor (2013) is an amazingly crafted film showing many values within war that are rarely displayed. Typically war films tend to leave out that they're good and bad people on both sides of the war-zones, not everyone within such a situation are bad or good, there is good and bad in everything. Lone Survivor (2013) shows a story of bravery, and at the same time shows great values within human beings that may be shown from all people of all nationalities. I'm not a big war film buff as I truly disagree with many actions that are forced to take place in times like that as I love people no matter where they are from or what they believe in; this movie is well put together and I really liked it a lot. Great acting, great script, and I believe what the film is dedicated for is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a spoiler to say that a 'navy seals' film will show them training, in the opening credits (as per usual)?What about that.... we are forced to then listen to utterly ridiculous conversations? ... and then an utterly ridiculous first meeting with the new guy?The scenes that play out have no connection to the tough guy opening credits... the mandatory training scenes instead lead us to a bunch of guys acting like as if they are in a drama class..... think of something to talk about, and then run with it.While you may not throw up into the bucket that you've sensibly put beside you.... it comes close.I watched this with my 17 year old son, and we were groaning from the start, and groaned even more when we got to the obligatory argument.Can it be the case, that this is representative of the navy seals? I truly hope not.Who calls the shots on these movies? Was the Director Peter Berg, just a 'yes' man, or was it his own non-creative talent, that caused him to regurgitate what we've all seen before.The last Afghan war movie I watched was Kajaki (based upon a true story) - different, engrossing, and believable.Lone Survivor is meant also to be based upon a true story, with all the ingredients for a great film.What a shame that the audience is completely turned off in the first half hour.If you want to watch this movie, my strong advice would be to give it its best chance, and avoid completely the first 30 minutes.Otherwise, just give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an underrated war film by Peter Berg which deserves much more credit. It contains well-done battle sequences and it keeps the viewer hoping for a happy ending even though the outcome is already known.4 Navy SEALs on a mission to find a high-level Taliban operative find themselves in a desperate gun battle with enemy forces in the Hindu Kush region.Like Black Hawk Down, this is a movie which puts you in the middle of combat and it immerses you well. It isn't as claustrophobic and tense as Black Hawk Down was but it still does a great job in immersing you. The make-up work is bloody realistic and it shows you how all 4 men slowly become weaker and weaker as the battles they face continue on and on. Black Hawk Down didn't have this feature but I still think that it was more tense. I'll explain why I think that later in this review.Mark Wahlberg did a great job acting. His performance isn't too impressive at first but after the movie starts to pick up, he gives it all he has and he does an exceptional job in the second half. All of the other actors give great performances as well but Wahlberg is the one who stands out the most considering that he's the main star of the movie.I mentioned earlier that this movie has a lot of tension (which is does). However, perhaps "Lone Survivor" wasn't exactly the best title they could have come up with. After the other 3 men die, I felt that the movie lost some of its suspense because I knew that Wahlberg wouldn't die and I felt more calm in the battle scenes which came after it. I know that some people already knew the ending since this was based on a true story but I wasn't familiar with the main story and I would've felt more tension if there was a different title.Even though this movie loses some of its tension near the end, I still think that this is an underrated war movie and it deserves a lot more praise. Some people have argued that it has intensity not seen in a Hollywood war movie ever since Black Hawk Down. I kind of agree with this statement. However, this movie still has well-executed battle scenes which are definitely worthy of a viewing. In my opinion, this is one of the best war movies of the past 15 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a harsh movie, but you already know that with the introduction, taken from some kind of breaking boot camp for seals.This is based on real events, that makes it personal in a way and very vivid. Three acts is what this movie holds, and director Peter Berg makes sure we know the characters and their lives before heading them into the second act, this is where hell breaks loose, lots of action, bullets, explosions etc. going on there. The third act ends it of, it does however not show every Afghan as a Taliban terrorist, very refreshing and a different ending then what you mind expect. But it also gets a bit to stars and stripes for me, maybe thats the liberal European in me talking... never mind that.The Scenes seem very real, great action, great explosions and great scenery to keep it all together. This is entertaining and you should see it if you like war scenes with all that that entails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trademark Wahlberg Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year , while watching "Shooter" on HBO , I realized something quite remarkable about Mark Wahlberg and the movies he stars in- they have a uncanny knack of bearing a striking resemblance to the uni-dimension unapologetic action movies of the 1990's or in short very entertaining. "Lone Survivor" exhibits all the symptoms which make it a typical Wahlberg fare. To begin with the storyline is quite simple, linear and straightforward. The screenplay is trite and cleanly composed. There is no sub planar text here, nor any sub planar political undertones. It is in all aspects a very conventional war movie with clearly demarcated "good guy" bad guy" "patriot" " enemy" themes. In this respect it is unlike most contemporary cinema. Much like "Shooter" the movie doesn't beat around the bush a lot no inordinate delays blot the plot. There is a conspicuous absence of subtlety and each character wear his emotions on the sleeve, which would have have been run of the mill in the 90's or 80's but seems refreshingly nostalgic in the emotionally devoid action flicks of the first decade of the new millennium .Moving on, the action scenes are downright impressive. The camera-work is superb and the sound effects impeccable. The cinematography and action choreography are totally in sync . The scenes do not look dragged out or repetitive, partly due to the plot progression and partly due to the smart usage of the shooting locations by the director.The cast too does well playing out their respective roles to the best of their abilities. Their task is made easier by the predominance of combat scenes where finesse is not required and also the melodramatic tone of the movie. There are times when you feel that that movie is duplicating scenes from older movies in the genre with stereotypical themes and ricocheted scenes appearing , but they don't hurt the overall experience. I am giving the movie 7 , but this is the kind of 7 which signifies a decent , entertaining Mark Wahlberg Action Thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame, completely forgettable war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to re-hash everything some of the one-star rating reviewers have already said, but this film was a huge disappointment. I will throw a bit out there, though; Totally lame hero dialog that never once strayed from the "Chuck Norris" formula, characters I never cared about for a moment (we're supposed to care that one of the guy's fiancé wants an expensive horse as a present??), enemy soldiers who just run up one and after another like complete dopes and get shot, US soldiers who somehow fall off cliffs at least three times and land on back- breaking rocks and get up and still run around, the sappy doe-eyed little boy and the "hero" local who saved him, and the list goes on and on. The only time I was interested was in the first couple of minutes when they were showing how tough SEAL training was- now that would have made an interesting movie. Now don't get me wrong here- I absolutely love war movies; 2 or 3 are in my all-time top 10. My message is simply this for people who have grown up during our current conflicts. If you think this is a great war, fine, but I hope you have taken the time to see the real greats; Platoon, Apocalypse Now (original), The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, and The Band of Brothers. Sometimes I get the feeling that today's younger movie goers never bothered to watch older movies, when they fawn over a dreadful film such as this one. Hell, even a western like The Good, the Bad and The Ugly had more memorable things to say about warfare than Lone Survivor did. Now I get this is based on a true story and that these guys were heroes and brave and gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country, but that doesn't make the film great. I do hope that someday, maybe when our current wars are long over with, a worthy film is made about the Afgahn and Iraq conflicts. Sorry, but Sniper and Survivor ain't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words can't describe how I feel about this movie. I had goosebumps from the start to finish. The symmetry between the Director and the actors was powerful and it showed on the screen. Once they started with navy Seals training to the sprint between Dietz and Murphy I knew this was going to blow my mind. I love war movies, Platoon,Thin Red Line were at the top of my list with Private Ryan but this one has replaced them for me anyway. I thought all four of the leads were exceptional with Kitsch and Foster being my personal favorites in this film. Wahlberg at times can be hit or miss but I thought this was one of his best performances. The Score was spine tingling, I loved the "Waking up" musical score that is spread throughout the film and Peter Gabriel's Heroes with the real Navy Seals faces was a terrific way to end it. One of my favorite films of this decade and I also loved the extras and the real families. Peter Berg you blew me away</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor 8/10- I did not know what to think coming into this movie. I have seen so many disappointing war movies I have lost count. Lone Survivor though, was a truly great war film that is probably the best war movie of the past ten years. Now, I have no clue if these kind of films are realistic or not since I have never been in any situation remotely like the ones in this movie, but people I know who have been say that this movie is one of the only realistic war movies they have ever seen. That itself is something very rare. For those of you that do not know the plot to the movie, Lone Survivor tells the story of four NAVY SEALS who are tasked to go a mission to neutralize a high-level Taliban operative and are forced to fight for their lives when the mission goes wrong. It starts out with footage of NAVY SEALS training and it is amazing to believe all of the stuff they have to do to become biggest badasses in the world. I could not imagine how mentally and physically tough a person could be to go through all of that and all of these actors in Lone Survivor were able to portray these roles very well. Mark Wahlberg, who plays Marcus Luttrell, gave his usual amazing tough guy performance and gives this movie exactly the right character portrayal that it needs. Taylor Kitsch, who plays the leader of the mission Mike Murphy, gave probably the best performance of his career and I am very glad that he is finally is in a successful film. Emile Hirsch, who plays Danny Dietz, gives a good enough performance to make his character memorable enough. Without a doubt, the best performance of the movie was surprisingly by Ben Foster, who play Matt Axelson. He gave his character more life than any of the others. The acting though is not the thing that the audience remembers when they leave the theater.The action scenes are amazingly crafted and are the best I have ever seen. It just seems impossible how well the director was able to make it look like the NAVY SEALS got shot or fell through the forest like rag dolls. I do know who was the head of that department, but that guy deserves an Oscar. One thing that I also like about this movie is it doesn't just show the Middle Eastern people as the bad guys, Lone Survivor shows how a lot of the people are and how they feel about the Taliban. It really showed me a new light about the Gulf War and how it happened. What I personally loved about this movie, is the message that it leaves you with. It inspires you to go farther than you can possibly imagine and to never give up. It plants the idea in the audiences minds that if these NAVY SEALS can go through all of this stuff and not complain, I have a pretty good life and have very little to complain about. This movie could be a little too much for some people as it is pretty gory in some scenes, but for those who can handle it, you will love this movie and feel incredibly inspired as you walk out.

		<shortDescription>Not without flaws but still a brilliantly intense war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of a small group of Navy Seals on a mission to kill a Taliban leader that goes wrong. They are left to fend for themselves in a hostile environment against massive odds. It's a brutal, relentless but exhilarating tale which is brilliantly filmed from start to finish. It does have a few flaws, the Americans seem able to withstand many shots and rock collisions whilst the Taliban go down with every shot. Even given the fact the Americans are highly trained and skilled whilst the Taliban presumably are not, this does grate a little. However the action scenes are so intense and incredibly well done that I am able to forgive this. The acting is superb and realistic from the whole cast especially Mark Wahlberg and Ali Suliman. It is nice to see a war film with a different angle, one that shows that war isn't always black and white and things aren't always what you believe them to be. Lone Survivor for me is one of the best modern war films combining a great story, great action scenes and great drama. An absolute treat to watch. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly depicted horror of modern warfare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wahlberg is a pretty good bet for superior acting and this film doesn't disappoint. He plays the titular lone survivor, no spoiler alert there, and lived to tell the tale and write the book about his horrific experience in the field. Whilst an American production, it wasn't as flag-wavingly red white and blue as I expected and whilst that's always good, we do expect a little understandable bias but I liked how the film pushed hard the fact that not ALL people from that part of the world are bad. The Gulab villagers were incredibly brave and true to their beliefs of hospitality and obviously Marcus Luttrell owes his life to the father and son, who risked their lives for him.The premise of the film obviously told you the ending, which does diminish some of the anxiety and stress of the action, but there is still a lot of horrific scenes of war and conflict. The action was generally graphic, realistic and powerful but a few bits were too "staged" but knowing that it was a true story overrode any of the minute flaws in the production of the film. Photography and editing were good - the camera always in amongst the action and low level, almost like hand held and therefore emotion watching the film ran high as the viewer was in the centre of what was happening. Certainly not a film for those viewers who don't like blood and gore, but realistic SFX of combat. With my limited knowledge the procedural aspects of the film seemed good (Luttrell was involved in production) and I noted his documentation of the concept that the Generals in war were able to stand back and send their men into untenable situations like pawns on a chess board and they are safe back in the bases behind the lines was commentary on the unfairness of combat on the ground. All the actors in the squad were good at their individual personalities and characters and overall the film was engaging and exciting, if a little emotional. Whilst not necessarily the sort of film you could watch over and over, it is certainly one that would stand repeat viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is an excellent movie. It is based on a true story, which will make you appreciate the plot more. The pain and terror that these Seals went thru will have your heart pounding. If you have seen Black Hawk Down and consider it one of your favorites, then Lone Survivor will be a new favorite. The movie begins slow at a military base in Afghanistan and shows the military lifestyle of the Seals. They show clips of the camaraderie and hazing that takes place as well as the relationship with their family in the states. This engages the audience and makes the characters human. Once the action begins with that first shot fired, hold on because it just keeps going from there. The main character played by Mark Wahlberg was a great casting choice. I read the book before the movie came out and when I found out Wahlberg was in the movie as the lone survivor himself, I was excited. He embodied the character that my mind created while reading the book. I recommend this movie to any movie goer that is up for some edge of your seat action. It was intensely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb film that leaves a lasting impression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor tells the true story of Marcus Luttrell and his team of Navy Seals who are sent to Afghanistan in order to capture notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Marcus and his team have orchestrated a carefully co-ordinated plan to capture Shah, but the Taliban manage to find Marcus and his team before they can fully co-ordinate their effort. The situation is exacerbated for the Navy SEALS due to a breakdown in their communications systems meaning that Marcus and his team are forced to fight the Taliban against impossible odds whilst also being isolated from their airbase.This film is impressive in many ways and the first thing I liked about this film is its no nonsense approach - we don't have a long drawn out introduction before the SEALS are drawn into battle. There's a short section showing their training and there are a few early snippets of some of the SEALS contacting their loved ones in order to establish an emotive core. I do feel the writers used their time wisely in this film and did enough to cover all the bases without appearing to ramble.A good example of this is the scene between Murphy and Luttrell where they're discussing Murphy's wedding plans and Murphy's wife wanting him to buy her horse. These exchanges are amusing, but on the surface they seem irrelevant. Even though these exchanges seem pointless, it's actually a good piece of writing because it not only shows the bond and friendship that exists between the men, but it also gives us a reason to care for the characters. Although they risk their lives every day, they show that they have so much to live for. I thought that this was an excellent way to establish an emotive core.Another strength with this film lies with the acting; Wahlberg has been disappointing in a few films recently, but in this film he really impresses. Whether he was sharing jokes with his platoon or in the midst of battle he was solid all the way through and this is probably the best performance I've seen from him in a long time. The rest of the cast are OK, but Wahlberg is the one that really shines. Lone Survivor is also fast paced and rarely allows you to pause for breath, the action sequences are exciting (although inevitably there are a few OTT Hollywood moments, but that's only a very minor criticism). I honestly can't think of a single moment that felt like it was wasted in this film.Probably one of the biggest strengths with this film is the way that Berg &amp; Luttrell make a clear point of showing that not everyone in Afghanistan was a member of the Taliban - the peaceful tribe known as Pashtunwali actually helped to protect Luttrell from the Taliban. It's clear that Berg &amp; Luttrell weren't creating a piece of propaganda, but merely providing the audience with a balanced account of the events that took place. This was a virtually flawless film that I won't forget about in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor (2013) is a film I had avoided for some time. I am a fan of war films, always have been ever since my dad would get me to watch war and westerns with him as a kid. I steered away from this film for so long through not wanting to sit through another American propaganda film aimed at showing how valiantly they fight the good fight. But I decided to suck it up and watch it and I have to say, it was not what I was expecting. The film follows the true story of four Navy SEALS on a recon mission in Afghanistan. They are locating their target and assessing the strength of enemy troops before the main contingent of American lads arrive. After running into some Afgans they have a decision to make, kill them and carry on or let them live but run the risk that they will alert the Taliban. I think we all know which option they chose. This is a film about, as the title suggests, survival. We see these four soldiers get shot, punched, cut, hurt by explosions but the thing which will always stand out for me is the cliffs. These men want to survive so badly that they throw themselves off cliffs numerous times when they find their backs up against it. We see them bouncing down the cliff face, smacking their heads on rocks, crashing through trees and being thrown around like ragdolls. These scenes were truly tense; gripping the side of my sofa I watched and hoped that these men would still be alive when they reach the bottom. As if that wasn't bad enough, they are getting shot regularly from the first encounter, and throughout the film we see them get progressively injured.Every time we see one of the soldiers take a bullet we are reminded that this is a true story, actual soldiers went through what we are seeing on the screen. The realism in this film is something not often seen in an American war film. These are elite soldiers, yet even they have weaknesses, they are not bulletproof and are human just the same as you and I. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, the lone survivor. He pays this character very well in my opinion; he brings none of his cocky acting style to this role. Instead he swaps it for someone who never says they're dying, but doesn't say they will live either. You could say he is a positive realist. What sets this film apart from most American war films is the stance it takes on the morality on how Afgans should be seen. Many war films will show them all as evil, unable to aim and wanting to kill every white man they meet. This film however shows us a side to these people not often explored; the loyal, compassionate and honour-bound side. We see that not all Afgans are Taliban, not everyone in the country wants to kill the west, but in fact some want to help, some hate the Taliban as much as the west and want nothing more than to see them fail. This is something any logical person knows before watching this film, but it is great to actually see this portrayed on the big screen. So, all in all I was impressed with the films realism and different view on the natives. All of the actors did a good job, nobody stuck out as being bad, but similarly nobody shone for me. But if you like your war films then I would say give this a try, you might like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We do what we do. What we have to do".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the revelation just this past week of the identity of the Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden (his name is Robert Oneil), it was also made known that the same individual took part in the boarding of the Maersk Alabama in the rescue of Captain Phillips, and was part of the extraction team that pulled Marcus Luttrell out of Afghanistan. That's what prompted me to pick up a copy of "Lone Survivor" right away, although it would have remained on my radar anyway. I guess time will tell if Oneil's actual involvement in all three missions is true or not. In the meantime, the courage and honor that's required to serve our country's Armed Forces has never been as dramatically portrayed as the story of the "Lone Survivor".It's been stated by many on the review pages for this film, and I have to second that - this is not an easy movie to watch. Once the four man force becomes the target of enemy Taliban in the rocky outcrops of Afghanistan, the action is relentless and unimaginable. Obviously well choreographed and staged for dramatic effect, as viewers we come to understand that SEAL training is only a warm-up for the hardships that come with assignment to a live mission. The undeniable valor of the men depicted in the story resonates with the pride they have in serving their country to their dying breath. These men live and die for the challenge, with fierce determination and a pride expressed in Matt Axelson's unyielding declaration - "You can die for your country. I'm going to live for mine."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film and got excited, knowing finally that there would be a film adaptation for the true story of Operation Red Wings. When I saw that Peter Berg was directing this movie, I had mixed emotions. His directing was great in The Kingdom and Friday Night Lights, but Battleship was a train wreck of a movie. I had read the book of the same name and liked it, and I was really hoping that the movie would be good. It exceeded my expectations. From the start I could tell that it wouldn't be 100% true to the real story, but I don't want to spoil anything more than what the title tells us. There is a somewhat cheesy portrayal of the daily life of the SEALs, but it works. Soon the mission is explained and the four men that the film follows are deployed in Afghanistan on a mission to neutralize an important Taliban leader. Of course things go wrong, and the four men are faced with tough moral and consequential decisions. This is where we start to see the actors in their characters. Mark Wahlberg plays the medic Marcus Luttrell, and he plays this role well. This is easily one of his best performances. Taylor Kitsch plays the team leader Michael P. "Mikey" Murphy. His acting job is not superb but it is good and believable. Ben Foster plays sniper Matthew G. "Axe" Axelson. He stole the show as Charlie Prince in 3:10 To Yuma. He is stern and does a brilliant job as Axelson. Emile Hirsch plays communications expert Danny Dietz. He is good in this role, and although he probably had the least screen time of the four, he is up to par with the rest. They find themselves surrounded by a large number of Taliban fighters. (Estimates vary the force from 10-200.) Any number in that range, these four SEALs are heavily outnumbered. This is where the action begins, and it is gripping. The editing in this 35 minute fight is amazing, every gunshot and explosion is made to be realistic. The fight is very brutal and intense and the audience can feel the sensation of being pinned down by gunfire. When the fight comes to its climax and the bullets start hitting their marks, the film gets emotional. The score, editing, and acting fit well together to make this film an emotional powerhouse. Later we meet Afghan villagers who are "good guys". This element is both true to history and good for the film, showing the viewers that turbans don't always make Taliban. At the end there is a very emotional tribute to the fallen. Overall this film did well to tell us a true story of courage and hit us hard emotionally. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in Houston Texas, and around here an institution of sorts is furniture store magnate "Mattress Mac", known for his philanthropy and his very annoying "save you money" TV commercials. In recent TV commercials we sometimes also see a burly young man standing with him, that young man is Marcus Luttrell. I only mention this to make a connection, because this movie 'Lone Survivor' is about Marcus Luttrell and his experience in Afghanistan as a member of a Navy Seal team sent into a hostile area to eliminate a top Taliban commander. That he survived to write his book and now see this movie come to reality is a testament to his toughness.Unfortunately the others did not survive. This is not an easy movie to watch, the fighting is very realistic and the deaths often very gruesome. I never liked Peter Berg as an actor, and I do not like all his directorial efforts, but I have to give credit here, he went all out to make it realistic. That can be either good or bad depending on one's tolerance for violence and gore.The mission was jeopardized when a group of two men and a boy, herding goats, came upon the Seal Team on a mountain slope overlooking the village where the target was. The men were faced with a critical decision, kill the innocent three to avoid spoiling the mission, or let them go and surely spoil the mission. It wasn't easy and it wasn't unanimous, but they did let them go, they did abort the mission, they tried to get rescue but had radio problems. In the end Marcus Luttrell was saved only because he came upon men in another village that had an honor code of sorts, to protect someone in need of medical attention. A chapter in a long war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film represents a rerun of the same old who cares military rah-rah movie. Rather like a fraternity hell-week, look how special we are group. This squad of Seals has now been done too much and it's tragic to see the same old thing again and again. A major problem is - the actors are well-known and they are for the most part well into their 40's. MUCH too old to be doing this sort of thing any more. This group of actors is NOT believable. These guys are too old, and would simply know better than to participate in this kind of mindless-robotic conduct. The actors do not fit the roles. Even their hair cuts are unrealistically long. I have never seen a navy seal without a high and tight crew cut. These guys are 'long-hairs'. It's also VERY difficult to watch this kind of military action and not feel like what a total and complete waste of time all of this is/was. What are we doing over there? Why are our country's soldiers being sent to a conflict that has zero national interest? All this does is cement the viewer into the position that George 'Dub-Ya' Bush was the absolute WORST president of my lifetime, and what a terrible, horrific, useless waste of resources in human life, and in money for a task that we had absolutely no business being involved. What in the world are we doing over there? To what end? And to who's benefit? Difficult to sit thru the movie. Just make it a video game and be done with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Berg got around to realizing a project he's been working on for the last 5 years and for which he now probably had enough time coz after 'Battleship' nobody wanted to hire him anymore one would think. It's well known I guess that Berg is somewhat of a right wing warmonger so this film was right up his alley. Wahlberg and his team of marines are sent out to capture/kill a Bin-laden-like towelhead called Ahmad Shah. They get discovered by a bunch of old geezers with kids and decide not to waste them but to let them go so they can haul-ass back to their Al Qaida buddies who come after our heroes in full force. This gesture of 'christian life sparing' leads to a towelhead shooting gallery where many (brown) lives are wasted. The firefights are pretty well done with very good surround effects as you hear the bullets whizzing past your ears. But there are several scenes which are incredibly (but unintentional) comical. At a certain point they get blown of a hill by an explosion which causes them to fall for 5 minutes very much like the scene from the simpsons where homer keeps hitting rocks on his way down. Later in the film Wahlberg asks for a knife and receives a duck (I'm serious). Don't go looking for insight into the horrors of war with this film. It's all rather superficial and preachy. Also Wahlberg sometimes sounds a bit like a whiny bitch with his high pitched voice when he keeps whaling 'why did you save me?'. It's all supposed to be a patriotic ode to a brotherhood of men defending their country, thumping their chest and letting the Afghan citizens do their part. Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? Apparently it does for most Americans as it did quite well at the box-office. So (my) conclusion: good entertainment for the red blooded action loving patriot who doesn't want to know why we fight but just want's to know where to shoot and to be a brother amongst men.

		<shortDescription>Another case of bad equipment and military planning and leadership</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After capturing three un-armed Afghans who could blow their cover on a mission to kill a Taliban leader, the unit's leader says they had 3 options: 1) kill the hostages 2) tie them up -- in which case they would most likely be eaten by wolves, or 3) let them go.They chose option 3, and soon were pursued and trapped by an overwhelming force of Taliban/insurgent fighters.There was a 4th option -- realizing their communications equipment was unreliable, and aborting the mission, they could have taken the hostages out with them to a point far enough away that by the time the Afghans made it back to warn the Taliban, our team could have been escaped or been extracted. What it boils down to, is an incredibly bad decision on the part of the military command to send four men on a dangerous mission into a region where their communications equipment might be unreliable, and a total lack of coordination between extraction teams;choppers etc.Marcus Luttrel and his three dead buddies were the victims of P__s poor military equipment, planning and leadership.No wonder we're losing this war!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good vs. Evil - is it so simple?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not about heroes, it is about propaganda. It is like some bad old Western movie, where the Indians are just evil scum, who should be shot at every possible occasion, and where all the cowboys are automatically good.Face it: if you go fighting in a foreign country, you have a good chance to die. Does not really matter much if you train a lot, have good weapons and such. You can just get shot like a dog, like it happened in case of thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. USA keeps making wars since the end of World War II, and as such, portraying the "heroes" fighting in Afghanistan is just stupid and hypocritical. They do not defend their own country,they went to play GI Joe to another culture's homeland - and it has consequences.Although there are evil people in every country, this movie shows it like all the Americans are just friggin' awesome dancing around, training like hell, having fun team events, and generally being "cool", while all those bad-bad-stupid Arabic fighters should just die - as they hinder the Big Mission. We do not really understand from the movie what is the purpose of Big Mission - but who cares? They are fighters, aces, marines, and hell, they need some success!!! The brown guys must be bad, because they dare to fight back against the good marines. Well.. imagine if the USA would be attacked some day - would they also fight back? Are the local fighters automatically just evil for defending their own territories? The answer of this movie is: HELL YES!!! So they must die.They show a little boy (as possibly the only good Arabic guy?), and a lot of other evil brown-skinned fighters. There is a lot of fighting, and if an USA marine gets wounded - they show how everyone is doing everything to save his life. The movie does not care much about the brown-skinned ones, they can just get shot and die. This movie is empty propaganda, and such deserves no stars, but there is no 0 point possible, so I give 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor: Yet Another Over-exaggeration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Muhammad Mustafa Mustaan was born in Afghanistan and witnessed first- hand the US invasion of the countryThe film "Lone Survivor" topped the box office after screening in cinemas. It had to do well as the storyline was based around four brave, invincible US Navy Seals facing in the Afghan war. After a compassionate decision of letting unarmed shepherds go free, they were caught in a firefight where US navy seals fought hundreds of Afghan Taliban fighters until the very last bullet. All of the navy seals perished except one 'lone survivor' who was offered protection after the rescue helicopter was shot down. The story did not end there as the lone survivor was protected by the people of a village, though he was still ready to fight with the only grenade left with him. Afterwards, the American army sent hundreds of soldiers, right in the middle of a firefight amongst hundreds of Taliban fighters and the few villagers who are trying to protect him.The truth however is very different.The true depiction of events is that a US Chinook helicopter was shot down in Eastern Afghanistan while it was transporting a number of Navy Seals to the area. One soldier survived the crash with severe injuries, who then managed to seek protection from an Afghan villager nearby. There was no firefight between the villagers and the Taliban, and the US did not dare to send any helicopter again and only sent a military convoy to the region two days later.One needs to consider the following:1. In Afghan-Pashtun culture, anyone who seeks 'Nanawatae' (protection) by entering any house, carrying no arms and as a true-seeker of help (the person must be in extreme need of help for his life) is protected by the family members as well as the people of the village. This applies even to enemy combatants.2. In 2005 the Afghans were unaware of the reality and nature of the US armed forces, and hence were quite susceptible to provide protection to any soldier, especially if he was seriously injured.3. The Taliban reorganized in 2003, however their numbers in individual units was only in the 10's and in rare cases up to 20. This continued well beyond 2005 and the numbers of the units only increased after thousands of Afghans joined the Taliban for the revenge of their family members who were killed by indiscriminate American air bombings and drone attacks. Until today the Taliban do not walk together in groups of more than 20 due to the fact that they can easily become targets of US signature strikes.This movie is another desperate act by the US to show it won the war and that the sacrifices were needed. This movie is another example of an incident which is completely misrepresented. It serves as an opportunistic tool to legitimize the unjustifiable war in the eyes of the general public. It is similar to the film 'The Hurt Locker,' which was based on an overly exaggerated account of those soldiers who were part of failed missions, including missions such as Blackhawk Down, where hundreds of American soldiers were killed in Mogadishu and in addition to two of their helicopters shot down and tens of their armored vehicles were destroyed.While this movie and more of its types will sell well in the US and the Western world, in order to justify its inhumane war, it will not change the reality of the war in which the US is bleeding to death and the anger and outrage it continues to evoke in the Muslim world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hard hitting war drama that shows the true nature of brotherhood and friendship that is built and destroyed during war. At the same casting a light onto the pain of losing friends and brothers. A well shot film that casts the beautiful Afghanistan scenery alongside true events from Operation Red Wing. The use of real footage from the gruelling training of the elite Navy Seals at the start of the film instantly shows how the film establishes the theme of brotherhood. Individual acting is limited to moaning about injuries, harsh barking of orders and some jovial banter between comrades but the bond between the soldiers is clearly demonstrated inthis film which is the ultimate aim of the film, to retell the story of the brave men who died during that fateful operation. A touching slideshow of photos of the soldiers who died in the operation to finish the film is a perfect ending to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Restores Faith in Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently caught a viewing of this on FX, although I'd already seen it and in fact own it. I stayed on the channel simply to see what it would be like to watch this film on a normal station, with commercials in between, censorship of violence and, more importantly, censorship for language. This is not a film to watch in this fashion. Director: Peter Berg Writers: Marcus Luttrell(book), Patrick Robinson**Spoilers**Lone Survivor is an unforgiving, brutal war film; it is the definition of visceral. It does not compromise for a toned down and user friendly outing. It's "R" rating is well earned. However the fact that a watered down television version of this film just does not work, there is simply no denying the spellbinding quality of this vicious war film, especially given that it is a true story. At the beginning we are introduced to Marcus Luttrell and his four Navy SEAL teammates, who are prepping for their mission, "Operation Red Wings", in Afghanistan. The viewer is immediately immersed in this fascinating, isolated mission very far from home. We are then taken to a rocky mountain top as the four-man SEAL team are sent to gain reconnaissance on notorious Taliban leader, Ahmad Shaw. The mission runs smoothly, albeit with communications being off and on from the surrounding high peaks, until a sound from a bush is heard to the SEALS' horror, it is not an animal but a local goat herder and two boys. The SEALS are faced with the decision of what to do next, with so many confining problems and without sufficient comms. What comes next, I won't reveal, although it should be obvious that it does not go well. The next 35-45 minutes the audience is treated to one of the most phenomenal pieces of film ever put together, as we follow the four men as they attempt to push back and fend off 60-80 plus Taliban soldiers. We then follow them as they jump off a deep gorge in order to save themselves, with their already bleeding bodies banging and smashing again limbs, rocks, etc. The Four SEALS display an incredible professionalism as they calmly and carefully hold their own against the chaos, even as their conditions rapidly decline. We are then taken with them through another fall down the cliff, this time even more hard to watch as the men practically break their backs just to escape the enemy gunfire. One of their teammates, shot several times, begins to lose consciousness, babbling about his mother and admiring the "vivid reds" that his missing fingers are sporting...this is not just a film, it IS war. What is so exceptional about this film is that it caters well to the average movie goer(action action action) with the breathtaking scenes of war and gun fighting, yet it manages to be such an intense and emotional experience that you can't help not be moved by it, at least somewhat. During adverts for the film I was simply rolling my eyes(a bad, first judgment habit I have) and my low expectations of this made my viewing even more special, as I was incredibly drawn into this simply stellar war film. A common critique is of two natures: 1. The film has no depth and 2. It is a highly political movie. I will start off by saying that second complaint is highly untrue; this is not a political film, which is the beauty in it. It is simply a telling of a story. A true war story which real people were involved in. There is no need for political debate or arguing whether or not we should have been there etc., etc., that is a moot point. The fact is, this was something that people were involved in, were needed for the job. I have a much more immense respect for the Military and the ordinary people who decide to make that their career, upon viewing this film. The first critique is of a somewhat true nature. Yes, the film doesn't have a great amount of depth; and again that's what makes it work so well. We are shown that these are youngish and mostly engaged men who are simply living their careers and paying their bills. Every exasperated "F*** you" and "mother f**ker" is so rightfully felt, as these extraordinary young soldiers who have become involved in an extraordinary and tragic operation battle for their lives. We as an audience are taken with these men through their valiant battle to survive, and the only thing we as an audience can do is watch in awe, amazement and respect. For me, "Lone Survivor" conjures up a great mixture of feelings, the simple awe factor that something like this truly unfolded in real life, and the restoration of faith in me that film industry, with all of it's overwhelming shortcomings, can still be a powerful, driving bullet of force. No pun intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brotherhood of warriors, the Hollywood version,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed this one a lot, intense, action filled story of bravery, heroism and survival. I also immediately disregarded the book it was based on and watched it purely as Hollywood entertainment. On that note its a good war movie. The action never lets up and I enjoyed all the actors involved (Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirshe, Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana) they're believable as soldiers.The opening of this is powerful, showing our "lone survivor" battered and bloody getting some serious medical attention aboard a helicopter, his heart stops... and then the images switch to real footage of potential SEALs during Hell week, ignoring pain and pushing through at all costs. I suppose this is meant to show how our four men can later fall down a mountain (twice) get shot multiple times, break several bones and still carry on. Although it could also be a nod to Marcus who dedicates a large part of his book to explaining the training SEALS go through. I highly recommend reading his book, its excellent.The story is based on Navy Seal, Marcus Luttrell's bestseller following himself and three others on a covert mission into the Afghan Mountains to locate a Taliban leader. The mission is "cursed" from the onset, with poor communications and a run in with goat herders that sees the men ambushed, badly outnumbered and fighting for their lives before receiving help from several local villagers. Its a good movie if a bit too a bit too much ra-ra flag waving propaganda at times. I did like how we briefly got to know the back story of these guys before the sh!t hits the fan.From the cast Ben Foster stands out as he always seems to,Wahlberg does a good job as Marcus, I got Emile and Taylor confused most of the time as they looked very similar. Shout out to the make up team who did a great job here with the changing bruises, scratches, swelling shut eyes, missing fingers, bones sticking out of leg etc. It all looked very realistic. 4/13/16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has got to be one of the worst. My problem is not with the acting, but with the plot. The story line is so stupid to the point of insulting basic human intelligence.Spoiler Alert When a special op. team captured three villagers by surprise on a covert mission in mountain terrain in Afghanistan, the team leader (LT) explained to his men that they had three options. To honor the rule of engagement and not to kill a kid, they set them free which set off the whole chain of event, that led to heavy casualties of US marine.I can think of 4 or 5 other options right away, all of which are much better choices that give the team more time and safer way to retreat: 1) Tie the two adults to a tree, take the kid in retreat, and once the back up arrives, set the kid free, so he can in turn free the other two villagers. No one needs to be killed, and the team can safely retreat 2) Set free the old villager only. It'd take him much longer to get back to the village (and inform enemy combat) 3) Wait till night time to set free all three, so the team has more time to contact base and get support 4), 5), 6) ....It is also extremely odd that for this kind of special op. mission, none of the comm. equipment is functioning, which contributed to the delay of back up arrival, and more casualties. Come the fxxx on, this is the Navy SEAL we are talking about, won't they know to check their equipment before went on a mission? As I said, the plot simply doesn't make sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie disgusted me, as did "American Sniper" - asking 'permission' to take the shot!?!?WHY!?!? Why do American servicemen have to abide by, and, risk their lives for, civilian pipe-dream liberal-created 'Rules of War,' while enemies can do anything they choose?Although STG2 Axelson was incapacitated and out of action, those Taliban dirtbags "MURDERED" him.Likely, they did the same with GM2 Deitz...helpless and dying, they "MURDERED" him instead of helping and taking him as a prisoner, like 'normal' people do.Michael Murphy made a judgment call that went along with the "AMERICAN" rules of war, which was the correct thing to do...but, by doing this, he compromised himself and his men. Axelson and Dietz were right - they should have killed those Taliban creeps on the spot and succeeded in their mission.American rules of war are SNAFU, and, rules of engagement are just as bad (even for cops)- "The bad guy has to shoot first!" BS! The US is losing good people, "AMERICAN" people, because of this 'treat a scumbag like a human' mentality. An enemy has to be fought on 'their' terms, not on ours.If this was a Russian operation and these four guys were Spetsnaz...they'd have wasted those treacherous insect farmers with extreme prejudice and succeeded in their operation. BUT..."NO!" Americans have to follow rules that no one else has to and this places American servicemen,and, America, in jeopardy.Marcus Luttrell and his guys didn't deserve any of this. It was the BS rules of the American government who ruined the lives of these men...and, their families. To me - "ONE"(1) Marcus Lutrell; Michael Murphy; Matthew Axelson; and, Daniel Dietz, is worth more than the entire nation of our enemies.Japan rolled over South-East Asia like a bulldozer because they had no rules nor restrictions...THAT'S REAL WAR - KEEPING YOUR OWN TROOPS ALIVE!America should learn from that before more American 'KIDS' are squandered overseas. YEAH! The Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon where 241 Marines were 'murdered' was planned out with care (I lost a high school friend there)!?!? Mogadishu, Somalia was a charm - "Black Hawk Down" really did a lot for American troops and America!?!? BS!I salute all involved in this movie, and, all American troops anywhere and everywhere. However, I'm disgusted with our governmental rules that make American troops sitting ducks who cannot take the first shot in an already continuing war, conflict, or, engagement.USN Veteran</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read the book and enjoyed it so naturally was excited to see the movie. The movie is not even close to recognizable to what I read in the book! When the seals first run into the 3 Afghan men Marcus' character is arguing to keep them alive. In his book he goes into length stating how government dictates rules of engagement and how politicians tie the hands of soldiers! Yet in the movie he is a spokesmen for the lives of the enemy. Then the soldiers pick off the Afghan soldiers easily, but they take bullet after bullet and never seem to bleed out. They even tumble off a cliff with one hitting their head on a rock, another slamming his back into a tree yet everyone can get up and keep fighting! It is ridiculous. This could have been a good movie if the actors looked at the actual material seriously instead of turning it into an 80s action flick! Even the background music stunk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't bother to review this poor movie except that it has such a high rating on IMDb. I want to help bring that down to where it belongs. I will give it the vote it deserves, not one reduced to offset the ridiculous high score.There's a lot of action. If you are recovering from an operation, as I was, it may provide a nice way to kill some time. If you are looking for a good movie, go elsewhere.The "Hated It" reviews go into plenty of detail about what is bad, so I will just give a short list: excessive cool talk among the SEALs at the beginning, ridiculous decision to let the shepherd prisoners go free (this all takes place in enemy territory), the commander at the base asking in an irritated tone if there is a problem when the SEAL leader calls the base on a cell phone instead of the radio after missing several scheduled radio contacts, our guys bouncing down two long rock faces and then one small one hitting boulders and trees on the way down while sustaining virtually no damage other than some scrapes, getting shot over and over and over with little ill effect, bad guys who cannot hit the broad side of a barn from the inside with their rifles, bad guys who cannot hit anything with RPG after RPG (except miraculously can put one right into the open rear end of a flying helicopter), our hero performing intermediate surgery on himself at least twice without passing out, the arrival of the cavalry at the end to save our hero.This movie is on a par with the Rambo series, except those made no pretense of being true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Lone Survivor' Is A Ball-Breaker of A Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War is a lot of things, but it's useless to pretend that exciting isn't one of them. From an adrenaline standpoint that might well be the case, but in every other respect, from every other possible viewpoint, it's an inescapable waking nightmare that you'd never wish upon anyone. If that doesn't ring true for you, go see 'Lone Survivor'.Adapted from a memoir by Marcus Luttrell, it tells the story of a special unit of the U.S army comprising of four SEALs led by Marcus himself, who are sent on a mission to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. The four bunker down in the mountains in search of their target, but when the squad silently moves within sight of the compound where the besieged commander is seen training his men, they realize the mission is going to be far different than anticipated. Soon they find themselves outnumbered, pinned down on a scraggy hill. With phone signals going out in the mountainous terrain, barring them from calling in an exfiltration, a fight for their lives begins. Pursued through inhospitable mountains by several hundred Taliban and cut off from their support, a wretched retreat follows, where the exploits of those four soldiers quite simply defy belief.Mark Wahlberg, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Taylor Kitsch play the four imperiled SEALs, and from the moment they elect to abort the mission, 'Lone Survivor' becomes a ball-breaker of a film, as you slowly see shock and fear overtake their bodies. Each actor sells the utter terror of the situation and there is a visceral element to the performances as each character is mutilated beyond recognition. They give an incredible amount of emotional weight to the moments where their characters must face their fate, even though the plot is shackled to a definitive outcome.Director Peter Berg captures the raw intensity of combat and carnage on both sides of the battlefront and the heroics that forge an indelible spirit in combat. Working with a crutch of a title, there is an incredible amount of pressure on Berg to implement the 'how' element of the story and he overcomes the challenge with the precision of the army commandos he's portraying. He takes his time getting to the conflict and the anticipation of the skirmish is extreme because you're expecting the worst and that's exactly what you get. The skirmishes are gut wrenching in their brutality and Berg puts you in tight confines of makeshift foxholes and rifle sights to amplify the claustrophobia of the situation. Shot in furious sweeps and featuring smashing sound design, it is heart stopping watching the soldiers scramble across rocky outcrops and tumble down cliffs with their bones crunching against trees and boulders; the stunt work is astonishing. Berg trips up a little on a few slow motion edits that break the gritty realism but when the unit take stock on their ghastly wounds you're jolted back into the hopelessness of the situation.This is a war movie at its most confronting; it terrifyingly captures the confusion, brutality, chaos and intensity of combat in a way. It's a suffocating sort of tension - with all its bone-breaking, blood-splattering, white-knuckle skirmish - and whilst there's no question the movie suffers from some clumsy jingoism, the experience is so palpable, you frequently find yourself ducking in your own seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact-based, but still generic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lone Survivor" is an American 2-hour film from 3 years ago that managed 2 Academy Award nominations in the sound categories. In my opinion, it was fairly forgettable there and also in terms of everything else. People like this film because the characters are all people who really existed, but I have doubts how accurate the action portrayed in here is. And even if it is accurate, it is still once again just another war movie that does not make a difference compared to all the other war films that have been done in the past decades. It also isn't helping that Mark Wahlberg is not a particularly good actor and real acting talent, such as Eric Bana or Ben Foster was pretty much wasted in this film we have here.I did not really enjoy the watch. This may partially be because I do not like the genre a lot really, but yeah, it just wasn't a thrill ride or remotely edge-of-the-seat material I think. However, if the likes of "Black Hawk Down" and "Saving Private Ryan" belong to your favorite films, you can probably check this one out I guess. Sadly, the title is already a massive spoiler here. Of course, if you know about Marcus Luttrell and the mission he was on, you will know everything anyway, but I am sure most people outside the United States do not even know the basics of where he is. Anyway, fairly forgettable film in my opinion, not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor (2013): Dir: Peter Berg / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana: Tense and riveting war film about the nightmare that these soldiers embark upon that their training only touches upon in terms of preparation. Based on a true story where four young soldiers are dropped off via helicopter on a rocky forest hillside in Afghanistan. Problem arises when they capture an old goat herder and his two children and decide to let them go. Bad mistake because it opens a hornet nest that has these four soldiers fighting for their lives. We know that only one survives but what director Peter Berg does is briefly detail these soldiers before they are littered with bullets. We hear their faint breathing as life slowly drifts away and reflecting on the reality that the end is upon them. Another plus here is that not all the Taliban is viewed as a villain as our lone survivor discovers in a crucial moment when he is assisted by a father and son who happen upon him after barely surviving the onslaught. Berg has directed good films as with Hancock, and garbage such as the pathetic Very Bad Things. Here he creates his finest film. The performances by Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, and Taylor Kitsch all give credible and convincing work as soldiers confident yet not ready for the reality of war and death. Eric Bana is also featured back at base and struggling to regain communication when all seems lost. It ranks as one of the best war films ever made giving viewers a reason to thank our soldiers for the risks they are never certain to survive. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, a few nit picks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, when based on truth, especially a very modern truth, with characters still having survivors, a story may have many sides.Except in the case of the demon possessed Taliban monsters. There really is only one side here.There are gray areas. Such as how to deal with prisoners and civilians. JUNGLE FIGHTERS explored this for WWII quite well. PLATOON showed a scary side of uncertainty in Viet Nam.Here, we get more of the uncertainty of modern warfare.A small team of well trained soldiers go on a mission to eliminate a human monster that the world would obviously be better off without.The plan goes awry because of a compromised situation.The story is well told, and I believe told quite credibly. When the four soldiers are outnumbered, you will probably be like me and hope they all get out, despite the title, and kill all the nut jobs out there, because you know those nut jobs make life miserable even more for the local people.And we get insight into that, which is good.A lot is good with this film, and well done.A few nit picks I have.First, I found it easier to understand the Farsi speakers than the Americans. Whether it was sound quality or just horrible enunciation from the actors, I have no idea what any of the Americans said for the entire first half of the film. I would walk out if I didn't plan to critique it.Fortunately, the rest of the film made up for it.Second, I learned some Farsi from Pimsleur tapes and a book, though never practiced in real life to real people, and even I could understand and communicate better than the soldier among the villagers. One would think he would at least know to say "chaghu" for "knife", and "motoshakerim" (which I always remember by saying "Moto Shack Harem"), and to understand the simple "Taliban nist".Unbelievable that the soldier couldn't understand any of this, but then he was horribly wounded, but then it should have been made clear that this was the reason he didn't understand. I can't comprehend that simple Farsi wouldn't be taught to an elite unit.Third, and lastly, the soldier should have known that the villagers weren't hostile, I guess because the villager kept saying "Taliban Nist", and thought he was a little crazy during that time.These are mere nit picks on a good film. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie for most is probably a wake up call to what our warriors go through everyday but also what our men in special operations around the world go through. this movie shows perfectly the difference between what your average civilian has compared to the heart that our warriors have. If you take for example the thought of having just you and your three brothers being in the mountains maybe 2 klicks outside of a occupied rebel village , have no comms , a down sat phone and then having your op be compromised right after your infiltration , these men had the odds against them from the get go and still undertook this mission shows the love for country like none have ever seen. I think the underlying sadness of this movie is that some people will see it as war propaganda and will never support this movie or what the men of operation redwing did. Being a veteran myself this movie will always have a soft spot in my heart and this movie is great because it tells a story that otherwise would have never been told.Grimwolf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a true story of four navy seals that went on a mission to kill a Taliban leader. Later got out numbered by Taliban only one navy seal "Marcus luttrell" made it out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I chose this movie because the amount of times I've seen it, probably one of my favorite moves. After watching this movie I went further into it read about he actual mission and what happened. I've watched a lot of Marcus Luttrell actual talks about what happened on the mission. The actual mission was called operation red wings and happened on June 28, 2005. Mark Wahlberg played as the main character Marcus Luttrel. I liked the overall movie really a tense movie with well played actors. In the beginning of the movie the scene of the navy seal buds training was the real clips. They used class 234 buds training scene to show the seals in the making. The inaccurate part of the movie were the sounds of the guns were the classics Hollywood rifle sounds but that didn't affect the movie in my opinion.One thing I wish was more clear is when the goat herders discovered them in the mountains the seals had to do something with them. The options were to kill them, let them go, tie them up and leave or take them with them. They let them go and later in the movie Taliban soilders outnumbered the seals. My question is was it the herders that they let got notify the Taliban? Three of the seals died on the mission and one made it out barely. He was injured but crawled to a village where the had a old ethical code called pashtunwali where they are to protect any people in danger that comes into their village. Overall I liked the movie because of the overall story and what happened. Even though three navy seals died one made it out alive to tell the story. it was filmed in New Mexico but the terrain of it seemed so real compared to Afghanistan. Great movie and would defiantly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This intense and gritty true account of the failed mission of a Navy SEALs raid in Afghanistan packs a strong punch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rounding out the end of the year is yet another survival story with Peter Berg's 'Lone Survivor'. This intense and gritty true account of the failed mission of a Navy SEALs raid in Afghanistan packs a strong punch, even though you know only one person makes it out alive like the title suggests. The real life Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell is are lone survivor here, and we can compare this film to plenty other movies that take place in the Middle East where a mission has gone wrong, but Berg pulls out all of the stops with this story, and not only gives us an hour and a half of sheer brutality, but also gives us some great character camaraderie and tender moments to connect with these honorable soldiers. With the amount of movies out this holiday weekend, I don't see this one trumping the box office, but might make a medium-sized dent.We all know that the Navy SEALs are the cream of the crop and the best of the best in keeping our great country safe. These soldiers are the best equipped, the most trained for the most difficult situations, and for most of the time, get the job done, if not every time. But once in a blue moon, something goes wrong. Back in 2005, four SEALs, Lt. Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Petty Officer 1st Class Marcus Latrell (Mark Wahlberg), and Petty Officers 2nd Class Danny Dietz and Matt Axelson (Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster) were tasked with a mission to be dropped off in the rural mountains of Afghanistan by helicopter, and had to trek around the rocky terrain until the came upon a village where a high ranking member of the Taliban and Bin Laden's right hand man was hiding out, and killed dozens of marines for breakfast earlier in the week. The task was to take this guy out and his soldiers, which upon arrival and looking through their binoculars at the village, the amount of Taliban members were much greater than anticipated.The mission heats up quickly when an old man and two young kids stumble across the SEALs, and there in lies a conflict of ethics. One of the young kids seems to be the next member of the Taliban, as he seems to not cooperate with the SEALs at all. Now the elite squad must make a decision of whether to kill them or set them free. After an intense discussion, they decide to let them free in fear of going to jail for war crimes, but shortly thereafter, the SEALs become in a horrific battle with Taliban members that seems to not stop. In video game like fashion, the bad guys keep coming with bigger and better weapons including a rocket launcher. But this is no video game, but real life and death.Berg does a great job showing the physical aspects of the soldiers and their tough and tragic situation. As bullets, explosions, and debris literally rip the flesh off our soldiers and blood continually pours out, we feel every hit, bullet entry, and fall these soldiers take. And I think Berg is the best in the business at filming characters falling down cliffs and mountains,as we saw in his film 'The Rundown' with The Rock. Berg tends to slow down the film as these character fall to the hard rocky ground, and speed up to normal pace at the moment of impact with a branch, rock, or tree, and with a loud and intense crunch or pop sound, we feel every painful hit. There is no shortage of these scenes here.Despite Wahlberg being 42 years old, and the character he played was not even 30 in real life, he definitely pulls off a young soldier very well. Never at one point did I think he was too old for the role. That goes the same for the other three, even Kitsch. Their friendship and camaraderie at the beginning of the film is incredible, and you just know these guys will never let the other down, as I know that Berg and some of the other actors went through some of the actual training the SEALs go through.This is one of Berg's best films and is loads better than his recent effort of 'Battleship'. With Steve Jablonsky's impressive score, and some great acting and physical performances by these actors, this ultra-bloody and tragic story is one for the ages and won't be soon forgot. The film let's us know that some of these situations that are portrayed happen everyday over in the Middle East, and it made me glad that we have people like the SEALs and good people overseas who are willing to take out the evil that is the Taliban.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a seal, there is no such thing as an easy day. You got to be ready to lead, ready to follow, and never quit. Lone Survivor shows that. You're never out of the fight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on true event, Lone Survivor dramatizes a United States Navy SEALs counter-insurgent mission call "Operation Red Wings", during the Afghanistan War. Set in 2005, the team of four Navy SEAL, was task to take out a high-ranking Taliban leader, who is hiding somewhere in an Afghanistan mountain range. Unfortunately for the members of Seals Team 10 -- Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), the mission turn sour, as the team are left to fight on their own, in one of the most brutal last stand battles in the history of modern warfare. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, this movie will make some people, feel the patriotism, sacrifice, and heart the soldiers display incredibly moving; while others might feel, concerned that war and the military appears in this film, is too positive a light, and might come off like a recruitment movie. I can understand, where these people are coming from. While, I like the film, it does seem, like a powerful enlistment video. The film starts off with some cool intense Navy SEAL training footage, follow up, with a powerful Warrior Creed scene and then, a lot of badass, purely visceral, gut- pounding visceral action. If the fully immersive action wasn't enough, the movie ends it off, with over-dramatic martyrdom deaths. While, it feels shallow propaganda. In my opinion, the movie wasn't too jingoistic or overly patriotic. The movie made it very clear that there were some really bad people in Afghanistan that had to be stopped. Still, it does question and criticize the war for its failures, without painting the American soldiers in a bad-light. Director Peter Berg manages, so well to avoid high-minded moral debate of the war, while still respecting the source material, 'Lone Survivor' by author Marcus Luttrell. While, the movie is mostly historic accurate, there were a number of historical inaccuracies in the film that have to be noted. While, I'll not here to name all of them; some of the big ones, were, how the film deviates from Marcus Luttrell's account of the voting decision, his account to his injuries, and finally how certain characters die. The one decision, that bug me, is how they changed, how long, the fire fight lasted. In real life, the fire fight Marcus Luttrell and company engaged in with the Taliban for five days compared to the three depicted here. Another thing, the whole scene where the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight, never actually happened. So, I don't know, why they added it. I think the movie had enough action. Peter Berg manage to film, those scenes, very well. I like that he avoids too much camera- shaking in his depictions of the bloody battle. He builds adrenaline without tipping too far into either extreme gore or shock value. The movie pacing needs some work. The movie starts out, very slow, but toward the end, it does pick up. One thing, that I kinda hate about the film is, how predictable, it is. The movie kinda spoils, who the Last Survivor is, with the opening shot. Despite that, the movie does work. The ending is genuinely touching, and genuinely earned. You can't look away, when the photos of the real participants, are shown. Still, I wish the movie more concerned with telling us who these fallen heroes really were, rather than, focusing too much on the military-style action scenes. Yes, the movie did show, some character development, during the beginning, but it was far too little to remember. It's even harder to tell the men, apart, when they look nearly the same; all of them, having bushy facial hair, and all, being in the same height range. Still, I have to give the actors, some credit. The acting was pretty alright. Mark Wahlberg as the lead, was somewhat there, playing a Texan. I just wish, Mark Wahlberg at least, try to do a southern accent. His signature Boston accent was getting a little too silly, at times. The whole yelling scene with the grenade is prove of that. The supporting actors were decent. By far, this is Taylor Kitsch's best role, as of yet. I love Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster, but I wish, there were more scenes with them. I like that the actors build genuine chemistry and warmth with each other. They really do, seem like brothers. Before filming began, the cast also underwent training from real Navy SEALs. They really did look the part. I really believe, they were soldiers. Still, I love the movie for using actual military veterans were used in the film to fulfill extra and acting roles. Even the real-life Marcus Luttrell got a cameo in the film. Overall: This powerhouse movie does have flaws, but it's still a smart, yet brutal intense film that need to be seen. So check it out, when you can!</fullReview>

The Red Wings Operation was really sad history for US military history and these had showed how it was hard to fight against Taliban in their land.I want also mention that Eric Bana is always good option for acting positive and spirited leaders and in this movie he again did his best. The only weak point of the work is maybe some fighting episodes were so exaggerated, especially rolling downs in couple times. I strongly recommend for biography and history lovers. I always prefer scenarios which are based on true stories like Lone Survivor and could say that this movie met my expectations. Thanks to all cast and crew for this perfect work.</fullReview>

It was a great story to tell, about cool, committed and proud people, the cherry on the cake is P. Berg, who did a stunning job as always, if you've liked the Kingdom you will adore this movie like I do, I've seen it many times now and still goodwell it's a must watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expecting a top shelf war movie and what I got was an undeveloped standard Hollywood action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched a few modern war films and I have been waiting to see this since it finished it's theatrical run and it didn't deliver as much as I thought it would. Mark Wahlberg stars as Marcus Luttrell who is part of a four man Navy SEAL's team also consisting of Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster). deployed into the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan to capture or kill Ahmad Shah, who is a local Taliban leader. I mentioned at the start of this review that the film didn't deliver and in my opinion, here's why. It started off looking like it had the hallmarks of a great war movie along the lines of Platoon or Saving Private Ryan but instead descended into your standard Hollywood action movie which is kind of funny considering Mark Wahlberg is your go to action movie star these days. Secondly, most of the cast, except say Ben Foster don't get their chance to shine or let their chances slip away from an acting perspective and most of them at one stage commit one of the cardinal sins of acting, murmuring and mumbling their lines which is a big no-no. Thirdly, because of the acting mentioned in the previous sentence, I found it hard to make a connection to the characters, probably due to below average screen writing which didn't delve deep enough into what makes the characters who they are. And probably last but not least, parts of the movie are quite over the top but I guess you can kind of expect it with movies like this and at one stage made me think one thing, was Michael Bay directing this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest Yet Unbending, Epic Yet Tragic, Authentic Yet Larger Than Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When young Shane Patton (Alexander Ludwig) is being initiated as a SEAL, he has to recite a long monologue full of bluster and doggerel basically saying he is the ultimate fighting man. Instead of shouting the speech, however, he recites the lines thoughtfully, as if he's examining his own conscience as much as trying to find a place in the pecking order.Bear in mind that this is a minor character, and that most of this speech is background for basic visuals of the heroes preparing for combat. But the tone is set for a modern American epic that is as timeless as the Iliad and as relevant as today's headlines, a motion picture that is extraordinary, complex, and moving.I've been a fan of Mark Wahlberg ever since THE BASKETBALL DIARIES. There's no one else as authentic or intense as he is. Whether he's playing the very worst of human beings (a teenage junkie killer) or the very best of American heroes (Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell) he is always uncompromising and gives one hundred percent as an actor. Which is not to say that he can't be funny, playful, or charming, sometimes most unexpectedly so. But he is always authentic in every role he plays.This movie explores a classic military scenario, as old as Thermopylae or the Alamo. What happens when the greatest and most professional warriors of their age are hopelessly outnumbered and face certain death? This is not when they fade away. This is when they become who they are.It's impossible to say too much in praise of Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Mark Wahlberg, not to mention newcomers like Alexander Ludwig and the ever-reliable Eric Bana. Not one of them fails the task. They became the heroes they portrayed in this movie. What makes the movie shocking is not how real the violence is, but how real the bond between these men is even in the most casual and amusing moments, and how they remain loyal comrades even when death is only moments away. Every single performance is powerful and authentic, and the effect is not merely inspiring or patriotic but poignant and meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of a mission gone wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fairly enjoyable, fast-paced action film. One of us found it riveting. The military culture and operations seemed quite realistic. No false notes there. They picked a half dozen of the hottest male actors around to play the roles here.The acting here was really good, especially by Wahlberg. He's become a good actor (within his type) but in this movie he truly excelled. They were all good.It essentially tells the story of a screwed-up behind-the-lines SEALS mission in Afghanistan. They get stupidly discovered and are then attacked by the Taliban. Their backup is unable to rescue them for a while. They die one by one, until only Mark Walhberg is left.Whether the action scenes actually did happen as portrayed is difficult to tell. Their ability to continue moving and to generally survive bullet wounds and harrowing cliff falls was astonishing and sometimes difficult to watch. It felt to me like suffering porn at times. It strained credibility, as did the willingness of a Afghan village to expose itself to mortal danger to help an injured American.To me, as a non-American, the elegiac feel of their battle deaths, and the survival of the protagonist at all cost, felt over the top. But I regretted their deaths, just like everyone else.However, it wasn't a bad movie. I'd give it about 7.5. If you can't stomach American patriotic schmaltz, stay away from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good.. right up until the lone survivor part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with low expectations mostly because of the bad Chuck Norris style title and the fact that Mark Wahlberg was in it, but right until the final 45 minutes I was quite surprised with the quality.. it's a very good action movie up until that point Unfortunately not enough time is spent on the final leg of the movie after he is helped by the Afghan villagers. So instead of doing that part an injustice, either they should've missed it out entirely and ended when he makes contact, focusing on his actual lone survival and traversal through the hostile environment (in keeping with the movie title) for the day or so before he was saved. Or made the movie longer and given the village section the movie time that it deserves.. i.e at least the same amount of movie time as the action sequences Instead time is spent overdramatizing when it really isn't needed, the action sequences are enough. We see Marky Mark in his under armour being brought back to life, he flat lines, there are slo-mo shots, and then we have a really o.t.t credits sequence where we see lots of photos of the real guys etc. notably the Asian soldier in the pictures is missing from the movie. Why? as I understand it he was on the chopper that was shot down trying to save them So a good movie but ultimately it focuses on action and sentimentality rather too much, I doubt those guys want that, and is disappointing for it</fullReview>

The biggest flaw which came early on in the movie was that they could've just taken the 3 taliban sheep herders up the mountain with them. but this wasn't one of the 3! options. Maybe this was intended by the producers to show how pressure can compromise the logical thinking process of the American soldier. But i think its fair to say it would've made the movie a lot worse if they had done so. If America was my hometown i would have sued the people responsible for making this movie cause nothing can compensate for the time i lost on this movie.

I didn't.The premise is really interesting and, being a true story, if you know what happens you won't be entirely disappointed by watching it to the end. As a film, it falls down with an absence of any character development at all - we have no reason to care for the characters and we don't know how strong their relationships with each other are. There's no reason to actually care for any of them.The film focuses on heavy, extended action sequences for its entertainment value. Its entertaining enough but, ultimately, the film fails to be anywhere near as it could have been because of a lack of focus on story telling and character development. 5/10 from me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Berg really did an excellent job at conveying a sense of isolation in the atmosphere of this film. Coupled with great cinematography, excellent performances and great action (albeit exaggerated) you have one of the best war films ever made... despite the low budget.The camera never leaves the pinned down Americans most of the time and that gave me a very claustrophobic feeling as I watched this film this morning. All the action was shown in the perspective of the main characters and just like them, you didn't know when the next bullet was going to be fired, or the next rocket launched.Unlike films like Black Hawk Down, Lone Survivor was a bit more personal and even more emotional than the Ridley Scott classic. It made me think about karma, and the reward for acts of compassion. And I was in tears by the end of the film. Not many war films choke me up like that. And I can't think of one flaw in the film.Final Rating 8/10. Despite being without flaws, it is a B-movie. I would've rated it higher if I wasn't comparing to the larger war films out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realistic depiction of modern combat, with a little flag-waving on the side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LONE SURVIVOR is an incredible experience: a tale of bravery and camaraderie, and one of the most realistic depictions of war that I've ever seen. The story is about Operation Red Wings and takes place during the (still-ongoing) Afghanistan War. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal Petty Officer who was the lone survivor of the mission. Early on, the movie establishes the characters and gives the audience a sense of who they are, although it doesn't really delve too much. However, it gives enough of a baseline so that when the fighting ensues you care when they're injured and killed. If there was one area where the movie doesn't quite stand up to scrutiny, it's that they could have had some more character development. Still, that's not quite the reason for this movie. It's mostly about the intense firefight that Luttrell and his three other team members enter into when their op is compromised. And it sure was intense and brutal. It was filmed in a way to maximize the visceral nature of the experience and, while occasionally chaotic, was still comprehensible. There was also a lot of well-done special effects with injuries, kill-shots, etc. Here, the filmmakers did a great job putting you in the moment and making you feel the pain these soldiers went through. Overall, I liked the movie which, while never questioning American involvement in the region, does differentiate between friendly Afghanis and the Taliban. There was a touching moment towards the end between Luttrell and a young Afghani boy that was quite moving. Also, before the end credits they have a slide show of the actual people involved in the operation, which I thought was a fitting tribute to their sacrifice. Is it the greatest war movie ever? No, but it is very effective at what it sets out to do, and I applaud it for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The closest to the truth about war -- there is no honor in war, only horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before turning the TV off and going to bed the other night I watched the last half of the new war movie "Lone Survivor". This is the true story of a squad of US SEAL soldiers who were nearly wiped out by Taliban forces in the rugged hills of Afghanistan. In my experience in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Pakistan) this movie is the truest account of what it's really like to be a soldier or a civilian in war; what's it's really like to come under fire in a battle. It is a pure horror; full blown horror. Why do humans, and particularly human leaders, continue to forget just how horrible war truly is? There is never, repeat never any honor involved when the shooting starts. It's pure unadulterated mayhem and horror for every soldier under fire. Watch this movie to understand what war really is. It worries me a great deal that the US stopped the military draft after Vietnam. Today, save for the elite officer corps, the US Government basically hires its military from the lower rungs of the US social and income ladder. The military is a way out of poverty. This has been tried before. Think Rome. I continue to believe that all young US men and women, both rich/privileged and the less advantaged, should serve their country for 1-2 years in some capacity. If this happened, the US would engage in fewer wars because the leadership would think twice about sending their own sons and daughters into the horror of war. Also the cost to the government would be lower, and, over a lifetime, such a democratic military would increase the participation of the citizens in their local, state and federal governments.Don't forget; vote!!!</fullReview>

From the start, you know only one of the Seals is going to make it.Anyways the story takes place in Afghanistan where 4 Seals are sent on a mission in the mountains to take out a Taliban leader. Their mission is compromised when 3 goat herders stumble onto them. My biggest question is, why didn't they just leave them tied up till the mission was over, and then release them. Or why not wait until dark, knock all 3 out, untie them, then get out of there before they could warn the Taliban. The solution they chose was stupid on their part.Anyways, soon the Seals are surrounded and a thrilling gun fight ensues. It's very disturbing to think anyone in real life being in that situation. Also, I find it hard to believe that the villagers would help an American, but maybe that part is true. I guess they thought the Taliban was worse.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, intense action, definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review so please go easy on me. :)Last Sunday, My mother &amp; I went to Speedy Video(the Movie rentals store) in TTDI, Kuala Lumpur. We were to send back few movie rentals, but took the opportunity to borrow few other movies in return.The Lone Survivor was one of them I chose and NOT REGRET. I will say this, even though I am brought in an Islamic country and my family are Muslims. The movie is mind-blowing, excellent &amp; crazy.I love this movie, I think it is a great movie. Why? Because The movie is about America &amp; Afghanistan. It is also nice to learn the different cultures &amp; groups in Afghanistan. It is also enlightening to learn about the life of American soldiers who swear to live for their country. I admire their courage, speech, bravery, &amp; spirits. BRAVO!!!Just as There are Ups &amp; Downs in every movie, there are Ups &amp; Downs in this movie. However, The acting is also believable. Mark Wahlberg played his part really well as the Petty Officer First Class. I like his character Marcus Luttrell in this movie. I believe he is a good guy in real life but I heard that he didn't return &amp; help the people from Afghanistan back after the events. (No Spoiler I hope)Anyway, The soldiers are amazing. I respect. I think Taliban &amp; terrorists are cruel, violent &amp; inhumane at times. The movie shows that America is strong at heart. Their soldiers are strong at heart too. I also love the Afghanistan people(good people) in the movie. They too, have strong heart!I am a fan of militant movies, war movies, helicopters &amp; flying jets, armored vehicles, etc so if you are not like me even...then watch this movie and you can learn something. You may Love this movie, it's difficult to not love this movie!Peace! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harsh story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- Lone Survivior, 2013. While fighting in Aphganistan, a Seal team must find and remove a terrorist chief who lives in the hills. The team is discovered and almost gets wiped-out until new villagers assist and fight off the terrorists hord.*Special Stars- Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsh, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Alexander Ludwig.*Theme- Freedom is everyone's business.*Trivia/location/goofs- Made in eastern Europe. In real life the fire fight Marcus Luttrell and company engaged in with the Taliban last far longer than in the film and the whole ordeal was five days compared to the three depicted in the film. Was made relatively cheaply by writer/director Peter Berg who labored to make it happen over five years. Involved only a 42-day shoot and $40 million budget. Stars Taylor Kitsch and Mark Wahlberg worked at a discount, as did Berg, for the mandatory Directors Guild minimum salary of $17,000 a week. The tumbling and falling scenes were filmed on location without CGI enhancement, and necessitated that the stunt performers subject themselves to genuinely hard falls. After one such stunt, Mark Wahlberg's stunt double had to be hospitalized. Marcus Luttrell: At about the 12:30 mark of the movie he's the SEAL "Frank" or "Frankie" that spills the coffee and tells the rookie to clean it up. He appears again on the rescue helicopter. Though it is not mentioned in the movie, Marcus Luttrell was personally awarded the Navy Cross by then-President George W. Bush. Lieutenant Michael Murphy would be awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. Axelson and Dietz were also awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. GOOFS- In one scene a common New Mexico diamondback rattlesnake slithers across the ground. Diamondbacks are not native to Afghanistan. In numerous shots of the SEALs falling down the mountains the faces of the replacement stunt performers are visible.*Emotion-A harsh story to watch due to it's true plot and vicious SEAL warfare action against Taliban terrorists. Well worth you time. Not for the faint hearted.*Based On-Based on a true story and popular book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like 2004's excellent, melancholy Friday Night Lights (and the TV series that followed), Peter Berg injects Lone Survivor with the same sense of camaraderie, as a band of brothers go to near- impossible lengths to carry out the task at hand. But where Lights took place on the football pitch, Lone Survivor is set amongst the unforgivable terrain of the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan. Based on sniper Martin Luttrell's book (here he is played by Mark Wahlberg), the events that took place in June 2005 was one of the most gruelling acts of warfare ever recorded.After receiving orders to execute Ahmad Shah, a Taliban leader responsible for deaths of over a dozen marines, a Navy SEAL's unit headed by Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) plan for a quick operation. Luttrell, team leader Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), sniper 'Ax' Axelson (Ben Foster) and communications specialist Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) are picked for the job, and are dropped onto a steep and jagged Afghan hillside. They locate their target, but after experiencing some communication problems, come across a Taliban sheep-herder and two children. After deciding to obey the rules of engagement and let them go, they are soon pursued by a small army, who rain bullets and rockets down upon them.Starting with the same twangly-guitar music that steeped Friday Night Lights so beautifully and richly in atmosphere, the film begins with heavy in shots of sunsets, our heroes staring at photographs of their loved ones. and cracking wise over dinner. It doesn't do much to help us distinguish one from the other (apart from the fact they are all recognisable faces), but it does establish a sense of foreboding doom. The opening scene depicts a bullet-ridden and near-dead Luttrell before skipping back in time, so the outcome of a film called 'Lone Survivor' leaves little ambiguity. And when the bullets start to fly, Peter Berg shows us one of the most brutal and realistic depictions of war even put on film.The four are shot, blown up, and in the most wince-inducing scenes, thrown down a hillside of sharp rocks and thick trees, where we get to experience every impact and every bone broken. It's an endless array of loud violence, and when you finally think it's over as Luttrell is aided by Afghan villagers, they still more to come. It's in the later scenes when the film becomes less a serious study of warfare and bravery, and becomes more of a Hollywood movie. There's a lot added in these scenes that didn't happen in real life, and it feels like an unnecessary attempt to appease an audience used to more traditional action-movie climaxes. But for the most part, this is thrilling, and quite moving, stuff.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gripping "Lone Survivor" has that "eye of the tiger" as a surreal cinematic experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This adapted true story stars Mark Wahlberg as Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell who is sent on a mission with his three Seal compadres to kill or capture Tabilan leader Ahmad Shad. When the mission turns into a nightmarish experience, Marcus and company have to fight for their lives by combating a full army of Tabilans. Director Peter Berg, who has not been much of a Berger Directorial King in his past work, does surprise here by brilliantly capturing the authenticity of the misery of war through Marcus' &amp; Co. unforgettable experience. Wahlberg was on target as Marcus, and Ben Foster also fostered in nicely with his work as Navy Seal Matt "Axe" Axelson. There are many scenes that are a bit too heavy-handed for some viewers, but "Lone Survivor" is a must-see and a true valiant lesson of overcoming insurmountable odds. And I don't think I am the lone critic (or pseudo-critic better stated) that has the same sentiment. **** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep thinking about the options that the Seals had when they were discovered by the goat herders. An old man, a young boy, and a young man, the latter clearly angry and having tried to escape. Do you let them go, in which case the young man goes straight to the Taliban, or do you kill them and continue the operation? They let all three go, the young man goes to the Taliban, and American lives are lost. Were those really the only choices? Could they not have killed the young man, injured the young boy, and let the old man go? Couldn't they have held the latter two until the operation was over and then let them go? I am also troubled that the military left these boys in harm's way when they didn't have to be. Why couldn't a plane have monitored them until the mission was over, not just 6 hours? Why were they given defective radio equipment? The soldiers at Normandy had better stuff. These boys expected the people who trained them to look after them and this just didn't happen.The fighting on the mountain was hard to take but that too stayed with me. Was the truth embellished? Probably, but this movie had my attention from first frame to last.</fullReview>

You will see how rough things get and the importance of brotherhood and kindness that bring so much meaning to life. The scenic views make you forget that you are watching a war movie. The camera work and the details of the incident are clean and realistic. The acting is amazing.Two hours of engaging replication of a real life incident under gruesome condition of fight, sacrifice, kindness, and recovery.A must watch movie and stands up straight against all other war movies in the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot better than what I was prepared for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lone Survivor" is a film that I left on the backburner for a bit for several reasons. Number 1) Mark Wahlberg is an actor that I will really enjoy in one role or completely be annoyed by in another. Number 2) I am not a fan of Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster (too bad that Foster's name doesn't also end with a "sch." I had a bit of a pattern going there). Number 3) The film is based on a true story of Marcus Luttrell's survival in a failed Navy SEALs operation and I was putting my money on the fact that Hollywood was going to take some insane liberties with it (the film was directed by Peter Berg and he directed "Battleship"). Finally, Number 4) I kinda thought the film was going to be one giant cheerleading session about how great America is and that everyone in Afghanistan is a terrorist working for the Taliban.I was wrong on each of these concerns.First off, the entire cast?even the guys who I've never once seen a decent performance from (like Kitsch and Foster)?were absolutely incredible. The team had a very real chemistry and, more importantly, they all seem grounded and realistic. That last observation is a big deal considering this is the first time I've watched Ben Foster in a film where he isn't trying to chew on every bit of scenery he can find.Secondly, while the film does take some liberties with the story, the film is treated with a lot of respect and it really showcases the indomitable spirit of Marcus Luttrell?even though Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of him isn't even close to how really badass Luttrell was. Finally, going along with that whole respect thing, the movie isn't just one long fireworks display about how awesome our service men are. The movie is more about the men who were trapped behind enemy lines and cut off from all rescue. The film also stays away from Fox News-ing it up and will actually show that because someone is from the Middle East it doesn't mean they are a terrorist. The movie shows how Luttrell was sheltered by an Afghani village and protected from the Taliban. A fact like that was one of those liberties I feared was going to be taken but it wasn't and it made the film less about the war and more about the tale of survival?which is what is was meant to be.Overall, I was very surprised with how well constructed and how human "Lone Survivor" was. Much better than I had originally predicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>__BOOK SPOLIERS__ I love this movie. Let me just tell you what is different from the book. Mark Wahlberg is a 5'8 New Englander. Marcus Luttrell (the character he is playing) is a 6'5 Texan. Throughout the movie there is no native Texan accent. NONE, and hes a lot shorter than Real Life Marcus, which angers me lol. Ending didn't happen truthfully Danny died next to them at a certain point with WAY more wounds but was still trying to fight. Axe was grazed by a bullet in the head, kept fighting next to Marcus, then got blown up by a RPG along with Marcus. Murphys ridge was depicted well other than the fact he didn't die up there. but DANNY Wasn't LEFT UP THERE FOR THE TALI TO TAKE ALIVE. Marcus was in the village for roughly 5 days before he was rescued, SMH overall, MARK WAHLBERG Wasn't A GOOD FIT AT ALL FOR MARCUS LUTRELL. OH AND PS, MURPHY died in a horrific way, not by the way depicted in the movie at all. really horrific. he was in a bunker type of cover after calling in backup. his team of i think marcus and axe were way behind him and the TALI slowly surrounded Murphy, and throughout that being under heavy fire he was yelling "HELP ME MARCUS HELP!!!!" that scene still haunts Marcus Lutrell to this day. I can see why it wasn't in the movie. I don't even know if he sleeps anymore</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor is the true story of Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell's experiences with his team in the Hindu Kush during operation Red Wing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Lone Survivor has a very small amount of main characters but the casting of all the characters was fairly spot on. The main characters in the movie are Marcus Luttrell, played by Mark Wahlberg, Mike Murphy, played by Taylor Kitsch, Matt Axelson, played by Ben Foster, and Danny Dietz, played by Emile Hirsch. While reading the book I was able to create a picture in my head of these characters and the events that took place. These four are the only characters that really mean anything in the movie even though there are far more involved in the book. In the book Luttrell describes Mike Murphy as that guy that was just good at everything. He was good looking, extremely strong and athletic, and of course smart. Taylor Kitsch is not that well known of an actor but he was in the TV series Friday Night Lights where he played an ex high school football player he was known for getting with attractive women. With that said we can assume he's an athletic and good looking guy. Matt Axelson is described in the book as a humble family man, always thinking about his wife and always doing the right thing. I never heard of Ben Foster before I saw Lone Survivor but when I compared him to the real Matt Axelson there is a striking resemblance. They both have similar features and the personality Foster portrays is just like the one Luttrell describes. In the beginning of the movie Axelson is seen emailing his wife cute messages, telling her how much he misses her. That's the type of guy he was. Danny Dietz and Marcus Luttrell weren't as close as Luttrell was to the other two members of the team but he still had a love for him. According to Danny Dietz Family Interview, where questions were sent to his parents and responses were given, Dietz was described as "rambunctious", kind and loving, and of course determined to become a Navy Seal at a young age of 13. Hirsche, the actor who plays Dietz, is a tad bit shorter than the real Seal but for the movie Hirsche got into good shape and was able to pull of the look. With his facial hair grown in he definitely looks like Dietz. Dietz was also described as competitive and active which is shown in the beginning of the movie when he and Murphy race around their base just for the fun of it. The Last character needed to be described is of course Marcus Luttrell, played by the well-known Mark Wahlberg. Mark Wahlberg is known for playing tough guy roles such as in Invincible, The Fighter, and 21 Guns with Denzel Washington. Even in his comedic roles he can be tough like in The Other Guys where he plays a short tempered NYC cop. With all that said his resume fits the criteria to play a bad-ass Navy Seal like Marcus Luttrell. The one downside to the casting that baffled me when I heard about it was that Marcus Luttrell dwarfs Mark Wahlberg. Luttrell was known in his Seal class for being the giant that was surprisingly a great swimmer. Wahlberg is known for his short temper due to his Napoleon complex for being so short. I thought that there could've been other casting roles that might have fit the "Mark" a little better. But after learning that he was one of the main producers of the movie it made sense that he would want to make himself one of the leading roles. Other than being a tad vertically challenged, Wahlberg fit the personality and demeanor of Luttrell pretty well. Other notable actors in the movie include Eric Bana, Dan Bilzerian, and Marcus Luttrell himself. Eric Bana, known for his roles in Black Hawk Down, Hulk, and Troy, played Erik Kristenson, Luttrell's commander and one of the organizers of operation Red Wings. Other than being Australian Bana was a pretty good choice due to his stature and attitude in the movie. He did not really look like Kristenson but he sure did play him well. Dan Bilzerian, known for making millions as an online poker player and becoming an "Instagram Playboy", played Dan Healy. Healy did not play that big of a part in the movie but Dan Bilzerian is an ex-Navy Seal and a lot of media buzz has been surrounding him recently so I thought I'd mention his casting. Lastly, Marcus Luttrell has about as minor as a role can get in a film. He is seen in the background of a few scenes while still on the American military base. He may have a couple lines if any at all but it was still cool to have him play a role in the movie that he lived through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know you really shouldn't put 'spoilers' in film reviews, but the title itself must give you a bit of a clue regarding what eventually happens. 'Lone Survivor' is the true story of an ill-fated U.S. Navy Seals mission to root out the Taliban.Mark Wahlberg plays the leader (or at least the main) Navy Seal on the mission, so no prizes for guessing who's the one who makes it to the final credits. However, just because you probably already know what happens, doesn't really detract from the film's tension. No one really stands out as giving the performance of a lifetime. All the main characters (who speak English) are functional, i.e. the play battle-hardened soldiers as you'd expect.It's actually pretty scary stuff. There aren't exactly a million different special effects used (or required) to tell the story. It's quite a simple affair, i.e. a small squad of soldiers in the woods, deep behind enemy lines. But, when they finally come into contact with those they're there to destroy, things do not go according to plan and they end up being the ones on the receiving end.Being a true story helps. It does make you ponder what troops go through and the lack of big budget special effects give it a much more gritty feel (although, sometimes watching guys run through a wood did make it feel a little like a 'made-for-TV' movie).It's nothing revolutionary, but, if you're into true life war films or are generally interested in modern armed conflict, it's certainly worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw LONE SURVIVOR! This movie is about the true story of Operation Red Wings, a military scout mission that turned into a massive firefight between four Navy SEALs and a small army of Taliban soldiers and the heroism the SEALs displayed during the battle. The movie is directed by Peter Berg stars Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Taylor Kitsch and Emile Hirsch and is without a doubt one of the best war movies I've seen in the last 10 years. First of all, the acting here is superb! Everyone in it does a masterful job especially Ben Foster who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. The story is tight and simple but is well told for the most part. The Cinematography is unique and really creatively shows each and every excruciating aspect of real war situations. Lone Survivor is fantastic but some of the violence is really tough to watch at points and a lot of the characters are shown in a too often seen let-me-show-you-my-girl-back-home kind of way and we all know what that means X_X. Overall I would say Lone Survivor sits somewhere between Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan and is highly recommended to anyone looking for their action movie fix. Lone Survivor gets a solid 4... out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just so good that it'll blow your mind away in the opening sequence itself.It shows the training sessions of United States Navy SEALs not only is it a very cool footage to watch but it also makes you think is this all really worth so much pain and sacrifice ? Halfway through the movie you would understand why they are pushed so hard and that every drop of sweat during training is accounted for in the battlefield.It is so rare to see such a big star cast to come together and make a movie where all they are given equally strong characters and they all play it beautifully .A delightful cameo by the actual 'Lone Survivor' Marcus Luttrell makes it all even more special.The tension during the action sequence was nerve wracking previously felt during 'The Hurt Locker' .But this one has enough action to keep action movie lover satisfied. Very satisfying to see Mark Wahlberg in such a brilliant performance .Don't you just love it when a macho dude can do a heart warming performance . Director Peter Berg (Hancock, Battleship)has ensured that he didn't get carried away with the opportunity of explosions &amp; mindless action, what we get is just the right amount in the right way. Special mention to the stunt doubles of the four soldiers for the sequence in which they are falling down the rocky terrain that would make the hardest of us go Oucch!! Overall this movie is a pleasure watch .Do not miss it. The film not only shows the grit of the American soldiers and the determination of a motivated soldier .It shows us what courage can overcome and shows us the Good present in an Ugly place the world is right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I cannot recall being this moved by a film in a long time. The story depicts a real-life story of a team of Navy Seals sent into a Taliban area in Afghanistan to take out a major leader. Based on the title of the film, you already know something is going to go wrong, so that's not a spoiler.The days-long battle scenes are gripping and intense. You cannot take your eyes away as little by little, you feel things are slipping away for these guys. Yet they don't give up. Ever.The training scenes at the beginning give you a hint, just a hint, of how tough you have to be to be a Seal. All that training came to bear in this ordeal. But the strongest part of them is the brotherhood they develop, and keep, forever, through whatever happens. Man are they tough, which comes through loud and strong in this film.The acting is taut and spot on. The story is unrelenting. The climax builds and drags you into an emotional roller coaster. Some beautiful music in the final credits, with a special David Bowie song, and real life clips of these people - had me in tears sobbing. It's an emotionally moving movie that stands out as an exceptional war film, and a fitting tribute to brave troops fighting against terrorism worldwide.Well done, and thanks for bringing this story to life. This movie will stay with you a long time. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a straightforward film based on the book by Marcus Luttrell, but it lets itself down with the occasional "Rambo" touch.The book is the true story of how a four-man reconnaissance team of US Navy SEALs was ambushed, and their epic battle before three of them, and a helicopter full of rescuers were killed. The badly wounded lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell, was saved by Afghan tribesmen honouring the ancient tradition of defending a guest no matter what.About a third of the book was devoted to the selection and training of the Navy SEALs, and although training footage is shown under the opening credits, the movie concentrates on the mission, the ambush and the aftermath.Little of the political viewpoint of the book is in the movie, which might be a good thing ? claims such as Saddam Hussein supporting Al-Qaeda, don't fit with the known facts. However, the book makes some interesting points about how Western media and Rules of Engagement can jeopardise coalition soldier's lives.A jarring note in the movie is the heavy-handed way the Taliban are portrayed in the early sequence when they attack a village; it smacks a little of actors in costume. Surely it would have been better if they had been simply introduced from the POV of the SEALs as they observe the village just before the ambush.The movie is faithful to the book except for the final battle at the end, which weakens its integrity, especially when Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell starts wielding a knife.The book is a good read and the description of the battle with the Taliban, which the film follows closely, is one of the most exciting passages of its kind ? maybe a bit too exciting? The book has been accused of exaggerating the number of Taliban involved and the casualties they suffered ? even Luttrell's after-action report gives less than half the number given in the book.This is similar to the problems with the far more controversial "Bravo Two Zero", the story of a British SAS patrol during the Gulf War. It appears that a great deal of colourful action was added to that account.Coincidentally, the same thing, goat herders, compromised both missions. They seem a more effective early warning system than any number of satellites.I remember thinking when the inconsistencies over "Bravo Two Zero" came to light, why do it? The exaggeration detracted from the real bravery of soldiers trapped behind enemy lines, their endurance and courage in the face of torture ? it's as though the author feared the readers wouldn't think it brave enough.The same applies to "Lone Survivor"; the courage of the SEALs, and the heroism of the team leader who sacrificed himself to make the call for help isn't diminished whether they were facing 100 Taliban or 10.With that said, Peter Berg's movie is competently made, and is obviously a heart-felt tribute to a small band of modern-day warriors who put themselves in harm's way for values they believed in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old cavalry to the rescue movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a realistic war movie, although it is probably more realistic than Bravo Two Zero, which a lot of other reviewers compare this movie with. In Bravo Two Zero an intrepid band of SAS soldiers decide, unlike their other squadron's teams, to leave their vehicle's behind, and as a result, suffer for it. Somehow they take on almost the entire Iraqi army in flat, desert terrain, killing many without receiving a single wound themselves. At least in Lone Survivor the truth/Story isn't stretched as far, although they do seem to be immune from injury when falling down cliffs. Lone Survivor is a very well made, good guys versus the baddies with the cavalry coming to the rescue in the end. I'm not sure how the cavalry could work out the difference between the good and bad guys? This movie is no way as bad as a lot of reviews have made it out. It is entertaining, great on a big screen with good sound, just don't expect a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well checked Gung Ho. But leaves questions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of the "Special Forces" genre this film is a must see. What can not be overlooked is the attention to detail by the films director with regard to environment, equipment and the realities of military life both in and out of the combat zone for operational Navy Seal teams.However the film does leave some questions in mind. Without doubt the film goes along way to establishing the exemplary credentials of those selected to serve as Navy Seals. Displaying honestly and admirably their physical fortitude under pressure. That all said, if I where a senior commander within the U.S. Navy. I am not entirely certain that I would be happy that the film presents this particular branch of the U.S. military's special forces in a particularly good light.Based on a true story about a past Navy Seal mission in Afghanistan. Whether the storyline itself is factually correct and accurately represents the decision making that led to the ultimate conclusion of this story or not. What the film does go a long way in doing, is presenting some of the Navy's finest as being a bit too much brawn and not a great deal of brain.For fans of the genre all the usual foundations are there. Brotherhood, camaraderie and sheer grit against the blackest of outcomes. There is even the shining example that the struggle is worthwhile and some genuinely touching examples from the real world of the Navy Seals.But to the viewer it does leave those questions.............. All the gear and no idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't normally review movies because they are so subjective, but I really felt like I had to review this one. I felt like my heart had been ripped out and I was exhausted when it was over. The actors did an excellent job of making you care about them even though you knew most of them didn't make it. The action sequences were brutal and realistic. It captured the hardships of the Afghan people and the humanity of the non-Taliban people who are driven to help anyone in need. The movie was raw and emotional. It ranks as one of top movies I've seen. The bonus features were worth watching as well. The interviews with the families of the fallen and hearing that they felt the movie was respectful to the memories also made the film even more endearing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know absolutely nothing about being in the service, so I can not vouch for the authenticity of the material exposed in this movie. There is no way for me to know what is real and what is a Hollywood exaggeration, except of course common sense-- nonetheless I kept telling myself, "Its based on real events".These war themed movies tend to really affect me and really make me rethink the way I view the war and the people who volunteer to go. These guys are brothers, they spend every day together, and have this fondness for each other, that they channel in the movie, and doubt this is a reality. At the beginning of the movie, it shows the extreme training they got through, and hopefully they make it through the whole training. Then comes the conflict later on during the movie when they are discovered by these Taliban "shepherds". The inner conflict of whether they should eliminate the enemy, or let them go, and buy some time........ fine, they go with the most "sensible" decision of letting them go, but it takes a turn for the worse, and after that I was unable to contain myself. I felt like I was in the battlefield myself; paranoia all around. After all the war scenes, comes my favorite part. This part restored my faith in humanity, and really made my choke up. Lutrell is found by a man,and his son and they take him under their cover. Just like Lutrell, I could not understand why he'd done this, and put his whole village in danger. Its later explained in the movie, but this really was the boiling point for me. It's even greater because I have the sense of satisfaction that this part was not scripted or made up, but actually happened.WITHOUT SELFISHNESS, HE OFFERED HIS HAND FOR HELP. There are so many things in this movie to talk about that I would be here all night just raving on and on about this awesome movie. Everyone in this movie took charge of their role. I cant imagine the irony of this story; Lutrell wanted to do the right thing in NOT killing these Talibans, but in hindsight, if he had, maybe this whole story wouldn't exist.</fullReview>

Finally it was hilarious how the whole team were diving on the rocks from the slope like they were diving in the swimming pool,breaking there bones,loosing guns,medipack.At this point my brain started denying the movie at such a level that I shut it down and started writing this.Why I rated 5 is the camera,gun and sound.

		<shortDescription>Good movie but could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that this is a good movie. However, it could have been great; if the director Berg used some commonsense (unfortunately common sense is uncommon). Let me start by saying that I am huge Wahlberg fan. My biggest peeve with this movie is lack of logic. Here are team of elite Navy seals who undergo tremendous training and hard work but lacks logic in the field. Really? I understand the code of conduct in the war but this is not war. The code of conduct should not apply, when fighting terrorists!!. Okay I will let this slide because if the terrorists in the form shepherds were shot, there won't be a movie. Aren't these elite Seals know not to shout and keep quite when engaging a hoard of enemies? Why was Luttrell (Wahlberg) keeps on shouting Axe loudly, thereby giving away his location? I can't fathom it. Don't even get me started about pleasantries exchanged between Shane Patton (Ludwig) and Kristenson (Bana) before their Chinook was shot down. WTF are they chatting in a battle. Get on with the job. Anyway, now that I vented my frustration, I have to say that I did like the movie.It is sad to see our Seals fight valiantly and in doing so sacrifice their lives. It is a must watch (IF LOGIC OR LACK THERE OF BOTHERS YOU). Just my opinion.</fullReview>

A tribute to the soldiers and their families, certainly, but if you are not among them you may choose to watch something else. I read other reviews comparing this movie to "Saving Private Ryan"... it was misleading in my opinion. This movie reminds me more Black Hawk Down but it is far less spectacular and gripping. Battles scenes are quite realistic but the whole story is built around a small episode after all (big enough for those who took part in it, but what about the others?).

		<fullReview>Review: This movie does take some time to get going, but once it does, it's full of intense drama which is very believable. The action scenes were put together well and you can't help but feel for the 4 band of brothers who find themselves in an impossible situation. The fact that this film is based on true events, makes it even more intense, but they had to put a Hollywood spin on it by making Wahlberg the hero, as usual. Anyway, the footage of the real soldiers was emotional but there are better movies out there that portray the Americans at war. Watchable!Round-Up: I would have liked the director to concentrate on the individual characters because the film just jumps right into them going into the jungle. Apart from that, the actors done extremely well by making the film feel real and it really does make you think about what the real soldiers have to go through. I personally would have cracked under the pressure, but when you see the footage of the training at the beginning, you can understand that they are prepared for every situation. Anyway, you can't fault the film for intense drama.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $150millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there war movies about 4 band of brothers who get caught in an impossible situation. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninformed Reviews of a Well-Informed Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After much anticipation of this film's release, I wasn't disappointed after watching it last night via Charter On-Demand. In fact, it ranks among the top 5 best "combat" endeavors I've seen, preceded only by timeless, military-based classics such as 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon', &amp; 'Full Metal Jacket'. Those thoughts aside, only one issue leaves me scratching my head this morning: reviewers casting their "tiny detail spotlights" on what they believe to be major tactical and equipment snafus ~ Or, what's 'possible' or 'impossible' for a Navy SEAL operator to physically or mentally accomplish during the course of a 2-hour dramatic performance.With military films in particular, prop details, factual precision, and period accuracy are invaluable. The directors and producers of 'Lone Survivor' did their Naval Special Warfare homework to ultimately accomplish the element of combat realism ~ their successes were even noted above in one review posted by an individual in a NAVSPECWARCOM support role ... Yes, someone who's actually *familiar* with the SPEC-OPS community, their tactics, weapons, uniforms, and overall cognitive / physical capabilities.Other reviews, however, were ill-informed critiques of what the SEALs "should have done", or how impossible it is for SEALs to kill most of the converging enemy personnel with "single shooting". Again, seemingly small details like these are critical in assuring we *believe* the experience on the screen, so here's why this film hit its mark, and why a few negative reviewers didn't: 1) Claymore mines and tripwires? Navy SEALs operate in small teams of 4-6 men. They're notorious for doing three things extremely well ... moving, communicating, and shooting. These three things are done quickly, with overwhelming aggression, violence, and deadly precision firepower. Historically, SEALs have been quick-insertion forces who don't linger around the campsite waiting on the enemy to arrive. SEALs are trained to act in a proactive manner, initiate the contact, neutralize the target / accomplish the goal, and get OUT. Given their small numbers, they have little use for additional weight on their backs in the form of claymore mines and rolls of detonation cord. Those types of armament are typically used by Army and Marine personnel with longer mission ranges. In the time it takes to set up these "claymores and tripwires", SEALs are back at the FOB smoking cigars, Skyping, and cleaning their weapons.2) Speaking of weapons ... It's 100% accurate that 4-6 Navy SEALs would "single shoot" (to use a reviewer's term) rather than sling 1000s of rounds of ammunition at an enemy hiding behind rocks and trees. SEALs are trained to kill quickly with a double-tap trigger method resulting in a "keyhole" pattern. This was evident numerous times during the mountain firefight scenes... the SEALs fired one well-placed head shot, then followed quickly with a second "finishing" body shot. When you're taxed with needing to enter and exit a mission area quickly, the last thing you want are 8 boxes of ammo weighing you down. A small team of SEALs, inserted quickly into an area saturated with enemy personnel, must kill with one or two well-placed shots to the head or center mass. These guys are the best shooters in the world, and the directors of the film nailed this one.3) With regard to weapons, once more ... the Taliban do love their AK-47 assault rifles, but rest assured -- an AK-47 doesn't utilize .45 caliber rounds (as noted in the same reviewer's post). A Kalishnikov (like that depicted in the film) operates on 7.62mm rounds, the equivalent of the civilian .308 caliber.4) Totes m'Goats ... or, leave them? Would a REAL Navy SEAL tie a goat herder to a tree, or let him go, or kill him, or take him along for a stroll to the top of a 9,000 ft. Afghan mountain? There are 4 or 5 of you, and potentially 100s of the enemy right down the hill. Arriving at the best possible solution to this problem (on the fly, under controlled stress, in the presence of your enemy) wouldn't be easy, and would likely have no clear-cut answer. As one SEAL notoriously said after a mission, "The best designed plans change after the first shot is fired." Are there elements of Hollywood dramatics in 'Lone Survivor'? Absolutely... such as multiple 200-foot ass-bashing tumbles down boulder-ridden hillsides, and several of the SEALs soaking up multiple gunshots from 7.62mm rounds (which normally would rip an arm off). But, kudos to the film-makers for an overall great war film, and depiction of our incredibly talented Special Ops warriors. Definitely a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hard To Say Where Exactly I Stand On This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's not a knife, that's a f***ing duck." That line is too good to not be mentioned in this review. This film really has me conflicted. I heard really good things about it when it came out, so I thought it would go above and beyond the usual military hero movie, but i'm not sure if it did. The strongest part of this film has to be the whole sequence of the squad being attacked by the Taliban. There are lots of great blood and gore effects that help make their injuries feel realistic, and you really feel bad for these guys. They go through so much and the movie does not pull any punches. One of the biggest things I can't quite make my mind up about is whether or not I think the film is too "hurrah USA!" or not. The last little bit of the film feels too Hollywood, which would make you think so, but the amount of terrible things that happen to the characters makes me think otherwise. Regardless, I really respect the real men who died during this mission in real life, and the sequence at the end where they show real pictures of the men is quite moving, especially when we see footage from one of the men's wedding videos. Touching stuff.I think the performances were pretty good all around. Mark Wahlberg is the main character, and he does a good job, but I actually think Ben Foster would have been more interesting in the role of the lead, because I found his performance extremely interesting and impressive.There were also some things in this that I found humorous that i'm almost certain aren't supposed to be. The "f***ing duck" quote is obviously supposed to get a laugh, but i'm not sure about Mark Wahlberg yelling "i'm gonna f***ing kill you!" over and over at a group of Afghan men and a kid while holding a grenade. I couldn't help but laugh and I don't think that was the response the director wanted. Also the way one of the falling down the cliff sequences was edited almost seemed like he kept falling down the same slope and hitting the same rock, which made me laugh once again when I know it was supposed to be serious. I'm not one of those idiots who laughs at things all the time, I just don't think these scenes we're done well.Overall, this is a good movie. Not great, just good. Take from it what you will. It certainly is an interesting story based on a real event, and I think that makes it worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story stays in a great measure faithful to the events back in 2005, underlining critical choices and situations who can be decisive in such moments that test soldiers to the limit of their training and abilities. I am not going to go into details as anyone spending 5 minutes on Wikipedia can have a general idea of what happened there. It is nice to have this sort of movies depicting realities and how hard it is for US troops, both mentally and physically, yet, I still sense these movies are generally directed and targeting mainly the US viewers, as stereotypical it may sound, it's a dedication to fallen heroes, who are not only seen as soldiers trained and paid by the US military industry to be ultimate weapons, but also normal people, loved and grieved by their families back home. Of course, as a viewer, every US war related flick tends to empathize only with the US side, but things are slowly changing, as enemies have also a drop of humanity sometimes.I give it a 7/10 as I would wanted a more detailed plot development on the enemy, who did not seem at all very Taliban-sh to me. But, yes, it's the story told on the US side, because such a mission fail is not on the daily agenda of the US Army.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a simple special missions movie. Where four Seal teammates go on a mission to take down a terrorist leader that killed a bunch of Marine soldiers. It really isn't a movie that leads to the audiences to think about war or any of those stuff. It really isn't a intelligent war movie. But what it does have is good cinematography and topnotch sound effects and sound editing. Seriously the sound effects in this is one of the best I have ever heard so far. Even to the point it lead me to grimace just by the sound effects itself more than what I actually saw on screen. The action sequences are realistic and very well done. It also does a decent job of trying to put the audiences in the perspective of the Seal team. However the development isn't done so well and the four main characters that were on the mission just didn't stand out all that well. It just didn't really grip me nor did it gave me a rush to really focus and nor did it really have any emotional effects. I thought it was cool to actually know about the "Pushtanwali" code which saved a soldiers life in this movie. So yeah, although it isn't really a stand out movie I still give it a 6.5/10 because it's based on a true story. And that does have a bit of an effect, at least on me while watching this movie.6.5/10</fullReview>

I was awestruck at the safe harbor tradition of the Afghan village where they protect anyone who has taken a refugee at their place. This two hour cinema is engaging from the start to the finish. Even there were some missing logic at the places where they let the captured villagers go, I put my annoyance to sleep saying to myself that it might have happened in real. Except that part, everything falls to place like icing on cake. Watch it if you have not; you may thank me later.(The following lines are intended for Indian audience) Why the producers in our great country don't come up with more movies about valor, bravery and courage nevertheless REALISTIC? Oh no. We the audience absolutely love to be goat-minded by the cheesy scripts and flying jeeps. Entertainment to us is far from reality and goes by legacy and shed clothes. We be dumb, hypocrite and in denial. But if we don't we ain't human- that's our excuse. We watch D-Day, Madras Cafe and such, because we've run out of "world-famous-in-India" movies.

		<fullReview>Marcus Luttrell, and his team of Navy S.E.A.L's set out on a mission to capture or kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. After running into mountain Shepherds and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives on the mountains, with communications down, and a seemingly endless adversary....Here in the UK, this vanished without a trace at the Box Office, and Bergs film are either hit and miss, and plus Wahlberg's last film was the poisonous Pain and Gain, so I wasn't really too bothered about seeing it.But then again, one should realise that a bad movie shouldn't taint your future viewing, and I'm glad it hasn't tainted mine, because this is a really good movie, with great performances from the four leads.To say the film is intense is an understatement, as half hour into the film, the ambush happens, and it literally doesn't give up until the final credits roll.Berg proves again, he can expertly film an extended set piece, and every fall and wound the four incur, is wince inducing and brutal, in some parts of the film, I was literally holding on to my chair for dear life.My only gripes with the film are the title. If you've never heard of the story, it's a bit of a spoiler in itself, and some of the deaths are a bit Willem Dafoe in Platoon.The final act is breathtaking and very touching, proving that stereotypes are rife in the world.A really good movie all in all. The narrative is tight, and the film is executed almost perfectly. Just very, very tense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purely disgusting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that are called "based on a true story" that are so fantasized that calling them a true story becomes incredibly illogical. This movie disgusts me because it thinks that if you show a bunch of clips of marines and call it a true story that it must be hailed as "inspiring" and "a story of true courage", when there are obvious moments that it's impossible for the single survivor to have known that they happened. So I can fairly criticize this as a film without any qualms. You can't just fly a banner that says "war movie" and evade criticism... well, you can avoid the critics at the idiotic aggregators and the idiots who see "based on true acts of courage" and automatically call it the greatest film of the year.This movie is comically bad. It barely shows any of the humanity of the soldiers, making their deaths lack impact. And you know that everybody's going to die from the get-go because of the title, meaning it needed to have impact. And it doesn't. It has horrible pacing, terrible camera, and the portrayal of the Muslim characters is laughable at best. Like American Sniper, this film is Jingoistic, portraying all Muslim characters as either stupid terrorists or just stupid.The musical score is bad too. The action sequences are like American Sniper; a scope lines up with a terrorist, and then it jump cuts to the person dying. Wow, that's intense. Great action really, because there totally aren't sniper movies that do more. Totally. The movie completely overuses slow motion with multiple sequences where nothing happens except soldiers falling down the mountainsides. Wow, riveting.The dialogue is poorly written; never does anybody feel heroic or humane. Quite the opposite. And that's the worst part about it. It feels disrespectful, because that's what it is. You can't take a story of a group of heroes, turn it into just another Hollywood garbage film, plaster "true story" on it, play a sad song at the end with pictures of the real soldiers, and then get massive dough and avoid any and all criticism. Sorry Hollywood, I won't fall for this bullshit. Lone Survivor gets a 3/10. &#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may be one of the best over the last couple of years. It is well shot, with crisp, colourful scenes and gorgeous mountainous landscapes that amply serve to show that Afghanistan is far more than a mostly flat dust-bowl like Rambo III portrayed it as. Good sound quality, with plus points for the solid thuds that storm rifles deliver instead of the pea-shooter sounds that far too many war and actions movies of the past have given these weapons of war. The movie even packs in a few good "shock" moments that genuinely had me jump out of my seat - thats a rare one for me.There are many harsh criticisms of this movie here on IMDb, most of them giving it a 1/10. I do not believe that such a rating is in any way justified, and that that is the result of personal opinions coming in the way of sound judgment. Some criticisms are however worth mentioning: Primarily that, while the movie is hardly a case of "the American Supermen return home in Glorious Victory after mowing down hundreds of Afghan savages", it did annoy me that every shot that the SEALS landed on the Afghans had them go down just like that (without even using the classic trope of "bad buy took a bullet and looks dead, while reaching for gun right next to him..."), while the protagonists of the movie takes loads of punishment by the way of bullets that tear into them, RPGs raining down on them and shell shocking them, rolling down cliffs and getting everything from scraped to concussions. And no, it's certainly not like some claim that they merrily jog and fight on after taking so much punishment, but you do have to suspend disbelief when watching a movie like this. If not, almost every war movie ever must be bombed down to low grades based on the impossibility of whatever the actors in it do.Another objection is that the movie is the usual USA-Patriotic-GungHo stuff. I disagree with this. While I certainly agree that it can easily be INTERPRETED to be the usual of this tripe (and it is an honest question: Can Americans at all make non-patriotic war movies?) the patriotism seems low-key in this. The intro with the footage of ultra-though SEAL training is claimed to be an advertisement for the US elite forces. I disagree. I saw it as a simple intro to how tough material a soldier than ends up in the elite ranks, has to be made of; it is a decent atmosphere-setting intro. Also, how patriotic is it to see a country's soldiers cut to shreds, or go down in a blazing inferno? Or do we have to justify that interpretation by claiming the "glorious death" angle with the heroes interred in Arlington with all the other dead heroes, while entirely neglecting their gruesome deaths? Come on! The last objection I'll mention here is that the movie is at odds with both the written story of the survivor, AND of the events as they likely occurred. I do not deny this at all. However, this is not a war documentary; it is a story told though an action-packed lens. Again, it means that to make an effective tale, artistic freedoms must be used. The scriptwriter and director does that here. This should come as a surprise to no-one.All in all, it is a good movie, but far from perfect. Very watchable, and recommended, unless you can't stomach anything that can be even slightly be interpreted to be army/patriotic propaganda.And if you must ask, I'm not at all a flag-waving American rooting for its heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not like the MOVIE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie only knowing two things: 1: It's based on a true story.2: It's from the director of "Battleship".Knowing those two facts, I kept an open mind as to how the story would be told, and boy was I disappointed. It lacked the substance that other war/combat films (Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, Black Hawk Down, and American Sniper) had. It tried, and fell flat.The story of Lone Survivor in a nutshell is a very tragic story of very brave men who made the ultimate sacrifice with only one man left alive. A skilled filmmaker should have had no problem conveying that to the screen. This one did with weak character development, poor pacing, and (what looked like to me) a glorification of violence.I'm not bad mouthing the actual events that happened to these brave men. All I'm really saying is, these men deserved a better film than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brutal and Modern Take on Warfare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is an excellent movie and is one of the better war movies to be released this century. The movie has themes of survival and heroism as well as the Navy SEALS protecting their brother-in-arms at all costs, down to the final death. I liked the opening of the film where it shows a montage on just how tough training is and if you can complete training, you can do anything. The film also made me angry in regards to this failed mission. Communication was the key here and the movie made note that the army's communication systems may be faulty thus resulting in a failed mission. Peter Berg's film is about a mission, where four Navy SEALS led by Marcus Lutterel are tasked to capture or kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. However they are led into an ambush where the four men are pitted in the ultimate battle, on the precarious mountain ranges in Afghanistan, against the better-armed Taliban army. The film was well-acted as everyone got a piece of the puzzle. Mark Wahlberg was outstanding as the one of the leaders of the four men and he actually had a few tear-worthy scenes. Ben Foster had another standout performance as Axelson. Taylor Kitsch does a great job as Mike Murphy and under the bulk, Emile Hirsch likewise did a great job as Danny Dietz. Finally, Eric Bana is forever reliable as Commander Kristensen. Overall, Lone Survivor is a great war film and a powerful one at that. The movie focused mainly on the character development between the SEALS, so don't expect to get to really know any of the Taliban that well. The film has lots of action and because of the odds stacked against the SEALS, it made for a very tense watch. The movie is an unflinching, brutal take on warfare and is also very realistic. A sad, but an ultimately powerful film. I rate this film 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Two Cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who knows me (a silly thing to say on an anonymous message board) would probably be surprised that I'm about to write a review defending this movie.It seems that the majority of these reviews cannot give an objective perspective on the quality of the movie itself, but instead focus on using the review to lecture on their personal views of the war in Afghanistan, to comment on the sensibility of the soldiers making decisions most of us will never have to face, or to question the authenticity of Luttrell's story itself.For the record, I am about as left wing as it gets and don't agree with many US military decisions. I am also, generally, a fan of indie and art movies. I think that film, as art, should teach us something about life and leave us with questions to ponder. With all of that said, to the previous reviews, I would say JUST SHUT UP AND ENJOY THE MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS. Is the movie jingoistic propaganda? Yes, of course it is. The "good guys" are almost super human. They rarely miss a shot and make heroic decisions in the face of staggering odds. The "bad guys" couldn't hit the broad side of a barn and act as if they've never been in any combat before. Did the soldiers endanger themselves with their decision-making? Probably, but you are not capable of judging that until you are in that situation. Does the story seem exaggerated? Yes, some things seem implausible and glorified.I am admitting all of this and still saying, just enjoy the movie. As much as I have my opinions of the subject matter and as much as I am generally a fan of more intellectual material, I can still sit back and enjoy an action film now and then, which is exactly what this is. This is no SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or PLATOON. Is it as far to the fanatical as RAMBO or RED DAWN? No, but it's probably somewhere in between. To me, this is the modern equivalent of a John Wayne movie. The good guys always wear white and will always triumph in the end. War was never something to critique in those movies, it was a backdrop that created heroes, which is what this movie does. Once the action drops, it's non- stop and I never found myself looking at the clock once. I rooted for our characters, though I knew their ultimate fate.So go ahead and over-analyze the movie, but if you're capable of getting out of your own head for a couple hours and just enjoying a movie, there's a lot to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well done but Berg puts a little too much Hollywood in the action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) is the lone survivor of a mission in Afganistan. He, Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) are a four man SEAL reconnaissance team sent to track down a violent Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. The team has constant radio problems. They encounter 3 goat herders. After some lively debate, they let them go and try to escape the onslaught of Taliban forces.Director Peter Berg brings the book about the real battle to the big screen. The start is reminiscent of Peter Berg doing 'Friday Night Lights'. I think he even used similar musical cues. The four lead actors do a solid job. They're all good actors and they don't let their Hollywood flash outshine their roles. This is especially true for Wahlberg. He continues to improve as an actor.However Peter Berg does put too much Hollywood flash into the battles. After an hour, the movie's second half is overblown both in explosive flash and theatrical posing. The action has some great realism at times but at other times feels like a Hollywood affair. All in all, the action pushes over the edge a few times. The villagers are nice but there again, Berg puts in a battle where the helicopters come over the ridge just in time to mow down all the Taliban in a blaze of glory. This would probably work much better if the action is not overproduced and be more realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mighty Fine War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsAn emotionally inspiring and gripping film about courage, honor, patriotism, and brotherhood. "Lone Survivor" tells the tale of four soldiers fighting for survival behind enemy lines after a reconnaissance operation gets compromised by an unforeseen circumstance. How these bravehearts battle for their lives and how they push themselves beyond conceivable limits for the men they fight with form the rest of the proceedings. The intrepidness, tenacity, and willingness for sacrifice displayed by these brave souls leave us literally spellbound and humbled. I ended up saying to myself, 'I'm a very small human being and not all that important in the face of these great men. Whatever grand notions of courage I had about myself were quickly made to feel minuscule.'Since this is based on a true story (from a book by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson on a real-life mission of Marcus Luttrell and his fellow Navy Seal team comprising of Michael Murphy, Matt Axelson, and Danny Dietz), you shouldn't expect many unexpected twists. Anyways, the heartfelt nature of the content and the positive impact it has on us as viewers, is enough to keep us thoroughly engaged and even entertained. Plus, the veracious sources of the movie provide ample scope for some heart-pounding action and edge-of-the-seat thrills. Credit must be given to the Director, Peter Berg, who aptly adapts this heroic tale of unflinching camaraderie and irrepressible bravado. Berg's assured hand evokes a keen sense of pride and respect for our four protagonists. Along the way, he also escalates his standing as a Director of note be delivering a film that's leagues ahead of his erstwhile passable fare.An inspiring war film with so many action scenes demands strong support from the technical departments like editing, cinematography, special effects, and sound, and "Lone Survivor" astutely delivers on all these accounts. Performances wise, all the actors delivers true portrayals of their roles, which blend seamlessly with the script on offer. Mark Wahlberg puts in another act that does equal justice to his star value and acting credentials alike. He's ably supported by Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, and Emile Hirsch."Lone Survivor" is a gripping, inspirational, and heart-crunching film on bravery, honor, determination, loyalty, and camaraderie. It's certain to go down as one of the best war films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film like this can be a profoundly troubling experience. You know in advance that the US army aided the production, the filmmaker spent time with the SEALS in Iraq, the actors underwent weeks of military training, so it has much more verisimilitude than old westerns did about that time. The characters are not Dick Cheney types planning oil war on maps but rugged cowboys with a family back home, expertly trained to do a job. You take all their bonding and mastery of mind and apply to something completely senseless, killing. You have to juggle the fact it's based on recollection, that it's a film, and that some version of this, probably not far at all from what we see, did happen. You watch two hours of endless pain. You take in a revealing line in voice-over as our 'lone survivor' near the end muses something along the lines that 'brave men died on that mountain to uphold our feared reputation' and you know that it is in the end a reputation of fear. And you get to the end to see images of the real people with friends or in their wedding, just ordinary people, not Rambos, all this still ahead of them.So even though the thing is simple, it elicits a complex response that I would rather confront than store away as propaganda or heroism. The fact is that it tries to perform a solid and precise job, as the men did, that the ugliness is both part of that world and gratuitous, war is, and that by its nature it dehumanizes. Did we need to see them throw themselves off cliffs like rag dolls not once but twice? But presumably that's what happened and that's how dehumanizing war is. We see them shelled and shot at, four guys against a hundred. A sense of injustice wells up and who are we to direct it against? They're fighting faceless Talibans, killing scores with a single bullet yet themselves surviving. But of course that's what the SEALS would see from their end, faceless enemies, and that's how deadly they are. And in retrospect of all that happens, the humane decision to let the Taliban goatherds go registers as woeful mistake, perhaps: they should have snuffed them. The film takes care to insert 'good' Afghans after all, a whole village of them, which also apparently happened.We could say there's no need for a film like this, but then we have the parting images to remind us this is all part of the narrative of who some people are, the celebration of courage and sacrifice as substitute for loss.Granting all this, there's still no room in my narrative for something like this. We enter the lives of some people in a certain moment in time to live through a certain revealing transition, it's what all films do. But history takes a few turns that you can inhabit and leave just bruised by blind necessity, nothing revealed beyond the fact that we can endure it. The real tragedy for me is evoked by the home video of a sergeant's wedding, a few seconds in the end credits, dancing with his bride, slicing cake and kissing, and it's such a tremendous waste that he should go half the world away to blow himself up and all the film can do is retrospectively celebrate a heroism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollow War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something just doesn't click with Peter Berg's Lone Survivor. It seems empty, a hollow movie that should have been filled in with care and concern for its main characters. Instead, more time is devoted to combat sequences?which are admittedly well done?than to any sort of character development.Lone Survivor tells the true story of Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of a failed Navy SEAL mission, "Operation Red Wings" in the mountains of Afghanistan in 2008. Mark Wahlberg plays Luttrell convincingly, but his character isn't given much to work with. He has no solid back story, so the audience can't really connect with a familial side of him. Instead, all we know of Marcus is his love for his fellow soldiers, and we can cheer him on as a leader and warrior.Berg (who directed and co-wrote) takes his time getting to the actual battle, which comes as the result of a bungled covert surveillance/capture-or-kill mission. Luttrell and three other SEALs have their location given away and are soon surrounded by Taliban fighters. This is where Lone Survivor is at its best: the action sequences are well-staged, compelling, and easy to follow, despite a rapidly moving camera and tricky terrain. Once the action begins, it rarely lets up. However, the film's first forty-five minutes or so are combat-free, and one would think Berg would invest this time into developing characters and making the audience really feel the sense that these men have something at home worth fighting for. However, he chooses to attempt this through forced dialog (one character explains to his significant other back home that he has to "make that money" or something of the sort) and rather bland situations. By the time the combat begins, we really only care about the bond forged between our four heroes, and we can only care as much as for anyone we just met a half hour before. By titling the film Lone Survivor, we expect casualties. We know that only one man is making it out of this mission alive, and Berg could have framed the looming sense of dread a bit better. Instead, he prefers long, drawn-out deaths, which seem somewhat sadistic at times. I understand that war is all hell, and that in a real-life setting, there's no cut-away from the harsh brutalities of death. But one SEAL's death in particular seems like cinematic overkill. In other cases, Berg eschews the generally gritty look of the film for fog-filtered, picturesque, slow-motion deaths which come across as stagy and shallow.Lone Survivor is a well-made war movie, albeit one without a clear message. It is a simple retelling of facts, too true to them at points and too dramatized at others. It is no Black Hawk Down, or even The Hurt Locker. Nonetheless, its actors turn in realistic performances in their depictions of soldiers (Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch are especially good) in a film that ultimately keeps its audience at arm's length from them, emotionally speaking.The most powerful aspects of Lone Survivor are its bookend montages of footage of the real SEALs involved in Operation Red Wings. I wonder if it would have been a better decision to have simply produced a documentary with the real Marcus Luttrell chronicling his amazing journey. It may have paid better tribute to the brave men involved in the battle than Peter Berg's Lone Survivor.</fullReview>

American soldiers are stupid to boot apparently. poor decision making skills, poor life choices altogether, poor wage for certain death and poor everything else.. the Afghani (or tali-ban terrorists)are apparently a mindless, one shot die nation, with poor aim, great park-our skills and NO knowledge of American tactics. the're the bad guys(supposedly)! you'd think they'd actually represent a threat to you, yet you do more damage to yourself with cliff diving than they do with guns.......... believable as hell, yeah and just goes to show what American views on other nations are.4. general hate-babble and advice... i know a few marines and one of my best friend's boyfriend is a USMC veteran.. he's okay. you know why? because he's RETIRED! this is pure "join the army, you'll be a hero!" propaganda. yea, you'll be a hero. you'll be dead, but you'll be a hero!!!! don't join the US military, any branch, you'd be signing a certain death contract. and unless you are a dumb, uneducated, blindly patriotic, totally brainwashed American.. DON'T watch this crap. oh, i'm from Slovenia. for most of you that don't know, that's in EUROPE. and that is the continent you haven't physically invaded yet, just with your globalization and capitalistic damn views. with that, i'm trying to show you just how far away people still think you're a sad, stuck up, egotistical, uneducated, unethical, un-SMART nation.5. effects and some better movie suggestions... the whole action aspect and effects and all those things are done, i must admit, very good. thats the only reason why it got 3 stars from me. and because i love(mostly) action and war movies. if you want a really good one, go see black hawk down, saving private Ryan, where eagles dare, Kelly's heroes... etc. i could go on and on.don't hate me just because i speak the truth, Americans.</fullReview>

This piece of propaganda really takes it over the top with the emotional manipulation through acoustics, somehow ? making you feel 'good' watching people blow each other to kingdom come.The Taliban was invited to Sugarland Texas in 1999 - and they came. Cheney of Halliburton as well as what is now Chevron asked if they would be a problem for the Kazakhstan-Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline. The Taliban opted NOT to take Chevron's money. The Taliban didn't just show up overnight hating America, no, corporate oil provoked these people. This movie is a commercial for Chevron period.I have to seriously wonder who funded it. A movie showing that Pat Tillman was killed by friendly fire and that the US Department of Defense covered it up and Bush ? ironically USED Tillman's death to rally support FOR Afghanistan.In so many ways Tillman's death may very well have paved the road for these unfortunate souls to even find themselves in the hills of Afghanistan with rattlesnakes and tribal elders armed with ground to ground stinger missiles provided by Casey era CIA.There is a HIGH probability the ground to ground missiles being used as depicted in this film would have been provided by the US CIA in a different era, and era where the very men here being painted as evil ? Were actually allies and used by Reagan, Bush, Casey era. I do not recommend watching this rally around the flag garbage. In no was did US presence in Afghanistan help matters, if anything ? There is now an entire generation that only can know the United States as if it's there to blow peoples heads off. DoD should have had US troops building schools, and protecting them, we'd have an entire generation now of kids nearly 12 years old - young adults - who would have a very positive view on the world, including the United States. So ironic that in Sugarland Texas ? The Taliban expressed they didn't want western oil money, they just wanted schools, roads and power lines. This movie fails to value life first before ideology. The only thing worse than this movie is the truth - and that is- US presence in Afghanistan was about securing the IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW - Kazakhstan- Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline. It seems over 200 BILLION barrels of oil have been validated in Kazakhstan. That's 20 trillion dollars at $100 a barrel. 20 trillion dollars is enough to 'just have to get elected in 2000'. It's all oil - and this movie fails to show how human lives have been disrespected on ALL sides here - all in the name of power. With 20 trillion dollars ? You could buy the next 100 US presidencies, in fact ? ALL land mortgage contracts in the United States used to total only 12 trillion before the regulatory failures - the FBI financial crimes unit warned the Bush White House admin of the forthcoming mortgage crisis and they opted to do nothing about it, in fact, Bush took over 500 FBI FC unit agents and put them on 'terror' assignment. The money to be harvested in adjacent Kazakhstan ? is enough to buy the ENTIRE United States over TWICE. These Navy Seals are as brainwashed as the North Koreans. They haven't figured out they're just RENTED by the oil corporations. If it wasn't for what is now Chevron ? We wouldn't have had WTC attacks. Cheney threatened to destroy the Taliban in 1999. It seems he found his excuse through WTC.And in the end ? ISI who the CIA was been doing business with for some time ? turns out to be housing Usama Bin Laden in a nice abode in Pakistan under ISI protection. Too bad the US Naval Intelligence command couldn't get BETTER intel from the CIA. Clearly Porter Goss could care LESS about US Navy renta-seals.US should have been building schools and protecting the next generation to break the religious extremist's hold on the next generation. I sense in the West the extreme Christian right is analog to the Taliban.The absolute worst would be would be if there is some pro Christian message in this movie. So far, I've not seen any. Remember, former CEO of former Blackwater Erik Prince stated Blackwater's contracting with the DIA and DOD was a 'crusade for Christ'. It doesn't get much sicker than that. I PRAY religion isn't part of the US Navy Seals morning rituals, seeing it on Alaska Gold Rush and US Marines in Iraq is short of wondering who's been brainwashed more into a phony pretense of a religious war. At the end of the day the LAST thing you want to see US presence in Iraq OR Afghanistan turn into is a religious war. Who knows, maybe that's why the 'war on terror' just seems - misdirected. Perhaps OTHER than oil profiteering and abuses of third world nations driving it ? Perhaps there really ARE people who decorate the conflict in religious context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are expecting something on the level of Shooter you will be disappointed. I was. The book was excellent. This movie is ho-hum. Needed a better screenplay, director, character development, you name it. Never involved me. Marcus Luttrell deserved a better homage. Mark Wahlberg doesn't shine - no one does. A waste of time, talent and money. Fluff. Even the scenery is questionable. It looks like it was shot in the Rockies or Idaho with Aspen trees. The first half of the book is omitted - except for a little slide-show prologue - no Seal training, no sniper training at Pendleton. No reference to how Luttrel was focused on the Seals as a young boy in Texas. It could have been so much better. Not sure if it could be worse.Is everybody on this board from Colorado? This is a terrible movie. With a terrific book to start from the director produced nothing. No character development, no sympathy, no catharsis, no nothing. It belongs on video. It is not worthy. It is not worthy. READ THE BOOK and then you judge. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I am a patriot. Two sons in the USMC. But filmmaking is filmmaking and this is not worth your time. Another director, another script - this does a disservice. Piece of junk. If there was a zero possible or minus numbers.... I give it a 1. Rather watch the Simpsons in Chinese or a rerun of Gidget. Sorry to all you fans but let's call a spade a spade. This is bad filmmaking. What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film somehow managed to fly under the radar. There is a quality to it that puts it into the realms of Braveheart. War propaganda? Perhaps. If the story had roles swapped would it still be as good? Probably not.War is the by product of mans ego. The brutality has been captured to portray the horror of what those that put their lives on the line go through. More effective than American Sniper the essence of four men's battle, from start to finish, to stay alive and save their 'brothers' ahead of themselves is tough to watch. A true story which is unrelenting, sometimes difficult to relate with and thoroughly well put together and as realistic as it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treated with care, but in the wrong care (**1/2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to be upfront and admit that I've had a difficult time formulating a response to this film. On one hand, it was a very solid, albeit Hollywood-ized version of a true story. On the other hand, the actual true story was different in important ways, and finding out about the inaccuracies after seeing the film frustrated me to no end. I'm left feeling very neutral and blasé about the whole thing- for if it's not real, does the film really honor those that lost their lives? Does it really show us the true nature of heroism if it's partially fabricated? "Lone Survivor" works in some ways, but there is no getting around the cynical feeling that comes from knowing creative license has trumped the truth.The film is based on Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell's account of the events surrounding Operation Red Wings in 2005. As the film explains, this mission's intent was specifically to assassinate Ahmad Shah, who was (is?) allegedly an Al Qaeda/Taliban general, responsible for multiple U.S. deaths, and was/is considered a generally abhorrent guy. The plan was to have a team infiltrate the camp where Shah was located by crossing the rough terrain of the Afghan mountains and take him out quietly. I like how the film takes its' time showing the prelude to the chaos, which allows us to see how harsh the environment is in Afghanistan, and how difficult it must have been to navigate on foot as a foreigner. Also, the way the film sets up how this team clicks, or for that matter how all Navy SEALs click, was portrayed well. These men are put through so much mental and physical stress to become SEALs that it's not at all surprising how close-knit these men are. They're brothers through and through, and there was never a doubt about that.I'm sure former and current military personnel would say that missions can be meticulously planned, but still go wrong due to unforeseen variables. "Lone Survivor" has just that type of variable in the form of goat farmers, who just happen to be wandering in the same area where the SEAL team is resting before carrying out their task. It seems innocent enough- until a Taliban communication device is found on one of them. It brings about a terrible dilemma- can these soldiers complete their mission independent of this threat, or do they have to break the rules of engagement to go forward? The decision they make decides the team's fate and sets the stage for the rest of the film.It can be assumed by his demeanor that the younger, sinister-looking farmer will go back to the village and tell Shahd's men about the team. If he does, the mission is compromised- if the soldiers tie them to trees, it's possible they'll never be found, or eaten by wildlife. It's an impossible decision, but one SEALs are trained to handle. I did wonder why there was even a discussion about the decision- after all, they're robotic in their responses for a reason.Once the fighting began, however, disbelief crept in. Sure, I bought the expertise of the SEALs, but as others have been keen to mention about the last half of the film, the body can only take so much. It's hard to believe anyone, even the best of the best like SEALs, could absorb multiple gunshot wounds, and multiple falls upon sharp, jagged rocks, then keep fighting. Does SEAL training prepare individuals to do what seems like the impossible? I don't have an issue suspending disbelief in the right situation, though, and when I finished, I accepted the film as a slightly overproduced, occasionally aggrandized version of a true story.Then I read stuff. Specifically, I read a Slate.com story (which referenced the site OnViolence.com) that detailed what the inaccuracies of the film are. I understand why creative choices are sometimes made to dramatize true stories; what I can't understand are conscious choices to make already brave individuals appear superhuman, and fabricate events that are already monumental. Director Peter Berg was quoted as saying "We never set out to do something non-Hollywood or Hollywood. We just literally told the story." If they did just 'tell the story', why does the film depict Luttrell as flat-lining as the film opens and closes, when the apparently reality was quite the opposite, per Luttrell? Why does the film invent an old Afghan villager that brings the news to the U.S. base that Marcus is hiding in one of their homes, when the truth is that U.S. forces found him while scouring the mountains? Why did the film invent the entire last battle sequence in said village? Why is that Luttrell was on set, moving the actors around to get them in more accurate positions according to the real event, yet he hasn't said anything publicly about the fabrications?I think I know the reason, and I feel sad for it. Films like "Act of Valor" and "Zero Dark Thirty" have been successful, in part for attempting to accurately reproduce the military experience on film. I haven't seen either film, so I cannot comment on the quality of either, but I sense "Lone Survivor" is capitalizing on their success. Cynically, I can't help but think that someone in charge of this project saw dollar signs, and those spoke much louder than giving a voice to this story, or a greater audience to help honor the fallen from this mission. Even Wal-Mart is selling a tie-in documentary about the life and times of Lieutenant Mike Murphy (not a bad thing, but it raises my skeptical flag). As a straight Hollywood film, this works just fine, but discovering the inaccuracies behind the final product disappointed me. I feel the true stories of our military heroes are perhaps more important, and thus should be depicted without grandiose creativity. It's enough that they did what they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Lone Survivor" exhilarates and hits hard and home.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the time war movies use the bogus excuse of honoring our soldiers to show non-stop violence and explosions. Lone Survivor" gets a little carried away with the action, but it truly does honor the brave men and women who sacrifice for our great country. Directing the he best war film since "The Hurt Locker," Peter Berg reenacts the Operations Red Wings mission in Afghanistan of 2005 where four Navy Seals were to investigate an area where a highly notorious Taliban leader was seating his army. Little did they known there were over two-hundred Taliban they had to face off one by one. Mark Wahlberg in one of his best performances plays real life Navy Seal Marcus Lutrell. Lutrell is a highly determined body of persistence who will do anything to save his brothers. In polarizing warfare scenes shot beautifully with furious energy and depth, Peter Berg reminds us that the ultimate sacrifice Navy Seals give is truly rigorous and relentless. With devastating acting by Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Taylor Kitsch, we experience a gruesome battle with entertaining and intense combat that tests the morals and diligence of four honorable and brave human beings. Berg fills the screen with exciting sights and sounds tied in with overwhelming intensity. Despite the highly fantasized outcome of the operation and the added in extras to add some spice to the pot, we still get a clear perspective of what Lutrell and his team went through. With moral questions to provoke the mind and shocking detail on brutal warfare, "Lone Survivor" hits hard and pays tribute to those that serve our country.</fullReview>

If you are looking for a movie that is an exact enactment of the true war, it becomes a must watch. No matter what your nationality is, once through, you will have a sense of respect for the soldiers in war. There are a few scenes so brilliantly executed, that my eyes teared up. Unlike the usual American war films, the movie wears a shade of realism. Michael Murphy though not the highlight of the film, became a hero for me.

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie must watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contain spoilersI'd give this movie 8.5 stars but have to round up out of the absence of half grades. The movie is very solid and based on a strong real story. I certainly would recommend watching this to anyone, any audience. The movie is superb but itself is a soul wrenching horror story that shows how the price of incompetence in war is death. I was seriously motivated by the movie to get this off my chest here. It's hard to imagine a more horrendous pile up of tactical mistakes made by the SEALS and the rescue mission. I have no beef with the decision to release the hoarders by the SEALS, there was really no choice as this indeed was bound by the rules of engagement. But to not try to tie everyone up and release just the oldest - and the slowest - hoarder, thus getting more time to escape or hide. Or openly argue about the direction of retreat and just go there then and wait, instead of changing direction to try and get lost in the woods, fully realizing they would be followed shortly after. Or giving up high ground in a fight (although there SEALs might had no choice already). Or performing air drop in a clear war zone without trying to generate any kind of suppressing fire, even by firing own firearms, knowing plain and square there is Taliban on the ground, like it was a picnic hike. And not following up with a search for survivors, if any (where is the "no one gets left behind" of the US Army we hear so much about in Hollywood blockbusters?). And finally the worst of them all - not taking up a defensible position while it was abundantly clear that the clash with Taliban was extremely likely. In aftermath while watching the things unravel horrendously, it appears that every single decision that had to be made was made wrong by the company leaders, and the loss of life is horrendous. The operation itself is a disaster, with 19 marines dead. The only thing you can say while watching this is Oh My God. Very sad and painful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The usual gungho Hollywood schlock - cowboys and indians updated but no better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer here on IMDb who says he is a former SEAL assures us that the depiction of the 'frogmen', from their unkempt appearance and painted weapons to their living quarters and ops room is almost 100pc accurate. Well, hallelujah and yippee!He goes on to say that all SEALs and former SEALs have an eternal pride in fallen comrade who are never forgotten. Nothing wrong with that, in my book, but the circumstances in which they fell are often, as here, highly dubious and questionable. But more of that later. First to the film.In the second decade of the 21st millennium filmmaking techniques and equipment have come on apace: hand-held cameras add rather spurious realism, make-up is more realistic, we can now simulated a chap having the back of his head blown off with amazing verisimilitude (as far as I know - I've never actually seen it happen in real life), and computer editing and computer graphics are a godsend.But strip away all the modern equipment and techniques and this film was first made - and often since remade a hundred times - over 50 years ago: in those days the 'baddies' were what were then called 'red indians' and were slaughtered without ruth, and the 'goodies', the ones we were expected to cheer for, were the US army cavalry. Now the 'baddies' are the Taliban, who are slaughtered with ruth, and the 'goodies' are Navy SEALs, the 'frogmen'. And we're still expected to cheer.True to the cliché, the indians/Taliban baddies are nasty cutthroats who are apparently prepared to die in their hundreds for no obviously good reason, whereas the US cavalry/SEAL goodies are made of true grit and although most of them die - except, of course, the film's main star - they die bravely. And Lone Survivor is true to the cliché. That there's less to the film than meets the eye - despite the former SEAL reviewer who claims it is almost 100pc accurate - because quite obvious when, as has to happen in a film of this kind, things start to go wrong.The opening credits show us SEALs in training, in hard training, the sort wimps like you and I could never survive and we are then treated to an interminable number of minutes to the almost statutory 'bonding' scenes: virtually incomprehensible dialogue and loads of brotherly joshing which shows us that the well-trained killing machines 'care' about each other.Yet they don't, or they don't according to Lone Survivor: at the first hint of trouble they fall out and bicker, can't decide what to do, the chain of command is ignored and generally set the scene for screwing things up.There follows what is really nothing but an extended gunfight in which a great many Taliban get themselves killed - Lord, how stupid they are! - but our band of brothers soldier on and on and on, throwing themselves down rocky hillsides in an attempt to escape despite all being shot and wounded several times in multiple places.Finally, the last act in the cliché: our star, by now the 'lone survivor', is taken into the care of a 'good' Indian/Afghani and cared for, and this chap and his villagers are so noble that they are prepared to lose their lives just to protect 'the American'. Well, pass the sickbag. The film ends with the US cavalry/Apache gunships riding in to rescue the film's main star in a scene in which a further several hundred indians/Taliban are slaughtered. Overall, this is the laziest of lazy filmmaking and offensive claptrap.As for the politics of it all, here's a question: what right does the US think it has to invade a country such as Afghanistan? And why is it so surprised that 'the natives grow restless' and do all they can to kick out the invader? And why does the US expect the rest of the world to cheer on their gungho guntoting knuckleheaded idiots.Were any part of the US actually to be invaded, you could bet your bottom dollar that the US 'natives' would resort to their armoury of weapons to try to kick out the invaders. So why the surprise when the Taliban does the same?The final offence is, of course, that Lone Survivor was made in Hollywood to try to multiple the sums invested several times over as suburban nerds and geeks go along to their multiplex to wallow in bullshit. But then what's new. If you like the usual kind of gungho jingoistic crap, this film is for you. If you have read what I have to say and agree with me, give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Even Death Could Have Killed Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the 10th of January 2014, a movie hit the theaters that would leave everyone in the crowd shocked, crying, and filled with pride. This movie is Lone Survivor directed by Peter Berg and based off of a series of true events that were put into a book written by Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of tale. The movie starts off with real footage of United States Navy SEALs boot camp and everything it takes to make it before they are granted the honor of calling themselves a Navy SEAL. The focus is then shifted to the mission presented to the unit which is a Taliban leader Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Asami) who is responsible for the death of over twenty United States Marines, as well as any villager or refugee who was aiding the American forces. In response to these deaths, a United States Navy SEALs unit was ordered to execute a counter-insurgent mission to capture or if needed take out Shah. The team assigned to the mission comprised of four SEALs: team leader Michael P. "Murph" Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), snipers Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and Matthew "Axe" Axelson, and communications specialist Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch). The team is flown into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they must make a trek through several mountains in order to arrive at their designated location, a small town miles away that Shah has overtaken. Along the way they find themselves accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and his two teenage grandchildren; one of which clearly shows his hatred of the U.S. SEALs and it thus assumed to have Taliban connections. After a heated conversation between the SEALs they agree to let the unarmed men go and quickly backtrack into the mountains in hopes of getting coms up for extraction. However, no matter how far they backtracked it wasn't enough and they were confronted with hundreds of Taliban men armed with rocket launchers, full auto rifles, and countless grenades. The next hour of the film turned into one of the longest and most intense ground force combat scenes of the last decade. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the gunfight from jumping off the edges of cliffs, at least five gun shot wounds each, and countless broken bones. In the end, all but Marcus Luttrell lives to tell the tale of the brave men, both navy SEALs and the villagers that aided him in his escape. The movie wrapped up with a four minute montage of videos and pictures of the real men involved with this tale as well as an epilogue to what happened to the survivors afterwards. The overarching theme of this movie is what the will to survive can drive a person to do as well as what the hope to make change happen can make a person risk in order to see it done. The men in this story take an unimaginable amount of damage to their bodies and are still able to take out about &#x2153; of the Taliban forces themselves. Such bravery is demonstrated when Danny Dietz treks up a hillside swarmed with Taliban in order to get the coms up, alerting the base of their location. On top of earlier injuries, he is shot six times before making it to the top and the final shot caused Dietz to fall to his knees, but no further, he did not fully fall to the Taliban, even in death. The other theme of this movie is the drive to make change happen as well as the overwhelming kindness of a people. Towards the end of the movie Marcus was found by a local Pashtun village leader, Mohammad Gulab (Ali Suliman), who takes in Marcus and attempts to nurse him back to health. After a few days the Taliban arrive with the mission to execute Marcus, but were driven away by Gulab and the villagers. However, they planned on coming back in full force with Shah leading the assault. Gulab knows that they cannot hold Shah's forces for long, so he sends an unidentified mountain man to hike the fifty plus mile journey to the nearest American air base. Why did these people risk everything to help an American SEAL who has taken the lives of their fellow brethren? Because the villagers of that town were bound to help Marcus as part of a traditional code of honor known as Pashtunwali, a true act of selflessness that Marcus could never fully repay. This movie stunned everyone in the theater I was in. During the montage and epilogue at the end, not one person got up to leave; everyone was still as a mountain, and tears were cascading down everyone's face--even the toughest of men were not afraid to cry. We witnessed a movie that could only show a glimpse into the bravery that those men had, and that small glimpse was more than any of us thought possible for a human being to muster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Navy SEAL heroics ably highlighted in unwinnable Afghan imbroglio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Long Survivor' is based on the book of the same name, which recounts a small Navy SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance mission to track (and eventually eliminate) Ahmad Shah, a dangerous Taliban commander already responsible for the deaths of a coterie of American soldiers along with Afghan allies. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of his fellow four man SEAL team who make their way into the mountains of the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan.The film is divided into three main sections. The opening expository section introduces us to the Navy SEALS as they participate in grueling training to go out on these extremely difficult missions (the opening footage appears to be taken during real basic training). It's a little difficult figuring out who's who but the dialogue between the soldiers feels like it's real.We break into Act II, when Luttrell and three compatriots locate Shah while they're hidden in the bush on the side of a mountain. A sheep herder along with two boys run into the soldiers who now have to decide whether to kill, tie them up or let them go. Ultimately, it's Lutrell who argues they'll be charged with war crimes if they kill the Afghans, so they take their chances by letting them return to the village and then retreat up the mountain.The bulk of the movie involves the four Americans attempting to fend off a big number of Taliban soldiers who are heavily armed with machine guns and rocket launchers (one of young sheep herders is seen scurrying down the mountain earlier, with the intent of alerting the Taliban).Throughout Act II, 'Lone Survivor' proves to be wholly an 'action' film. It's extremely well filmed and choreographed, as the Americans heroically resist against overwhelming odds. At times, they're forced to dive off cliffs and end up rolling down the side of the mountains, injuring themselves severely, but still managing to return fire. Meanwhile, they're unable to phone in their position to headquarters until one of the soldiers manages to get to the top of the mountain, where finally there is radio reception. Unfortunately he's immediately taken down by the Taliban, once exposed with no cover.In some ways, the folly of the initial surveillance mission is exposed. Once their cover is blown, the small surveillance team has no chance of winning against such superior numbers. Certainly, a larger force was needed in the area, to back up the team. Reinforcements do arrive in the form of two manned helicopters, but one is shot down almost immediately by the Taliban and the other is forced to retreat.Once all of his buddies are killed, Luttrell must make his way out of the area after dark. He's saved by a sympathetic Afghan villager who rallies members of his tribe who resist the Taliban who come looking for Luttrell. The Americans are alerted by a mountain man who brings a map of Luttrell's position at the behest of Luttrell's Afghan protector. In reality, the Taliban did not have a face off with the villagers, as the villagers outnumbered them significantly.'Lone Survivor' highlights the heroic actions of the Navy SEALS as well as the Afghan villagers who came to Luttrell's defense. Some critics found the film to be light on characterization but in truth, it's mainly an 'action ' film. Mark Wahlberg proves to be talented as a do or die military man along with his assorted comrades in arms. In the end, nothing is sugar coated here. In a sense, the film is symptomatic of our effort in Afghanistan where noble efforts end in failure, in an unwinnable Afghan imbroglio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phenomenal! That's one of the many words to explain this movie. Based on a true story, which is the saddest part of this film. The audience already knows what the inevitable ending will be because of the title.&nbsp;The characters were spot on. The Navy Seals: Wahlberg, Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster played their roles brilliantly. They acted so well that it seemed as if they were actually there, experiencing the action head on in real life. They all play their roles very carefully. Knowing that they have to play someone who was real and endured all of those events. Although Wahlberg was the lead, Kitsch took all of the stardom from playing the fearless captain.Although outnumbered by Taliban forces, the men put up a tough fight, all the way through to the end... Well of their lives. They all died with honor. The shootout sequence was filled with brutality, gore and heartbreaking scenes. It had the audience at the edge of their seat. Made them feel as if they could feel their pain through the screen.&nbsp;By the end of the film, it makes you appreciate not only the Navy Seals, but the other military people who are out there risking their lives as we sit here and not think anything about them. This was a heart racing film that will have an everlasting effect on myself personally.&nbsp;When the pictorial came at the end of the movie, it kind of brought the audience back to reality. To let them know that these men were real, they had families too, and they risked their lives to save their fellow Seals.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.The movie is very intense almost from the get go,you are following these soldiers in a dangerous area and are really hoping they will be safe.This is certainly one of Mark Wahlberg's most impressive performances to date,quite possibly his best,he is a very hit and miss actor,sometimes he's a great ,other times he's awful,but in this he is certainly outstanding,he really got in to his character and I really feel like he became his character,he wasn't just acting.Lone Survivor is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or war film. A group of soldiers set out on a dangerous and risky mission to find and possibly kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Best Performance: Mark Wahlberg Worst Performance: Alexander Ludwig</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I survived Lone Survivor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this review by saying, I have nothing but respect for all the men and women fighting for our freedom. Without these heroes, I couldn't be typing up this review. Thank you all for your service. Lone Survivor! Directed by Peter Berg, this movie follows a small squad of super elite, awesome soldiers who are on a mission to either kill or bag a ruthless Taliban leader. However, their mission quickly becomes compromised and all hell breaks loose as our four heroes try to fend off an army of Taliban grunts. I REALLY loved this movie, I haven't seen a more brutal, intense, testosterone filled movie this good in a while. What makes the movie so suspenseful doesn't only come from the incredible shoot outs that take place, but also because you really get involved with the characters in the movie. The opening montage of the training these guys go through perfectly set the tone of the movie. The action is shockingly intense, and the directing really puts you in the middle of these battles. I thought the performances were all around really good, it was cool seeing Emile Hirsch in a good movie again. Ben Foster and Mark Wahlberg were typically good, but it was Taylor Kitsch (Mr. John Carter of Mars)that surprised me with his chops. His character was very likable, as was all the other characters. The main villain doesn't get to much screen time, but even then you knew and felt this guy had to go down. When an action movie THIS intense, gives us great relatable characters to go on this journey with it makes for a great watch. The settings, cinematography, sound effects, and STUNT WORK are all amazing. There's a scene where characters are just rolling down a cliff to escape harm and it's PAINFUL to watch! You feel every bone crack. I can't find a fault here, the movies about 2 hours and you can NOT tell, it hits you with some character development and just exlodes for the next hour and a half without a moment to catch your breath. This is an exceptional film that I really adore. I give this movie my highest recommendation, buy this blu-ray!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kingdom on a 50% discount</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Peter Berg. I like his Rundown, The Kingdom, Battleship, and yes even his role in that Corky Romano film. But LS is just a let-down. Plot: what plot? A bunch of guys go in, most killed, with a lone survivor, the end. Yes there is gun fight, camaraderie, explosions, limbs, etc, but they all fall into this very linear and simple plot. You can see these things in Hellraiser movies, with a more complex story. Acting: they are already dressed like soldiers, with mud/blood/ammo on them. There is absolutely zero character development. Story: see plot. As long as they are not laughing and just acting hurt, it's sufficient acting for the premise. Effects: have you seen Saving Private Ryan? This is not better. Overall: this is a very disappointing film from PB. He has done better and more entertaining films. I am not certain why this movie got such a high rating at IMDb. Maybe some writers here are paid to praise. Due to the lack of plot here, while the actors in it did their best to act, this movie is a mere chapter of any war/shooting movie out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'You are never out of the fight'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/writer Peter Berg has translated Marcus Luttrell's and Patrick Robinson's fact based book into a film that is as spot on accurate as far as the training and extraordinary skills of the Navy Seals. The casting is excellent, the degree of uncomfortable banter is balanced well with the sheer terror of a covert op in a way that few directors and actors have been able to accomplish. This is a bloody, crude, harsh film to watch but the audience must be ready to accept that this is the way things were and remain in the multiple wars in the Middle East. And for what? The film begs the question. It is a story of survival and profound comradeship and it jolts us in just the right way.The film opens with a training camp for Navy SEALS, a fine way to set the tone for the story. The time is 2005, the place Afghanistan. Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg and his team ? Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt 'Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster) set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami After running into mountain herders and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare. Cut off from back support team (Eric Bana, Alexander Ludwig, Rich Ting, Jerry Ferrara, Scott Elrod, etc) the four struggle to survive against insurmountable odds. But is many ways the acidic cruelty of war is somewhat offset by the compassionate benevolence (Pashtunwali) by a group of Afghans who offer the lone survivor Luttrell succor and safety. Food for thought after the battle of the film is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wasn't sure about this film before watching, thought it might be a bit of a slow drama about how caring and brave US soldiers are in the face of adversity. And it's a true story so however the film depicts them, it must be true..In fact this film is about a group of soldiers getting shot the crap out of for over and hour. where in most films two groups of people shoot at each other, and bullets fly off the ground and rocks, but unless they land a fatal blow, people generally don't get hit, pretty much the opposite here, they get hit.. a lot. I mean they really did not have a good day up on that hill. And the hero of it all, was a local villager. Was a good film, and the slideshow of the end of the real people depicted in the film was good, especially the one of the 'lone survivor' and the villager that saved him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid war/survival flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based on the 2005 American operation in Afghanistan where four SEALs are dropped off near a remote Afghan village to survey a Taliban leader. The mission is compromised when the team runs into three Afghan civilians. Once the Taliban hears of their presence it's four SEALs against a veritable army. Can they make it out alive? I thought this was a solid war/survival movie. It's very realistic, except maybe for the scenes of the SEALs falling down the rocky slopes of the mountain a couple times (how could they even walk after such falls?). The first 45 minutes presents a nice build-up to the action and then it's intense throughout most of the rest of the movie.The final act shares something that I didn't know about this operation, which involves an Afghan village. I not going to say any more because I don't want to spoil it.This is just a straight war/survival flick based on a true story and on that level it works well. It's not American propaganda, as some criticize; it simply honors these courageous men, including some Afghanis. It may lack the depth and greatness of films like "Platoon," "Rambo" (2008) and the original "Apocalypse Now" (not that lame "Redux"), but it's still worth checking out.I can't give the film a higher rating because it's not something I care to see again anytime soon. It works for what it is, but it's too one-dimensional and there's one aspect of the story that wasn't true to the real story; it's an obvious cinematic addition to heighten suspense and it's just eye-rolling.GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who were the real heroes ??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This portrayal of 'Marcus Luttrell' is interesting viewing with any movie about human spirit overcoming the odds, being inspirational to watch. However many reviews this film has got are flattering to say the least. As a war movie, this hardly compares to 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Born on the Fourth of July' and as a biopic, it's obvious this has been largely exaggerated. The cast is good and they deliver based on what they are given, but the film ignores them as people and fails to allow the viewer to empathise with their sacrifice and the role of the villagers is also largely ignored. Without giving too much away, I hope when people watch this movie, they are able to recognise who the real heroes were. That's if we can get over our own prejudice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Lone Survivor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"War is Hell" and director Peter Berg wants to hammer that notion home. I've never been a huge fan of his previous work (I didn't go for the sickening vibe in Very Bad Things nor did I dig the silly plot twist in Hancock), but he comes into his own this time with the nominally accurate, horrifically violent Lone Survivor. In order to compromise his vision, Berg shot "Survivor" with searing, grunge guitar riffs as background music. He also supposedly consulted one of the soldiers who actually fought in the battle scenes this movie depicts (Marcus Luttrell who's book is the basis for the occurring events, makes a small cameo in the second or third scene, and who's character is portrayed by star Mark Wahlberg).As a limited Christmas Day release that follows four brave souls into the hardening backdrop of Afghanistan's mountainous forests and boulders, "Survivor" projects relenting, brutal battle sequences that aren't technically brilliant (like something made by say Steven Spielberg or Terrence Malick) but get the job done. Like I mentioned earlier, watching this thing gave me the feeling that this is as accurate a true story as one director could ever piece together (if you've seen the behind the scenes trailer, you'll know what I mean). The soldiers who all get shot four or five times each (I'm not kidding), are a bunch of tough tough hombres. After all, they were United States Navy SEALs and what you see them go through at the beginning of the proceedings, will make you believe that they can take anything.Based on true events that translate into this year's Black Hawk Down (basically what's on screen is one long, arduous battle sequence) and featuring a solid amount of storytelling sans the final act, "Survivor" focuses on four foot soldiers who during the War in Afghanistan, become part of a failed mission entitled Operation Red Wings. The four actors who all seem well casted, are played by Ben Foster (Matthew "Axe" Axelson), Emile Hirsch (Danny Dietz), Mark Wahlberg (Marcus Luttrell), and Taylor Kitsch (Michael "Murph" Murphy). While on their mission, they run into an old man, a young child, and a teenager (goat herders and possible Taliban sympathisers). Instead of killing them or tying them up, they feed them back into the population where they tell their own people. This ignites a full-on attack (basically it's four guys against what seems to be like a hundred enemies) and the film then becomes faithful yet squeamishly savage (enough blood and guts for three such war vehicles). Overall, the two hour running time with a quick introduction of all of its characters, tunefully glides by. Berg directs with a slick proficiency and a no-nonsense approach. If anything, this is his most mature work behind the camera. He's back in my good graces after seeing the stale fruits of his labor with his tainted, previous directorial outings.In essence, I've always preferred combat films that are set in different time periods like WWII and Vietnam. Lone Survivor however, makes me believe in the enjoyment of taking in and accepting, the modern day war epic. It's not cerebral or poetic like say, The Thin Red Line. And it's not quite Academy friendly like Zero Dark Thirty. It is however, a solid stepping stone in the career of one Peter Berg. His "Survivor" is solid despite being too accurate for its own good. The storytelling fumbles a bit when it wants you to focus on two different plot lines. Is this thing about a failed mission where people lose their lives, or is it about non-Taliban supporters taking a soldier into their care by providing that person with food and shelter? After you view Lone Survivor, it is you the viewer, who has to decide. Either way, I give this shattering, bullet-ridden parka a very high recommendation. It's your "survival" guide to careful, alert, and triumphantly watchful film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-recruitment movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good news about this tribute to a team of Marines who lost their lives in Afghanistan is that it is surely not going to lure any prospective recruits into making the same mistake. The plot basically comprises a long concatenation of ludicrous mistakes followed by payback in the form of nightmarish, impossible scenarios, and culminating in death for most of the participants.The bad news is that, as usual, this Hollywood war movie production portrays the Americans as always righteous and just and their adversaries as ignorant and evil. I did not buy the part about the "good" Afghans coming to the rescue of the lone survivor--at the price of all of their own lives? Doesn't make a lot of sense. Let's face it, even if they hated the Taliban, they also knew that the Americans were generally making their country far less stable and secure than it was before they arrived in 2001. The US military and CIA also killed their share of entirely innocent civilians, just as they did also in Iraq.I see that there are some pretty high ratings, which is in some ways surprising (see the good news, above), but in other ways not so surprising (see the bad news, above). The fact that the plot is loosely based on the recollections of the lone survivor of the incident probably causes patriotism and loyalty to well up in the hearts of some reviewers, leading ultimately to clouded judgment about the quality of this production.I will say that this is okay as a pure action film, if you happen to like to see lots of blood and guts. But this was pretty unrealistic. The soldiers survived falling down cliffs and multiple deep lacerations and bullet wounds before finally dying. In some ways, the melodrama smacked of staged WWW wrestling matches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, violent, but very moving NAVY Seal story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Berg, director of Friday Night Lights (2006), The Kingdom (2007), and Hancock (2008), takes a step into the war genre with this violent, but powerful war film, based on the true story by U.S Navy Seal, Marcus Luttrell. Lone Survivor takes you into combat in Afghanistan during Operation Red Wings, an failed mission on June 28, 2005, in which a team of four Navy Seals set out to the mountains of Afghanistan to track down and assassinate Taliban leader, Ahmad Shah. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, the Hospital Corpsman, Taylor Kitsch plays Michael Murphy, the leader of the team, Emile Hirsch plays Danny Dietz, the communications specialist, and Ben Foster plays Matthew Axelson, the sniper. The film follows these four Navy Seals on their harrowing mission through the mountains of Afghanistan that turns into a grueling fight for survival. Lone Survivor is one of the most powerful and harshest film I've seen recently, especially as its inspired on a true story. This brutally intense war film grabs you by the heart and never lets go. When the characters are on their mission, they face difficult decisions on the way, including a scene where they catch stray Taliban and struggle to decide whether to let them go or kill them. The way the film portrays these situations very realistically, and it shows the hardships of what the Navy Seals face during in their mission. The film also never decides what is wrong or what is right, which makes the film even more intriguing. The film almost has a bit of a feel to Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001). Then you have the huge combat scene that does not hold back on its harsh authenticity. As the the characters are in combat, you can literally feel their emotions and the pain they endure while fending off against the Taliban. Each time one of the characters is shot, killed, or taking a nasty fall down a cliff, it makes you cringe. This film pulls absolutely no punches when portraying the Navy Seals' combat experience, and it is very emotional and tear-jerking. Mark Wahlberg did a fantastic job as Marcus Luttrell, as well as the rest of the cast as their characters. They were very good at making their characters believable and portraying their bravery. These actors put on some good performances. This is one of the war films I have seen, it was very moving, very powerful, and left my family and I in tears. This is a film every needs to see. While it does get pretty violent and bloody, it makes you appreciate the sacrifices our military makes to protect our country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn good for patriotism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Berg directs and writes, based on Marcus Luttrell's book. Mark Wahlberg plays Navy Seal Luttrell, who with a hand picked group take a five-day mission across Afghanistan. The 2005 Operation Red Wings had its troubles and the Seals had one shortcoming after another. The mission was to bring down a Taliban boss Ahmad Shah(Yousuf Azami), who had more men surrounding him than expected. Some ill-fated choices end with Luttrell and his unit ambushed in the region of Hindu Kush. Berg presents moments of sacrifice and material costs of war as these brave men give an ultimate effort to try and save the mission. Rapid-fire exchange between the Seals and Taliban are graphic. Rules of engagement are questioned when the unit runs into a small group of goat herders.Special effects are superb. Vivid bloody war and strong pervasive language equal an R rating. And believe it or not some filming was done in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The majority of us would only recognize Afghanistan via CNN. Other players include: Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, Alexander Ludwig and Scott Elrod.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is, indeed, Hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never once have I wondered about the origin of the phrase 'rub some dirt on it.'For good reason, turns out.I don't know if word's gotten round to you yet, but 'War is Hell.'In the course of history, a piece of wisdom has never been so bastardized through overuse.We've all heard it before. Everyone's weary of the hippy-dippy words (including Yours Truly). But consider the implication of the trend. There must be a reason the phrase became so prolific.There is a level of indecency; an unpleasantness and lack of fairness that is so difficult to articulate, 'Hell' is the most accurate word for it.The phrase isn't 'War is suffering' or 'War is misery.' It transcends terms like torture, depression, fear, panic, pain or dread.In Saving Private Ryan, instead of Hell, they use 'F.U.B.A.R.'Similar high-caliber films like Platoon, Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Hurt Locker, Schindler's List, etc. all explore these hellish realities of war, and are currently the single greatest tool for conveying the inconceivable heartache that comes as a result.And you can add Lone Survivor to that iconic list of dark war movies. The film sort of shrugs and says, "Yeah, it's atrocious as ever. It really, really sucks."The one way I can describe L.S. is truly horrific. It's #5 on my 'Best Films of 2013' list and I'll tell you why.The story's compelling, timely and riveting. The plot takes unexpected twists, the images evoke a wealth of emotion and it's based on a true story.This film will constrict your insides and left me rattled. But it should, and if you can stomach some difficult imagery, and a healthy supply of darkness, check out Lone Survivor.But be careful of the spoilers below.What the movie does exceptionally well is accurately depict the almost inhuman combat prowess of navy seals. It opens strong with clips of actual seal training procedures.The film hooks right from the start when I see the trainees being drowned and brought back from the brink of death. Tough stuff, from the get-go.The falls down the cliff sides were graphic and not fun to watch.The depiction of the rookie seal, the tall buff blonde, is just the dark icing on a tall, treacherous cake. But one of the brightest spots in the movie is when he recites the froghopper mantra.Beside the tragic story on the surface, I like the subtleties as well.For example Mark Wahlberg's character (Marcus Luttrell) tosses in a fat lip of dipping tobacco for the mission. When he wakes up, he's left it in all night!Sure it's gross, but that's a badass character trait. That's not something regular dudes can do.Love that Marky Mark. He's always a winner. Might be cool to see him as a villain sometime.Some dust got on my contact lens when he thanks the Afghani fellow for helping him. And I love the little kid.All four of the main characters turn in remarkable performances. Taylor Kitsch as Mike Murphy, Luttrell's best pal, is an unknown but good.Emile Hirsch is spectacular, the best I've ever seen him. Since The Girl Next Door, America's been waiting for him to get a role like this. His performance is moving and deeply disturbing.And the same can be said for Ben Foster as Matt Axelson. His fate is equally horrific and tragic, and had me curling into a ball cringing as we watched his life fade away.That death scene is such an unsettling, powerful cinematic moment. As a physical specimen, his body endures all of the punishment it possibly can. Part of me wishes I had muted the last five minutes preceding his death, when his final breaths are presented in a macabre fashion.It's just so terrible, the way in which his head bobs about deliriously. He literally teeters on the brink of life while those bullets ricochet beside his face.The sequence is so dark; it's tough to form even an appropriate response.The obvious question is how much did they blur the boundary between fiction and reality? Well, I don't have an answer for you, but does it really matter whether they threw themselves down one mountainside or two?I've heard criticisms about the ending, which I find fair, but they certainly do not fall in line with my experience of the film. I thoroughly enjoyed the ending and never saw any of it coming. I'm on the edge of my seat the entire time.I enjoy Lone Survivor very much and highly recommend it.It's just a tough flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninformed Reviews of a Well-Informed Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After much anticipation of this film's release, I wasn't disappointed after watching it last night via Charter On-Demand. In fact, it ranks among the top 5 best "combat" endeavors I've seen, preceded only by timeless, military-based classics such as 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon', &amp; 'Full Metal Jacket'. Those thoughts aside, only one issue leaves me scratching my head this morning: reviewers casting their "tiny detail spotlights" on what they believe to be major tactical and equipment snafus ~ Or, what's 'possible' or 'impossible' for a Navy SEAL operator to physically or mentally accomplish during the course of a 2-hour dramatic performance.With military films in particular, prop details, factual precision, and period accuracy are invaluable. The directors and producers of 'Lone Survivor' did their Naval Special Warfare homework to ultimately accomplish the element of combat realism ~ their successes were even noted above in one review posted by an individual in a NAVSPECWARCOM support role ... Yes, someone who's actually *familiar* with the SPEC-OPS community, their tactics, weapons, uniforms, and overall cognitive / physical capabilities.Other reviews, however, were ill-informed critiques of what the SEALs "should have done", or how impossible it is for SEALs to kill most of the converging enemy personnel with "single shooting". Again, seemingly small details like these are critical in assuring we *believe* the experience on the screen, so here's why this film hit its mark, and why a few negative reviewers didn't: 1) Claymore mines and tripwires? Navy SEALs operate in small teams of 4-6 men. They're notorious for doing three things extremely well ... moving, communicating, and shooting. These three things are done quickly, with overwhelming aggression, violence, and deadly precision firepower. Historically, SEALs have been quick-insertion forces who don't linger around the campsite waiting on the enemy to arrive. SEALs are trained to act in a proactive manner, initiate the contact, neutralize the target / accomplish the goal, and get OUT. Given their small numbers, they have little use for additional weight on their backs in the form of claymore mines and rolls of detonation cord. Those types of armament are typically used by Army and Marine personnel with longer mission ranges. In the time it takes to set up these "claymores and tripwires", SEALs are back at the FOB smoking cigars, Skyping, and cleaning their weapons.2) Speaking of weapons ... It's 100% accurate that 4-6 Navy SEALs would "single shoot" (to use a reviewer's term) rather than sling 1000s of rounds of ammunition at an enemy hiding behind rocks and trees. SEALs are trained to kill quickly with a double-tap trigger method resulting in a "keyhole" pattern. This was evident numerous times during the mountain firefight scenes... the SEALs fired one well-placed head shot, then followed quickly with a second "finishing" body shot. When you're taxed with needing to enter and exit a mission area quickly, the last thing you want are 8 boxes of ammo weighing you down. A small team of SEALs, inserted quickly into an area saturated with enemy personnel, must kill with one or two well-placed shots to the head or center mass. These guys are the best shooters in the world, and the directors of the film nailed this one.3) With regard to weapons, once more ... the Taliban do love their AK-47 assault rifles, but rest assured -- an AK-47 doesn't utilize .45 caliber rounds (as noted in the same reviewer's post). A Kalishnikov (like that depicted in the film) operates on 7.62mm rounds, the equivalent of the civilian .308 caliber.4) Totes m'Goats ... or, leave them? Would a REAL Navy SEAL tie a goat herder to a tree, or let him go, or kill him, or take him along for a stroll to the top of a 9,000 ft. Afghan mountain? There are 4 or 5 of you, and potentially 100s of the enemy right down the hill. Arriving at the best possible solution to this problem (on the fly, under controlled stress, in the presence of your enemy) wouldn't be easy, and would likely have no clear-cut answer. As one SEAL notoriously said after a mission, "The best designed plans change after the first shot is fired." Are there elements of Hollywood dramatics in 'Lone Survivor'? Absolutely... such as multiple 200-foot ass-bashing tumbles down boulder-ridden hillsides, and several of the SEALs soaking up multiple gunshots from 7.62mm rounds (which normally would rip an arm off). But, kudos to the film-makers for an overall great war film, and depiction of our incredibly talented Special Ops warriors. Definitely a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word - superb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a trailer for Lone Survivor and thought "I do want to see that". Well, one thing led to another, long story short, I missed it at the cinema and had to wait until it was released on Blu-ray. While I waited for the Blu-ray release I had time to find out some more about the story behind the movie and I was very surprised. Operation Redwings was a covert mission to locate and eliminate a high level Taliban asset which required the use of U.S special forces, namely Navy SEALs. The mission on paper was rather simple, insertion, locate target, eliminate target and then extraction. We've seen before that even the best of plans can be thrown into turmoil by the simplest of things and Operation Redwing was no exception. What was meant to be a relatively straightforward mission descended into a real fight for survival which would seriously test the resolve of the soldiers embroiled within it.I knew this movie was helmed by Peter Berg, while I enjoyed The Kingdom,I thought Hancock and Battleship were both very average indeed and I really hoped that this film followed in the footsteps of The Kingdom in terms of grittiness and action, thankfully Berg has done just this. As I'm sure you've gathered the plot for the movie is simple, Berg has amassed great acting talent: Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell, Taylor Kitsch as Michael Murphy, Emile Hirsch as Danny Dietz, Ben Foster as Matt Axelson and Eric Bana as the unit commander Erik Kristensen, all of whom have the necessary gravitas and screen presence to grab and maintain the audiences attention. Berg has also clearly had good levels of participation from the military and ex-members of the special forces community to make the actors and the story as authentic as possible, as a result of their efforts, you don't have any issues believing the cast in their roles - crucial for a film of this type. Berg lets the tension build and build and build, as time passes you do have a sense of impending doom hanging over you as you agonisingly watch the leads try to get themselves out of the deep trouble they have found themselves in. As an audience member you will them on, want them to make it, want them to win, even though the writing is well and truly on the wall. At times salvation is so close, but then cruelly snatched away leaving you as an audience member drained. Berg keeps turning the screw right til the bitter end whereby the audience finally gets a pay off in an impressive action sequence. From such a simple premise Berg really has made a film which surpasses The Kingdom in terms of its grittiness, action and tension, something for which he rightly deserves praise.You'll infer from what I've written that I enjoyed this movie - I really did! This movie for me soundly demonstrated the will, strength and dedication of those who serve within the armed forces. It made me want to know more, more about the operation, more about those who served, more about those who didn't make it and why this event happened. There are some who have complained this movie is nothing more than a flag waving recruitment film for the military. It isn't. This movie shows war for what it is, brutal and uncompromising it also shows that even when things are at their darkest, there is always hope and salvation and it doesn't always come from where you'd expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor The key to surviving in the wilderness is to avoid going into the wilderness in the first place.Unfortunately, for the Navy SEALs in this action movie, it's part of their job.When a Taliban leader is located in a remote region of Afghanistan, snipers Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), along with spotters Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Michael P. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), are dispatched to a nearby mountain range.Waiting for a shot, the team encounters goat herders. Torn between killing them and freeing them, Luttrell eventually let's them go.Moments later, they're attacked by their targets. Outnumbered and out-gunned, the team makes their last stand.Based on the best-selling biography, this intensely violent and emotionally draining adaptation is a shocking example of military ineptitude, and the senseless valor it can produce.Besides, when pinned down by Islamic fundamentalist, it's time to start praying to Allah.

		<fullReview>I actually surprised myself by giving this movie 8 stars. Throughout the beginning half of the movie I was disappointing by certain aspects of the film. The characters were not nearly well developed enough and I never really felt I developed a bond with them. Mark Wahlberg is a fantastic actor though and his performance in the film manages to raise it above some shortcomings. The fighting is gritty and bloody and makes you wince at the brutality of it all. At the same time the number of enemies did seem video game like and somehow did not ring true. Others have said that the accounts changed over time in reality as well. The deaths of the US soldiers were over dramatized I think. There are some historical inaccuracies in the movie as well as fictionalized events. The battle at the end is one of them. From what I know there was more than enough material in the true story to make a great human story, and a great action packed war film as well. It was unnecessary for the film makers to through in things like the attempted beheading and helicopter assault at the end. It demeans the real life story to turn it into fiction in a film. Detailing the human story of Luttrell being saved by the Afghan villagers would have added an entirely new value to the film, but the producers seemed more intent on reaching a video game battle ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good word to summarise this movie is the word "intense". This must be one of the most intense movies I have watched in my life. Period. What makes this movie good in itself is psychological. The narrative of being surrounded by enemies, outnumbered, and out-firepowered compels us to watch the movie's developments intensively. Furthermore, since this movie is based on a true story, it makes the whole narration even more engaging. What you really need to give to this movie is the sheer minute to minute actions, which the protagonists are trying to fight their out. There is simply no let up to the intense level. What I am saying is not just some mindless shootings in movies that perpetuate for the reason of only prolonging the shooting scenes. But moment to moment attention captivate actions. Please watch it and you will know how intense this movie can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular portrayal of war and its outcomes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor stars Marky Mark (Wahlberg) as Marcus Luttrell, a Navy SEAL who is very well aware of the dangers which he and his team will face. And his Funky Bunch includes Taylor Kitsch and Ben Foster and a few more bearded musclemen. The story revolves around how Red Wings began and how Marcus's team fought to survive the Al-Qaeda leader Ahmad Shah's troops by using weapons, stealth and combat skills.The plot may seem simple and may sound repetitive for those who have seen such movies. But, still viewers will be glued to their seats because the film is very intense. You can actually feel what a tough life SEALS lead because the movie shows them in a realistic manner. They are not like Rambo or John Matrix who is always ready for action; instead they are Homo sapiens who get tired and injured after a great deal of fighting. The actors have given such realistic portrayals that apart from being wounded you can see that they are emotionally disturbed as well. Mark Wahlberg is good and has delivered some intense expressions. Taylor Kitsch delivered a fine performance (finally after giving us bad performances in flops like Battleship). Ben Foster has a small role but looks good. Eric Bana (who appeared in Black Hawk Down, another great war movie) also has a few scenes as a Lieutenant Commander.A major aspect of Lone Survivor which makes it a thrilling watch is its sound effects and brilliant cinematography. The battle scenes are wonderfully shot and the sound effects during these scenes can send chills down the spine. Hats off to Tobias Schlieffer (cinematographer) and the entire sound mixing team to make Lone Survivor an unforgettable experience. Finally, I will praise Peter Berg who had given disappointments like "Hancock" and "Battleship" for doing a remarkable job by directing this film.So my verdict for the Lone Survivor is that it is a movie which is a visual treat and is masterfully directed; an acute portrayal of troubled times during war. Added the sound effects, Lone Survivor is truly a memorable watch which gives the message of courage and will touch the heart of viewers and critics alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The morals of choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tale of morality and war.A team of American soldiers on an undercover mission in Afghanistan. They are well trained, prepared and have all the necessary equipment. As they advance towards the village of a high ranking Al-Qaeda they take cover in the woods. All seem to go according to plan.Then everything changes. An old man with couple of children, all goat herders, arrive on that very spot. Ideally the soldiers did not want to be seen but they are and thus capture the passersby. Whilst on some level it would make sense to kill them, the captain of the team decides to let them go knowing that their cover will be blown. Little did those soldiers knew how swiftly their situation will reverse. The released captives informed the fellow villagers in a matter of few moments and the US soldiers become utterly helpless and overwhelmed.The training and sophistication of the American soldiers proved futile to the street wise gut instinct of the Taliban.Moral choices and reversal of fortune become very intertwined. Just as audience we somehow anticipated the usual war/action film the whole situation and reality changes from controlled to desperate in a fight to the very end.Well worth seeing, both as a viewing experience as well as an initiator of a post film moral discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The effects and movie itself is very good. you see much fast scenes with violence but its not that hard. except the scene with the knife. the characters are hollow and the story itself is slow until half of the movie. i did expect it to start right at the beginning. it surely is a military propaganda movie with a lot of good sponsors. the story is tragic, but i think the real hero is not the soldier, its the Afghani who rescues him. you see him about 1-2 minutes in the movie and at the very end, you see a picture of him. without the story about the Afghani, it's just a simple action/war movie like we all have seen enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but the shouldn't have changed the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film with so many good points. The depiction of the harsh training for the SEALs is agonising to watch but when you see what they had to go through in combat (or even the hike in over such arduous terrain with such heavy loads) you realise why. Life with the SEALs back at base seems like an eternal frat party if everyone was an ultra-professional/competitive Olympic level triathlete with lethal combat skills. The dance scene was a little baffling although the 'Introduction/We don't care' bit was very true to life (actually I think Paton is a great dancer and very much the cliché SEAL in appearance, like something from the cover of one of those corny SEAL/SWAT romances on Amazon). The action scenes are great and super realistic although oddly I thought the scenes where they fall down the cliffs were more shocking than when they get wounded. The depiction of the Afghan villagers helping the SEALs was also good to see, so often they end up stereotyped as the bad guys, good to see that Hollywood realises there are factions and levels to Afghan society.Personally I think they overdid the whole 'Band of Brothers' aspect but that's part of the SEAL mystique and true to the book. Some people question why the Apaches were taken away to help the army convoy but no way could you justify not sending them to help troops in actual combat because they MIGHT be needed to support the much smaller SEAL team whose mission seemed to be going OK at that point. Personally if I was in their prisoner predicament I would have taken the shepherds with me until I was able to establish comms then tied them to a tree and stabbed them all in the calf. By the time they bit through their bonds and hobbled back to the village the team would be clear. But you can't second guess the man on the ground and you have to agree with Lutterall that even that would probably have earned them criticism from certain people who either have no understanding of their situation or hypocrites who don't even want to try to empathise with those at the sharp end. It's an interesting comparison to the British SAS mission Bravo 2 Zero which also had comms difficulties and was compromised by a goatherd. The bad point of this fim is the ending which is pure Hollywood. In real life Lutterall was helped to escape into the woods by the Afghan villagers and is discovered by an army search team. In the book the Taliban attack the village and are eventually repulsed with help of the army rescue force, the heroes personally dispatching the main villains, one in hand to hand combat in the worst possible Hollywood cliché. Why they chose to do that is unfathomable, Lutterall's story is amazing enough as it is, it doesn't require any such embellishment. Another inaccuracy is the fact that Lutterall never witnesses the rescue helicopter being shot down but that's forgivable for dramatic purposes. Some controversy arises about the number of enemies the SEALs faced, some saying hundreds, others putting it as low as single figures. As always the truth probably lies somewhere in between, the Taliban and various elements who wish to criticize the film wanting to play it down, those who wish stress the heroism of the SEALs/aircrew wanted to elaborate it.All told excellent film, really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Alone Survivor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although based on a true story, LONE SURVIVOR, especially during the riveting first half, plays out like an old school/body count war film. The soldiers are properly introduced during the first fifteen minutes before the 2005 mission OPERATION RED WINGS: to take out a Taliban chief within an obscure village surrounded by a formidable, rock-filled valley.We first meet the American heroes within the safety of their compound, waking up while visited by Murphy, played by BATTLESHIP actor Taylor Kitsch, who turns in a surprisingly mature performance. As he enters each room, we learn about stuff ranging from wedding gifts to pop culture preferences? The members of SEAL TEAM 10 not only have loved ones at home, but are very human and vulnerable.Then, skipping past an intriguing set-up, right after the mission goes wrong, the troop is surrounded by a large number of Taliban... Thus a prolonged action-packed sequence involves a shattering gunfight within the crest of the mountain where each soldier, sans Mark Wahlberg's Marcus Luttrell, gets taken out.In a film titled LONE SURVIVAL, to say everyone dies except Luttrell is hardly a spoiler... The most jarring scenes take us up-close into each soldier's rolling/tumbling fight for survival amidst seemingly impossible odds.Along with Wahlberg and Kitsch is an edgy, unpredictable Ben Foster and a more grounded and passive Emile Hirsch... Meanwhile, the title is both fitting and misleading: much of the story centers on the entire Team, making Wahlberg seem more of an ensemble cog than a leading role. At times the dialogue tries too hard to sound authentic, bathed in mundane realism and often corny military cliché one-liners, and director Peter Berg piles on the ultra-violence a bit too heavy, perhaps to compete with modern war films and/or anything of the bloody action genre? But he keeps the situation clear enough for the viewer to get lost inside this utterly unfathomable nightmare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect direction of Peter Berg in action sequences, environment, photography, soundtrack, opening credits and end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Berg, surprised us with another fantastic "thriller" war, produced by Michael Mann "The Kingdom". Now go back to the military genre, serious cut and nothing like what he did in "Battleship" with this film that is among the best films of recent action.The story, based on true events, tells the raid of a group of Marines in Taliban territory, where an armed conflict of biblical proportions will bundle and put the viewer at the edge of the seat.That command of four soldiers, composed of actors Taylor Kitsch ("John Carter", "Battleship"), Emile Hirsch ("Milk", "Speed &#x200b;&#x200b;Racer"), Ben Foster ("The 3:10 to Yuma") and Mark Wahlberg seems to trace his character in "The Shooter" in for a hell in which they will have to put all eggs in one basket in order to survive against the hordes of heavily armed Taliban.The film has a great start, with actual recordings of Marine training at U.S. bases and with a perfect presentation of each of these soldiers, something very important when rages moments of tension and suffering, we empathize with each soldier and his calamities feel as if we ourselves happen.The film works like a charm on an emotional level and action level, because Berg gets epic action sequences, which he did in the thrilling final sequences of "Shadow the kingdom." A who like movies like "Tears of the Sun", "Black Hawk Down", "The Shooter", will find this film a true not for sensitive viewers enjoy violence or blood.All the actors are perfect in their roles, with great characterization work and you can not stand out above any other, since they all work which compact command marines.I would also like to comment that in the plane of the side we will find the actor Eric Bana ("Hulk"), who previously worked in that other war film, directed by Ridley Scott and entitled "Black Hawk down".We admire the good work atmosphere, reaching apparently the director has used real basis to shoot her scenes or reached an agreement with the army of the United States since that, as happened in "Battleship", do act presence of all types of aircraft and helicopters real, getting a military realism that only ever seen in movies like the aforementioned "Black hawk down".Technically, apart from superb handling in all the epic action sequences, we note good photography in those mountain scenery and a very interesting by Steve Jablonsky ("Transformers", "The Island") soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most exciting war movie for quite a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as war movies go this is exciting tense involving and well made. The story is compelling not just because it is an extraordinary true story of one soldier surviving but because the bravery and tragedy are keenly felt without unrealistic bravado. Once the fighting starts, you're in for a terrifying and unforgettable ordeal.Good points include identifiable characters (unlike Black Hawk Down) and a likable cast. The main actors are all familiar to movie goers and they don't look out of place in their roles. Mark Wahlberg doesn't look that combat ready being relatively middle aged looking compared to the rest. Eric Bana is convincing as the commander. Never thought of Emil Hirsch as a soldier type but he is okay. Ben Foster is good. Taylor Kitsch is a bit too much of a dude for the role of a career soldier.The story shows the people of Afghanistan from both sides of the conflict. During the battle it seemed like a bit like a video game killing Taliban but then it became quite eye opening when the Afghans saved Marcus and helps to show the difficult situation the anti Taliban Afghans face in the country. The story isn't political or anti war though one does come away feeling the loss of such brave men and the suffering is such a terrible waste in the bungled mission and rescue.A must watch for war movie fans especially since it's about Afghanistan an under represented conflict on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it allot despite the embellishments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It gave me a good feel what special forces can be like especially when things go bad and I've never seen that before. It made me think about what these guys can go through. Normally, Special Forces movies are like Commando where Arnold Schwarzenegger mows down about a hundred bad guys and saves the girl and kills the really bad guy and spends most of the movie being stoic and looking really cool. So, this movie was a refreshing change.I read many IMDb reviews about this movie and a lot of people were giving it a very low score, bashing it for inaccuracies and the choice of soundtrack. This minority lowered the overall score noticeably. Here's my view: I've never been in the military so I'm just trying to get an understanding and a feel of what it is like and I want to be engaged by a story. This movie did that. If I wanted to watch a documentary where there is no acting or embellishment, I'd do that instead.Hollywood is in the business of making money and they know more people pay for an embellished story. More people will watch it. Look at Lincoln, a remarkable man who didn't require any embellishment. Embellished movie. More people watched that embellished movie than all the documentaries. I'm fine with that. If anything, I think embellishments helped convey the main lessons I got out of Lone Survivor. It made me think about and feel for these people.In regards to the soundtrack, just by the title of this movie alone, we know this story is a tragedy. So, I found the music appropriate. I thought it was a bold choice to contrast to the imagery. I happen to really like Explosions in the Sky so maybe I'm biased on that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film took me by surprise. I was not expecting it to be this good especially considering the guy who directed this (Peter Berg) also directed Battleship. Based on a true story, it is about a group of four US Navy seals on a mission in Afghanistan to hunt down a Taliban leader and it goes horrible wrong. What I really liked about the movie was how brutal and realistic it felt. Seriously, there were times when I was cringing and saying "OUCH" etc. Pretty brutal stuff they went through and it is portrayed in a great way. The cinematography was great and really made these scenes epic. The movie also doesn't depict Afghanistan as just plain EVIL all round and US soldiers being the good heroes. The last act was really refreshing for me and it became even more awesome considering it was based on True story. There is some cheesiness here and there that you usually get with war type movies and the character establishment of Mark Wahlberg and other guys at the start could have been better and longer. Also, it did felt very realistic during war scenes BUT there were a few occasions where it became kinda hard to believe they survived that much punishment.Overall, a great film and a must watch.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor is nowhere in the league of an epic war film but it deserves recognition as a visceral achievement in depicting modern warfare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard-edged, gritty and unrelenting, Lone Survivor is an action packed war film that is equally moving and as courageous as some of the tragic real life characters it is based on. While the story is a visceral achievement in depicting modern warfare, the film itself couldn't have arrived at a better time than at the start of a new year. And if this trend continues, 2014 should be another great year at the movies! Written and directed by Peter Berg, Lone Survivor stands testimony to the ill-fated 'Operation Red Wings' ? a covert ops mission in 2005 that sent four US Navy SEALS into the Afghan mountains to track and eliminate a high ranking Taliban leader. Berg's narrative uses the first twenty minutes to introduce us to these valiant men. We get a peek into their personal lives ? some are newlyweds, others have pictures of their infants. They talk about their hopes and dreams and providing for their families back home. We also get to see what makes them elite soldiers ? real life footage of their rigorous training before graduating into Navy SEALs. But out here in a US military base in Afghanistan, their only family is each other. Bound by brotherhood, courage and sacrifice, they are Lieutenant Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Petty Officer Second Class Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). The mission is supervised by Lieutenant Commander Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) via satellite communications at a remote US base. Outfitted with the latest military hardware, including high caliber firepower and over watch from a high altitude AC-130 gunship, you would expect a bravura show of force. However, Murphy's Law dictates their fate and the first disaster comes knocking in the form of civilians tending to goats. Almost instantly, they become sitting ducks against a hateful enemy in an extremely unforgiving terrain. It's all downhill from here and as the title predicts with ominous certainty, only one of these men make it out alive; that too, barely.As expected in a Peter Berg film, action is heavy and consumes more than half the running time. Battle scenes are thick with the zip and ping of bullets and shrapnel flying in every direction. It gets to such a frenzy that you begin to lose track of who is firing and from where. To counter this, Berg employs frequent 'pink mist' scenes of silhouetted blood spilling to signify confirmed hits. Then he cranks it up to a point where you start to think these SEALs are death defying superheroes. But if this film is based on actual events, then heroes they are, because seeing is believing. Also noticeable is the heavy handed vibes of patriotism emitted through the film. This is second nature for Berg, especially if you have seen The Kingdom, a similarly themed action spectacle that speaks volumes on the culture clash associated with the ongoing war on terror. Even with Berg's signature aspects embedded throughout the film, patriotism is hoisted to a whole new level by honoring the lives of America's slain sons. As a mass media obituary of sorts, this is reserved for the final segment where we get to see the real men who perished - eighteen individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice so that freedom remains a birthright in the motherland.Real combat heroism is not about racking up the body count or triggering spectacular explosions. Real soldiers don't have endless clips of ammo or nerves of steel; or so we have seen in epic war films like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. On the other hand, Lone Survivor is nowhere in the league of an epic war film but it deserves recognition as an action-thriller that packs a wallop in suspense driven firefights. Tension mounts even before the first shot is fired and Berg has some of these pre-skirmish scenes tightly packed into a powder keg. Wahlberg and rest of the supporting cast make this possible, even as stuntmen provide visual plausibility for some unbelievable scenes of physical trauma. And although the film ends on a sombre note, there is an indulgent bit of Hollywoodism in the final act that is almost laughable. But after Berg's last travesty, Battleship (2012), the overall making of Lone Survivor resonates the progression of a rising action film director. Welcome back Pete! All is forgiven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Went into this film with no expectations, just a spur of the moment thing with friends (We flipped a coin between this, and RoboCop.) It tries to be a black hawk down style military true story survival film, but reaches neither the levels of emotion, nor action of that film. Admittedly, I hadn't heard of this story beforehand, but some parts are just far too unbelievable, lack of continuity, tired clichés, bad dialogue and lack of character development or investment, makes it seem an empty action flick, instead of what it should have been. However, there are good parts to it, the action sequences can sometimes work, and the tension created works well. Overall I just felt, like I'd seen it all before, just this wasn't done as well and no reason to feel anything for the characters. I felt it should have been an emotional personal story, when really, it just turned into a generic military film</fullReview>

I really would not like to elaborate on this but an example of this arises when the villagers protected Marcus from the Taliban due to an ancient custom .Without the strength of these people and their doggedness to follow this code Marcus would have been handed in for execution,The film mentions this only in one line on the screen just before the credits roll .

		<fullReview>I had no problem with the entertainment value or performances but have a big concern over what is being implied with these Hollywood versions of very serious history (Zero Dark Thirty, Cpt Phillips, etc) which exploit real life situations for profit and ratings. If a true story has to be rewritten in any way to better a Hollywood movie, made for profit and awards by already millionaire celebrities; Why even use the real names of people? Why not base it in truth but openly make it clear you are changing details Hollywood didn't find juicy enough while exploiting serious situations for money and awards?It's like a bible. If it's so important and sacred, why sell it for money and why ever rewrite it? There's no reason to if you want to be taken seriously. I don't care if the people involved in the real story support this garbage. Rewriting history with changes that DID not happen, regardless of how cool it looks, is dishonest and does a disservice to those who died and can't cash a book selling check or shake hands with rich movie stars. If you care so much about truth, don't sex-up the story to have dramatic elements for the sake of an audience. Make it for the history channel and swallow your pride. Impossible I know but just a thought to get back to honesty and what matters most. Would be more happy with the film if I knew it at least followed all accounts and didn't add in Hollywood studio notes. Ridiculous.</fullReview>

I doubt that these four Navy SEALS engaged in combat like you would in a CoD game, in that they only need to rest in cover for a few seconds after being shot then they're fine. Lone Survivor is also rather messy moralistically as well, as it doesn't seem to have a clear message on war. One of my favourite scenes in the movie was one where soldiers debate what to do with some Afghan kids they've captured. I thought this scene would serve as a basis for more complex developments on the morality of war, but alas no, as Lone Survivor feels like a movie that doesn't know what it's trying to say.However, the movie is still well made. The action is very well directed and incredibly tense, there's one scene where the soldiers are falling down a mountain and I have no idea whatsoever how they filmed it, it was incredibly well done. The acting is excellent as well, with Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch all giving excellent performances, however I found myself not caring so much about anyone other than Mark Wahlberg because I knew what their fate would be due to the title of the movie and the posters which all have Mark Wahlberg front and centre, so it's not exactly hard to guess who will be the lone survivor.I was glad the movie didn't show the belief that all Afghans are Taliban members that will try to kill you instantly. For a good portion of the movie I thought it was going down this road but was glad to see that towards the end it turned around. However, message wise that's the one of the only things I thought was done well. Is it worth watching? I would still say so because it's enjoyable enough, but don't expect a complex social commentary on war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything in the movie was somewhat in sync with the book...then as the scene fades to darkness and Luttrell is rescued, my jaw just dropped as to the final events of the movie. Please, please, please read the book and get the facts straight from Luttrell, not Hollywood. There was no violent ending to Luttrell's rescue as it was depicted in the final scenes of the movie. Much respect to the true heroes who died during Operation Redwing, but I do not have any respect for Hollywood and their poor portrayal of a great story of survivalism and heroism. Again, please, please, please read the book. "Based on a True Story" movies are not always great examples of what actually happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movies of the Year Are in Theaters, But This Isn't One of Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I knew that with Peter Burg writing the screenplay and directing it was going to be a mess but with all the good reviews I thought that I might be mistaken. I wasn't. I mean if you just want to see a movie where all the good guys have full beards and all the bad guys wear eyeliner with very questionable special effects then it's... well it's still not great. The thing that bothers me the most about this is how everyone swears to its authenticity. A quick Google search will not only show that the movie and book are glaringly different (with almost the entire last 30 minutes of the movie being fabricated) but that the book also has been criticized heavily for its inaccuracies. Most scenes in the movie will leave you thinking, "Really? There is no way that happened" and you'd be right. Even if you completely ignore the inaccuracies its still a spotty movie at best. I haven't seen a movie where the effects stood that far out as fake in a long time. Every time someone gets shot its so poorly done that you cant even try to pretend that its real and the "RPG's" are so inconsistent and fake that it hurts. Most lines in the movie seem unnatural and forced. Mark Wahlburg seems a bit off but gives a decent performance considering the horrible directing. Bottom line, there are fantastic movies in theaters right now that are far better for and more deserving of your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duped by IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally a movie's IMDb rating is a good barometer for suitability. Yes, sometimes things will be overrated a couple of points (Dark Knight &amp; DKR being prime examples) by fanboys, others might be under scored because, as you will see from 'popular culture', the general public is by and large pretty stupid and can't comprehend something which requires a bit of analysis from the viewer without clear sign posts.Lone Survivor is the first example I've seen which has been overrated by at least 5 points, solely due to one nations sentimental patriotism. Take away the blatant propaganda, the glaring inaccuracies and questionable truths and you're left with what is just a very bad film. Poorly scripted, badly directed and wooden performances, especially from Wahlberg. Emile Hirsch phones in the worst performance of his a career and it was probably a relief for him when he was killed off.It will be lauded in the US due to their obsession with the military and 'people who give their lives to protect my freedom' despite their being very little threat and those they hero worship and generally there because they couldn't do much else. For ANYBODY else or Americans with half a brain cell, steer clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first 45-60 minutes, I enjoyed the well-played look and feel of an elite military culture - the compound, the camaraderie, the language all felt realistic and captivated me. The attempts to humanize the characters were weak and lazy. Tropic Thunder actually came to mind a few times, with the cliché one-liners. There wasn't any attachment to the characters that forced me to cling to the heroes of the movie. Even the anti-heroes, the Afghans, had no soul or objective whatsoever, and I really found it to be pro-American and devoid of any plot depth in that regard. I would cringe in embarrassment at this movie in about 50 years, I'm sure.I wanted this film to be challenging. It began as though it was going to raise some serious dialogue about war and civilization, but it ended up being a shoot-out action hero sequence that NEVER ENDED.Do I really even need to tell you how it ended?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another War Flick. &#x2666; 46%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The use of word "flick" in the summary instead of "film" seriously shows how Lone Survivor depends solely on the clichéd war elements coupled with sympathetic emotions. Well, I respect the original fighters behind the failed mission, but I still cannot understand why it had to be brought to celluloid in the first place. Too damn terrible!Letting us know the happenings through a book is a fine thing to do. But, as a film, Lone Survivor fails because: the plot heavily showcases the action scene, rather than focusing on 2 main things, characterization &amp; the dot to dot fact file as to what went wrong. Yes, the screenplay tried hard to give us the reasons, but they either seemed ridiculous or foolish, thus giving us another reason to doubt the whole plot line-up. Unless I read the book, I might never believe this film.Next, the characters die so fast, the story gasps for life. And as the title so dramatically proposes the climax, I had no specific adrenalin rush throughout the 2 hour period. "Pushtanwali," a code of honor for wise Afghanistanis is something new I learned of and it is because of this, the soundtrack, make-up and Wahlberg, why I rate it 5/10.Cinematography is below average and I am not happy with the direction even. The guns are good, the action sequences jaw-dropping, but performances aren't that great and BTW, what was Eric Bana doing in this preposterously inappropriate role?BOTTOM LINE: Easily forgettable, a very cold flick. Read the happenings instead somewhere than watching this typical Hollywood money-raker. Not Recommended!Gore/Violence: Very Critical | Sex/Nudity: No</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******************Warning spoilers ahead************* The movie started out OK, right up until the point where they got made. But than it just went down hill fast. I dunno much about being a SEAL, but I know they're supposed to be pretty good. So it sort'a amazes me when they know they're being pursued by the Taliban, they decide to wait for night fall, on a quite open hill top, in hostile area, to see if they can get radio contact. Especially when they know the Taliban is close by, and could reach them in a within two hours window at the most I can't understand why they just didn't started walking to begin with, considering the Taliban was hot on their trail. I also found it pretty weird to roll of a 5-10m cliff on purpose, but it supposed to be accurate to the book so I guess it's true than How ever I did react to the fact that all their weapons seemed to function fine after they roll off the cliff, especially after all the beating it took, and their scopes zero is still good. Another thing that puzzled me when you let the capture baddies go, why cut their hand loose, why not just keep them zip tied together? Than it would take em a lot longer to reach their comrades in arms (which consider the distance, should take them at least 30 min or more) and tell them that there are US soldiers in the woods. Found it a bit strange that after they roll of the first cliff, which was more or less a short cut if not a brutal one, the Taliban managed to walk around that cliff and catch up with them in less than two minutes. The distance would at least be a 15 min walk, considering the Taliban had no idea if they would be walking into an ambush or not. I also reacted to the fact that they openly argue about what to do with the prisoners. I know they are seals and thereby have a different code than regular soldiers. But I didn't think a SEAL platoon was a democracy. I also caught my self wondering why the SEAL's didn't have a guard posted further away from their OP. I mean they were pretty much all huddled together in the same square, so if you spotted one, you would find the rest too. To me at least it would make sense to post a hidden man as forward guard post, to avoid exactly that type of situation you see in this film, unwanted visitors stumbling over your OP. And why wasn't the rescue team ready at the choppers bay doors, when they were suppose to rappel down? They knew their job, and they knew the enemy was close, why stand around waiting to have your frigging name called instead of being lined up and ready? I would've thought that the SEALS would have gone in dressed as natives, instead of full battle gear. But I haven't read the book, so I assume it's accurate as to what they do in the field. Oh btw I dunno who's the army adviser on this movie, but he should get fired. You really can't hide from an apache-bird. They got thermo and will most likely spot you, so I found it a bit strange that when the choppers come in low on the way to the crash sight, they don't see any Taliban at all. Especially since they are quite feared by the Taliban for their ability to spot them and track em down almost everywhere in the field. To me this was not worth the money, it seemed more like a Gun&amp;Optic commercial =look what you can do with our rifles and scopes and they will still work perfectly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mere Propaganda Film. Nothing More. Nothing Less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the nonfiction book of the same name &amp; set during the War in Afghanistan, Lone Survivor tries to recreate the US Navy SEALs' Operation Red Wings, a failed mission in which a survey team of 4 soldiers were tasked to locate the Taliban leader, Ahmad Shah. And even though it impresses in parts &amp; has a lot in it to evoke the patriotic response from its target audience (which is American viewers obviously), Lone Survivor ends up going completely overboard in dramatizing the true events &amp; suffers from the very clichés that most films of its genre find themselves trapped in.What's right with this film is Peter Berg's dynamic direction, tense atmosphere, superb pacing, intense battle sequences, precision use of sound, music &amp; relatively fine performances from its star cast who were actually capable of delivering more than what ended up being in the final print. What's wrong with it, however, is its lack of emotional depth or character development, sometimes going overly dramatic than required and too much reliance on action to push its story forward which ultimately crosses the fine line between exploration &amp; exploitation to revel in the latter.On an overall scale, Lone Survivor has nothing new to offer compared to what other films of this genre have already given us so far. Yes, it's brutal. Yes, it looks realistic to some extent. Yes, the battle sequences are disturbing, graphic &amp;, in my opinion, explosively entertaining as well. But, there is also no denying that its characters remain hollow throughout its runtime, the story or characters aren't explored enough for us to invest our emotions in &amp; all in all, this war drama is nothing less or more than a mere propaganda film, unfortunately.</fullReview>

Battleship, the Expendables 1 through x and now this lone survivor show very much respect for the heroism and valor of persons whose primary occupation is killing other people without giving it too much of a thought. Why is a Talibanleader a bad guy when he kills 20 marines? What were those marines doing there in the first place. Following orders, just as these navy seals were just following orders. It's not OK in the US to criticize the poor guys following orders. You must 'support our troops'. This film shows a Triumph des Willens. And that is quite scary.</fullReview>

It will grip you 100 x more than this film will &amp; will also fill in the many facts left out of the story; the biggest one being the horrendous chapter of him surviving on his own against all odds, surrounded by Taliban, badly wounded, yet continuing to fight on &amp; kill the enemy, until he was finally rescued.This film fails to incite any emotion on any level. In many ways, this film seems to be just 'going through the motions' and I honestly think I could have easily fallen asleep through it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this was only "based on true events," but they really took "dramatization" to the next level for this movie (by the way, there is a significant difference between "based on true events" and "documentary"). Anyway, I thought the exaggeration in the story was way, way over the top and really took away from what could have been a more interesting movie. For example: - More buckets of bullets being fired and missing than any Hong Kong "Gun-Fu" flick.- The SEAL team taking 2 huge bone-crushing falls down rocky, shale-covered cliffs and just walking it off. I'm sure this really happened but the way it was depicted made it seem completely unrealistic.- Packed FULL of clichés. Tons of last-second saves (phone call goes through just in time before SEAL gets fatally shot, just before Walbird is beheaded, just before Taliban overtakes the town where Walbird has refuge, etc). Taliban miraculously learns how to aim and shoots down a helicopter with an unguided RPG, although they always seem to be *just* off when aiming at the 4 SEALs with the same weapons, making for crazy near misses. Lots of blatantly "bollywood" stuff like that added to create drama/tension.Those are just two that are at the forefront of my mind right now. I see a lot of people saying crap like "you're unamerican/unpatriotic if you hate this movie" and so-on, and i don't want to take away from what actually happened. But as anIndonesian national, I find it to be much, much worse that the filmmakers are exaggerating and dramatizing their story just to make a more "entertaining" movie so that they can take in more at the box office and in rentals/DVD purchases. I checked the wikipedia page before posting this and there is no indication that any of the proceeds went to anything meaningful. Not even a token donation or mention of groups that help veterans. This is just a shameless moneygrab trying to capitalize on blind patriotism, and you people criticizing people for offering their opinion of the movie are playing right into the filmmakers hands.Again, just to be clear, I understand this is based on true events. My issue is the unrealistic and "hollywoodized" way these events were exaggerated and depicted. At least it they didn't bring out any fighting CIA mechs as they did in the recent Robocops debacle.</fullReview>

Theses guys put Superman to shame as to how they can keep moving after numerous wounds and falls that should have broken every bone in their bodies. The attempt to show the Seals as superhuman with a strong ethical soul was a bit overdone. The biggest fault was their decision to let the goat herders go. They had other options to avoid killing them while allowing themselves to remain undiscovered. But I think the desire by the writer/director to make a point led to the decision.

		<shortDescription>Touching story, bit over-dramatized.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see that a movie is based on a true story I always tend to watch it with a little bit of a different feeling. I tend to look more to what might actually be real and what might be exaggerated to make the movie look better.This story of this movie is rather simple: a squad of 4 men have the mission to assassinate a terrorist leader, however they run into a couple of goat herders. They have a tough decision to make: either kill the goat herders and continue their mission (risking that the American army might get denigrated by the press, I.e American soldiers kill innocent children). Or they can let the goat herders go and risk that they will compromise their position.The decision the soldiers make is crucial for this movie, because when they make the decision to let the herders go, all hell brakes loose. What follows is a series of gunfights where the Americans kill dozens of terrorist while falling down from quite some heights rolling down hills etc.I do not believe that all of this happened in real life, they were all shot so many times and then falling from such heights, they could've never survived that. Also they killed many terrorist in this movie, I do not believe that you can kill 40+ terrorist with 4 man.Even though I assume that much of this movie is over-dramatized, it's still a touching story of a squad of soldiers that make sacrifices to rescue each other.Verdict: The story is a bit dull, much shooting and drama, but touching none the less. Probably a lot is over dramatized but it's still filmed and acted in a nice way.I rate this movie a solid 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn June 2005, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and his team of men are sent on a mission in Afghanistan to take out a notorious Taliban commander whose lack of mercy is becoming intolerable. But after arriving at their destination, they find their mission compromised when unexpected problems come up, and they do end up finding themselves in heavy gunfire with insurgents. The following is a true depiction of his battle for survival and the unexpected kindness and humanity he was shown by some local Afghan villagers.The backdrop of the controversial Afghan war would no doubt provide many a setting for some really meaty tales that could be converted in to a Hollywood film, and here we have one by Peter Berg, adapted from the true life story of Marcus Luttrell and his harrowing five day long battle for survival in the Afghan wilderness, where he saw his comrades brutally killed off one by one and was forced to endure his own terrible ordeal, before re-discovering the humanity of others after being rescued by some local villagers. Berg has crafted a film that manages to open in a really involving, absorbing style that is more than you expect, but which loses it somehow after the battle starts, descending in to a stylish but less moving effort. Somehow, the early scenes give it a depth and development it loses when the action starts.Somehow, more than in any film I've seen him in before, here Wahlberg's limitations as an actor really shine through, even though I can't say he gave an especially bad performance, or any worse than usual. It could be because he takes up much of the screen time on his own, and can't rely on a supporting cast including the likes of Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Eric Bana to carry him. It's surprising what a lead star can reveal when their safety net goes. The film seems split in to three parts, before, during and after the battle, and even after during his humanistic scenes with the villagers, it doesn't switch on.From the director who gave us the likes of Battleship, this could have been a lot worse, but a more charismatic lead and not letting up on the stirring human dynamics at any point would have still made the experience an even more dramatic depiction of a real life thriller. ***</fullReview>

They are just soldiers and they do what they are trained for. They go, they fight, they die. This is the story. I would rather learn who they are than how they died. I think director should have focused on character development, instead he spent an hour on how they jumped, how they got shot, how they killed, and be killed. It was just cheap story telling. I only liked the beginning (how they are trained) and the end (Pashtunwali).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Lone Survivor' tells the true story of a US navy SEAL team and their failed mission called Operation Red Wings during the Afghanistan war. As the title says there's nothing to hide or secrets behind characters, only one survive from a team of four soldiers. How it all going to happen unfolded in an unbelievable manner.It was Mark Wahlberg's show, though Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana and others appearance gave strong grip to the story. This movie takes place mainly in three locations, one from US navy base, two from mountain range and the third one from a small village. The US navy base was okay, but the mountain range and Afghan village were looked clearly fake. Failed to recreate those middle-east atmospheres where the movie was shot (in Mexico), but the movie was breathtaking by the story and performances make you forget the technical side flaws.In a few areas, it makes you to feel it was overdone. Especially after soldiers were wounded by multiple bullet shots. But then it was clearly explained in the opening scene itself like the soldiers were trained to stand tall in any given harsh situations. The director of 'The Kingdom' crafted this movie awesomely in a similar fashion to that. One of the Oscars talked movie, but did not do well, though got good responds from the movie goers around the world. It is like this year's 'Zero Dark Thrity' based on US war against Talibans. Knowing truth is always good for knowledge and if it comes through a movie, then it will be a thrilling entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing with "Lone survivor" is that its an action movie. An action movie that's based on a true story. Trouble is, its one of those "they couldn't possibly survive that in real life" kind of action movies. So the only problem I really had with it. Was over how true the stuff that happens in it actually is.Now, i'm sure the basics of the plot are the true part. 4 soldiers find themselves fighting off hundreds of enemy soldiers while trapped in Afghanistan, and indeed, the later parts of this story are genuinely amazing.The earlier gun fighting itself, though entertaining as a movie, I have a little bit of trouble with. As the title suggests there's a "Lone survivor." So, when all the characters split up, how does he know what happened to his colleagues? Now I know its been dramatised for movie purposes, but some of what we see in these parts seems gratuitously violent and un-necessary. If these were fictional characters then OK. But they're based on real guys, and to me, that seemed in bad taste.Still, the movie tries to honour these heroes in an ending that may bring a tear to your eye, and overall the movie is action packed, and has a great cast. Yet, maybe a "rambo" style action movie wasn't the way to go with this one.</fullReview>

This film depicts the importance of U.S military interference in the Middle East.The movie conjures up all sorts of feelings, and great sympathy towards all the fallen soldiers. Since the movie is based on a true story it is even more shocking and if one imagines how authentic this film is I am sure that you also get shivers..

Plus, the first few scenes of the movie seem full of empty sentimentality. The first half of the movie, is on the surface, about heroism and camaraderie. However, more than this, it is about military incompetence. The overly complex mission, so complex any small detail, eg loss of communications, can derail it. The failure to terminate a major threat to the mission. The hung-ho, uncoordinated rescue attempt.The first half was actually somewhat irritating, as it seemed to value heroism over good planning and prudent decision-making.This is redeemed somewhat by the second half. Here it is a movie about survival, grace, generosity and kindness.Powerful ending.Decent performances all round, though nobody stands out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is much to admire in Peter Bergs tribute to the men lost in the botched 2005 Operation Red Wings Military expedition but there is an overall feeling one gets also that Berg has himself to blame for failing to properly establish his 4 leading men beyond typical war film characitures and give the film an identity and audience affiliation that would of allowed the film to pack a much bigger emotional punch.Lone Survivor starts things out in promising fashion with the opening montage of real life military training giving the audience insight into what these man endure to become elite soldiers. The subsequent segment at the Military base of the man gives off the sense also that we will be spending some quality time getting to know the man involved in the real life tragedy but it's merely a false pretense for once the operations starts all character growth is stunted in favor of typical war skirmishes despite them being unquestionably well staged.Berg delivers world class direction of a roughly 40 minute barrage of frighteningly realistic action that while acting as edge of your seat, white knuckle filmmaking due to a disappearance of any character we truly know or care for it can only take the film so far. In the lead role as Marcus Luttrell Wahlberg gives one of his less charismatic turns with only Ben Foster making something worthwhile in an acting sense with his turn as Axe. When talking about Kitsch and Hirsch they equally don't get an opportunity to make much of there underwritten roles which is a strange thing considering the wealth of information that would of been made available to Berg upon research of these real life man and when reading about the films research time spent to do justice to them in the movie it would be considered a failure for the film in allowing us to not get a sense of who they were as there lost in a spray blood squibs and bullets.Lathering on the patriotism thick and fast Lone Survivor is a impressive feat of filmmaking that is not allowed to truly shine thanks to its lacklustre script and cardboard characters. With more time spent on the script and developing these brave men into more than mere movie soldiers that movie would of been a sure fire war classic cut from the same cloth as films like Black Hawk Down and Platton. Special mention must also be paid to the stunt team on this film who on face value look to have endured some serious bruising on there work here.3 and a half agonizing mountain side falls out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terribly effective movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is a brutally effective movie, made by people thinking they're serving their country. However these people make the audience coarser and more self-centered. They perpetuate the kind of propaganda that sent the heroes of the Seal Team 10 to death. The film is intense though but balanced by the moments of surprising tenderness, among the men themselves and also in the field. The ensemble cast delivers properly, working with a screenplay telling the story with considerable force. The story itself is not just about a fire fight with the enemy, it regards more the sense of brothers in arms helping each other to survive. This is what makes the film powerful and somewhat satisfying in a terrible sort of way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As gripping as a death match on Call Of Duty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gripping action packed war film. The Hurt locker meets Saving Private Ryan.An high octane all action war movie, now I am not in the army and have no knowledge of what its like to be in a situation of life or death but this film seems to me the most realistic portrayal an actual war zone then most other films of the same genre in recent years. The film starts off quite slow but be patient because after half hour you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen as your thrown into the heat of battle. Its just as gripping as being in a call of duty death match. The hairs on the back of your neck will stand up as you feel the fear the soldiers are feeling as bullets reign down around them. Mark Wahlberg leads a group of four American soldiers stranded without a radio connection behind enemy lines as a mission goes wrong deep in Taliban controlled Afghanistan.This film is based on true life events, if you love war films there is no reason you wont love this one.http://raroe.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't much what I expected based on IMDb ratings , box office . Literally Mark Wahlberg's performance saved this movie from being a complete failure . I think the screenplay wasn't that good and din't made it a real action movie but mostly of the time in first 50 minutes was boring as f*** . Only Mark when was left by himself the only that survived the movie started to revive the movie . His fantastic acting skills made the movie awesome with his dramatic role . The script (story) was fantastic , but I don't know maybe the producing or director or something turned into a boring movie till some point Mark came and saved it . Love Mark's performance 6.8/10 this movie :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping, horrifying action movie that loses sight of its soul when the bullets fly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many films would be willing to place a spoiler so squarely in their title, but Peter Berg's Lone Survivor has no such qualms. We know right from the start that Mark Wahlberg - grim-faced, stone-washed, blood- bathed - is the only soldier who makes it back alive from a surveillance mission gone badly wrong. What's surprising about the film is that it still positively thrums with tension, its action beats pounding fast and furious through a gunfight all the more horrifying for the number of casualties we know it must yield. But Berg also loses sight of the men within his soldiers, sacrificing intimacy and nuance for blood and bullets.Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg) is one of four elite SEAL team members dispatched on a reconnaissance mission in the mountains of Afghanistan. Together with squad leader Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) and fellow soldiers Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), Luttrell is on the hunt for notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. While hiking through the rough terrain some distance above Ahmad Shah's suspected hideout, the team run into an elderly goat-herd and his young shepherds. The SEAL team's decision to spare the lives of these possible innocents unleashes a brutal, bruising battle, the outcome of which is tragic and already-known.The squeamish and faint of heart should look away now. In the hour-long bloodbath that forms the centrepiece of Lone Survivor, Berg has crafted perhaps his most thrilling, bone-crunching action scenes yet. In order to avoid fates worse than capture or death, characters fling themselves off cliffs, crashing headlong and parkour-style into seemingly every rock and tree along the way. Blood dripping down their faces, flesh torn to shreds, the SEAL team limp and lurch across the mountain, a host of nameless Taliban foot-soldiers hot on their heels. There is little respite for the characters, and even less for the audience, who will find their hearts clenched in their chests as bullets fly and lives ebb slowly, devastatingly away.It's such a virtuoso piece of film-making - edited together in short, sharp bursts - that it's almost possible to forget that Berg hasn't shown us who any of these men really are. There are a handful of moments at the start of the film, when he tries to establish character: one doomed soldier is contemplating getting a horse for his impending wedding; the other has a new wife. But these details aren't enough to provide a genuine depth of connection. By the time war rings out across the mountain, we still don't know much about these four soldiers who have been thrust so senselessly into a bitter, horrible fight for their lives.The politics of Lone Survivor are also murky at best. In stretching out the ferocious gunplay to such a horrifying extent, Berg's film winds up asking the oddly amoral question: should the soldiers have, after all, decided to permanently silence apparently innocent villagers? The final- act twist in Luttrell's tale - when he must seek refuge from the Taliban hunters - feels exactly like what it is: an exaggerated coda tacked on to drive home the point that, alongside the crazy terrorists, there are also right-minded heroes amongst the Afghan populace. It's a point made so bluntly that the film goes from bruising and believable to odd and over-blown.That being said, Lone Survivor is dragged back from the brink of mediocrity and excess by its truly staggering action sequences, choreographed so expertly that they actually become harder to watch the longer they go on. Wahlberg serves as a grim, gritty presence at the heart of the film, battered in both body and soul, while Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster provide able back-up despite their characters' woeful lack of depth. It makes for a heck of an action movie, even if it stumbles when forced to confront the thornier politics and complicated morality of its true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, realistic, drama-documentary on the reality of war in Afghanistan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dramatization of a US mission to kill a Taliban activist in 2005, in which the four man team experience the extremes of warfare, and at the end there is a 'lone survivor'. Mixed in with this, is the experience of one of the team in a Pashtun village, where he is inexplicably sheltered from his Taliban pursuers. Can't elaborate any more without giving away some of the plot.As a war movie, it's pretty accurate-looking, although many moments are distinctly 'Hollywoodized' (particularly one of the death scenes), and the movie makers love of glamorizing explosions is often present.There is an excess of glib chat between soldiers - there would have been no harm to the accuracy of the movie in toning this down, it didn't tell me anything about the characters or plot. Mark Wahlberg's closing line, obviously something significant, was incomprehensible to me.There's a lot of padding at the beginning and end of the movie, with shots of service personnel training and other matter, which was repetitive and didn't add to the product as a movie or documentary. Also a lot of slow-motion and intrusive music score, particularly in the earlier part of the movie.So, a lot of criticism from me, but ... eight out of ten all the same, less one point because of the uneven production issues mentioned above. It's quite good, and leaves one thinking a little. Lone Survivor takes a step further than the much hyped Zero Dark Thirty, by recognizing the role of the people whose home actually is Afghanstan. This is done in a simplistic way, but then this is really a movie about soldiers doing their stuff, and how they cope (or don't) when things go wrong. Grim, but with a thankful message of hope in human nature by the end. Would have loved to have given it eight (although certainly not nine), but it's just a bit to ragged and uneven in places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prolly the movie Peter Berg was born to make. Nah, it's defn not a classic. Save all those comparisons to 'Saving Private Ryan' (except for the action, perhaps) too, they're wasted on this. However, it has a great many good things going for it. The casting for one (regardless of the idiotic tell-all title). Finally, Taylor Kitsch gets a role he can be proud of (Is Berg atoning for 'Battleship'?) - he's in great form, and in good company for sure, with decent (as expected) turns from Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch as well. The terrain's as much a (-ve) character as are the Pashtun. Bana's little-seen, little- used, but effective as always. This is his second military rescue genre work after 'Black Hawk down'. Speaking of which, this one shares more with that, and with the far-far inferior 'Behind enemy lines' (which could've been better without the ham- fisted direction). The movie's one hell of a visceral experience, only to be had on the big screen, and I dare anyone not to flinch during the numerous sequences of nature-against-man violence wrought upon the 'survivors'. However, it does get a tad much (not belittling the plight of the lead/s, but more to do with a movie-making perspective), and a little subtlety would've helped, something like the less-is-more approach used by James Wan or William Friedkin. I also quite enjoyed the end-credits track by Peter Gabriel (Heroes) and the New Blood Orchestra(?). All in all, a decent watch, but its being extremely overrated by people who don't know better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's been much said about Lone Survivor ? mostly by my frequent cinema companion, Bag, who read the book by Marcus Luttrell upon which it was based. Mostly I trust Bag's opinion and heed his guidance, but then there was the Act of Valor episode, and we all know how that one ended? Lone Survivor begins with the titles laid across documentary footage of Navy SEALs undergoing, failing and surviving basic training. It has little bearing on the feature that follows, but it succeeds in giving audiences an understanding of the elite military unit and the essential backstory to the characters as a whole. Based on the actual events of ill-fated covert mission Operation Red Wings, in which a small force endeavours to 'neutralize' Ahmed Shah, a Taliban operative, Peter Berg's film embellishes the truth to make it more exciting, and perhaps palatable, for his niche audience.To the ignorant near-pacifist, it seems a little odd that Navy SEALs should find themselves on a mountain in landlocked Afghanistan, but that is perhaps beside the point. Berg wisely avoids the politics of whether America had any business being in Afghanistan in the first place but cannot resist a moment of self-congratulation with Peter Gabriel's rendition of Heroes over the end credits. But, while both issues rankle slightly, they are understandable moves and still a long way from the blinkered, gung-ho approach of Act of Valor.Lone Survivor is no Hurt Locker but it doesn't scrape the depths of the barrel the afore mentioned battle flick managed to achieve. While it is never going to convince the sceptics that war is good and that it was a legal escapade, it is a compelling look at the camaraderie and the sheer bloody mindedness of soldiers on a mission. Scruples are hinted at and consciences suggested, but I'm not sure Lone Survivor has anything particular to say beyond acknowledging the bond of military brotherhood under gunfire.Mark Wahlberg does a convincing job and I'm sure Luttrell the soldier will be more than happy with his portrayal by the actor. As a small unit, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster, along with Wahlberg, gel as a film watcher would hope a quartet of SEALs would. Was it realistic? I don't know; I've never been paid to shoot at people. But they create a sense of genuine solidarity and, while I was never convinced to actually like them, it was impossible not to admire their spirit.Lone Survivor aims for naturalism with the weaponry, sound effects and the sheer grit and discomfort of mountain/desert warfare and, so I'm told, Berg has achieved a reasonable level of technical accuracy, but there is nothing here that really sets it above or apart from other war films. Black Hawk Down is more thrilling, The Green Zone more shocking and The Hurt Locker far more intense. It's fine, it's good but there's no hint of a sixth star wandering into the rating.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for middle America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following making Battleship Peter Berg needed to redeem himself, so made his dream project, an adaptation of Lone Survivor, serving as his love letter for the Navy Seals. Based on the true story of Operation Red Wing, Lone Survivor tells a similar story to Black Hawk Down where a operation to target a Taliban goes wrong, leading to a SEAL team of four have to fight for their lives against large force of Taliban fighters.The war action is brutal and bloody as Berg delivers a relentless firefight between the SEALS and the Taliban. The action was the best part of the film as Berg and his cinematographer use a hand-held cameras and a liberal use of blood packs, making the war scenes seem like Saving Private Ryan. But the SEALS goes through a lot of punishment, getting shot up, getting their parts of their bodies blown off and still keep on fighting.There is a good cast and they do a solid job in their respective roles, being believable in their relationship. But the actors have little to work on: there is no characterisation, we do not know much about the men we are following and the main reason to support the Americans simply because the Taliban commander was worst, beheading people readily. This is a film that does not go into the complexities of the War in Afghanistan and simply made as a film about surviving in impossible odds as everything goes wrong, from the lack of support from outside and the radio going wrong early on.The battle scenes were expertly done and fans of war films will enjoy that aspect of the film. But Lone Survivor is too thin of an experience on a story and character level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Entertainment for Men, but a missed opportunity for a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has at least succeeded that I register at IMDb after many years to write a review.I was a German Airborne Ranger (Fallschirmjäger) many years ago, so I now a little bit about being a soldier, although I have never seen combat.This movie is acceptable as entertainment for men because most men love weapons and watching men killing each other. You get to see at lot of both.It is based on a true story, but for me it is hard to believe that the movie comes anywhere close give an accurate picture to what really happened.There is just too much cliché in this movie, and the SEALs just can absorb too much damage to their body to be credible, and the Taliban die too easy.On the other hand, if you just try to ignore that, the movie probably shows a lot of truth:- a successful military operation that goes according to plan is the exception to the SNAFU rule- communication equipment in the military is sh*t and fails when you most need it - people who voluntarily join the military are not the sharpest knifes in the drawer - a well trained group of soldiers can inflict heavy casualties on numerically superior untrained troops - war sucks, but the sound of weapon fire makes up for itIn the movie the SEALs start taking hits too early and maneuver really bad. It is especially unbelievable that they would jump or fall down a slope they way shown in the movie. There are also a number of factual errors in the movie. - In reality, the team was inserted by helicopter just 1.5 miles from the point of interest. In the movie it seems like they were moving at least ten or twenty miles through the mountains.- It is also not true that Taliban attacked the village where Lutrell was sheltered because they were way outnumbered by villagers. The town was Salar Ban and is only about 0.7 miles from the location of the fight. The old man who brought the note to the American base is factual, but he made most of the way by Taxi.- The number of Taliban opponents is also heavily disputed; the official number is 30-40, but there are reports that give numbers from 5 to 200. I would regard 10-30 as realistic because the Taliban did not dare to enter the village where Lutrell was sheltered. It is true however that an Aghan named Mohammad Gulab Khan sheltered Lutrell and later received threats from the Taliban, so he and his family were relocated to Asadabad.You have to take movie with a grain of salt, but if you want more than just entertainment out of this movie you have to to look through this movie and just ignore a substantial amount of cheesy stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies based on heroism on the battle ground are not an unfamiliar territory for the movie fans. And once in a while a movie comes out which strikes so hard that you realize that somewhere out there some people risk their lives for the betterment of many more sleeping at home. Lone Survivor is indeed a brilliant movie of that kind seeing seldom from Hollywood. And to make it even better it's based on actual events taken place. Lone Survivor is the cinematic adaptation by Peter Berg of the book of same name. The plot is based on a US failed mission Operation Red Wings taken place in Afghanistan. The mission objective was to track a high priority Taliban leader Ahmad Shah and a four member covert operatives team was sent out. The story unveils their mission starting from base camp to a remote village in the Hindu Kush mountain range through a tough terrain on foot. While the team is equipped with latest technology and experienced personal an unexpected incidence pushes them the deviate from the plan. And they find themselves surrounded by enemy insurgents and hope of getting out alive becomes thinner and thinner.Some call this the best after Black Hawk Down and I pretty much agree with it. But then there is the Special Forces (2012) a French movie that comes very close to this in my opinion but seems many Hollywood critics despise it (Well that's their problem). But what's the best movie is not the fact to highlight here. It's the fact that Lone Survivor is filled with brilliant performances, action sequences and top of all mind blowing amounts of heroism, courage and patriotism.Lone Survivor has good production quality and direction. Though there are no surprises to the plot or anything never seeing before in a war flick, this runs right through predictable points without sweating much. Relatively there is not enough character building done throughout but the lack of that kind of drama is barely noticed after the guns starts to fire. It is quite right to say that Lone Survivor has one of the best battle sequences that do not include heavy artillery. And it's pretty obvious that many stunt actors have broken bones performing it.A good war movie is not in terms of how bloody it is but in ways of how successful it is in justifying a war. It seems like Lone Survivor has done a decent job at it while the whole war again terrorism is at a questionable point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passionate, immersive and moving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2012's Act of Valor, current serving Navy SEALs were cast in order to inject realism into the action scenes, which they did, however the film couldn't overcome the dire acting and leaden dialogue to land out on top. With a group of dedicated A-listers undergoing an intensive boot camp before production, Lone Survivor proves that it's easier for professional actors to look the part in combat than it is for real soldiers to sprout a screenwriter's words. As the four- man team sent into the hills of Afghanistan to kill or capture an integral Taliban leader ? which doesn't go as planned ? Mark Whalberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster are fantastic. Their convincing portrayals and natural chemistry with each other ensures the audience has an immediate investment into their fates and makes the series of unfortunate events on their mission even more gruelling and gut-wrenching to witness. Writer-director Peter Berg has spoken about how this was a passion project for him (he took a pay cut on Universal's Battleship to get funding from the studio for this) and he proudly wears his patriotic devotion on his sleeve every step of the way. The opening act is relaxed, calm and humorous, slowly building a sense of camaraderie whilst introducing the military jargon and operational lifestyle. The extended middle act, where the bulk of the battle ensues, is a tour de force in modern warfare filmmaking. The meticulously researched gunfight is authentic and pulse-racing, amped up with tight, clear editing and an immersive sound design (unsurprisingly garnering an Oscar nod) that places you right in the middle of the action. Berg makes a crucial misstep with a dragged out, patience-testing denouement, but Lone Survivor remains in the higher echelon of war pictures and warrants a big screen viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 Navy Seals, deep in Afghanistan on a mission to assassinate two senior Taliban men, are compromised when they encounter 3 shepherds (one old, one teen, and a boy). Faced with a choice to kill them as a matter of self-preservation or let them go, they release them. And all hell breaks loose.The title of this film rather does away with any suspense which you might have if you don't already know the resolution of this adaptation of Marcus Lutrell's autobiographical book. What you are left with is an opening section which sets up the members of the unit and the beginning of the mission, a central section where they are trying to escape, and a final section where Marcus is given sanctuary in an Afghan village. This final section, which would have benefited from a little more attention being paid to telling us about the aftermath, gives one some hope that not everything about Afghanistan identifies it as a hell-hole which should be wiped from the face of the earth.But this is not a deep, complicated film, and its raison d'etre is is the lengthy central section, which is extremely well done. It has the visceral intensity of the D-Day Landings sequence from Saving Private Ryan - you are actually with the 4 comrades in arms as they try everything they can, initially to arrange extraction and, finally, just to stay alive. And, as an extended action sequence, it is a masterclass in putting such a sequence on screen in terms of geography of pursuit, what to include and what to exclude, and pacing: it is a long sequence and never gets repetitive because you (the viewer) are always so involved.The constant bad language is entirely appropriate in this rather good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor war movie. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even tho i don't like war movies(especially American ones), I decided to watch this movie with my friends. I didn't expect a 10/10 movie, of course, but I hoped for and average and thrilling movie. And what did i get? One of the worse movies i watched in years, and yes-its that bad. I would say movie started well, nothing special but a fine start. Seemed to me my expectations will be fulfilled, and I'm about to watch a potential 7/10. But then,after no character development, no plot background or setting, 15 minutes into the movie a group of 4 marines goes on a "stealth mission", poor deal of information being given to watchers what the mission is about. This movie is supposed to make you feel for the marines, make you want them survive but yet it has no character development and no charisma - only long ass boring shooting scenes. Its directed and written so bad, but I wont really talk on that much. And the realism? Thats like the crown on this poor movie. I mean, at one moment those marines had enough lead in their bodies from bullets and shrapnel's that in one moment in the movie i thought that a helicopter should fly over them with a big magnet and they would all be rescued... And actually, that would be the most logical thing in the movie. Fall over a cliff 3 times, hit your head against 3 rocks while being wounded 4 times? No problem, still alive and able to shoot. RPG cant lock on airplanes/helis and yet it knocks down a 2 propelled heli. There are many more illogical actions, but i wont waste my time explaining them all.. You got the pointThe last thing is that this movie is a classical American propaganda movie- hence its rated so well on imdb(7.7 rating). People watch this, and cheer for marines, hoping tali-bans will all die and marines will get out safe, thinking tali-bans are the bad guys-when the Americans are invading their country. Wouldn't you defend your country the same way if someone invaded it and is trying to kill you and your family? -And no, I'm not from Afghanistan or anything like that, I'm just sick of this American politic propaganda and manipulation over people. All can be summarized in just 5 minutes of this movie- If you really think that in real life marines would free 3 tali-bans like that, knowing that in the next 5 minutes 300 tali-bans will be chasing them - you need to think over and you probably belong to that group of people that will enjoy this movie.So to conclude, this is one bad movie. However if you are murican, you will probably like it- so go ahead and enjoy it. For me, a poor 2/10- only for Mark Wahlberg and decent effects and makeup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real deal, imperfect and untidy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's who my son was. That's how hard he fought. Make sure you get that right." Danny Dietz's (Emile Hirsch) fatherWe know from the beginning and the title, Lone Survivor, that Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) is the only one to make it out from ill-fated Afghanistan mission, Operation Redwings, in 2005. Three of the four SEALs die in an ambush. Knowing how it will turn out does not diminish the impact of this powerful docudrama, in which the ambiguities and allegiances of that conflict are knowingly and realistically disclosed.Sure, some of the clichés from WWII combat movies are still alive and kicking such as the obligatory back stories about families, loves, and horses, all laid out in the first half hour to add the human touch. The film succeeds in connecting us, perhaps because it does not overdo the sentimentality or the background music. The scenes of SEAL training are also a part of the genre but appropriate for verifying the four as fighting machines.When Lone Survivor gets to the mission to eventually assassinate the infamous Taliban leader Ahmad Shahd, it is meticulous with the details of the special-forces movements and machinery. When the ambush of the SEALs begins in full, the gradual degradation of the situation for the vastly outnumbered Seals seems authentic if not overdone in the large number of Afghans the SEALs kill.The interesting question about this type of war film is whether or not it's all about the stars who play the real-life heroes. Although Mark Wahlberg can't hide his cinematic persona, his role is much more than preening because his part shows best the need for a brotherhood to develop to survive in the field. Wahlberg succeeds making us sympathize with him as a caring soldier, not just a movie star.At the early planning stage, Matt "Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster) remarks there are "a lot of moving parts" to the military planning. With the failure of communications and Apache helicopter backup, his comment is a death knell, and not just because of the rugged terrain (New Mexico) or unreliable locals. As a metaphor for the arguable merits of the Afghanistan invasion, Lone Survivor completes its mission. As a recruitment vehicle for Navy SEALs, not so much. It's too rough out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mini Black Hawk Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A visceral display of streaming bullets and gory bloodshed, Lone Survivor follows a botched military operation with relentless intensity. It portrays the unforgiving struggle as the four stranded NAVY SEALs climb and jump for their survival in punishing hostile territory. The movie does a good job of not excessively use special effects, action feels more realistic with restriction on design, make up and practical effect. While it boasts military lingo and thick atmosphere of exclusive brotherhood, the movie manages to convey the sacrifice to the audience.The movie is a dramatization of an actual failed mission which left the four men team behind enemy line in Afghanistan. Mark Wahlberg is at his element as Marcus Luttrell, he thrives more in an arduous action movie. Stoic and with grit, he produces more natural rendition in this type of role. The cast of recon team could use more characterization as sometimes they might fall into stereotypical macho soldier. However, as the movie progresses and these men engage in battle of attrition and moral, they perform more compellingly in extreme situation.There is a raw primal feeling at work as they are shot endlessly. It's a grueling and exhausting process; the sensation of utmost emergency is almost as engaging as what Black Hawk Down had to offer, although in smaller scale. The way the shootout is portrayed, by visual and audio, is impeccably organic. Whiffs of nearby bullets sound intimately closely, the flesh tearing hits are even more so. The movie understands how to build up exhilaration while the protagonists fade with every hit they take.It reaches its height in the second act; the latter part does tend to falter. The pace loses a bit of steam towards the end, even though it makes a decent conclusion. Most time goes to reenact the gruesome battle and it's done justly, but there could be more effort made for the buildup as well. Audience might not follow the mission well as it's peppered with military terminology or the geography of Afghanistan, the movie could clarify the position and movement clearer.There are flaws, but in essence Lone Survivor succeeds in portraying a courageous act. It's patriotic without being preachy; instead it delivers with tightly packed action and sheer tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor further goes into the war genre, however it being a true story adds emotion and further intrigue to this film. The sound and music played through out the film is captivating as well as the story unfolding. The story is inspiring and will appeal to large audiences however, the way the movie was presented was in a way where I myself and many people have seen before in a war movie. The story is touching and really shows the nature of the cruel Taliban as well the grit and fight of the American Army. There were no stand out performances and it just didn't blow my mind as some War movies do e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Apocalypse Now etc. but it is safe to say 'Lone Survivor' is this generations Black Hawk Down. In summation, it is a well filmed movie, done by Peter Berg with up and coming actors as well as Mark Wahlberg. Only 7/10</fullReview>

The grueling Navy S.E.A.L. training of LONE SURVIVOR's opening credits is OBSOLETE today. Gamegirl's drone can pick out the Taliban leader "with no earlobes" and liquidate him with a Hellfire Missile without her P.J.'s needing to soak up any sweat. When you balance the cost of Gamegirl's training and salary against the drilling, equipment, transportation, health care, and survivor benefits of Marky Mark's S.E.A.L. squad (one of whom whines "HOW can the Taliban move faster than us?!" just before he expires), Gamegirl costs we taxpayers LESS THAN 10% as much as one of those self-styled Supermen. S.E.A.L.s are great for propaganda movies, but even LONE SURVIVOR shows them moving like 90-year-old grannies with walkers (weighed down by tons of excess equipment) compared to the locals, who pick them off one by one while moving with the nimbleness of the goats they herd (though these Taliban can't shoot well enough to hit the broad side of a barn). Gamegirl doesn't know one word of the local language halfway around the world, but neither does Marky Mark's S.E.A.L. character in LONE SURVIVOR. I don't mind paying to watch movie S.E.A.L.s, but subsidizing real-life ones is another story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Berg seems to be trying to hard to imitate Michael Bay. Whereas Battleship was effectively a Bay version of a film based on a toy, here we see the same type of bombastic and patriotic tones that Bay likes to indulge in.Based on true events, Lone Survivor follows Marks Wahlberg and his Navy SEAL team try to hunt down a Taliban Leader. However they encounter some goat herders and decide whether to kill them or not. However these scene itself causes discomfort as the herders are civilians and therefore killing them is in breach of the Geneva convention, yet the film wants to enter a debate on war ethics. These are professional soldiers, surely this was mentioned in their training? Hold on it was mentioned in the mission briefing a few minutes earlier!As they have to abort the mission the SEALs encounter the Taliban forces and get involved in a brutal and visceral gunfight in the wild Afghan terrain which suspiciously looks like somewhere in America.Mark Walhberg, Ben Foster and Taylor Kitsch give strong performances but the film although starts off slowly then becomes scenes of constant blood-soaked fighting and running or more accurately falling down the mountain from the Taliban.There is an element of war porn in this film with the prolonged battle scenes as the SEALs are repeatedly getting shot. It starts as soldiers goofing around but once the action begins there is an emphasis of a band of brothers but there is something hollow about this film even with the latter storyline of getting help from Pushtun villagers does not overcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Are We Doing in Afghanistan?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lone Survivor" is a brutal, graphic, combat movie. It depicts US Navy SEALs fighting against Taliban in Afghanistan in 2007. It is based on Marcus Luttrell's book of the same title. There is very little plot. The movie opens with scenes of Navy SEALs undergoing rigorous training. Trainees are shown lying down under oncoming ocean waves, being dunked in water so that they cannot breathe, doing pushups, etc. After this brief segment, the film sets up each SEAL team member. They are shown to be lovable guys who have families back home whom they cherish and who cherish them. One SEAL wants to buy his fiancée an Arabian horse. Another is concerned about his wife's redecorating in a color called "honeydew." Given Marcus Luttrell's fame and the title of the movie, most people will know how this movie ends. That knowledge gives these scenes that much more poignancy, but also a sense of the director manipulating the audience. We know what's coming, and we know why the director included these scenes. The SEALs are assigned to assassinate Taliban commander Ahmad Shah. They are shown with all their gear, penetrating a steep mountain covered with pines and strewn with boulders. They see their target, and are ready to carry out their mission. They are discovered by three Afghan goat herders. They consider killing the goat herders, but Luttrell advises against it. If they kill the goat herders, they will be condemned on CNN as bestial Americans who assassinate Afghan civilians. Immediately after the soldiers release the goat herders, the goat herders inform the Taliban of their location. They Taliban quickly surround, outnumber, and begin firing on the four SEALs. The firefight is depicted in graphic, brutal, realistic images. A SEAL is shown aiming his weapon, firing, and a Taliban's turbaned head explodes into a squirting fountain of red liquid. Bullets penetrate flesh and blood and gore ooze out. This gunfight is lengthy and tense. I have to ask how it will affect viewers. Will viewers want to get a gun and make someone's head explode? Yes, our media is saturated with violence. Is that a good thing? Have we given up even asking this question? The film never addresses the larger questions at play, and by not addressing them, they become all the louder. What are we doing in Afghanistan? How do we win in Afghanistan? Are we wasting the lives of fine, patriotic Americans and other allied men and women in uniform? Not to mention the polio workers, doctors and other aid workers the Taliban murders in Afghanistan? How about the rules of engagement? If we are at war in Afghanistan, then why aren't we acting as if we are at war? Should the goat herders not have been immediately killed, thus possibly saving many soldiers' lives and leading to a successful mission ? the death or capture of Ahmad Shah? If soldiers are forced to conduct a war while wearing kid gloves, how can they be expected to win? What if we had imposed these rules of engagement on our soldiers during WW II? Would they have been able to win that war? Would the swastika not still be flying in Europe as we engaged in endless talks with our "partners for peace"? Again, none of this is discussed in the film, making the discussion all the louder inside the viewer's head. In fact there was some controversy when CNN's Jake Tapper asked Marcus Luttrell about the "Senseless" deaths depicted in the film. Marcus Luttrell asserted that no, the deaths depicted in the film were not senseless. Americans are asking this, though. What are we doing in Afghanistan?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run-of-the-Mill Representation of American Warfare in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could get enthusiastic about LONE SURVIVOR. Peter Berg's direction is both terse and non-partisan, portraying the sheer hell of Americans trying to fight in an alien territory against an elusive opponent. Led by Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), a small group of troops are left alone to fight for their lives in an atmosphere fraught with danger; this is memorably evoked through fast cuts and the use hand-held cameras emphasizing the peril that they are faced with. The actors are excellent, especially Wahlberg and Taylor Kitsch as his fellow-soldier Taylor Kitsch. On the other hand LONE SURVIVOR is inscribed within wearyingly familiar binarist terms; the Taleban are represented as both savage and ruthless, as opposed to the more humanist American forces. The fact that the Americans are invading another territory is conveniently overlooked. The motive for the mission - to kill a notorious Taleban leader Ahmad Shah - is justifiable (from an American perspective), but experience might demonstrate that a so-called "terrorist" from an American perspective might fulfill a quite different role in other contexts. Nor does the film actively question why the American forces are in Afghanistan; what their motives are; and what the final outcome of their occupation might be. The focus instead is on the bravery of a few men rather than looking at the broader political implications of their action. Director Berg opts for a thick-ear approach, with the script regularly peppered with curses and/or gunshots in familiar war-film mode.</fullReview>

There is more to operation read wings then was described here. This story could have been in the same class as Saving Private Ryan but it had none of the elements that made that show great. The action scenes where fantastic. The realism was top notch. The acting was a 10 star performance. The story was empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jingoism Never Had A Finer Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert. Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. This movie is based on a book of the same title by Marcus Luttrell and assistance by Patrick Robinson. The screenplay was written by the director Peter Berg. Of all the people listed as being involved with the book or the movie, only Luttrell has any experience with special operations. That said:Like all efforts to depict the "reality" of warfare or war fighting operations, a lot of romanticism is involved. Also besides the base story, writers and directors try to make statements using the situation of the book or movie as a backdrop to the message they want to convey. In this effort, the message is obvious: In a war of insurgents, it's difficult to tell friend from foe and allegiances crop up in the most unlikely places. The plot is simple: Four Navy Seals are sent on a mission to "scout" the whereabouts of a Taliban leader and take him out, call in air support or call for air support and a Quick Reaction Force (QRF.) Their job is to terminate the chief but as life can be a series of mishaps, so can well planned operations. There is a scene where the new guy is hazed. He has to do that crazy dance from "Napoleon dynamite." That dance has become a "right of passage" kind of event. Here, it didn't fit but may have been factual. Hazing is common when new people are brought into existing structures. Spec Ops teams are tight. I never witnessed anything like this but times have changed. Mostly it was a test of drinking ability not dancing. From the appearance of the planning in the movie and the book, this was not a well planned op. Problems arose and these lead one to believe that the unit involved operated with such a high level of confidence and hubris that simple precautions went out the window. It's the kind of thinking that led to the mess at Benghazi. There is a long history of special operations recon protocol. There have been hundreds of books written about "how to" do it and "how not" to do it. These guys, unfortunately appeared to take whole chapters from the "How Not" to do it book. Communications broke down even before the mission made contact with the objective. There was no backup comm plan other than open or unrestricted satellite (SAT) phones that would not have been part of the TOE of the unit. But there are other problems, the whole way they moved in the daytime might make for a good movie but if the team operated as they did by walking ridges, often allowing themselves to be profiled against a bright blue sky, not using any of the natural cover the AO afforded and not having any map or satellite photo of the AO and surrounding territory so if things went bad, they would have a way out, no medical supplies and not enough water to sustain a team member who became exhausted due to any number of factors. This is supposed to be a story, in part, about the brave US soldiers prevailing against a larger number force of insurgents led by a really nasty guy who we want for any number of reasons. They make a heroic stand but this is no Alamo where a stand was are based on principles. But bravery is interesting. Is a soldier brave who enters into a conflict with overwhelming technological superiority? Is the fighter brave who wears no armor, has limited ammunition and training, marginal communications and even less medical support? What constitutes bravery? In this movie, the bravest role is that played by the villager who helps Luttrell, the lone SEAL survivor after a Taliban attack on the team, avoid the Taliban. In the film, his whole village is threatened with destruction if he does not hand over Luttrell. His defiance was a real act of bravery if indeed it played out as depicted. But again, an opportunity missed in the search for that "atta boy" attitude that so permeated "Rescue Dawn." Now it might seem that the Seal team members were brave and they certainly displayed heroics. SEALs are highly trained, professional soldiers. They are some of the best soldiers in the world. This type of operation is their bread and butter. But nothing they do as part of their job is as brave as the villager who defied the Taliban to give aid and comfort to the enemy. This whole defiant line could have been used to make this an important movie but while it is touched on, it's more of an opportunity missed and that is a huge miss. Yes the story of the Seal team is compelling but so was "Bravo Two Zero" about the British SAS team that suffered a similar fate of a botched operation except they were captured and tortured. As far as action, the movie holds your attention but with each compounding mistake one finds a lot of head slapping. Acting was fine with no "American" standing out. Of note is Rohand Chand who played the son of the Afghan who stood up to the Tals. There was more expression in his face and body language than most of the rest of the actors in the movie. M5. Is it really what happened? Probably not but Paladin Press publishes hundred of books in this kind of genre. There is a market for unrestricted jingoism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another SImplistic Military Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is about Operation Red wings. It was a Navy Seal operation conducted to take out a Taliban commander named Ahmad Shah. The operation was a complete failure. It wound of costing the lives of every person involved aside from one person. His name is Marcus Luttrell. I guess that makes the title a spoiler.There are spoilers ahead in my review, so don't read further if that bothers you. I will say that it will probably not affect your viewing experience.From an entertainment standpoint, I think this film delivers. Unfortunately, if you want something deeper than the average run of the mill military experience, this film falls flat. Peter Berg could have made this film into something greater, but he made a product which is more about telling a story rather than taking on serious issues and creating debate.The big issue I had is that the film does not take on the fact that America has not learned its lessons when it comes to the country of Afghanistan. There was an Afghani man, Mohammad Gulab, who put his family's life on the line by saving Marcus from the Taliban. What thanks does he get from the Americans at the end of the film? They take Marcus away to their base and abandon the man and his family at the battle zone to defend himself against the Taliban. The Taliban knew he harbored and aided an American, so his and his loved one's lives were in danger. The military did not care.I guess history repeats itself. After the Soviet Union retreated many years earlier, America abandoned its ally and moved on. A vast uneducated and young population was left alone. They struggled and fought with each other as the country fell into chaos.Fast forward to Operation Redwing and the same thing happens again. A guy who put his life on the line for you is left to fend for himself. What if the Aghanis heard that story? I would think it would not win their hearts and minds, but it would lead them to believe that they should support the Taliban. The US may leave one day, but they will be stuck having to deal with their own people after they depart. I think that is why it is very hard for the American military to win their trust now.This brings me to my next point. Mohammad Gulab, follows a tribal code known as pushtunwali. When he brings Marcus to his village, it is his duty to protect him from his enemies and not let him die at their hands. I know in the American media it is always shown that Afghan tribalism is a backward way of life, but, maybe, this movie could have changed that one-sided view.For me it shows that tribalism is not all about oppressing women, but it has some positive aspects to it as well. The fact that someone was willing to put their life on the line for a foreigner serving in an opposing military proves that this code is very strictly followed. Is honor that strong of a trait in the American way of life? I think that is a very interesting subject to debate. At the very least, it proves that life is not as simplistic in Afghanistan as it is made out to be by the media.Finally, Ahmed Shah is called "a real bad guy" in the film when he is first introduced in the film. Is he? Keep in mind, he is not a member of Al Quaida, the group run by Osama Bin Laden, who attacked us during 9/11. He is a member of the Taliban, who are mainly members of the Pushtun tribe. They are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.In the film, he is portrayed as a target. He does not have any pertinent dialogue to the film. What if, instead of the usual portrayal of a bad guy, they make him more complex? He could have been portrayed as a guy who is trying to get an occupying army out of his country. Well, of course no one will ever do that. That just too hard to accomplish. Hollywood is about having clear cut good and bad guys.I guess the good thing for me is that the movie has propelled me to order the book authored by Marcus Luttrell. If it's one thing I've learned about Hollywood, it is the fact that the book is, usually, better and more detailed and complex than the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say that this is NOT a high budget Hollywood movie that glorifies war. It is a tribute to the story of the brave soldiers that died during Operation Redwing. The movie will bring you up close and personal on the mountain with four Navy Seals and their ordeal with a Taliban ambush.This story could easily have been made into a PG-13 feel-good Hollywood blockbuster, but it would have been a disservice to the soldiers that died. The action sequences are brutal, gory, and real... as is war.The movie follows Marcus Luttrell's book pretty closely, though some parts were omitted... as is needed to make a book into a movie. That said, all the key points of the story were covered.To any soldiers that may be reading this, Thank you for your service.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr Wahlberg knows how to make action hits. He's an action star, but more so, can act. He's one of the most misjudged actors I've ever seen. Here, he's at his most dramatic best, thick beard and all, surrounded by other fine performers, the underrated Emilie Hirsh, Taylor Kitcsh, and Australia's own Eric (Chopper) Bana. Here, Wahlberg plays real life, lone survivor, Marcus somebody, part of anti terrorist squad, on a failed mission, due to bad radio connections, but more so a fatal one out of three decision, that soon sees the squad, outnumbered by the Taliban. Outnumbered is a tame word here too. Making the one out of three call, is a tough one too, some of it involving procedure, other parts of it, sparing the safety of the squad. The photography and direction are number one. Some parts of this movie, I warn you are incredibly tense and ugly. Working through story, step by step, in the factual events that occurred, through the real life 2005 incident, the movie comes off as top floor story/filmmaking of this genre. Probably in a couple of ways, it's better than last years, Zero Dark Thirty. I'll be honest, as a quality war film, it's better than I'd thought it'd be. When it opens, I advise you to see it. You'll be pleasantly surprised, but also by it, being directed by Peter Berg who brought that guilty pleasure-blacker than black comedy, Very Bad Things. A great way to start off the movies of 2014, but too The Wolf Of Wall Street, opens the same day here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...who have no idea WTF they're talking about. If you haven't served as a SEAL, then you have zero business even commenting about any special forces aspect of this film nor any knowledge about what is and is not accurate, proper, or relevant in that arena. Further, if you haven't served in the military and in any armed conflict, then you have zero business commenting about the military and war aspects of this film.As for the quality of the movie from a cinema, acting, and story - fire way - but otherwise, contain your comments to what you know. That said, I served in the Navy - I love the Navy and the SEALs but I hate war and much of what we've done, as a Country, for the last decade or so WRT the military, our troops, and other citizens of this planet. Those feelings have kept me from embracing tales and movies that I suspect may glamorize the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and with this one, I felt especially that it might go down that path. However, I took the plunge and was not disappointed. This story does nothing to glamorize anything about war but does center squarely on the brotherhood and what hell can and will become your reality when Murphy (the law - not the SEAL) rears his ugly head. It is also about survival, dedication, and most of all - honor - both with the SEALs and the Afghanis. All in all, this movie is well done - has good acting and story-telling - and is an incredible story even if part of it is not 100% accurate.If you're looking for real-world SEAL depiction, then this may or may not be it - real SEALs know far better than I. But if you're looking for a killer story told very well, then you've hit pay dirt...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty competent action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though it's not a sequel, Lone Survivor has various similarities with the film Act of Valor. The fluid camera, the realism of military procedures and the raw brutality of the battle scenes make it transcend the action genre, and make it a docudrama which also works as a tribute to the relentless determination and training of the soldiers. And even though the cast of Lone Survivor includes many famous actors (Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Eric Bana and Ben Foster), their performances are natural enough in order to preserve the illusion of realism, supported by excellent make-up effects which almost make us feel the pain of the wounds, and by semi-documentary cinematography which emulates the disorientation and chaos of the combat. Having said that, a movie about the Afghanistan war with such a patriotic nature could be classified as simple propaganda, and unavoidably wakes some doubts about the validity of that conflict and the justification of North American interventions. However, I think Lone Survivor managed to keep itself aside from any political position, focusing on the discipline from the SEALS and the terrible decisions they have to take under very difficult circumstances. On the negative side, Lone Survivor gets excessively sentimental on the ending, and that feels a bit incongruent with the sober tone of the rest of the movie; besides, I think a few characters could have been a bit more developed. Nevertheless, that doesn't avoid me from recommending this very competent action film. As a comparison point, I liked Lone Survivor a bit less than Act of Valor, but much more than Zero Dark Thirty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty war movie with a heavy sense of realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is the depiction of a navy mission that fails and leaves the men entrusted to carry it out in an out gunned fight with a huge taliban force. Based on real events, the movie is presented with a fantastic sense of realism. This is a war movie at its best and the scenes leave nothing to imagination. Whether it's the terrible effects of the explosions or the cringe worthy wounds these men suffer, you will find yourself very attached to what's going on. All the performances are equally and resoundingly superb. Throughout the whole ordeal the bond these soldiers share will be tested and in the end it will triumph despite the obvious consequences.This is usually a genre that doesn't do it for me. I like most of the films and some are exquisitely better than others (E.G: Saving Private Ryan). What makes this one a little more interesting than others is the incredible courage of these man and the sacrifices some of them made. Lone Survivor is about as real as a war movie will get nowadays. I certainly understand the praise and is deserved. On a personal note it is merely yet another movie I enjoyed due to great entertainment values.Rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was great. I loved how it told the story through action. The suspense was thrilling and I thought the director did a great job of showing the passion of the Seals that were being portrayed. In all, I think this movie does a great job of honoring those brave men who lost their lives fighting for our country. It was very entertaining, and even though I'm not a huge action fan, It kept my attention the entire time. I also appreciated the fact that the director made sure to emphasize the kindness of the man who aided him. It is a step in the right direction to stop prejudice in our country. Overall, this movie is a great choice for anyone wanting to see a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Long Visceral Combat Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not much of a storyline to Lone Survivor directed by Peter Berg. Just based on the title alone, we are already fully aware of the film's ending. A Four man team goes into battle. Three of them die. Only One survives. The pre-action first act is pretty weak. It's the same old ultra-patriotic, Navy Seal prestige banter complete with a rookie giving a front-of-the-class speech defining his role as a Seal Diver. In the mission briefing the target Afghans are portrayed as cliché plot devices. Never is there a mention that these Afghan's are actual humans whose country the Seals are currently occupying, and are currently planning to kill. Scenes like these are not usually later redeemed, but as soon as the four Seals drop into the field, the tone of the film changes.What makes the film Lone Survivor a good film is 100% in its execution. The performances of all the actors, the special effects and stunts, the lighting and the sound, the fancy camera work and exotic scenery, the violence, equal the actual enactment: a very powerful, non-partisan, grim portrayal of modern ground combat.Once dropped in the field, the Seals encounter innocent civilians. Faced with the ethical decision of whether to execute them or free them, the Seals let them go. This is truly a controversial choice. Acting differently surely would have produced a different, less deadly outcome (for the Seals at least). Any logical viewer will afterwards struggle to justify why the Seals made the choice they did. Why would they sacrifice themselves for the innocents? It is almost nonsense, but in war decisions are made on the fly, and this is what happened.Within minutes the freed civilians alert the troops, and an army of hundreds of heavily armed men surround the group of 4. This when the action starts.It begins with the exchange of long-range rifle fire but soon the Seals are surrounded and flanked fiercely. As the battle shifts positions we encounter scenes where Seals must make split second decisions between particularly gruesome tasks. Which is less likely to kill me? Pushing forward and engaging in fire where I am extremely outnumbered, or throwing myself down this 50 foot rock face? The unfolding of this battle, and that is to say two-thirds of the film, really cannot be described in words. The battle truly is the film. It is an attempt at the depicting the intensity of real combat, and myself having zero experience in real combat, I think Peter Berg is very successful in portraying it. Their radio signals having been lost, their back-up firepower having failed them, and every other piece of bad luck imaginable having occurred, the battle ends. The Seals literally having fought to their deaths.Getthebonesaw.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it was a toss up between grand piano and lone survivor. the latter won due to movie timings as well as the fact that mark wahlberg and emile hirsch was in it. from the time i sat down to the roll of the end credits it was a movie that transported me to the throes of humanity and how we see situations differently. no one is painted an enemy but we adapt and thus the same people we let go at times comes back to haunt us and if we don't have friends who have our back we are just forgotten. the cinematography and the background score was mesmerizing. the fact that it is a true story and well depicted by the four band of brothers as well as the other casts. hats of too peter berg for yet another star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Berg Redeems Himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the mega flop "Battleship", I thought that Peter Berg would probably not follow this up with anything worth my time, but man am I glad to have been proved wrong. Rarely do I find myself drawn to a war movie, but this grabbed me and put me right in the middle of the action.This movie had to have been one of the most intense movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in quite some time. The gunshots, the explosions everything sounded so genuine, so real. And it was good enough to be acknowledged by the Academy! Mark Wahlberg gave what I consider to be his best performance, and he was helped by incredibly talented actors such as Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Taylor Kitsch and Eric Bana.Not having read the book, I don't know if it followed the book directly, but from what I've been told it was pretty spot on with the exception of the ending in the village.This movie was in my opinion snubbed by the academy, it got two very well deserved nominations for sound, but the editing was top notch, visual effects were solid, acting was right on target, best picture wise, maybe with a little more persuading.All in all, Berg did redeem himself with this effort, hopefully he can keep it up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite dangerous and thrilling, but not as epic as Zero Dark Thirty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though not as epic as Zero Dark Thirty, Peter Berg bounds back from the failure of Battleship to make this moderate budget action kicks into a great patriotism and moral value film in this traditional quiet box office month. The art of inserting the life of SEALS and to reveal the after life at the immediate of the story work well, turning the film into an emotional set piece better than Act of Valor. Based on a true story being modified onto a big screen, the sense of danger starts to relay from the appearance of the first huge numbers of Taliban forces until the end of the last scene.Overall, good film to check out in the theater in this boring January.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action scenes that should thrill any war film junkie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'LONE SURVIVOR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Peter Berg's new war film, based on the book of the same name by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson. The book is based on Luttrell's real-life experiences as a Navy SEAL during the War in Afghanistan. The movie focuses on a (failed) four-man mission, he was involved in, to capture a Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. Berg wrote, produced and directed the film (as well as has a cameo in it, like most of his movies) and Mark Wahlberg stars as Luttrell. The film also features Taylor Kitsch (who also worked with Berg in 'BATTLESHIP' and the TV show 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS'), Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Eric Bana and Alexander Ludwig in supporting roles. It's an exciting action movie and a nice tribute to our soldiers; another impressive achievement from Peter Berg (after a slight misstep with 'BATTLESHIP').The 2007 book 'Lone Survivor' begins with Marcus Luttrell's enlistment (in 1999) and also focuses on his training and deployment to Afghanistan (in 2005). Berg decided the movie should only detail the failed Navy SEAL mission he was involved in, called 'Operation Red Wings', to capture Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami), a notorious Taliban leader. In that assignment Luttrell (Wahlberg) was part of a four-man reconnaissance team which also included LT Michael P. Murphy (Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Hirsch) and Matthew Axelson (Foster). In the film the men must take on 50 Taliban soldiers (in reality it was a lot less, some say as little as 8 to 10).Like most of Berg's movies the film is action-packed for most of it's running time (at least the entire second half) and the war scenes are brutal and violent. They're of course filmed in a very cinematic way but Berg did have multiple war veterans as technical advisors (as he usually does), including Luttrell. The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is all more than adequate. The character development is very minimal and there's not really much of a story but it still drives home it's message of camaraderie and brotherhood. It has a lot of heart and action scenes that should thrill any war film junkie. For fans of Berg or war flicks it shouldn't be missed!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Tough Survivors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was not a disappointment. It's not quite the same caliber as "Black Hawk Down" or Berg's "The Kingdom", but not a disappointment. The tragic scenario doesn't lend itself to much more than is here. There is some comradeship and chemistry very briefly in the beginning when the Navy soldiers first wake up and talk about wives, family, etc. They are then told their mission will commence later in the day. Due to some mistakes, poor planning, poor technology, and bad luck the group of four elite soldiers never really get a chance to be successful. There are not really any phases of the mission that go well and some quick reconnaissance and surveying quickly turns to unfortunate turn of events.When the going gets tough, these soldiers don't quickly get going anywhere. Though they are quickly outnumbered ad faced with dire circumstances, they don't ever abandon their brothers and they don't surrender, even after falling down 1/2 mile of mountains, breaking multiple bones, acquiring numerous lacerations, and many bullet holes. The resiliency is quite impressive and the heart of the story. Watching the complications unfold, it made me angry at the mistakes made during this mission and the seemingly small things that if would've been slightly adjusted may have led to a totally different result. The end of the story is not a surprise, based on the title, but the unfolding of how this happens does add some more plot and suspense at the end of the film. As the credits roll, photos of the soldiers involved in the mission, many who gave their lives. I felt nothing but gratitude for the country we live in and the soldiers who sacrifice their freedoms and lives for us every day throughout the entire film. Very humbling.</fullReview>

Maybe it's in all of us, just waiting for someone, or something, to draw it out. God-loving family men who were raised to do special things. I have had the good fortune to meet Marcus, twice actually. Finer, braver men have never lived. These men put everything they had into their duty to this country. Watching this story, I felt proud. I had a lump in my throat the entire movie. I love these guys for what they did, and still do today.Special men do special things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film began, I feared that I was going to be disappointed...but I was so wrong. The opening sequences certainly set the tone of what was to follow. The acting and setting of the war in Afghanistan came across as 100% believable, and it brought home the bravery of Navy Seals under unimaginable conditions. I am not an American, but was so in awe of the bravery of the real people who are honored in "Lone Survivor". Mark Wahlberg grows in every movie he appears, and is brilliant, as is Taylor Kirsch as his superior officer. Good to see Eric Bana too. I must disagree with another reviewer who felt the credits at the end were not suitable - I felt they added quite brilliantly to the veracity and emotion of a very fine Movie. I fully recommend seeing it-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of Operation Red Wings, 2005, LONE SURVIVOR is gripping, well-acted, and well-filmed. It shows in no uncertain terms what it's like to train and fight in an outfit like the Navy Seals. Lots of death and violence, but no really blatant gore.LONE SURVIVOR is too grimly realistic to function simply as a cheesy war thriller, which is good. Still, shoot-'em-up scenes in the mountains of Afghanistan very much predominate. That, of course, was mostly what ORW consisted of: Some will like this quality of the film while others won't. Nevertheless, LONE SURVIVOR would have been better if there had been more back-story on local Taliban leader Ahmad Shah's activities, as well as more on the specific politics of the region and the operation. More of an alternating focus on the Seals, the Taliban, and the neighboring villagers would also have been a plus.One small but glaring anachronism: Rattlesnakes? In Afghanistan?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true story recounted with compelling graphic depiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not counting this one, out of the last 10 movies I watched, 7 are based on true stories. This is clearly the norm these days. "Lone survivor" stand out, not while you are watching, but at the end, when you see real photos and videos of the people in the movie (three of them killed). The uncanny resemblance of the actors with the real people reflects a good casting job. The important thing though is that seeing these images added considerably to the meaning of the movie.This is "Operation Red Wings" in June 2005 in which 4 SEALs took up a mission in the Afghanistan Hindu Kush mountains to take out a Taliban leader. The mission ended in terrible tragedy, with not only 3 people of the team killed, but a devastating addition to the casualty toll when a supporting helicopter crashed after being hit by anti-tank artillery.This gritty account does not play with spoiler teasers. The opening scene showing a blood-drenched SEAL Marcus Luttrell (Mark Walhberg) being rushed from a landing helicopter to the operation room neatly removes the titular suspense. Freed from the spoiler effect, the audience is prepared for going through this harrowing experience almost first-hand, with our protagonist.A few significant things emerged. First, in my technology-ignorance, I find it hard to believe that in the day and age when a satellite camera can see me in the privacy of my own home (even by bending around a solid angle of obstacle, I'm told), the protagonist in open air experiences failure to establish contact with mission base which was one factor causing the tragedy. The key reason, however, is a moral issue. When accidentally stumbled across (literally) by civilians (including both a child and an old man), the protagonist find themselves in a debate (not philosophical but rather pragmatic) on whether to disregard terms of engagement and "terminate" these threats or let them go free thereby endangering their own lives. Finally, the thing that touched me most is that our lone survivor is miraculously found and harboured by friendly villages who, following their long-established moral code, goes all the way in protecting a helpless "guest" to the extent of risking annihilation by the Taliban. Mark Walhberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch deliver a solid performance in losing themselves into the characters (real individuals, in this case) they portray. Eric Banner's role as the commander at mission base is a little more than a cameo, but not much so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is a thrilling and tragic movie about the navy seal going into Afghanistan on an army mission to knock out the Taliban leader. Mark Wahlberg is excellent as always in his action/dramatic acting as well with his fellow actors and actresses that play in the movie. Lone Survivor is an American war film. The teams members are heroes, the Taliban are enemies, and the heroes are able to fight on like in video games or movies. For the opening 40 minutes, it is a somewhat cheesy show of soldier's bravado and training, but it works. Incorporating real footage of the Navy Seals mixed with the actors lets viewers feel for the real life persons and their portrayed characters in the film. Soon after though, they are dropped into enemy territory on an operation to take out a Taliban leader. The mission goes awry when they encounter a small group of locals there, and they are faced with the decision of killing them and letting go. From here, the intensity begins to climb. What is the right thing to do? What would you do? Faced with that moral situation, they decide to cut them loose - soon after, Taliban forces are hot on their tail. Lone Survivor further goes into the war genre; however it being a true story adds emotion and further intrigue to this film. The sound and music played throughout the film is captivating as well as the story unfolding. The story is inspiring and will appeal to large audiences however; the way the movie was presented was in a way where I myself and many people have seen before in a war movie. The story is touching and really shows the nature of the cruel Taliban as well the grit and fight of the American Army. There were no stand out performances and it just didn't blow my mind as some War movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jake Wallock ENGL 110 MA 1 Kopplin February 17th 2014 Lone Survivor Brings Tears to TheatersImagine yourself crashing down the side of mountain in Afghanistan to avoid the ultimate sacrifice and lose your own life fighting for your country. Lone Survivor attacks the hearts and souls of its viewers as it recaps the true story events that took place in 2005, as four Navy Seals set out on, "Operation Red Wings" to kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shahd. Director Peter Berg brings you into the personal lives of each seal before they embark on the unforeseen disaster of a mission. Your heart will not stop pounding, as the Seals retreat down the mountain while fighting off the infuriated Taliban. The film brings the patriot out of everyone in the theater as well as a few tears as the thought of these hero's families burns in the bottom of your heart. Director Peter Berg doesn't use much film time to give you background on the Seal's lives. But it is used to capture your heart for these men. The movie opens with real footage of recruit Seals in boot camp. The sight of the mental and physical toughness required to become a seal drives home the sacrifice these soldiers make to defend their country. Mark Wahlberg stars in the movie as Marcus Luttrell, a hard-nosed fighter with a love for his country and his brothers that fight along side him. Peter Berg quickly makes navy seal Michael Murphy a fan favorite at heart by portraying his love for his fiancé. What woman doesn't love a man willing to spend 10 grand on a wedding gift? Matthew Axelson and Danny Dietz, the other two seals from the four-man team, are introduced at the base camp. Here the viewer has a chance to witness the family mentality that these men have with each other as they argue like children and compete like brothers. The movie shifts quickly into action as the men find themselves on a mountain in Afghanistan. The special effects of booming gun fire, horrifying explosions, and the sight of soldiers tumbling down the rocky, unforgiving mountain is painstakingly realistic. The filming of the movie was flawless. It captured the terrifying reality of war and took the viewers on an emotional roller coaster of thrill, hope, and grievance. The camera shifts from third to first person perspectives of the seals, making the viewer feel the fear and determination that is flowing through the veins of these warriors. Not to mention the slide show paying tribute to fallen soldiers that concludes the movie to send you out of the theater with a heavy heart. This film could not have been complete with out the ingenious acting performed by Mark Wahlberg. He makes the audience cringe at the though of his unbearable pain, and cry at the compassion he shows for his friends. Wahlberg's performance is supported by an outstanding script written by Peter Berg, filled with patriotic quotes that send shivers up any American's back. Perhaps, the character Matthew Axelson played by Ben Foster said the best quote of the movie. While his back was against the wall and it seemed all hope was lost Ben says with determination, "You can die for your country, I'm going to live for mine", Cleverly twisting George S. Patton's quote and sending a shock of pride through the theater. Lone Survivor is a must see movie for any action or patriotic movie enthusiast. The film will have you questioning humanity, and with a whole new respect for our veterans. Bring a box of tissues to this one folks, because Lone Survivor aims straight for your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a film to be enjoyed. Moved, rattled or stirred are more appropriate descriptions of experiencing this movie. As a war movie on it's own merits it is very engaging. Like Titanic and Apollo 13 it is not engaging from a perspective of wondering how it will turn out. The title of the film leaves little doubt there. When the fighting begins it is very intense. Although it is similar depiction of military-style engagements, the feeling is much different. The big difference in this movie is that you know for sure that each character represented was a real person. As only four soldiers are the main focus, each death is particular emotional. The depiction of these events can get quite graphic. We saw a couple leave the theater. Our assumption was that the male was a vet or active service. I can't say I relate from that perspective. But just knowing that these were real people made it a bit uncomfortable to sit through this movie. It does however open your eyes to what some soldiers face. Not just the extreme battle and survival elements, but even impossible decisions. Knowing the outcome, you almost wanted to yell at the screen when they made the decision that led to events in the movie. Kind of like those horror movies when you want to tell the person to not open that door or go up those stairs etc... Only this was much different. You want to tell them to do differently but you realize that the decision made makes you proud that men like that represent the US. The end of the movie helps a great deal in dealing with what you have witnessed. The sequence before the credits is very tasteful and moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistent and jingoistic, but it has good points to make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Berg had to sell his soul to Universal and direct Battleship before he was able to make his passion project of five years Lone Survivor. And now it's made more money than Battleship ever smelt. However, it's hard to say it deserves the honour. There is a lot of passion in the project, but the material is questionable. This may be ironic given my favourite film (The Assassination of Jesse James) but when films rely on the tension of the result that they put on the poster, it's very difficult to invest for me. Captain Phillips and Argo have similar issues and severely lack tension. However, Berg can be decent, he's the guy who directed the first half of Hancock. I found myself thoroughly enjoying the first 10 minutes of Lone Survivor with its powerfully edited montage on the value of brotherhood coupled with surprisingly great cinematography. I'm a sucker for an Explosions in the Sky score too who I'm surprised that Berg has such a strong relationship with.And then I remembered this is the guy who directed the second half of Hancock. Once the story gets going, it doesn't really go anywhere. It doesn't have anywhere to go. All characters are an assortment of clichés with no development to chew on, with rare exception to Ben Foster's engaging performance. Laughably fake makeup and hair really ruins the illusion the writing doesn't give. It spends its time milking the few moral dilemmas that it has before imitating Black Hawk Down's bloodbath on a smaller scale. Suddenly the cinematography and editing I'd been enjoying turn messy. It's unfortunate, but it does pick itself back up by the end. It may be a film that lives in a jingoistic world, but its final points are to make certain exceptions to prejudice. It wants to illustrate that not all Muslims are terrorists and are the true heroes of the story. Little too late to have that open mind but it's a valuable one to have which the film delivers in a moving way even if the characters aren't as strong.6/10</fullReview>

He focus on the script and comes out with a well -made flick. Hats off to him for pulling all strings together. As you are watching the film , you will be completely engrossed thanks to the powerful script. Special mention for nice action shots along with fantastic cinematography capturing the ecstatic terrains of Afghanistan. Mark Walhberg gives in a commendable performance.

		<fullReview>I want to say I am a full supporter of our Armed Forces. I walked out of The theater without finishing this movie. I went to see it with my father and we were disappointed by this "riveting story by the man who lived it". There are do many issues with the soldiers alone. Why did they not anticipate losing radio communication? Why did the commander leave the Operation Center completely, leaving the rookie in charge. Why did aforementioned rookie calmly answer a call from someone claiming to be the special forces team they just lost contact with and, after having top secret information relayed to him to prove they are who they claim they are, calmly with no rush go wake the commander who was an entire building away? Also, if in the field you believe you have been exposed and your secrecy is in danger, you leave the area, not argue over the hostages. THEY WOULD GIVE YOU UP. Damn morals. YOU ARE BEHIND ENEMY LINES. ACT LIKE IT. Also, after each man has each taken at least 8 AK rounds, which leave a much larger exit than entry, they fall down not 1, not 2, but 3 cliffs! Each time they even manage not to lose everything they have. You also cannot put a foregrip under an M-203 grenade launcher, which would require you to drill through the tube to mount a picantinnay rail, requiring screws to be place into the tube of the M-203. If this was a true story, they shouldn't have copied the entire plot of "Tropic Thunder". I couldn't even finish the movie. There was so much wrong before it even got good. If it was possible, I would give this movie 0 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK - I finally read the book. Maybe this movie could have been better. I still think it was good - but not as excellent as I wanted it to be. It is still a very moving film ? fast paced, intense, respectful. And I do think it is an excellent testament to those willing to give their all. Unlike other similar flicks, this did not seem to be a lefty-lap-dog production sucking up to some feckless politician - I may be wrong in that account. I did finish the book and there are enough inconsistencies that a one-to-one comparison is probably warranted. The shortening of the story is what really got to me. The amount of stuff that this guy went through should have been brought out more. The intensive training Marcus went through to become a SEAL is extremely important. I also think the time spent under the protection of the Pushtun Tribe - that needed more amplification. I understand the need for embellishment, but I also think it is a bit. I also see many armchair-quarterback criticizing this motion picture. Fine, in some regards you may be correct. Gee golly - Hollywood never lies...duh. I watched this epoch (yes ? I really liked the movie) in a cinema, located some 10 miles out of Little Creek Amphibious Base. The action was non-stop and Mark Wahlberg did a fine job. In a nutshell this is a saga of a mission tanking and a quick exit is the only option. Can you say adrenaline rush? As this group of SEALs trudge through the mountains of Afghanistan, it was obvious that the abyss of despair was becoming deeper and more hopeless. I shouldn't say much more, but when the last of the credits lingered, and eventually vanished from the screen ? the deafening silence embracing the audience was astonishing. Rarely have I experienced anything so sobering. Oh I am quite sure this movie will affect people in different ways, it should. Hell, all movies affect people in different ways - that is why we all have so much fun with IMDb. For me, this was an excellent movie (and I know and accept others will not like the flick). I feel those who give their lives defending our freedoms deserve my admiration and will always be greatly appreciated. I think this movie did show quite a bit of respect. Additionally, I will never refer to any of our heroes as, 'bumps-in-the-road', nor will I cavalierly spout conjecture or manifest lies in order to discredit those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Like the book or not (if you read it) this movie was a rare and positive salute by a normally arrogant Hollywood to those in uniform. Not appearing to be pilloried to some political dogma this movie was a refreshing change. I actually believe that all politicians should watch this annually, or at least just before they decide to send people into harm's way. From a twenty year vet - good job and thanks for the excellent job - Pete Berg, et al.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets be honest with ourselves. When you walk out of the movie, you may have the irrational urge to go and take up a rifle and join the Navy Seal program as soon as possible. When i first saw that Mr. Walberg would be the main actor in this movie i kind of chuckled at thought of him playing a Navy Seal. We are talking about the same guy who played the stud racer, bully beat down type character in the Itallian Job ten years before. But back to Lone Survivor. If you are one that might be known to have a faint heart, this movie is most certainly not for you. This might just be one of the most graphic movies i have ever seen.

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor a Breathtaking, often unbearably brutal account of a June 2005 military mission that claimed the lives of 19 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan's Kunar province.The movie is absolutely filled to the brim with action, emotion, and decent acting.Watching each of them falls is heartbreaking, with some breathtaking camera work and stunts, we see, hear, and feel every bullet zoom by, every burst of fire, and every bone shatter.The gun fights are very good, again you get the feeling of been there with them and having the fear of danger.The real acting came from Ben Foster and the others. Foster was excellent! Eric Bana strong support.Wahlberg was very good, He does injury and pain well, but not so much when he need to be vulnerable.Lastly a truly well made brilliant movie that is an extremely satisfying watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Not to Conduct a Reconnaissance Mission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is being compared to Saving Private Ryan. The firefight scenes in the movie are extremely realistic and give a good account of what it's like to be outnumbered and being hit from all sides. In this respect alone, Lone Survivor is on par with Saving Private Ryan.Where things start to fall apart, though, is when the soldiers involved start falling on hard rocks multiple times but still manage to function. No matter how tough anyone is, or how well trained to handle pain, shock from such injuries sets in very quickly and will render any soldier combat ineffective. This is especially so at the high altitudes and low temperatures the soldiers were faced with.Granted, the scenes showing the soldiers tumbling off the rocks was done for dramatic effect, but had it happened in reality, the chances of the soldiers being able to fight off the Taliban for any appreciable length of time after repeatedly falling like that would be slim.The whole movie is almost a textbook case in how not to conduct a reconnaissance mission. I won't go through all the technical minutiae of why it failed. But the fact that it failed boils down to three things: poor command and control, no real air support, and poor unit discipline both in the reconnaissance team and at the base.Where the movie really succeeds is in the portrayal of the bravery, fighting skill, and perseverance of the members of the reconnaissance team. Mark Wahlberg put in a superb performance, as did the members of the supporting cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid and moving story turned into a mainstream action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor was one of those films that I didn't particularly desire to see but it was playing at the right time for me to see a film so in I went. It was basically what I anticipated it to be and that isn't a bad thing at all. Lone Survivor is a riveting, dramatic, well acted and often hard to watch story based on the impossible survival of a US Armed Forces soldier. I think under the proper direction and script this could have been as big and as accepted as Zero Dark Thirty (an already completely inferior film in my books) What I mean to say is that this powerful story could have been less mainstreamed to be more critically accepted and more focused on the powerful emotion behind it. Instead they chose to aim for the general public as its demographic and that's okay because it is very entertaining but how much of it was accurate? Honestly, I don't know the answer to that. Perhaps I should read the book but I kept questioning whether these four men were truly shot multiple times, time after time like they were bulletproof and kept going...including one of them being shot in the head and still upright and talking. All of this is indeed possible but I want to know whether it was realistic to THIS situation. After a little bit of a slow start, the film really starts rolling and will leave you breathless. It has easily one of the best and horrifying scenes of someone falling down a mountainside. It literally felt painful to watch it.I am really becoming a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I think he's a very talented star, one of the best in Hollywood right now, and he does action very, very well. This is no exception. I thought maybe being that he was such a big star that he might not fit into this cast but he does...flawlessly. He brings a raw emotion and power to the role and he doesn't start as the key player but by the end he is the clear cut star. The first part of the film struggles to really get you familiar with the main crew. They drop obvious breadcrumbs like one of them is buying a horse for his woman, the other is dating or married to an Asian woman...things like that. It isn't until half way through the film where you really start to understand and connect to these characters. Taylor Kitsch was my least favourite on the team. No offence to him but his character felt like it was overly dramatic. His death scene felt ridiculous under the circumstances of a movie. The slow motion falling, the heroic pose on his knees on a mountainside with the sun rising over the beautiful landscape...it was hokey. It was like they were trying to spoof an action hero using Kitsch and his performance suffers because of it. Emile Hirsch on the other hand was excellent. He was charismatic, interesting, and made his character stand out and feel believable. Ben Foster...man I love this kid...and I always forget about him because he'll do a big movie and then vanish for a long while. While here he is again in the best role in the movie I think. He does an amazing job of making you feel like you're right there with him and his intensity and emotion easily trumps everyone else in the movie. Foster needs a breakout role and soon because he is very talented. Eric Bana and Alexander Ludwig round out supporting cast that were worth mentioning in very small roles but important and effective.Something I really liked about this film was that it wasn't your typical American military film where everything works out great and the mission is accomplished and go join the military now. This was a brutal and horrifyingly bad mission gone very very wrong. It is more a story of survival than it is military. Peter Berg irritates me as a director. He has a lot of experience but I've never cared much for his style for some reason. All his films just feel okay to me like there is more that could have been done but he doesn't bother because he's aiming for a certain demographic and "they won't care." I'm completely putting words in his mouth but it just feels that way. Lone Survivor could have been a WOW and instead its a...yah that was good. The problem is that I feel like this powerful survival story is mostly forgettable once you're out of the theatre. That reduces it to mindless entertaining and a story like this should be anything but. It is visceral at times, powerful, violent, entertaining...it is absolutely worth seeing. I sort of expected more emotion while watching it though one particular line almost got to me. One of the best scenes, acted and directed, is the scene when they are trying to decide what to do about the compromise in front of them. It is interesting and fascinating to watch how that unfolds. Check it out and take it for what it is and you will enjoy it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete Garbage!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never imagined the movie would really be this bad. Even after the reviews starting coming out. This is Friday Night Lights meets Rambo III. Look Friday Night Lights was a great show, and Rambo III was entertaining enough in its 80's Hollywood action adventure way, but the two together is just a disaster. Really the guys of Operation Redwing deserved better. It is a shame that somebody like Che Guevara gets an epic two part film about his life, but these soldiers do not. I suppose Soderbergh's film about Guevara comes to mind because my impression after reading Luttrell's book, was that it should have had a two volume structure. The first going much more deeply into the lives and background of Dietz, Axe and Murphy than Lutrell's book actually did, and concluding after the firefight. While the second volume would focused on Luttrell and his long efforts to survive. The thing is you can't blame Lutrell for failing to produce a work of true literary genius, even though the subject matter begged for it. However I can blame Hollywood for failing to make even a good film about the subject. It is a sad commentary on our culture that 100 times more thought and effort was put into making a film about Che Guevara then these truly heroic men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal battles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film details the failed operation of US SEALS in Afghanistan to capture a Taliban leader in 2005.The title already gave the plot away, and the first scene confirms all suspicion of the title. Hence, viewers are already given a grim outlook for the respectable soldiers portrayed in the film. For the first forty minutes, nothing much happens. I was about to lose interest in it, thinking it was boring and uneventful. When action strikes, it strikes big time. It is brutal and violent that most of the time I had my eyes closed. It's so sad to see the soldiers in such desperate situations, and yet they combat valiantly until the last minute. There is little emotional or dramatic element in the plot, but it will still evoke much emotions because the battles are so brutally realistic. "Lone Survivor" is certainly not a film for entertainment or an easy relaxing evening. Be prepared to see loads of nasty wounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great depiction of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I'd like to start off by saying why the negative reviews and why the so called propaganda term being incorporated with this. I actually found this a compelling, gripping, gritty and realistic true story on the mission operation red wings. This movie is extremely accurate if you have read the book and nearly everything that happens through out the film happened in real life. It may be tough to watch at times but I could never take my eyes of the screen. How is this propaganda ? How I ask. The film to me was actually more an anti- war message being portrayed as it doesn't just show the enemy as the enemy and it shows a different side to Afghanistan, this side we never really hear about. The film also packs some great performances with Taylor Kitch and Mark Wahlberg leading the pack. The films brutality and realistic warfare just adds to the tensity. Seriously if this film had been made 10 years ago it would have been hailed as one of the great war films but in a generation like today's where war movies are all hailed as propaganda it doesn't get the credit it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between the undeveloped characters and glamorization of war, the Lone Survivor wouldn't even be in the top 20 of best war movies. The film is nothing but a series of half-truths. The entire ending of the movie is a falsification of real world events. It's existence is purely because of the need for a better climax. Ever little moment is subtly twisted from its real-life counterparts to cast the Americans in good light.The movie is also overwrought with clichés. How many times do I have to hear about brotherhood in a war movie? Am I suppose to care for these characters the second they utter the word; brother, cause the first five minutes of the movie where they show a few family photographs didn't work. In fact, it came across as nothing but a shallow attempt to make these people human, just like the rest of this film. The action scenes are well done, but if you're looking for a movie that's more than a string of gung-ho American bull-crap, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent cinematography, really well done. That is the only unqualified praise I can give.I really wanted to understand and feel these Navy SEALs heroes more. What it means, emotionally, spiritually, to be a SEAL, the esprit de corps... The lead up seemed detached, like I should already know what it feels like to be a SEAL, and I most certainly don't. That it was a cursory summary of stuff I should already know and then we get to the action. Clearly that would be enough for an entire movie, but I think it fell flat. I wanted to become more attached to these men, to really truly care about them as soldiers, men, husbands, fathers... The movie made an attempt at that, but again, I wasn't grabbed by it. IDK, maybe it was me. Saving Private Ryan, OTOH, did that, did it well, and I cared deeply about everyone of those men. It hurt. Lone Survivor, well, of course I grieve their loss, but no more than I did before.The action, heck yes, well done... But why were we there again? And just where were we? they said, but it didn't stick... I knew exactly where we were in Black Hawk Down and, of course, Saving Private Ryan. And this bad guy they were to assassinate?? well, why were we putting our soldiers in the line of fire... Hmm maybe there was no good reason.The only true ethical dilemma in the movie, again, didn't strike deep, and I couldn't relate to any particular perspective, and I think an awesome opportunity to look at the effects of media on war was missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert- I do provide some thoughts on things that happen in the movie. Not sure why this movie is getting so many high reviews. Right from the start this movie is bad. I was waiting for Demi Moore to pop out during the intro to the Seal Training. Numerous issues with regard to the decision making. A) Why no communication plan? Clearly they knew there were going to be issues, i.e. check in every 10 minutes. But there was no plan for these problems. B) Sheep herders why would they not just tie them up, do what they were their to do and then release them. They are Seals, how can they possibly release them and not see that they were doomed in doing so. C) When the decided to release them and then back track, there is no way in hell you stop. I don't care what is in front of you the stupidest choice in the world is to head back TOWARD the enemy and hunker down until dark. D) The falling off cliffs, surviving multiple bullet shots, broken bones, etc etc. was way to far-fetched. a la Rambo. E) Why in the village when they stopped the beheading would they even think to allow the Taliban to leave only to return with tons more men and weapons. Had they shot them on the spot they would have saved a few villagers lives. Conclusion, The movie was OK, I can't help but feel it is politically led. It almost had a propaganda feel to it IMO. The acting was very good as were the effects. The story is suspect, and I would guess way blown out of proportion. If the lack of communication and preparedness that was displayed in this movie actually goes on in the US military, God help the soldiers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of Action but poor acting and characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst part of making a true life story real is it needs to feel real this does not from start to finish. For me the devil is in the details. First thing you see in this film is real footage of the brutal training US Seals do, much like the SAS in England and Australia and other elite military out fits, and the people that can complete this training are super human, or super stupid, depending on your stance. This is all real and I hoped that the characters and story would feel real as well, it did not. For starters the location looks like it was shot in America (it was), it looks nothing like Afghanistan. If you have not been then maybe this wont annoy you like it did me, but when you see pine trees you know it does not feel right. Then in the lead up they talk about being bitten by a rattle snake, rattle snakes in Afghanistan come on guys... have some pride. The small shots of FOB's (forward operation Bases) are OK, a little like Afghanistan but this is not a major shooting location. But they may of been the most realistic thing in the film. As for the 4 main characters in the movie they just don't develop or click, there is a small attempt at humanizing one by connecting him to his wife and her love for horses but its very week and even though he is a good looking man Taylor Kitsch is a horrible actor. I have no idea why Peter Berg uses him in lots of stuff. Mark Wahlberg tries very hard in this film but the story is of incompetence and action, throw in a few Hollywood explosions and this is the film. If you want a play by numbers action that was a true story then this might be for you, but for me it felt like a cheap make of what could of been great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Book - Very Poor Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine is a SEAL instructor in Coronado CA. He always keeps me up to date with the stories of heroism that are in the public domain and as a result of this I have read several books on the SEALS and their endeavours in various theatres of battle in the world, one of these being Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell, which details Operation Red Wings.The film to me is a very poor adaptation of what is a great story of heroism and courage amongst a team of brothers - people that would be pulling the trigger till their very last breath. Here, in the movie - you have 4 guys, that share the same name as the 4 in Operation Red Wings, at a high level the plot shares the same narrative of what happens in the book, then most of the ending is just skipped over and made to make it look more dramatic than it actually was.In the book the death of Michael Murphy had me in tears, in the film it is portrayed as stupid US hoohaa Bravado (For those that don't know, because the film doesn't bother to inform anyone Lt Michael Murphy received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions that day)After Danny Dietz is shot - the book portrays him fighting till his very last, in this film however he is portrayed as panicking and giving away the position of the squad, which is not the training of a Navy Seal, I can only imagine the horror Danny Dietz parent's to have the memory of their son sullied in such a way.READ THE BOOK! It is a much more faithful re-telling of what is a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jingoistic overtones rob this film of its anti war message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its lamentable that whilst Lone Survivor might be viewed as a anti war film it could just as easily be perceived as a ringing endorsement for the US military. The plot of the film is simple enough, a group of special forces soldiers are sent to Afghanistan to assassinate a militia leader with ties to the Taliban. Due to poor planning, dodgy equipment and a general lack of resources however the mission is doomed to failure. What follows is visceral, disturbing and above all very sad. Even if like me you are not from the United States you can not help but feel considerable sympathy as you watch a group of young men horrifically slaughtered as they take on an overwhelmingly larger enemy force.Whats really troubling about Lone Survivor is it stubbornly refuses to shed the jingoistic overtones that could have lifted this film above the raft of other US made war movies. Questions about the waste of human life and potential, the political validity of wars fought on foreign soil,that are inherent in this film are drowned out by the "rah rah and hoopla" about God and country. I can not as a consequence recommend this film. Indeed I'd go so far as to say it's an irresponsible film that romanticizes war, perpetuating the myth that dying on the field of battle is something other than bloody, gruesome and ultimately pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most brutal and realistic combat pictures ever made in recent memory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the summer of 2012, director Peter Berg faced harsh criticism when his big-budget sci-fi action blockbuster, BATTLESHIP, flopped big time at the box office. But thankfully, Berg manages to bounce back with this impressive combat picture, LONE SURVIVOR -- easily one of his best directing efforts to date. WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Based on a failed "Operation Red Wings" mission which takes place on June 28, 2005, a four-man Navy SEALs team -- Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Michael P. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster) and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) -- are sent into the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan to apprehend Taliban commander Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami). However, their mission is compromised when they stumble upon local goat herders. Facing a dilemma whether to kill them or to let them go, they choose the latter option -- a ill-fated decision that soon cost them dearly.THE GOOD STUFFKudos goes to Peter Berg for his well-paced direction throughout the two hours of this movie. He starts off with a strong setup that introduces all four main characters, sustaining the momentum, and finally hits full button with some of the most gruelling combat sequences ever staged in a war genre. Here, he doesn't skimp on the violence as well as the harsh reality of a war combat. In fact, the sequence is so intensely choreographed that you could almost feel all the pain (especially the scene where they rolled down the rocks and injured their bodies in the process) that these four main characters have to endure.All four main actors give believable and solid performances. But it was Mark Wahlberg who excels the most as the last standing soldier (hence the title).MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The extended combat sequence between the four-man Navy SEALs team and an army of Taliban fighters.THE BAD STUFFIf there's any flaw in this movie, it's Eric Bana. For such an established actor of his calibre, his performance as Lt. Commander Erik S. Kristensen is sadly reduced into thankless role.FINAL WORDSLONE SURVIVOR is definitely not for the squeamish. However, those who can stomach the unflinching act of violence, will be rewarded with one of the best post-9/11 war pictures ever made in years.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Put simply: the plot is unbelievable.Do you really think, soldiers would hold a debate about what to do with their prisoners in the midst of a rapidly deteriorating operation? Do you really think they would let the prisoners go? How many times can soldiers jump off mountains and not hurt themselves? OK, one guy broke his leg. But then 5 minutes later he is seen rapidly hobbling. Now I'm not a SEAL, nor have I broken my leg after being shot multiple times, nor have I jumped off a rocky mountain 3 times. BUT, I have had the relative minor condition of gout and believe me, you cannot hobble that fast even on doses of pain-killers that would knock out a small elephant. And this guy didn't take any medicine as far as I could make out. He didn't even drink any water until the villagers found him.I could go on and on.

This is arguably Mark's best movie yet, even though Planet of the Apes and The Other Guys were hits to me as well. I completely recommend seeing this movie. Overall rating: 8.5/10. Not as good as BHD or a Saving Private Ryan but it was great. It. Made me feel as though I were a navy seal, even though that will not happen. It is an adventure that no other movie gives you. It allows you to truly observe the Middle East and how they treat their population. He terrorists truly have a choke hold on that region. This movie was exceptional, however I do not recommend showing this to anyone who is not too fond of blood, or vulgar phrases. Overall age group (14-15+).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>for Modern Warfare lovers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night &amp; I was blown away by it, I'm a big fan of modern warfare (I find the technology etc. fascinating) such as Black Hawk Down. There is an element of Behind Enemy Lines, Owen Wilson, about this film but without the corniness &amp; irritation of Owen himself - Wahlberg &amp; co. put on a captivating performance as Navy Seals, you really feel for them throughout the film.I loved seeing the Apaches, Chinooks &amp; the AC-130s in action, just amazing.There is no attempt at propaganda, or anything like that, it is a fascinating portrayal of Operation Red Wings.The film gradually intensifies &amp; ends exceptionally well, you won't be disappointed if you go to see this movie, I promise you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor Hits Hard and Hits Home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor tells the stunning story of a four man squad that travels to dispose of one of thee Taliban leaders. Based on a true story, told by Markus Luttrel, is the first in a long time to portray the truth behind war. The very demeanor of thee soldiers is depicted beautifully, and the action and captivating. Some viewers may argue that this movie is violent, however that is equivalent to saying a baby is too innocent. The fatality of war is definitely not sugar coated in this movie. And what would a good movie be without actors? Director Peter Berg chose actors that delivered emotion and fit the roles perfectly. Lone Survivor is for those who seek a patriotic, real life story about the U.S. Army. One disappointment was character development. With that discarded as a small problem, Lone Survivor hits home and hits hard with the stunning depiction of war and its strong emotional impact, leaving you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one Seal survives a US mission to kill a Taliban leader</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Berg's Lone Survivor is a well-made ? and even more certainly well earned ? tribute to the US navy's Seals. In June 2005 four men were sent into Afghanistan undercover to kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Their mission compromised by the accidental appearance of some goat-herds, the men try to leave but face a concentrated Taliban assault. As the title subtlety suggests, only one, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) survives ? and that only thanks to the valiant engagement by a town of Afghans who rate their ancient code of hospitality higher than the Taliban threat. The point is that primitive society may not have Our Culture but they have A Culture.The arrival of the goatherds raises the Seals' crucial dilemma. Do they kill the unarmed civilians to preserve their mission or release them and flee? The scene is an important reminder of how complex a moral decision can become on the battlefield. Their decision may be right morally but it proves dead wrong strategically. For in these modern wars even children are soldiers, as the aged can be long-distance messengers.The film is eloquent on the Seals' fraternity and tight bond. In the epigraph montage of the real Seals behind the story it's immensely satisfying to see that Luttrell named his son after his die-hard killed comrade, Axe. The unforgiving harshness of the alien terrain is dramatized in the number of hard knocks the Seals suffer when they have to jump and roll to evade their assailants. After all his suffering on the desert and against hard rocks our survivor Seal is finally in his element when he tumbles into the waters of an oasis ? where the villagers give him new life.The graphic popping of blood confirms the film's visceral experience of modern gunfire. Where The Monuments Men (see my separate blog) seems based on old war films, Lone Survivor feels like the real, agonizing experience. It's loud and painfully disturbing ? which should make it required viewing for the safe fat cats who so easily send their young men off to distant war. The film is also a timely reminder of what the nation owes its veterans ? and how reprehensibly short their civilian treatment falls. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary - rather than feature film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Military movies based on biographical books and focusing on a single operation have both advantages and disadvantages. The first includes accuracy, naturalness, real names and places, but if you know the course of action and the ending (including hinting title), then you have to find some other angles and elements to catch...Well, the cast is evenly good, a real ensemble, although several actors performing members of the team were unknown to me.Shootings and dramatics were also in place, but the movie was roughly and unevenly divided into 3 parts: preparation for the mission (a bit protracted), failed operation (a row of fast and changing scenes), and escape of a single man (with ups and downs, and where I was confused why the US sends their soldiers out without any knowledge of local language, even with the help of a phrase-book).Occasional aridity in the plot is outbalanced by great cinematography and realistic atmosphere, probably better appreciated by those having direct contacts with troops or military service.Thus, I like Lone Survivor, but there are dozens related movies I like even more, e.g. Platoon or Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Doesn't Set its Sights High Enough to be Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some great moments to be found in Lone Survivor, but don't be mistaken: this is not of the same quality as recent war movies such as Zero Dark Thirty or The Hurt Locker. It's a solid action movie that doesn't try to play in the big leagues. Lone Survivor is an ideal candidate for the newly created Critic's Choice Award category "Best Action Movie," a category created to honor finely made films that were not worthy of a shot at Best Picture (Lone Survivor is actually nominated for this award, too). The sound design is crafty and is the aspect that creates the most suspense. I great prefer the scenes of Act 1 and 2 compared to 3, the beginning scenes explained what was happening mark-by-mark and told a simple story. Act 3 relies on Mark Walhberg's attempts at creating a character outside his "The Fighter" comfort zone. A pivotal moment occurs when the four main characters put their morality to the test. Any film that has their characters question morality deserves at least a chance. Grade: BRating: 6.5</fullReview>

I have viewed this film twice now and I can honestly say I find it very difficult to pick out any flaws from the screen play to characters themselves, utterly flawless. I myself have been in the armed forces so can relate the fear, integrity, will and determination of the actors, therefore making it far more impressive. Would love if they release a 3D version of this movie to feel even more part of a wonderful story. I watched this first time round with my girlfriend who doesn't really watch action packed movies and more romcom, however needless to say she was stunned by this movie and she also would highly recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i finale saw this movie based on true story based on acts of courage in opening scene there is Real Footage of Soldiers doing real risk Training footage at the beginning of the movie is archive footage that was commissioned by the Navy. Director Peter Berg needed a way to sum up the training and selection process chronicled in Luttrell's book, which spans approximately. yes that was true director is starting to be good almost great if he does great film like this one he is good director from Welcome to the jungle AKA Rundown, Kingdom was good Battleship was good i guess i know everyone hated it but i like it i thought it was good like Transformers but Battleship was a silly but very silly idea should have done better idea for Battleship i enjoy it but it's my opinion. (Mark Wahlberg) was great just like his all his movies, (Ben Foster) worked again with Mark at Contraband witch is good film ended up in this film (Taylor Kitsch)was good actor not great actor from Savages,Battleship,John Carter i saw these movies when he is the main role but not this movie he's not main role in this movie i saw his last movie Savages witch is great. that's i know but i know (Eric Bana) is not part of this movie but still good but he played as Lieutenant Commander, this movie was based on True Story it was real little staff a bit made up i don't want make Major Spoilers movie had great Action Scenes the war scenes were great no shaking camera's Scary when there is only 4 Soldiers 200 Taliban Fighters attacking them Lone Survivor that follows the real life events that happened in 2005 to Navy SEAL Mark Luttrell and his team in the Afghanistan Mountains when a secret operation is compromised. shot of movie looked awesome it's over impact great looking shot on movie this like Modern Warfare a bit in this movie it doesn't have any punching holes in movie great when this happened in 2005 witch i didn't know this happened 8 or 9 years later movie was made witch was shocking for people for there family they were brave soldiers very brave Marcus Luttrell is brave soldier he was just Survivor that because Mohammad Gulab saved him i think he trusted him the funny thing on this movie is when Mark Walhberg ask for knife the boy gets duck the father comes get's knife from kid he thought that he was going to kill it but he didn't do it funny scene but that didn't happen in movie that was not true that was made up i give this movie 10/10 Mark Walhberg does True story movies like Pain Gain he should a bit more true story movies this movie should own Oscar my favorite movie in 2014 in beginning</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only issue with this movie was that it didn't show more of Marcus's struggle before he was found by the heroic villagers that saved him. He actually had to crawl for something like 12 miles because he was paralyzed from the shoulders down. He'd draw a line in the sand with a rock and if his feet made it to the line and he was still alive he'd do it again. He did that for 12 miles and none of that was shown.As much as I loved Saving Private Ryan and Act Of Valor, I think this one takes it as the best war movie I've ever seen. I also love the fact that Marcus was in it!And for those who didn't read the book I suggest you do. Like I said in the beginning of my review, some important things were left out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very realistic war movie but a bit too much Hollywood (spoiler alert!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note that this review contains some spoilers! Peter Berg has a lot of movie related "stuff" under his belt, as actor, producer, writer and director. Being interested in movies but perhaps not a real movie buff, I have not really paid attention to his name up until now. Which means I will look out for other movies where he is involved? In Lone Survivor, Berg has really managed to make a movie that gives a good depiction of what a modern war situation can be like for a special forces unit and the (many times, but not every time) heroic individuals that go through the rigorous training required to become a member of those super high performance units. In other words, this war movie works because it provides a good understanding of the people and organization around the Special Forces and the context in which they operate. It is amazing what those men go through and they are definitely made of something else.Lone Survivor is based on a real SEAL mission back in 2005 in Afghanistan. The movie focuses on the four man SEAL team being tasked with the mission to capture or kill the Taliban leader Ahmad Shahd. The movie starts with showing the team and their friends/colleagues wake up one morning at their base and how they get ready for their mission. Roughly one third into the movie they transported out to the drop point and make their way to the village where their target is. Unfortunately, they are discovered by a group of villagers and from there it goes downhill, in more than one than one way.The action is good and realistic. The acting is also good and the different characters are built throughout the movie. All of them do a good job depicting what they go through as the situation goes worse and worse. The two hours of movie time is used properly. Personally, I was hoping for a longer battle towards the end, but I guess the fight is over pretty quickly when you have both Apache helicopters and Gunships involved.This is not a normal Hollywood movie but you can still tell it is made in Hollywood (duh?) which is a criticism in itself (perhaps not logical but I still think it is an issue) and also the end of the movie where they pay homage to the American soldiers who died in this mission. Do not take this the wrong way, I think we should be proud over these men doing this hard and tough job, but from "rating-a-movie" perspective, I think the ending could have been different to leave us thinking a bit more about what happened and why. Also, the characterization of the bad guys is very plain and simple.I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the perfect mix of action, emotion, and respectfulness towards the original mission, Lone Survivor is one of the best modern war dramas of the past decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 2012's negatively received Battleship, the name "Peter Berg" largely became a joke in Hollywood. Earning a Razzie nomination for his work on the film, Berg had backed himself into a corner, even after making a big splash with his Friday Night Lights film and its television spin-off. However, there's more to the story than that. Berg only agreed to direct Battleship if Universal would agree to distribute his passion project, Lone Survivor. Berg's passion for Lone Survivor is definitely evident: backed by its solid acting, tense storyline, and phenomenal directing, Lone Survivor is a fantastic redemption for Peter Berg.Lone Survivor is the harrowing true story of Operation Red Wings, which took place in 2005 during the War in Afghanistan. The goal of this mission was to capture and eliminate a notorious Taliban leader named Ahmed Shah. SEAL Team 10 is sent in to complete the task on June 28. SEAL Team 10 consists of four troops: Lieutenant Michael Murphy, Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz, Petty Officer Second Class Matthew Axelson, and Hospital Corpsman Second Class Marcus Luttrell.During one morning in their pre-determined overwatch positions, the squad must face a tough decision as a group of local goatherds stumble upon their scouting location: do they release the locals and abort the mission, but risk being compromised by local Taliban? Or do they execute the locals and continue with the mission, but ultimately disobey their original orders? Their final decision becomes a costly one as the outcome leads to an unexpected turn of events that leaves the squad with only a single, lone survivor.Lone Survivor is a very well-written war drama that adapts the real-life mission accurately and respectfully. Written by Peter Berg, the screenplay does a phenomenal job of creating tension that takes its time before it snaps. And once it snaps, everything completely goes to Hell. The film fleshes out its characters enough to make the movie an emotional roller coaster ride as the mission slowly and surely falls apart.The film also brings a fantastic cast to the table. Lone Survivor ultimately depends on the strength of its lead performance; fortunately, Mark Wahlberg shines as Marcus Luttrell. In his strongest performance since 2010's The Fighter, Wahlberg proves just how great of an actor he really is, pulling off every emotions he his character goes through. The supporting cast is well-rounded as well, consisting of actors such as Taylor Kitsch (who is much better than he was in Berg's Battleship), Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster, who is arguably the strongest of the three.Lone Survivor is easily Peter Berg's finest directing job since he began his directing career. The amount of passion Berg has for this subject material is definitely clear. Every action sequence is gritty, brutal, and even hard to watch, mirroring the same brutal quality as Saving Private Ryan's famous opening scene. All-around, Berg handles Lone Survivor with the perfect amount of emotion and exhilaration the story calls for.To call Lone Survivor a good movie is an understatement. Peter Berg really and truly redeems himself after Battleship with this amazing movie. With the perfect mix of action, emotion, and respectfulness towards the original mission, Lone Survivor is one of the best modern war dramas of the past decade. Backed by it's solid cast and phenomenal directing, Lone Survivor is one of 2013's finest outings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love. Fight. Navy Seal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm a lover. I'm a fighter. I'm a udt navy seal diver." That's the unit's motto in Lone Survivor. And oddly, a perfect description of the movie in general. Enough action scenes to suffice for several movies. Which isn't so much a negative statement as it is a statement of disbelief. I've seen movies with action scene after action scene, sure, they're good, you get what you expect. Action: things blowing up, gun fire, kill shots, blood, quick camera pans, hard cuts, suspense, victory and defeat. Which is all good and dandy, but this wasn't a good and dandy movie, this was a great movie. Yes, great. Never have I seen a movie mix that much action with a powerful human storyline so effortlessly. The fight of a war, the love of a brotherhood. There was hardly anytime spent on the background of the characters and yet the you could believe you knew them for their whole life. Perhaps its the short credit intro revealing the struggles soldiers train through to had become a navy seal. As if just witnessing the cruel initiation tactics made you feel as if you struggled through it with them. As if you had become a member of the team. It is in this connection or bond that you share with these characters that makes the movie so compelling. It's action after action but action used in the way to progress the bond between you and the team. The action isn't used for action's sake but for the sake of the story. Which is why Lone Survivor separates itself from other action movies. By the time you reach the end and the sad fate, that is the title, comes true, you feel like you have lost someone. Like you have lost your brothers. The movie ends with a call to never give up and to always push yourself farther than you think you can go. Which after seeing the pain and suffering they go through, giving up and pushing yourself takes a whole new prospective. These men did more for each other and their country than most people would do for themselves. And as the credits roll and pictures dedicated to the men who this story is based on appear, you start to put yourself into their position. You feel sad and yet you feel this strong bond within you for the people you hold close. And if you reach that point, you've understood the movie. You're hit with a wave of emotion not only for those who sacrificed for our country but imagining fighting for the people you hold close as well. It's about love. It's about fight. It's about a bond greater than surviving. Lone Survivor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SEAL Training</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first when the film showed the SEAL training, I thought, like many others have written that it was gratuitous. However, it is not. During the fire fight, the punishment these men took and still had the will to keep going was extraordinary. It was the same extraordinary punishment as the SEAL training. It suddenly made sense to me, that this isn't an empty exercise to weed out the weak in body. It is a sieve to weed out weakness of the spirit. (Please note that even failing at SEAL training earns my respect and honor. It takes a very special kind of person to want to attempt it).This is such an important movie, and the books and movies coming out about the military are so important, especially right now. We have a media that calls movies like this war porn, and then turns around and calls the killing of Bid Ladin heroic. An administration that sees these men as political toys gives me the desire to march on Washington.I am unutterably proud of all who serve, and have served and I am grateful for your sacrifices. I love that we are seeing movies that honor these people and I am hoping that they are successful enough that more are made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made movie with a couple of quibbles that I will not bring up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had a lively interest in combat. I've even cornered those who have seen it in person to get a better handle on it. After much contemplation, and a stint in the Army that did not involve combat, I've come to a rough, but accurate, notion of its reality, only to have it all superseded in one fell swoop by this brilliant movie.My wife doesn't like war movies, and I, therefore, had to offer to see it by myself. At the last minute she changed her mind and we both went. I feared she would spend most of the movie turning away but that didn't happen though there are some harrowing scenes that she disliked. I had explained that the story was essentially revealed on '60 Minutes' and was able to prepare her a bit. However, the story as told on that TV magazine was only a sketch. In the end she appreciated the movie and the adherence to duty depicted in it and that's as much as I can ask for.The story is about a small group of Navy Seals tasked with abducting or killing an Afghani who was a Taliban leader with many American deaths to his credit. Their intelligence wrongly informs them that the small village in which the target has been spotted has only about 10 soldiers. In fact the number is quite a bit larger. We follow the mission from its insertion to its bloody end but not once does this movie fall into an excess of movie pyrotechnics to make its point.Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch and the others all honor the men they're portraying by not over-doing it and staying real. But it's probably the director that deserves the most credit. Peter Berg does what I've always wanted to do, create a highly accurate picture in my mind of a single battle in all its inglorious mess. I was particularly happy to see and hear how they handled the bullets flying around. There's no sign of Clint Eastwood shooting a cigarette out of an opponents mouth. It's more like an evil shower of deadly metal.I could visualize myself there in the firefight having to force myself forward and that is something every war movie I've ever seen has dearly wanted to achieve. I don't know about others but this is the only one that's done it for me and I highly recommend it. It's an education you'll not soon forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good performances by Ben Foster and especially Taylor Kitsch. Wahlberg was just Wahlberg. Nothing memorable...I think the picture did an outstanding job of showing the viewer what it takes, and means, to be a Navy SEAL. That is what makes it valuable. However, the script was thin. I feel the writer could've taken more time to develop the characters before we jumped into the second act. Also, there is very little context as to why the SEALs are after their target. We get he's a bad guy, but how bad? Why are there lives worth it? The script lacked an incident to really get us behind the SEALs.All in all, I think Peter Berg shot an incredible war film and really made me feel like we were right next to the SEALs the whole time. I just wish there was some more background on the characters and the their mission (i.e., Blackhawk Down).</fullReview>

Mark Wahlberg is the one who truly gives the film it's glory he truly is talented. Each actor makes the movie real like they are the person you can feel that this is how the real men of operation red wings act and reacted. 8.6/10 in my opinion</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie that is worth Watching!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Berg made a massive misstep with 2012&#x2032;s Battleship. There was a decent ninety-minute popcorn movie buried underneath all the bloat, but worst of all, it had no personality. It didn't feel like a movie Berg had to make. Not every movie has to be a serious passion project, but when the passion is on screen, it speaks volumes. That theory is proved well by Berg's latest film, Lone Survivor, his best film since The Rundown. The true life story follows, if you haven't guessed yet, a lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg). You could consider that a spoiler, but the movie opens with the rescue of Luttrell. It's a questionable creative decision because a good deal of film goers will discover Luttrell's journey with this film, but then it becomes more a matter of how Luttrell got there rather than who survived. Berg goes about introducing Luttrell and his team ? Matt Axelson (Ben Foster), Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) ? with the standard camaraderie and exposition that's expected. It's a fine set-up, but it's forgotten once the four of them are thrust into battle, where we learn more about them through action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best combat movies ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this movie to be one of the best combat and engagement movies I've ever seen. I've never been in any kind of combat before nor seen any real ones on TV, so I can't really know how real the engagement scenes were. However, compared to other movies, this one to me looks very realistic. Before the movie ends, I noticed something when the US solider was telling the Afghan guy about the American flag. The Afghan man pointed first at the Texan flag and said: America? The US solider said: Texas. Then the Afghan pointed at the American flag and said: America? Then the US solider said yes, America is Texas. I'm just curious. Was there any political view behind that line?Hope you all enjoy the movie as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you go in and watch this movie without reading the book, you will be in for a fantastic story, fantastic - accurate depiction of some of the SEAL Teams, a great movie. Exciting, gripping, sad, patriotic and frightening. There's even a moment that made me laugh.If you want this movie to be an on screen adaptation of the book, you may be a little let down. I would of loved to have seen the book ending - on the screen. I understand that they have to "Hollywood" up the story a bit, but some points are not very accurate.Kudos for getting the story out to the mainstream. Kudos to the production team for such an accurate feeling and real looking action environment.That being said, please do your self a favor and read the book. Very well written, and flows well. A little bit more background to the situation, and characters that gives it an overall different feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One bad flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about 4 seals sent in behind enemy lines to eliminate a very bad Taliban Leader. OK , I get that , so they drop in behind enemy lines, and make their way to the target. So far , movie is OK. Then they are discovered by an old man and two teenagers , that were herding goats on a tree covered mountain side which over looks the targets village. This is where I lost my interest, the seals team leader votes to scrub the mission and let the 3 villagers go. WHY? These are supposed to be special forces trained Navy Seals , if killing isn't second nature to these guys , they should not be seals, its war , the choices here are simple , kill the 3 villagers , remained undetected , and finish the mission .Or at least tie them up , gag them , put them into cover so as not to be found quickly , and finish the mission or scrub the mission and evacuate safely. So , you can guess what happens after they let these 3 go . If this was a true story , you can bet it will be used for training purposes on what not to do , and what should have been done.I am not playing back seat driver, I just firmly believe that Special forces trained personal and Seals will not hesitate to kill if on a mission , to protect them selves and the mission, and that would include killing old men,teenagers,women , children . I know you would like to think that would not be true of Americans,war is horrible, but after you watch the film , you have wonder why they at the very least they did not tie up the 3 villagers, and then go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jingoistic Passion of the Christ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will be a quick-and-dirty review of the film, setting all personal political views aside. And please keep in mind that criticizing a film portraying real American soldiers in no way means that I am criticizing the real life soldiers who do these types of things for which I have the utmost respect. As for the movie, the first 30 minutes is a straight military recruitment video, full of prospective SEALS training, running bare- chested in the sand with iconic American drums rolling in the background, and rah-rah speeches of military bravado. Once the action starts, it turns into a jingoistic Passion of the Christ. The soldiers are used merely as human meat puppets with no subtext to it, like Berg's only point in showing the excess was to convey the amount of damage the body can take. The most glaring weakness of the film is that there is no depth to any of the main characters, they are basically macho military male cardboard cutouts with no substance to them, which other than the fact that they are Americans leaves an emotional disconnect between the viewer and the emotional response Berg was looking for. On the most superficial of levels I can see the average moviegoer finding enjoyment in this, especially the battlefield/COD first-person- shooter demographic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why would someone want to watch a bunch of men get shot up and all their wounds prominently displayed for much of the film?To see what a modern day war in Afghanistan is like perhaps?In that case, how could a group of Navy seals roll down the side of a jagged rock cliff for several hundred feet and survive, not once but twice (3 times for Mark Wahlberg)? Impossible, I don't care if you're a Navy Seal or an Imperial Stromtrooper. Why would a village of locals try to protect an American Soldier on the lam from the Taliban? Why would the soldiers let the goat herders go when it was obvious what the result would be? Why did these genius Navy Seals not simply take their prisoners to a different location when it was clear radio communications were not working where they were? How come the Navy seals all survived multiple gunshot wounds (at least for awhile) and all the Taliban went down for the count as soon as they were hit?Movies like this need to make sense. If you want to make a complete fiction based on the impossible or improbable, like a Superman or an Avatar, you need to introduce early on a world of fantasy.This movie instead tried to portray a modern day event in Afghanistan. I doubt the real Navy Seals are impressed.</fullReview>

Each chapter was full of very exciting events and I could not wait to keep reading. It is about the Operation Red Wing of a Navy Seal team where things go for the worse. It is told by a great perspective and I think that is what makes the book so good. After finishing the book I have a whole new respect for people in our military, the things they go through everyday just to defend our freedom is truly incredible. I think this book is a very good read for anyone. The text is not hard to understand at all and I believe it is a book that everyone should read. I was never interested in reading books that had to do with the military until I read this one. I am very happy I decided to read it and want to continue to read military books because of it.

		<shortDescription>Review: Lone Survivor/ Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The war film genre is one where the sensationalisation of the gains and losses on the battlefield and highly fictionalized moments drenched with brotherhood, duty, and honour, are what differentiate it from other film genres. Sadly, Lone Survivor is no different from the many other war films that have come before it. Despite its lack of originality in a genre that has, for the most part, run out of ammo in the originality department, one of the advantages that the film has compared to more recognizable battles of the past, is the obscurity of Operation Red Wings (the mission the film is based on) and the lack of mystery as to who lives and who dies.Lone Survivor tells the story of Operation Red Wings, an American search-and-destroy mission in Afghanistan, and focuses on the four men sent in to do the job. Giving a little insight into the lives of Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), Petty Officer Second Class Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), Lieutenant Micahel Murphy (Kitsch), and Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), the film is a comical and brutal account of the ethical decision-making on the battlefield and the impact of certain 'rules of engagement'. Within the war film genre, death is inevitable and thanks to its spoiler-laden title, audiences already know that only one of the four main protagonists actually comes away with his life. However, by taking the focus away from the mystery of who lives and who dies, the film is able to quickly establish heartfelt connections and deliver a deeply emotional response, even if the roles are played by not so emotionally impacting actors like Taylor Kitsch and Mark Wahlberg.As the opening monologue of the film echoes in its first few minutes, "There's a storm inside all of us; a burden, a river, a drive, an unrelentless desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone can think possible". This storm, this drive, is one that can be appreciated through the growing body of work of writer/director Pete Berg. Berg has made a career as Hollywood's go-to director for entrusting soaring production budgets and seasoned action stars, while confidently obtaining a great box-office return, despite dismal or mixed reviews. From Friday Night Lights and Battleship, to the out of nowhere mega-blockbuster Hancock, Berg has been fortunate with large scale budgets and generous star power behind his films. Spanning the course of five years, Lone Survivor is Berg's passion project. Working for the Director Guild of America with minimum salary, Berg was instantly drawn to the memoir of Marcus Luttrell during the production on Hancock. After proposing the film to Universal studios, and getting stars Wahlberg and Kitsch at a discounted rate, the funding for his film was the only reason Berg actually agreed to make Battleship.The film is being hailed as an authentic representation of the encounters many US Armed Force Officers are faced with. Although at times repetitive, the film is a bustling, hard-boiled piece of the American military life and a look into the lives of these triumphant men and women. Filled with moments that will have you clenching your fists and lifting yourself off the seat, Lone Survivor is a true testament of the artful representation of violence?proving that in Berg's book, moderation is definitely for cowards.Much like the highly overrated Captain Phillips released earlier in the awards season, the film really does not shed much light or give any insight to the antagonists of the film?the Taliban. Pursing Operation Red Wings for the sheer fact that their target is notorious for killing off Navy SEAL's, the four men are tested; mind, body, and soul through a perilous journey where their actions dictate the consequences of their future. Other than a scene involving a decapitation of one member of the Taliban as a supposed traitor, the film's first half shows the target Shah (Yousuf Azami) and his heartless second-in-command Taraq (Sammy Sheik) as diabolical animals. It isn't until we reach the last part of the film where the true nature and over- embellished actions of the Afghani people are accurately depicted.Despite the celebrity status of the four leading men, the real stand out is the always camouflaged Ben Foster. Taking queues from his career best The Messenger back in 2009, Foster brings a vulnerability to his role as Petty Officer Axel, one that quickly outshines his male cohorts. Foster's interpretation of inevitable death and the persistence to keep fighting for his country, is one that out-guns anyone else in Lone Survivor. When the mission is compromised and the four men are forced to decide the fate of the three civilians they take captive, the film with an obviously overcasting American attitude, becomes even if just momentarily, a quite reflective art-piece. Thanks to the memoir of the only surviving member Marcus Luttrell, the film highlights the fundamentals of the Afghan culture as well as highlights and gives due diligence to the reason for his survival?which comes as a big, pleasing, politically correct surprise.2014 has just begun, and although the film premiered to a selecte few audience members in 2013, I can confidently stand by my opinion that the film will offer one of the best photographic opening montage credits scene of the year. Showing the gruelling world of these Navy SEAL Officers who abandon all physical and mental sanity is portrayed in the opening credit sequence as a tactical and highly effective way to introduce audiences to the real world of pain, adrenaline, and perseverance many American men and women face when becoming SEALS.Contrary to what people may say, Lone Survivor surely will not be a serious contender at this year's Academy Awards although the film is one that pushes its audience relentlessly to the far corners of their comfort zone and forces them to endure the hardships these men, along with many Afghani people, constantly face being abraded by the Taliban.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie, but read the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie and is as honest to the true-life accounts in the book as you can expect from Hollywood. The protracted battle sequences were as accurate as any you will see on screen and recreated the events almost exactly as described by Luttrell. The movie was able to only barely touch on the relationship that Luttrell developed with his protectors in the village of Sabray ? especially with the children. The book provided an eye-opening description of lokhay warkawal and how that steadfast philosophy saved the life of the grievously wounded SEAL. It would be entirely too much to ask Berg to consolidate a six-day event into a two-hour movie without considerable artistic license. My only criticism is with the ending. The very dramatic, highly explosive rescue of Luttrell from his sanctuary was completely different from the events described in great detail in the book. And, frankly, I think this Hollywood ending is a disservice to Luttrell and his exceptionally brave saviors. The nearly superhuman strength and endurance displayed by Luttrell and the fierce bravery and loyalty on the part of the humble villagers is a much better (and more accurate) end to the story than was portrayed in the film. My final critique gets me accused of nit-picking by my wife. The depiction of Marcus Luttrell on the very verge of death was not accurate. He was beat to heck and seriously ill, but in reality Luttrell summoned his final reserve of strength and walked down the ramp of the aircraft when it landed at the base. He did not suffer cardiac arrest and require the standard overly-dramatic Hollywood defibrillation sequence. And in a movie that went to great lengths to get the smallest detail right I was troubled to see a standard Hollywood blunder. They had a non-rebreather oxygen mask on the face of Mark Wahlberg with the reservoir bag completely sucked dry. That bag needs to be full of life-giving oxygen otherwise it does nothing more than suffocate the patient on his own carbon dioxide. Lots and lots of medical types shake their heads in disappointment at this distraction from the authenticity of a film.This movie did an excellent job of consolidating a very complex real-life story into a two-hour flick. And while some may accuse the Producers of jingoism, I for one am pleased and proud to see this depiction of American exceptionalism in an era when we need a national morale boost. The movie was great, the book is amazing!</fullReview>

I liked this movie because it does a good job of this. And it also helps us to understand that not all Afgans have thrown in the towel with the Taliban. It gives some idea of the difficulty of knowing who to trust when faced with that scenario. Enemy and ally look the same externally as the Taliban wear no "uniforms" to distinguish themselves from noncom- batants. I was expecting more but the HBO miniseries "Band of Brothers" and "The Pacific" produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg is a tough act to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A salute to our fallen heroes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor was a decent movie but it failed to deliver on a lot of the emotion from the book, aka the real life events. Forewarning, the rest of this review will contain SPOILERS. I'll go ahead and start with the positives. The acting was phenomenal and the main guys, Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, and especially Taylor Kitsch, who I thought stole the movie, really deliver. They are able to establish an incredible rapport and level of camaraderie in a very short time so credit to them for them. The combat scenes, which make up essentially three-quarters of the film, were done excellently as well. Peter Berg really delivered here. The movie was gruesome, bloody, gory, and felt real because of those often subtle but occasionally dramatic sequences. Another thing I loved about the film was the sense that, more than just a movie, it was a dedication to those who lost their lives and have done so for our freedom throughout our history. The 5-minute intro with real-life footage from BUD/S training and hell week started in and then the photo/video montage of the heroes who died in the battle after the film completed it. Bravo again to Berg for that. Lastly, I loved that Marcus Luttrell had a role in the film itself. He is in several scenes and it was very unexpected when he first popped up in a scene.Now for some of the negatives. They changed so much stuff for the movie, it almost felt like a different battle. Now don't get me wrong, obviously there are things that must be left out when making a movie from a book due to time constraints. However, leaving something out and changing it are two totally different things. One of the changes that bugged me most was them showing Luttrell see the CH-47 Chinook crash. In reality, he didn't find out about that until later on when he was in the village. Another thing that irritated me was how they showed the Taliban invade and shoot up the village that was keeping Luttrell. This was actually the biggest change in the movie because they change the entire meaning and importance of villages like these. In reality, the Taliban attacks the village with threats but never actually raises a gun at it because they know, if they demolish an entire village for not complying with their ways, they will destroy their supply line in the Hindu Kush mountains. This is broken down in detail in the book and is you supplement that with more research you will quickly see that the Taliban would not massacre an entire village that didn't engage them first just because said village is obeying their Pashtunwali culture over the Taliban. If they did that, their supply line would fall apart and this reality was completely lost in the movie. There were several other changes that were minor but there was one last one that I felt is worth mentioning and that is Mike Murphy's death. When reading the book, the most emotional element was the tragic and tormenting way that Murph dies and the movie fails to portray that. Now I will say this, Marcus Luttrell was very involved in the movie and acknowledged that there were changes made because the studio wanted to dramatize things more. I'm sorry but the story is pretty damn dramatic on its own and doesn't need more action or drama.Regardless, this movie was a decent, not great, film and is a salute to the men who have lost their lives fighting for America. While it could've been better, it was still worthwhile experience and I am curious to know if I would've enjoyed it more if I hadn't already read the book first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realistic story of brotherhood and survival.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor tells the true story of four Navy SEALs during a failed operation in the mountains of Afghanistan. Lone Survivor is one of the first films about the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many films have depicted aspects of America's involvement in those campaigns, but the cinematic landscape has been almost devoid of any films that actually chronicle true warfare.In fact, the war film genre has fallen off in the last decade. With that being said, Lone Survivor ranks right up there with anything the genre has to offer in recent decades. Lone Survivor may not be as good as Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan or Letters from Iwo Jima, but it's at least in the discussion.Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, a senior member of the Navy SEAL unit sent behind enemy lines to observe a village occupied by Taliban forces. The mission is to capture or kill a high ranking Taliban leader.The mission goes awry when the unit is discovered by local farmers from the village. The soldiers are then left with a decision that could change their lives forever. Do they kill the farmers, one of whom is a younger boy, and live with the fact they murdered innocent civilians? The other risk with that option is the possibility their actions would be discovered by a news media intent on exposing all transgressions by the American military.The other option is to let the farmers go and take the risk they will go back to their village and inform the Taliban forces that there are American soldiers roaming around the mountains. After much discussion, the decision is made to let the men go. Luttrell and his men decide to fall back for an extract.Before they know it, Taliban soldiers are attacking from every angle. This is where all hell breaks loose and the soldiers are fighting for their lives against Taliban soldiers that know ever twig and rock in the mountains.Outmanned and outgunned, the men have no choice but to retreat. The scenes of the retreat are relentless and truly pulse-pounding, hardly giving the audience a chance to come up for air. The SEALs are peppered by enemy fire and take numerous tumbles down rocky cliffs, visuals that elicited actual winces from the audience.Saving Private Ryan set the benchmark for bringing war to the big screen in such a realistic and raw way, but Lone Survivor takes it to the next level. The sound is amazing and really made you feel like you were next to the SEALs as they fought for their lives. Every bullet cutting though the air and ever shell casing bouncing off the rocky terrain could be heard.Some of the scenes might be too real for some people. The scenes of the Taliban soldiers being shot are particularly graphic. The impact of each bullet is often seen bursting through the body releasing a spray of red mist. Although it's a lot to take in, it would be a disservice to depict the story in another way. These men lived through these moments and they deserve to have it brought to life as realistically as possible.The rest of the Lone Survivor cast is made up of great young actors. Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), who seems to be great in everything, plays Matt Axelson. Axelson is the most fiery of the bunch and is the main opposition to the plan to let the farmers go. Taylor Kitsch, who has redeemed himself for the box office bombs of Battleship and John Carter, plays Mike Murphy. Murphy is the level-headed golden boy of the crew and steps in to make the decision for Luttrell to let the Farmers go. One of my only problems with Lone Survivor is what I would call some of the more overly cinematic elements of the film. One is a cheesy shot of the four men jumping off of a cliff in slow motion. A visual that looked like it would be something on the poster of some second rate war film.My other problem is with a few of the death scenes. I felt they were too artistic in nature and were borderline disrespectful to the soldiers and their families.Overall, Lone Survivor is a solid war film about brotherhood and survival. While exiting the theater, the main theme I was left with is that humanity will conquer evil every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a combat service veteran, I can relate to the intensity and chaos surrounding the close range fire fights depicted in this film. Rather than emphasize large scale attacks with countless deaths, this film focuses on four Seal team members from a personal and professional perspective. The action scenes are realistic and very well done. I read through some of the negative reviews and they are either by people who are biased against the war or have never seen the film. When the closing credits scrolled, everybody in our theater was in tears or stunned silence. Neither I, nor anybody else in the world except Marcus Luttrell, can attest to the accuracy of the film but it doesn't matter. No film can be 100% accurate for a plethora of reasons. If you are not a radical anti-war zealot and can enjoy a powerful and well made drama, do not miss this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This is one of those times where, in order to analyze a movie, one must separate from the emotion of the subject matter. In the traditional sense, this is not a great movie. However, in terms of practicality, the true story and characters and their actions, leave us emotionally exhausted and questioning whether any war actually makes sense. The other thing it does is bring to light just what impressive beings these brave soldiers really are.The story is taken from the book (co-written by Patrick Robinson) and real experience of Marcus Luttrell. A Texan and member of Navy SEAL Team 10, Luttrell was one of four chosen for the June 2005 Operation Red Wings ... the capture or kill of al Qaeda bad guy Ahmad Shahd. Dropped into the Afghanistan Hindu Kush mountains, the mission goes horribly wrong once the group is stumbled upon by goat herders. The Rules of Engagement provide guidance that is supported by CNN concerns ... and the decision is made to release them and call off the mission.To say all hell breaks loose after that is simply an understatement. The four SEALs face insurmountable odds that end according to the spoiler title. If you have seen Blackhawk Down or the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, then you have some idea of what to expect on screen as these elite soldiers fight for their lives and their country. The intensity and visceral violence is impossible to describe here. The bullets rip flesh and bone, while desperate re-grouping efforts lead to horrendous tumbles down rocky cliffs.The movie begins with a glimpse at SEAL training, followed by a few minutes of base life ... the competitiveness, the bonding, the breeding of fighting machines. Director Peter Berg does allow for a peek at humanity and personality, but the Band of Brothers culture is unmistakable. When one of them states "moderation is for cowards", we never doubt for a second that this is part of their psyche.The four Seals are played by Mark Wahlberg (Marcus Luttrell), Taylor Kitsch (Michael Murphy), Emile Hirsch (Danny Dietz), and Ben Foster (Matt "Axe" Axelson). While they are all believable, this is not an actor's seminar. Neither is it a geopolitical editorial. Partisanship is non-existent here. Rather, we are reminded of the sacrifice that comes with war, and left to decide for ourselves if this approach is the best we can do.The real Marcus Luttrell makes an appearance in the movie ... he is the SEAL that spills coffee and tells the rookie to clean it up. Finally, as director Berg was meeting with the families prior to filming, this quote came from Danny Dietz's father after reading the obituary: "That's who my son was. That's how hard he fought. Make sure you get that right".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made by Peter Berg, the same guy who made 'Battleship'!...well I guess that explains the casting of Taylor Kitsch again. Man talk about not learning lessons, Kitsch was the only guy in this film that genuinely didn't fit the bill, next to Wahlberg and Foster it is clear.This film is based on a real event back in 2005 when the US managed to get some of their military killed...yet again. Four SEAL's are dropped into enemy territory in Afghanistan for surveillance and reconnaissance but are soon discovered by local goat herders. After releasing them the heat is on as the team must evac asap before the Taliban come after them, sure enough they do.The beginning of the film is very interesting as it shows real footage of real men going through hell to try and become SEAL's. From there on we do get some time to get to know the team that will be our guide through this ordeal, not a lot of time mind you but its enough. There isn't much hanging around as the film moves quickly into the main crux of the film, before you know it we're sneaking around the rocky bush in a mountainous region of Afghanistan.I'm not gonna sweet talk it but this film is all about the long fightfire between the SEAL's and the Taliban after their mission was compromised. There isn't much else to the film other than that, but what you see is damn intense. At first the small team have everything under control taking down the enemy calmly and smoothly and it makes you feel at ease, it feels like a cool action flick. But bit by bit the team become more and more overrun and seem to be becoming outnumbered as the fight continues. The men are forced to move from spot to spot desperately trying to find good cover to return solid fire and the intensity of the action becomes greater and greater. You are on the edge of your seat the whole time this fight rages on, you know from fact that only one will survive and you know who, but it doesn't detract from the immensely harrowing fight for survival taking place before your eyes, its relentless.This firefight must be one of the top 'action' sequences I have seen for some years and the fact its based on reality drills it home hard. Seeing these four guys slowly getting battered, bruised, shot and exhausted by the continuous siege of the enemy is sobering to say the least. What really hits you is the decisions they had to make to carry on, the fact they had to jump down cliff faces as they were pushed back. When watching these sequences I did find myself wondering if the film wasn't embellishing on the truth somewhat (only the remaining survivor can really say), its possible but apparently not. The same could be said about each of the SEAL's getting shot various times, it did seem a bit too Hollywood to me, how could these guys be getting shot over and over and still be carrying on?. I have since read the wounds on the SEAL's shown were gotten from medical records and are precise!.As the story gets deeper we then see how a US MH-47 chopper is blasted out of the sky by an RPG!. Again this is based on reality and happened but you couldn't have scripted it better if you think about it. A terrible set of events but it makes for a thrilling film no doubt and you gotta give Berg and his cast kudos for bringing it across for all to see. I was impressed by both Wahlberg's and Foster's performances here, not just because they are the big names on campus but the clear determination on their faces to bring the horror and realism of the situation to the surface whilst truly honouring the men they portrayed.It does of course feel very patriot as you would expect with a US military flick and the focus is more on the action in the main battle rather than the characters. One let down of the film being the entire fictional Hollywood finale which wasn't required at all, but rather shows us that all Hollywood is concerned about is the bloodshed and violence in the event and adding more just in case. The whole thing does feel like 'war porn', just seeing these guys shot to bits slowly in a fracas that got out of hand quickly and the US lost, this kind of thing has probably happened many times and we'll never know. The US seem to be very good at messing up their military ops and then making courageous patriotic films about them, cynically saying that is.Never the less the film is a hard hitting visual and audio spectacle that does manage to convey to us what happened with the majority of the film being truthful. I know it sounds clichéd but this is easily 2013's 'Black Hawk Down'. So Mr Berg there you have it, you have found your niche, less 'Battleship' crapola, less Taylor Kitsch and more films like this.8/10</fullReview>

I woulda shot him in the leg, so he couldn't run so fast, give you a better chance to get away. Why not bring the kids with them, finish the mission, then cut them loose? Or tie them up, finish the mission, then cut them loose? Not a good call on their part. But great movie still.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Navy Seals are "The Best of the Best"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is a true story based on Operation Red Wing, which was a military operation based in Afghanistan, intended to bring down Taliban Leader Ahmad Shah.At the beginning of the movie we see glimpses on what it takes to become a Navy Seal. I believe that was actual footage of a BUDS Training Class. Too me, this was the most meaningful part of the movie as it somewhat dictated their character, intensity and drive.Too become a Navy Seal, you have to endure a very rigorous and intense training program. During the first few weeks of training, the instructor's goals are to weed out the one's that don't belong.The instructor's have the attitude, "If your going to quit during training your probably going to quit during the heat of a battle".The very few that are able to overcome tremendous obstacles are the one's worth training.You'll often here the phrase "Train like you Fight", and "Fight like you Train".During the epic battle between the Four Member Seal Team against the hundred or so Taliban Militia, every one of those Seals just fought, fought and fought. They were all struck by gunfire, injured, outnumbered, but their was no quit in any of them.It all reverted back to their training. If they weren't pushed to the max during their training they would not have been able to endeavor what they encountered in Afghanistan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into the movie theater not knowing what to expect, the trailers for the movie did not show much and I was unsure how well done the movie would be. I walked out of the theater amazed and moved, a stunning story about a SEAL team and what happened to them in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. Recently some critics have accused it of being "jingoistic war propaganda", though I honestly do not see how this could be considered as such. The movie is a straightforward tale of what happened when a mission took an unexpected turn, there are no heavy-handed pro-war speeches or messages other then what the viewer may project upon the film. I recommend that you give it a try, though some viewers may want to skip this movie if they are uneasy with graphic combat situations (definitely not for the weak of stomach).</fullReview>

Professional soldiers of US invading army are trying to neutralize a local Afghanistan fighter commander known for killing 19 US marines in an ambush. And US army lose 19 more men in this attempt. If US soldiers would serve in a conscript army, all the blame for this failure would rest on a shoulders of US government and army commanders. But these men are professional army soldiers, they are paid for their services, and they resemble mercenaries much more than war heroes fighting for right cause. This really gives a trouble feeling with main characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I have truly gained so much respect for what soldiers go through. This movie really puts you in the mindset of a soldier and takes you through this journey with them, especially in the beginning of the movie when they show all of the training that these soldiers have to go through, I couldn't even imaging having to go through that. The emotions that are evoked throughout the movie was what really got to me. Especially knowing that most of these men had wives or they were planning to be married and ready to start their lives, it really brought me to tears. I thought this movie was beautifully put together and really honored the men that died that day and showed how courageous they were. This movie definitely had me on the edge of my seat for a while! And just knowing that this was based on a true story is mind blowing to me. We hear these things going on in the news but we really never get to see what any of it is like. Great movie all around, I'm usually not a fan of war movies of any kind but this is something I would recommend to anyone! Definitely makes you more thankful of what you have!</fullReview>

Well, let me say that if you don't want to know what is really going on in the world, what the bad guys are doing and what the good guys have to do to fight them and survive, then go back to your rose-colored glasses and stay away from anything like this movie or the military in general.Mark Wahlberg was amazing, inspired, and the other actors were as well! I have rarely seen such powerful acting or direction.It was like being there, and if you are afraid of being in the middle of a firefight, please, don't go.We had seen the interview of Mark Luttrell on 60 Minutes, and knew the story. As I said, this was like being there, and the entire audience was taken along.This was in Aurora, CO, we have a large military presence, and maybe that was why the audience was so engaged, but I was also, and I never served. At the end, everyone applauded, and it was as much for the SEALs and other military who were involved in this mission as for the actors and movie makers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patriotism and Pashtunwali</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The operation of Navy Seals in Taliban country in the mountains of Afghanistan go awry. And as the title already tells us quite obviously, there is only one lone survivor. However, before it reaches that inevitable conclusion, we will be brought right in the middle of the action where bullets fly and bombs explode. You will definitely flinch as director Peter Berg does not shirk from showing in stark graphic close-ups how bullets and shrapnel hit their targets, drawing blood and ultimately death. We will also bear witness to a 2000 year old code of honor among Afghan villagers called Pashtunwali where undertake the responsibility of protecting an individual at all costs. This is something new I have never known before and is heartening to learn about.Honor and valor comes in different forms from different people. We see a lot of it here in "Lone Survivor." The Seals (played by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch) show it. The Afghan villagers (played by Ali Suliman and Rohan Chand) show it even better.You will really get into the horrific experience of being in the battle zone. This will make you admire and appreciate these brave men who do their unenviable duties in the face of death out of sheer patriotism. This is brutally frank war movie, not for the faint at heart. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a son, grandson, nephew, brother, and friend of many American fighting men and women, I am very pleased with this movie.It is a major honor to live in America and know so many of them.That being said, after reading so many reviews on this movie I can say (to my dismay) that there are many people (American citizens) whose only knowledge of the US military is found in Wikipedia and therefore they know exactly what every SEAL would do in every situation. While I do not believe that everything depicted in the film is EXACTLY the way it happened in actuality (same can be said for World Trade Center, and that was a very public showing of actual events). I do believe the filmmakers took certain liberties in making the film; however, I also believe they did reality justice.The main concern I have with many of the reviews is the unappreciative- ness toward NAVY SEALs (NAVY being one key thing. This was not an ARMY mission. . . ugh). As was depicted in the title credits, SEALs are no cowards. Nor are they weak. If you think a couple bullets are going to bring a SEAL down you are in for a rude awakening. If you think some broken bones and blood (and a sprained ankle) are going to even slow one down, you are mistaken. Medically, it is possible to ignore pain, it's called adrenaline. When you know you are about to die (or someone you love is about to) your body can learn to ignore certain things. Certainly not everyone can, but those trained to can.Final conclusion: Those men are heroes. Their heroic actions should be publicized for the whole world to know what they did. If you don't like it, tough. Things like this have been going on since man first made war. About time someone took notice and honored it here in the USA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Moving Film I Have Seen..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start, for a guy who is overly cautious with films that are 'Based on a True Story' my thoughts changed once I watched this film. Im also one for being negative when real life tragedies are made into a film almost using what happened as a platform to sell. Once again this particular film has opened my eyes to this kind of film making and has made me even more respectful to servicemen both US and UK. The film had me up and out of my chair almost not wanting to watch the rest as it had entertainment factors, however the overwhelming realization that this happened got the better of me. I personally have to put this up with the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan'. It also gave me further interest into the 2005 mission, which got me reading up on loads that happened and what is happening. My only negative thought is the approach to the mission, things like this make me angry (Lets not get political). Although if i had it my way id just send an AC130 over. However... Once again the film changed and showed that ignorance to non Taliban is very high which just sold it for me.Final Thoughts. Watch it and make sure you have tissues (I don't care if your not a pussy DO IT)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but the book was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read Mr. Luttrell's book recently, I'd like to write a review comparing the movie to the book and note some omissions by the director (after all, a 2-hour movie based on a book that describes, in detail, the events that took place over one week is bound to omit certain events). Before I do so, however, I'd like to state that, despite not being 100% true to the book, Mr. Berg does an excellent job. Now, here are some important details omitted from the movie: 1. The death of each SEAL and some battle-scene changes.First of all, Danny Dietz is shown getting apprehended by the Taliban (he's left behind after the other SEAL's tumble down a cliff) and dying from his wounds. In the book, Dietz gets shot in the head while Marcus is trying to drag him to safety. However, the movie does capture each of Dietz's injuries quite well (Dietz was shot eleven times according to autopsy reports, including having his fingers taken off by a 7.62 mm round).Secondly, in the movie, Mike Murphy is able to call the base and inform his superiors of his group's situation, but he gets shot immediately after and dies. In the book, he didn't quite die at this point, as he was able to retreat back to cover (he actually died screaming Marcus' name).Thirdly, after Axe and Marcus get separated, we don't know exactly what happens to Axe according to the book (we do know that his body was found with only one magazine left). The movie, however, shows him fighting until he runs out of ammunition.2. Marcus' retreat and captivity.This is where the movie really doesn't do the book justice. By that, I mean that the book was actually more dramatic and harrowing than even the movie.You see, the movie shows Marcus stumbling along immediately after the fire-fight, finding water and then being rescued by villagers. However, in the book, Marcus actually has to drag his bloody, dehydrated body for miles before finding a water source (over the course of one day). When he finally finds it, he is indeed rescued by villagers.Now, it's worth mentioning that the village actually protected Marcus from the Taliban for a few days. The book shows the villagers protecting Marcus from the Taliban for about half of a day. This wasn't true. Mohammad Gulab and his family actually protected Marcus after he was discovered by the Taliban FOR DAYS. After the Taliban found Marcus, they beat him up, but the village elder (actually Gulab's father) kicked the Taliban out of his house (in which Marcus was situated) using his authority as an elder and hid Marcus in another area. There were a few times when Gulab and Marcus were almost discovered, ready to fight, but fortunately this never materialized. Ahmad Shah, the main bad guy, actually confronted Gulab face-to-face and demanded that Gulab hand over Marcus (he left Gulab with the choice of making the decision later).Anyway, Marcus was found by Rangers on the ground and rescued.I loved the movie; don't get me wrong. But the actual events that took place after he was given asylum by the Afghani villagers is worth mentioning.</fullReview>

I was glued to the screen for the entire movie and when the ending came, you could have heard a pin drop in the theater and there was quite a large audience. From what I have heard the movie was true to the original story that the surviving Navy Seal had experienced and the actors including Mark Wahlberg did an excellent and believable job portraying the Navy Seals. As a Navy veteran, I am personally in ah of Navy Seals and the training they have to endure to be some of our Nations finest. There is now way that i would have been able to complete that training and probably be ringing the bell before the first day of training was over. At the end of the movie, I must say my disgust of Taliban terrorist has increased that they all should be eliminated permanently. There should be no rules of engagement when dealing with them and there sympathizers, no different than the NVA and sympathizers such as Jane Fonda from the Viet Nam era. I do recommend it for everyone, 18+, language and violence is in the movie but makes it more believable. As good a movie as "Saving Private Ryan" but more relevant for what's going on in Afghanistan today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riveting. Best film of the year. Best war tribute since Saving Private Ryan (1998). This movie will grind your humanity to the core and keep you cringing in your seat as you experience the reality of war with no lines, no clear rules of engagement, no clear outcomes?just the clarity of life and death. If you don't applaud, cry and hug a soldier after seeing this film, you may not be human.Last night was pretty full. I read part of Robert Gates book, Duty and then attended the funeral of a good friend named John? a WWII hero. I saw John's purple heart, his bronze star. You don't get those things for sitting on the sidelines in college philosophy class. John survived to raise many fine children and inspire others. My Dad the same. No combat decorations for my Dad but the jungles of New Guinea were not exactly a day in the basement playing Xbox and eating pizza. My conclusion. War sucks big time. It may be necessary, but everyone from the President on down better be on board 180%. We don't put young men and women in harms way unless we are in extreme jeopardy of life and liberty. Because some men survive. Some do not. The survivors carry their fallen comrades for life, one way or another.The film is based on real life account of Marcus Luttrell in "Operation Red Wings" in Afghanistan 2005. The operation tasked four members of SEAL Team 10 to kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. They are poorly supported with communications more faulty than a Comcast cable box. These were regular young guys with girlfriends and a life at home and everything to live for. Americas best young men. Then they encounter and old man, a young child and several goat herders at the wrong place at the wrong time. Now everyone's life is in jeopardy. Suddenly duty, hour, country, right, wrong and basic human instincts to survive get very confused. Another great film, Casualties of War (1989) came to mind.I do not recommend this film for the weak of heart or for parents of current soldiers. Horrors of war should left off the table for some folks. This is not a film for the under 14 crowd. But every politician and wimp in this country that thinks political tricks and traffic jams are more important than our soldiers and ambassadors from Benghazi to Bagram should be strapped in a seat and forced to watch this film for or five times.God Bless America tonight. God bless these self described "hard-bodied, hairy- chested,rootin'- tootin' shootin', parachutin' demolition double-cap crimpin' frogman." You have to have that type of attitude and sense of humor to face what they face. Remember that and say a prayer for them next time you take a free walk in your local park. And go see this film. Not up to it? Contribute a few hundred dollars to The Wounded Warriors Project.</fullReview>

The story moves at a great pace and yet spends enough time with the men to draw you and make you really feel for them. The acting is good, very good in parts, and for the most part feels as though the actors are really going through what those poor guys did (portraying that it) The gun fights are very good, again you get the feeling of been there with them and having the fear of danger. Stunt work is a standout point, some by actors (more than normal) but those brave stunt people really earned their paychecks. The location for filming is spot on, there is very little green screen, and again it helps you feel like you are there. My only dis of the film is the last 30mins, it starts to slip from a real feel to a normal action film, but its not enough to hurt the score of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Peter Berg, the director of Battleship and Hancock - WAIT STOP DON'T LEAVE!!! I know, Berg's reputation as a director isn't exactly stunning, but stay with me here...Lone Survivor is the adaptation of the book by Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell, and is based on his true story of survival after "Operation Red Wings", a mission to take out a high ranking Taliban leader, goes awry. If there's one thing you need to know about this film, it's this: This movie was a labor of love. Berg did his homework, visiting the real families of each soldier involved, using real veterans to fill in various extra roles, researching the looks and typical protocols of Tactical and Joint Operation Centers, and even getting the actual equipment. The result is a very authentic representation of Navy SEALs in action, and many veterans are calling it the most accurate depiction of modern U.S. military warfare. THIS FEELS REAL.Adding to this is the solid performances by the cast. Mark Wahlberg does a solid job, while Taylor Kitsch and Emile Hirsch give us great supporting performances. What should be noted is the fact that many of the people involved here - Berg, Wahlberg, and Kitsch most notably - took significant pay cuts to get this movie out. Berg directed getting paid the union minimum salary, which is still a nice chunk of money for 42 days of shooting ($17,000 per week), but the point is that everyone involved were driven by a great amount of pride in this project, and not by a major paycheck. Also, I should have gotten into directing.We all know that Navy SEALs are some badass mofo's when it comes to toughness, but DAMN, THEY CAN TAKE SOME PUNISHMENT. Some people might question how believable that toughness is in a few spots, but I WILL NOT BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. I have no desire to have SEAL Team 6 come flying through my windows tonight. Is it as good as "Saving Private Ryan", like some of the advertisements are saying? No. But it doesn't have to be. Lone Survivor is still a moving, gritty and authentic story that will leave you with a fine appreciation of what these servicemen went through.Lone Survivor scores a 4 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(Hey guys, thanks for reading.

		<shortDescription>Definitely not for the faint of heart; Rambo this is Not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never watch another Rambo movie or war story the same. Those movies seem rather lame after being caught up in the middle of the fire fight these guys experienced in the mountains. This movie is intense and after reading the comments on this site from real war heroes it verified what I saw on screen. I've watched the interviews with Marcus Luttrell and wish him the very best in living with the demons and the memories of his ordeal. I wish the Congress, our President with his family and Ms. Clinton would be forced to watch this movie before they commit our young men to war. I wish all of us in the world would practice Pashtunwali. Maybe it's too much wishful thinking? We all know the outcome but at the very end, as the credits roll, the actual pictures and videos of these Heroes was tough, really hard to take. They were like any of us; wanting to just be happy and grow old with our spouses and kids. God Bless them and the loved ones they left behind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Lone Survivor" during a matinée showing on opening weekend, and the theater was just about full. It was one of the few times that I can remember a movie ending and there was complete silence from the crowd ? nothing at all. People just quietly got up and left, the movie was that powerful.I had read the book prior to watching the movie, and I think they did a good job following the story in the book. I am also a big fan of Peter Berg, Taylor Kitsch and "Friday Night Lights." The soundtrack to the film was reminiscent of the music used during the series, and I felt that it was the perfect backdrop for the various scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Does These Heroes Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was still on active duty in the Marine Corps, a situation involving a recon team, an isolated mountaintop, a targeted Afghani warlord, and a couple of innocent goatherders was posed to us as the perfect ethical dilemma. A room full of officers wrestled with the theoretical frying pan and fire?self-preservation (or, more importantly, the safety of their Marines) vs. morality. I knew then that I had to read Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10. I was not disappointed. I couldn't put that book down, and I recommended it to anyone who would listen.I've said this before many times, and I'll say it again: I love sports and movies, but my heroes aren't athletes or actors. I was fortunate enough to serve this great Country alongside my heroes. When I heard that this movie was being made, I couldn't wait to see what a team of talented filmmakers dedicated to bringing proper glory to the brave men of Operation Red Wings could do with this amazing story.Again, I was not disappointed. As a pure action flick, this film is top-notch. But it's more than that. It's a glimpse at what some patriotic, determined men and women do for other Americans (and, more importantly, for each other), in far off lands, under uncomfortable conditions, for a mediocre paycheck and little recognition.It took some effort for me not to get choked up during this film. Afterwards, my girlfriend marveled, "It's amazing how much the human body can take." I agreed, and added, "Even moreso, the human mind." Make this the next film you watch, especially if you need to get motivated to do anything remotely tough.What would you do in the situation involving the goat herders? I always say that if the first time you consider an ethical scenario is the moment that you're facing it, you're much more likely to compromise your moral code.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lone Survivor" does not disappoint in its depiction of a group of Navy Seals who fight off scores of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Confronted at the beginning of their mission with the dilemma of letting three goatherds go and risking the compromising of their mission or killing them - they let them go. The subsequent loss of all of the four Seals but one, Marcus Lutrell, and the killing of 16 of their comrades in a helicopter crash trying to rescue them is the crux of the movie.The movie is fast paced and well acted. It is very difficult to become a Seal. They put to use all of their special training trying to survive. The physical wounds of war are excruciating to watch. Mark Wahlberg is good as the Texan, Marcus Luttrell, who grittily clings to life after being given sanctuary by a group of friendly Afghan villagers and who is still pursued by the relentless Taliban.Adults and adolescents will like the film, but small children would be well advised to give it a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film that demands our attention to its characters, story, and above all its dignity towards our brave US servicemen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lone Survivor" has the makings of any great war picture. A likable band of brothers fighting against impossible odds. Bloody gun battle sequences. And even some hidden messages. What makes this film more unique than most others is the fact that it is based on a true story. Set in 2005, the movie follows SEAL Team 10, whom are sent into the perilous grounds of Afghanistan to take out an important Taliban leader. When their mission becomes compromised, they are forced to abort with an entire army hot on their trails. There were four members of SEAL 10. Only one lived to tell his story, hence the movie's title.There are three things in this feature that have left me in deep thought and personal reflection. The first is the reasoning behind the mission's failure. A small group of Afghan shepherds stumble upon SEAL Team 10. They are detained and the SEALs decide what to with their prisoners. Rather than simply killing the sheep herders, which is against the rules of engagement to kill unarmed prisoners or unarmed combatants, they release them. In turn, the herders flock to the Taliban, giving the SEALs whereabouts to them. Incidentally, this leads to most of SEAL 10s deaths. Morally, releasing the prisoners may have been the right. Logically, this was definitely not the situation. I really should not judge out of respect for the fallen, but this decision sheds the all too familiar light that the US enemies share no compassion and give no quarter--which goes against the American ideology. This action of SEAL Team 10 makes me think upon myself on what I would do in such an ethical conundrum. Deep down, like many, I would not have been so pleasant. The second factor is that this movie ruptures the stereotype that all Afghans are wicked, barbaric, American haters. Without giving too much more away, the film shows that there are some good-hearted and brave individuals that live in Afghanistan. See, people will walk into the theater, anticipating another shoot 'em up, bang 'em up war flick. "Lone Survivor" has its sustained moments of violence, but its roots are in the goodness of humanity. The final thing that works uniquely for this film is the characterization of the members of SEAL Team 10. All the actors wrap themselves into their characters, making them good, heroic men to admire. We smile at their daily banters and grow depressed as many of them are brutally killed. Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell delivers one of his best works in years. He displays so many emotions with perfection. Ben Foster turns in equal brilliance and stark ferocity. This man needs some more great dramatic work on his resume.All these aside, people will probably remember this feature most for its visual pleasures. A little bit of the Jerry Bruckheimer effect is at work--slow-motion shots for dramatic emphasis, hand-held camera in the heat of the action, and music on a gallantry scale. Yet, it feels more like a documentary. The opening credit sequence is archive footage of SEALS in training, and the ending is a montage of pictures and videos of the men who had fought and died on this mission. In addition, voice-over narration is utilized and base names and locations appear to fill in the geographical gaps. I give kudos to the sound effects editor and mixers for their Oscar nominated work. They truly make the audience feel like they are in the middle of a war zone. Peter Gabriel's song "Heroes" presents as one of the most uplifting songs in film that I haven't heard in years.The final thing I will mention before I conclude is the audience's reaction to at my viewing. Once the feature had drawn to a close, it was silent. Actually, through the entire film, the crowd was quiet. A pen could be dropped and heard. No applause. No sniffling of tears. Nothing. The only other film I had this experience at was "The Passion of the Christ." I can only surmise that everyone was stunned and engulfed by the film's powerful impact. It was a privilege to see this feature on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Wahlberg leads a great cast with support from Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, Eric Bana, Taylor Kistch, among others.The title is a dead giveaway. But still the movie is so true. As it also had real life military people as extras.It is about a group of Navy SEALS who try to kill a leader of Al-Qaeda in which their mission is compromised. As they are outnumbered in the "Operation Red Wings" back in 2005. The scenes are intense as well as the will to survive is that way. As these brave men learn how loyalty comes at a price. As well as comes either kill or be killed for the love of country.Action scenes are really not for the squeamish but the loyalty and price to pay to protect us and serve the country and world. Needs to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor gives civilians an honest look into the brutal and heroic actions Navy SEALs endure on the job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me preface this review by saying that the novel written by Marcus Luttrell was the best book I have ever read, hands down. The amount of detail regarding SEAL training and specializing in the first part of the novel gives civilians a crystal clear picture of how dedicated, intense, and mentally/physically elite these real warriors are. The movie did show us glimpses of real footage from BUDs in California and that was refreshing. I would not have been mad though, if the film included even more footage from SEAL training. One thing that I believe Marcus Luttrell consciously did was not make the movie about himself. That just attests to the character of Marcus Luttrell. He wanted this movie to be about his fallen brothers: Danny Dietz, Mike Murphy, and Matt Axelson. Marcus didn't put anything in the film about himself before he arrived in Afghanistan. How selfless can you be!! Another selfless act by Marcus Luttrell was when he geared up and placed himself in the Chinook helicopter with the other SEALS/armed service men who tragically got shot down by an RPG from an insurgent. I think deep down that Marcus felt an urge to do this, and that just speaks volumes of his character. The directing by Peter Berg (who took a pay cut to make this movie) and acting by Marky Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, Eric Bana, and the many others was spot on. All of these great actors wanted this film to be made out of a sense of pride, and that truthfully resounds throughout the film. The firefight was epic and gave people who didn't read the book an honest sense of what happened on that fateful day in June 2005. I only wish that the movie showed two more things: 1) when Marcus's best friend, Mike Murphy, goes to make that radio call to base, he gets wounded and is stranded and screams, "MARCUS, HELP ME!!! Marcus, please help!!" and Marcus puts his gun down in the middle of the gunfight and covers his ears so he doesn't have to hear his best man suffer. That to me is the most powerful moment in the book. That would have been a powerful scene. The second thing I would have liked to see in the movie would be how far Marcus crawled with all of his wounds and broken back and the DAYS stuck in the village. I know that a movie can't go on for 5 hours, but I didn't want the movie to end. All in all, this film was the most realistic and heroic film I have ever seen. Props to everyone who made this movie happen (with a low budget, too!!). I hope that nothing but good things happen to the people that made this movie for the rest of their lives. I am glad that the families of the three fallen SEALs got their sons back for a few hours. I am glad they got to see how brave their sons were. Every American should see this movie. I knew the entire story from reading Marcus Luttrell's novel, and I was still hoping there was a different outcome. Nobody said a word at the conclusion of the pictures of the fallen SEALs at the end of the movie, and it was quite a sobering experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor Spoiler Free reviewLone Survivor is another brutal portrayal of war. It may not be the best one but it is still an intense movie. Lone Survivor is the story of 4 NAVY seals trying to survive Afghanistan terrorists. The result is a touching and intense movie. The action scenes are well shot by Peter Berg who had directed Battleship. Whenever a soldier gets shot, you feel it. The movie does a good job of giving a good portrayal of how war is. It's not all explosions. Our heroes are being surrounded, taking all the shots and just trying to survive. The first 45 minutes is the set up which isn't really that good. There is no development for the characters. You know how they look like but you may not know there names. Sometimes you just don't care for them. All the performances are good. All the actors do a good job of portraying the real life soldiers who were in that dangerous situation. Lone Survivor is a really good war movie with intense action scenes and good performances. The character part of the movie may disappoint some people. Just like Black Hawk Down, an intense movie about soldiers in Somalia but also suffers from lack of character development.Overall rating 9/10 Intense portrayal of real life events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Testament to Incredible Courage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things stick with me in this movie: a moral dilemma and the courage of four men against all odds. Four Navy SEALs sent to observe a Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan are unluckily discovered by three goat shepherds. The commander decides to let them go since killing them, while ensuring the operation's secrecy, could have nasty PR repercussions. Besides, one is very young and another very old. As fate would have it, the shepherds alert the Taliban and the four men must fight for their lives after a vastly larger force engages them from higher ground. Nineteen Americans end up dying as a result. It reminds me of in "Saving Private Ryan" when the Americans let a German prisoner go who then later engages them and kills several in combat.However, Marcus Luttrell, the one SEAL to survive depends on the good will of a village that gives him sanctuary from the murderous and brutal Taliban. If they had executed the shepherds, could he have counted on this good will? Maybe not. All actions in this war have unanticipated consequences.As the four men fight the large Taliban force they must jump down the steep mountain slopes to find more cover. They maintain a cohesion and continuously engage the enemy in spite of being nearly surrounded. Their physical condition degrades as they suffer wounds, but they keep up the fight. I really like the close up shots on the men's faces as they look out for each other, patch their wounds, and resist to the bitter end. These are four tough hombres with a professional warrior tradition.Matt Axelson's resistance with a pistol while wheezing his last breath with multiple wounds is a testament to these men and to the memoir. I think anyone who has served in combat would agree these men gave it all and then a lot more.Lastly, this film makes me question how the Afghanistan conflict can continue year after year where villages in defiance of the Taliban are under assault yet keep their traditions of protecting a guest at all costs. How can these brutal tribesmen continue to fight and murder in the face of such overwhelming fire power? When caught in the open against the Apache helicopters or the AC-130 gunships these guys are toast, yet the struggle continues. Well worth seeing this film - please go if you are interested in this war and in the US military.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie.... Wrong Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the privilege of attending an advance screening of Lone Survivor and I must say that it is one of my favorite movies of 2014. So far, it is currently in my top 10. It's a movie based on the true story of Seal Team Members that went on a failed mission to capture a Taliban leader. The beginning starts off slow but once it picks up, you are left on the edge of your seat... biting your nails... squirming (falling down the mountain scenes)... and then overall emotional. I was highly impressed by the performances of Emile Hirsch and Taylor Kitsch. Emile played hard and tough but when the defying moment came for him, he turns into a softhearted human that captures the essence of the role. Taylor remained strong in such a tumultuous ordeal and his courage really inspired me. I could never imagine what the real soldiers went through but Taylor's commitment to the role brought tears to my eyes. Again, the movie has all of the thrills that you expect from a war film and it's doesn't sugar coat anything. Some scenes are gruesome but nothing you would lose your stomach over. The only misstep was MARK WAHLBERG. Don't shoot me because I think that he is a good actor but he plays the same character in all of his movies (personality-wise). Not once did I feel like he was playing another character but he was the typical Mark that we have all seen before. I must applaud his commitment to the role though because I'm sure that it wasn't an easy task. He was sorely miscast. Just a minor bump in a great film.If you're emotional, bring the Kleenex because the movie does pull at your heart strings. If you're a strong man like myself, you'll be okay but you're not human if this movie doesn't move you. It is a must see because it reminds you of the hard work and the sacrifices soldiers have provided for us. This is powerful a film and I am in debt to all of the lives that were sacrificed for our country. 8/10</fullReview>

In this film, there is the most terrific sequence of downhill falling down for a human being among rocks. I was shaking on my seat. All long their long downfall, I wondered: WHEN THE HELL WILL THEY AT LAST FINISH THEIR FALL INTO HELL?Terrific.

		<shortDescription>Masterful movie making -- Ignore the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do so many of the "professional" critics forget this is an adaptation of a book? It is supposed to be emotionally one sided, because that is what was written by the author. He wrote what HE WENT THROUGH, not the enemy. Critics complain when a movie goes too far outside the lines of truthful events, now many of them are complaining because the movie focuses on what actually happened out there? Artistic license was taken in the setup as well as the final act. The battle was what it was. The movie was never meant to be 2 sided or politically thought provoking. Why is that wrong? Many of these same people loved the mindless, silly plotted "Gravity" because of it's technical achievement, but they rip "Lone Survivor" for sticking to it's accurate guns? As more liberal-minded person myself, I am appalled by critics who CLEARLY allow their own politics to cloud their rating.As a technical achievement, "Lone Survivor" succeeds. That said, it does fail a bit in the 1st and 3rd acts, plus it fudges a huge fact regarding the goat herders.Making 2 hour movies out of a non-fiction book, while trying to build characters, is tricky. In this case, I believe too much time was spent up front creating the characters, while too little focus was given to the ending, which stretched about 5 days in real life. The movie shows it as an overnight and gets a bit gimmicky in spots, as it tries to tie it up. I feel the days in captivity and the efforts that the tribe and US forces went through were marginalized and that was a shame. Character creation could have been done in more efficient fashion as they were moving out, IMO. The MAJOR fact fudge regarding the goat herders was that, in real life, they had no idea if they were Taliban or not. The movie made it clear they were, when in fact they just didn't know. That is why they made their decision. The movie needed to be more precise with that scene.All that aside, your hands will sweat and you will be captivated by what you see. The performances were uniformly solid, save for maybe Eric Bana, who does little. It is a must-see movie and a worthwhile read. I'd recommend the book first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that this movie tries to engage audience into vilifying the Taliban as a very amateur Army, but the truth is not so many Taliban fighters died in the real battle and it was almost like a one sided battle for Taliban and there was hardly any resistance according to sources of Taliban during this mission, people say this is realistic which I fail to understand because as far as I am concerned the US soldiers seemed to be robots that would fall the cliff over rocks get hit be tree trunks so hard that it would break any bones at the same time I don't see chances of survival in such falls, let alone everyone surviving during such falls, which is very unrealistic...It is also important to note how good the Aim of US soldiers was very sharp when they were in such pain and torment, shivering of fear, in reality the case is completely opposite, Taliban were shown to come out without any proper cover and understanding but just shooting and marching, but in reality the Taliban has undoubtedly beaten The US and NATO forces in every Stratagem of war, the casualties that Taliban takes is mainly because of Air Support, otherwise they are very strategic to take much less damage, and very sharp to inflict more damage.I don't see this as a realistic movie as I have seen some real fights of Taliban and US forces on Youtube which are more powerful and real and create the sense of understanding what a real encounter is like, it creates fear and certain atmosphere that is unmatchable that your heart starts pounding and every gunshot you hear creates certain vibrations in your heart. But I have to say this movie does however do justice to Hollywood standards which have been much more unrealistic usually but no we cannot call this movie realistic and it should be considered as fiction because there is lot of fiction involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honor Under Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Wahlberg struggles to stay alive in war-torn Afghanistan throughout "Friday Night Lights" director Peter Berg's "Lone Survivor," a heroic but tragic combat chronicle co-starring Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Eric Bana. This gritty, profane, but ill-fated secret mission saga about former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell's battlefield exploits qualifies as an entertaining but predictable saga. Basically, this blood, sweat, and tears, mission-gone-awry movie reminded me of Ridley Scott's grueling warfare spectacle "Black Hawk Down." Scott's actioneer dealt with a disastrous mission in Somalia, back in 1993, when U.S. Rangers were dispatched to snatch two warlords out of a town teeming with heavily armed fanatics. They encountered chaos galore and had to fight for their lives. Comparably smaller in scale, "Lone Survivor" lacks the harrowing intensity of "Black Hawk Down." Our desperate "Lone Survivor" hero endures a nightmare-experience that lesser souls would never have survived. Sadly, his three SEAL team unit members caught none of his breaks. Nevertheless, while watching "Lone Survivor," I didn't feel like I was dodging a firestorm of ordnance as I did when I sat through "Black Hawk Down." Despite its two-hour plus length, "Lone Survivor" never bogs down. Although Berg's combat choreography lacks the visceral quality of "Black Hawk Down," the "Lone Survivor" stunts look and sound very physical. Scenes of soldiers plummeting down the sides of craggy mountains made me flinch. Recently, I fell and shattered by right elbow so every time one of the SEALs struck either a rocky outcropping or a tree, I cringed at the sickening sounds. Specifically, Berg doesn't emphasize the predicament that ricocheting bullets posed. If you read the frank and outspoken Luttrell, whose memoir Berg adapted, the SEAL team member wrote about how ricochets could prove as menacing as the shots themselves. Most of the time, the SEALs find themselves trapped in terrain with scant foliage. Meaning, it was doubly difficult for them to hide not only from the flying lead but also ricochets. Unlike Luttrell, Berg doesn't dwell at length on the fatal mistake and its consequences as much as Luttrell's memoir. Instead, Berg winds up depicting the SEALs as honorable men who refused to take the easy way out of a moral quandary."Lone Survivor" covers the three days during Operation Red Wing when an elite four-man unit of Navy SEALs set out to capture Taliban chieftain Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami of "Crank") in the rugged Hindu Kush Mountains of the Kunar Province. They want Ahmad because he masterminded the murder of 20 American soldiers. Like the disastrous mission in "Black Hawk Down," the "Lone Survivor" heroes are conducting business-as-usual until everything that can go wrong goes horrendously wrong. Similarly, like "Black Hawk Down," "Lone Survivor" derives its narrative from a factual, eyewitness account. During the opening credits, Berg gives us a glimpse at wannabe Navy SEALs negotiating a gauntlet of an obstacle course. Grainy, documentary-style footage of SEALs enduring the worst that you can imagine outside of combat foreshadows the tenacity of our heroes. They can take a licking and keep on ticking. Afterward, we meet the quartet of warriors and enjoy their easy-going camaraderie. Twenty-nine-year old Texas native Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg of "Ted") is a Hospital Corpsman who has no idea how complicated his life will be on his next mission. Luttrell's friends, Lt. Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch of "John Carter"), Gunner's Mate Danny P. Dietz (Emile Hirsch of "Savages"); and Sonar Technician Matthew "Axe" Axelson (Ben Foster of "3:10 to Yuma"), are just as oblivious. Thoughts about home and their loved ones dominate their thoughts. No sooner have they reached their objective than an elderly goat herder and two boys accidentally stumble onto them in the brush. Our heroes capture these Taliban loyalists and take them prisoner. Lieutenant Murphy boils down their options. First, they can execute their hostages. Second, they can leave them tied to trees in the wilderness like snacks for wild animals. Third, they can release them and scrub the mission. Our heroes behave like noble western gunfighters. They decide to turn the shepherd and his sons loose. Luttrell and company believe they can clear out before the enemy show up. Unfortunately, our heroes find themselves suddenly surrounded by an army of Taliban terrorists armed with AK-47 assault rifles with an inexhaustible supply of ammunition. In his memoir, Luttrell compared their predicament to Custer's Last Stand. Afterward, a running gun battle follows with our heroes mowing down terrorists by the dozens. The problem is the Taliban have the SEALs hopelessly outnumbered and our heroes have nowhere to go. Worse, the SEALs have trouble getting a clear signal so they can contact headquarters and summon relief helicopter gunships!Characterization remains sketchy at best in "Lone Survivor." Indeed, we never gain much insight into the Americans as three dimensional characters. Berg treats the quartet of SEALs as if they were an ensemble so you're not sure initially who is going to buy the farm. No single character lords it over the others in spite of their respective ranks. Not surprisingly, the Americans emerge as sympathetic, but the filmmakers don't demonize the Taliban. Primarily, Berg keeps the villains at arm's length. The Taliban amounts to pugnacious, trigger-happy, dastards. Essentially, they resemble the hordes of Apache Indians in a cavalry western. We know little about them except that they are miserable marksmen, wear too much eye-liner, and live only to slaughter Americans with extreme prejudice. Surprisingly, Berg shuns any geopolitical messages or cultural bias. The sloppy but violent combat sequences will keep you distracted from diatribes from either side. "Lone Survivor" is a good movie, but you won't want to see it more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very good movie. it was very emotional and the fact of knowing it is a true story just really makes it even more amazing. knowing going into the film you new that there was only going to be one survivor. however this didn't change that this was a great movie. you got to meet all the men that was lost that day and them having families just like anyone else and then there whole world is changed because of the war. You got a great feel of how the men and women are truly a family in the arm forces. its a brotherhood that no one would ever know. Mark Wahlberg and the producers did a great job of not making this a Hollywood popcorn movie. meaning that it was all about the money. this story was told like it should. letting everyone in America know and understand what our soldiers have to go through each and every day to keep us all safe. well done on the film everyone should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm usually not a fan of flag-waving war movies. But this one had a lot of nice elements. What carried the narrative along, so that it wasn't just a shoot out, (although one of those scenes went on too long for my taste), was careful editing, back and forth between two or three narratives. And what carried the day, was not patriotism, but the the band of men, fighting together. The four men, were admirable, although I wasn't completely happy with either Mark Wahlberg's character or acting, I'm not sure why, I seemed to have the sense that he wasn't in the fight as much as the other men, as if the star needs to be saved at the end, and I dislike having to say that, because I am sure the real life hero fought as bravely as the others. The script and dialog were tight. The film showed war at its bloodiest, most fatal, hand-to-had combat. And also had an interesting plot twist at the end showing the humanity of a culture other than our own. Interspersed with the fighting shots were wide angle natural beauty: supposed to be a mountainous range in Afghanistan; the film was shot in New Mexico. The film's credits at beginning and end - stay all the way to the end - nicely framed the picture in our real country's heroes. The entire theater audience with whom I saw the picture, applauded the film at the end, and at the end of the credits. Films don't often get that kind of praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense firefighting scenes lift this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"So if you're feeling froggy, then you better jump, because this frogman's been there, done that and is going back for more."Lone Survivor caught me completely by surprise considering I wasn't expecting much from director, Peter Berg, whose films I tend to dislike quite a bit. "From the director of Battleship and Hancock" isn't exactly great marketing campaign for a film. This personal and passionate project of Berg's ended up being by far his best work to date. Saying that this was the best war movie of the year is also an understatement considering I really can't recall another one, but I can tell you that despite having its flaws some of the action scenes do recall moments from Saving Private Ryan (and that is very high praise for a war film considering I'm not really the biggest fan of this genre). I tend to get tired with overlong firefight action scenes, but it wasn't the case with Lone Survivor. These scenes felt real and gruesome while building a lot of tension. Not once during the two hours did I feel like the film was dragging. The pacing of this film was solid. Berg actually did his homework here and having spent a month based with an actual SEAL team payed off because the screenplay felt believable. Ultimately the film is about brotherhood and fighting for survival, and that is accomplished very well by Berg who decided to make a narrow minded and focused movie instead of a large scale war film.Lone Survivor is based on a true story that took place in Afghanistan in 2005 involving a SEAL team's mission to kill a Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. Berg adapted the screenplay from Marcus Luttrell's book of the same name. Lutrell (played by Mark Wahlberg) was one of the four SEAL members involved in the mission "Operation Red Wings" taking place in the Afghan region. The others were Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). Their mission becomes compromised when a group of goat herders run into their hideout in the Hindu Kush region and the four have to make a quick ethical decision. They can either kill them or they can let them go knowing that they will warn the villagers of their presence. Despite knowing the risks involved they decide to let the herders go and quickly try to reach a better location to communicate back to their base before the Taliban catches up with them. It's not long until they are surrounded by enemy forces and are forced to fight for survival despite being heavily outnumbered. Despite knowing where the film is heading (considering the title gives away the story), it still maintains the audience's interest and build tension really well. The performances from Wahlberg, Foster, Kitsch, and Hirsch are all pretty solid and they each bring some unique trait to their characters. We sympathize with these characters and understand the quick moral decisions they have to make considering their lives are on the line. In a way Berg is trying to pay some sort of tribute to these soldiers who put their lives on the line every day and makes us appreciate the risky work they do even more. Perhaps many people found this film a bit heavy handed in that it does try to deliver a patriotic and courageous message about macho soldiers, but I didn't have an issue with that because at the same time Berg is also portraying the ugliness of the battlefield. Perhaps the easiest moment to pinpoint this film as military propaganda is the opening SEAL's training montage, but I thought it worked to help set the characters better and in a way sort of pay homage to these soldiers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a solid war movie came out of Hollywood after a while. It is very watchable and tense all the time. Pretty well story telling, involving and convincing. Good acting. There are some minor downsides but only one real problem with this movie, if you ask me. I understand that 'Lone Survivor' has been made after the real events. However, it is still a feature movie, so it needs a well standing plot logics. I do appreciate the artistic freedom of the director as well as following the facts, but I can't really accept the horse and the dove standing on the same branch. It makes at least one big hole in the movie plot. This is why I can't accept that everything over here happened because four members of the elite special forces deep behind enemy lines let the imprisoned Al Kaida go only for the fact that they were unarmed or too young/old to be shot but not to shoot. I can even accept that these are the facts - but in that case I am sure that we needed the additional explanation to understand the whole picture, not just few isolated facts. And this is what makes these facts very weak: The prisoners where not armed and not part of their mission so they didn't want to kill them. I am not sure about you but I do find this logical until some point. But not the part where they don't want to tie them up. 1. Cause they might freeze to death. They were tough locals living in the place closer to stone age than a/c or gas heating condos, I doubt they would freeze over just one night. 2. They would be eaten by the wolves. 99% of people killed by the wolves are coming from the Hollywood movies. In reality, wolves are afraid of people and are avoiding them. In my opinion, chances of wolves attacking people even if tide up are low. 3. Most important, we talk about the indigenous people, people who know the area as their pocket and are moving like cougars on these stones. Don't you think that someone from the village would notice they disappeared and go after them, if they just left them there? And then, there are their goats all around to notice them easier if that is necessary at all since they were all the time around a mile or two from the village so there were great chances that they would have been found quickly while the seals would have enough time to boogie. Like this, movie scenario suggests that this story happened because four navy seals decided to play good Samaritans and even more than that to make themselves absolutely sure that nothing bad will happen to their Al Kaida prisoners or at least potential Al Kaida company. Once again, I think that movie is still entertaining if we can call it that way since it seems that lot of people died there for real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanitarian Decisions In War With Huge Costs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the ill fated operation code named "Red Wings" Lone Survivor immediately rates as a classic American war movie. Starting out somewhat by rote by mixing real training footage with segments filmed expressly for the movie it gets the point across that only the creme De la creme of our fine forces make the grade for Special Ops/Seals. The movie quickly gets to business after what seems perfunctory in retrospect. No harm, however, because what these men go through is truly extraordinary and it should be reinforced. The business is of the deadly kind with a multi-pronged battle plan. The four brave men who must be dropped in to do the recon do so with tremendous precision and achieve all initial objectives only to be hampered by poor radio communications and intel that underestimated the manpower surrounding their target. Trained to adapt they move stealthily in order to hide overnight and re-establish communications at the earliest safe opportunity. That opportunity becomes complicated and decisions based on moral high ground quickly play into not a retreat, but survival itself This is the powerful crux of Lone Survivor. How four soldiers fight so bravely, and effectively up to a point, against overwhelming numbers of Taliban is beyond amazing. The most remarkable thing is without doubt how Marcus Luttrell survived. It's a story that deserves to be told time and time again, not only for the one man who survived, but for those who gave their lives in that outcome. It's hard to fault this film in getting this story to the screen. It's both excruciatingly painful and gloriously uplifting to watch. As the credits rolled and the men who actually gave all were shown it is more than clear war is the greatest price so many pay for the freedom we as Americans tend to take for granted. This is a powerful film that deserves to be seen by all who wake up everyday enjoying the spoils. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Im glad i did, the whole thing was superb. I loved it. Its a Must See. I wish this film the best, i honestly do.

		<fullReview>Filmmaker Peter Berg and crew put together an awesome film. The acting was top notch. Mark Wahlberg did a great job in portraying Marcus, even with the variance in their backgrounds. Ben Foster did an absolute excellent job in performing like Axe and as a Tier one operator. Foster maintained that focused, tactical persona and it showed in every expression. All these guys showed the lighter side of Brotherhood and then into the fight of their lives. I've seen this film twice within one week. Without going into specifics, I sat with other men who operate in the environment portrayed, some were former SEAL operators, some were SWAT members. All were men that I've served with where we have been tasked to the point of a firefight. Nothing even close to the Hell Marcus and these fine men went through. The Brotherhood and team spirit that is real was shown in this film to an extreme. This film accurately depicts men, warriors, brothers, loss and humanity. This is the proper way to honor these men, show they are human and a how they are patriots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lone Survivor creates the experience of grit and realism. A strong start where the viewer is inundated with Seal code, by experiencing hell week. Honor, duty, commitment from training is segued into the base experience where the story evolves into Seal's commitment of family/loyalty. One understands why procedures need to be met and not deviated from , but are in conflict with the value of protecting one's Seal brother. There are protocols for reasons and going against it results in dire consequences. Without giving the story away, all I can write is a true story is better than fiction. One experiences there are good and bad in all people. The director and actors where believable. Bana and Whalberg shined in their roles. I give Lone Survivor a seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Well Made War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is a film directed by Peter Berg, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster, and centres around the true story of 4 Navy SEALS who are sent on a mission to kill a notorious Taliban leader, and how the mission quickly goes from controlled to chaotic. I'll begin with my main negative towards the film, and that has to do with tone and music. The music here, done by Explosions in the Sky, is not necessarily bad. I must say though, within the context of the film, it is used fairly poorly. At various points in the film, when gunfights are raining, and everything is as intense as ever, the music turns towards a slower, calmer tone. Now, I noticed this around 3 times within the film. It's almost as if, whilst these gunfights are going on and people are dying, Peter Berg is trying to glorify it all, or make it seem somewhat heroic, as that's how the music sounded to me. The whole film sends the message that war is horrific, horrible and should be avoided at all costs, yet at various points throughout these tremendously powerful fights, we get tonal shifts that hint at heroism, when that tone should be avoided at these specifics times very carefully. It took me out of the film, and unfortunately, it affected the overall rating as well.As well as this problem, I felt, like a lot of reviewers, that this film didn't give enough time to character development, and it really hurt the emotional attachment to these men. I couldn't remember two of the four guys names for most of the film, actually. I'm not necessarily saying that Berg needed to take time away from the action to put towards making his characters more important to us, I'm just saying that a little more effective character development would go quite far for this film.On the positive side, this film, for the most part, is a technical masterpiece. The film is acted to perfection, with Mark Wahlberg giving an impressively emotional performance, and Taylor Kitsch giving us something, that dare I say... is actually good?! The rest of the ensemble is well done, with special mention to Alexander Ludwig, an actor who I previously ridiculed for The Hunger Games, who gave a very solid performance.When it comes to action, Peter Berg knows how to do it right! The action scenes here are intense, brutal and incredibly gritty. There are some real cringe moments here, and some points at which you simply can't watch. When a bullet lands on one of our main characters, you feel it, and it emotionally drains you watching these men get pinned down and beaten up. I have to say, I'd rival the first stage of the main fight with the first fight within Saving Private Ryan, a film which some would consider the best war film of all time, me included. That's a pretty heavy compliment. The gunfights are intense to the point of tears, and they will often have you at the edge of your seat. Berg has nailed the action scenes perfectly here.Now, a lot of reviewers have made mention of the propaganda factor within this film. I personally didn't see much of it. I feel that the film is telling us, as I've mentioned before, that war is not heroic or full of glory, and honestly, we should avoid it all costs. It shows us that war is not black and white, and that everyone involved can very well suffer from it's effect. I'm going to dismiss the propaganda factor as a whole, because I've said, I just don't see it that way.Overall, Lone Survivor is a powerful film, that whilst often tonally inconsistent, will leave you feeling emotionally drained. Peter Berg has a wonderful direction, and his cast helps him in achieving a balanced, centred film. Props to the makeup department as well, who really nailed it with all the blood and injuries. Ultimately, I'm not going to watch this film again, but I do feel that it is a brilliant film. I'm fairly sure it will be on my top 10 of 2014, at least at this stage! 9.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the book and seeing several interviews with Marcus Luttrell I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I was not disappointed. The portrayal of our Navy Seals and the work they do after enduring all the hardships of training is at the very least inspiring. We should thank God everyday for these brave men. The movie gives a realistic account of their devotion to their follow Seals and what they are called upon to do during their mission. The movie based on a true mission that due to no man's individual fault goes wrong. To see how Seal Team 10 responds to what has happened and the decisions they make to try to preserve themselves and their mission. The positive mental attitude in the face of grave odds is something everyone should remember in our daily lives. Seal Team 10 faced those challenges without ever giving up. I strongly suggest seeing this movie. At the conclusion of the movie the packed theater of 225+ people left in silence. Possibly as a memorial to our Fallen Heros.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that will quickly be forgotten - Good storyline but unbelievable firefights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is one of the more interesting war films to be released in 2013. Based on Operation Red Wing in Afghanistan 2005 this film is both gripping and exciting. However, it also raises an eyebrow and fails to bring anything new to the genre which is the ultimate reason why this film will be quickly forgotten.The film itself is more or less solid; a relatively well paced story line, some good acting (for the most part), great fire fights and good music. The director's research into the Navy Seals is evident as military jargon, comradery and atmosphere is portrayed very well. The actors themselves do a good job of bringing this all to life, even though Mark Wahlberg's uninteresting and 'samey' acting is consistent with his previous titles.The issue that many will have with this film is the strong "U.S.A" vibe that lifts this film into the unbelievable. At the beginning we watch Navy Seal training videos, showing what these men need to go through to be the best, however, as soon as the first bullet are fired it seemed more of a justification of the all American super heroes that fall down cliffs, smashing heads against rocks, being shot by AK47 rounds (a large bullet) multiple times and shrugging it all off. Its almost as if the lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell, over emphasized the teams hardships as no one else can correct him.However, if you are willing to overlook this you will be unable to leave the film without feeling a little underwhelmed. The film bring nothing new to the war film genre. In many ways this film is overshadowed by Act of Valor which did almost all aspects, minus acting and storyline, better. It is almost a shame that this storyline wasn't used for that film as this aspect has to be the saving grace of Lone Survivor. All in all, those looking for an interpretation of a special forces mission in Afghanistan this film is for you. As with any film based on true events, the storyline is not going to disappoint. However, if you are looking for a good war film, I would suggest you look elsewhere as the unbelievable invincible Navy Seals leave you shouting in disbelief at the screen! Furthermore, it brings nothing new to the genre and is overcast in many ways by other titles, resulting in a forgettable film.STAR RATING: 6 (just)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic Looking SEAL Mission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Lone Survivor", starring Mark Wahlberg-2 Guns, Ted; Taylor Kitsch-Savages, Snakes on a Plane; Emile Hirsch-Savages, Alpha Dog; Ben Foster-The Mechanic-2011, Alpha Dog and Eric Bana-Hanna, Black Hawk Down.This movie is based on a true story that was written by Marcus Luttrell, the only surviving Navy SEAL team member of a mission in Afghanistan in 2005-and I'm not giving anything away here by saying only surviving member, look at the title of the movie-and he also has a cameo in an early scene of the film. It's directed by Peter Berg-Battleship, Hancock, The Kingdom-with a realistic looking, no holds barred approach. The movie starts by showing some of the training the SEALs actually go through, and through-out the rest of the movie, you get the sense of the type of person it takes to become a SEAL. The mission for SEAL Team 10 was to go in and kill a high ranking Taliban leader in Afghanistan. Mark plays Marcus, with Taylor, Emile and Ben rounding out the 4 man squad. Eric was the military officer giving them their orders. After they made their drop behind enemy lines, the problems began. There were more Taliban holed up at the location than they expected. They ran into goat herders-rules of engagement were argued here-and due to the mountains, they had problems with their radios. Pretty soon, they were in a pretty lop-sided fire fight. I must say that these were some of the most realistic looking battle scenes that I have ever seen. FYI: During the end credits, there are photographs of Marcus and other soldiers shown, and on a side note, Marcus is from Houston. It's rated "R" for the bloody violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 1 minute. I enjoyed it and felt proud of our military and I would buy this on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An undeniable aspect of war, whether or not you make rationalizations on its regrettable purpose or demonize its existence entirely, is that it's an utter hell that tries the mentality and physicality of the courageous men and women who fight in the conflict. Most war film try to capture what its really like in war,but none have never real come close than this one has one review i saw from a former navy seal said this film is spot on to what it really like, i wouldn't disagree with him. This film serious take you on a roller coaster of emotion through it Astonishing camera work, heart-breaking moments as you see them come under fire &amp; pressure to stay alive, it one of the war film that has a very Powerful and Gripping story knowing that this really happened this way in the film is frightening. My heart go out for the brave men &amp; woman of the army force's for the jobs they do. Mark Wahlberg play the the soldier to survive that day on 2005 he plays this role perfect, as well has Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Eric Bana ,Alexander Ludwig play there role with honor with brilliant performance to those who had fallen that day. Ali Suliman played what i call an honorable man that helped Marcus Luttrell , his name is Mohammad Gulab who is still helping fight today against the Taliban this is what i call a good man i wish him &amp; his family well for this. One thing i want to do now is honor those brave men that gave their lives by putting there names on this review because what they did made them all heroes Red wings men we honor you.: Jeffrey Taylor 30 petty officer first class.(R.I.P) James Suh 28 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Jacques Fontan 36 chief petty officer (R.I.P) Jeffery Lucas 33 petty officer first class (R.I.P) Daniel Healy 36 senior chief petty officer (R.I.P) Michael Russell 31 sergeant first class (R.I.P) Michael Mcgreevy jr 30 lieutenant (R.I.P) Chris Sherkenbach 40 chief warrant officer 4 (R.I.P) James ponder 3rd 36 master sergeant (R.I.P) Kip Jacoby 21 sergeant (R.I.P) Marcus Muralles 33 sergeant first class (R.I.P) Shamus Goare 29 staff sergeant (R.I.P) Corey Goodnature 35 chief warrent officer 3 (R.I.P) Shane Patton 22 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Danny Dietz 25 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Erik Kristensen 33 Lieutenant Commander (R.I.P) Matthew Axelson 29 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Michael murphy 29 lieutenant (R.I.P) Marcus Luttrell petty officer first class (survivor) This is as close as your going to get to a war film that The director did his research because everything was 100% accurate in this film according to what I've read, so if your into war type film's or true story's this is one you should watch, because its brutal,breath taking &amp; heartbreaking that so many lives were lost in one mission my heart goes out the family's of these brave men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't get this movie out of my head. I hate to use the term. "It can't be unseen" because it sounds like a bad thing. I'm very torn. This is an amazing story of the heroism of these Navy SEALS. A true story that you become immersed into. There's a love and brotherhood shared by these men that was portrayed right away. The acting served them justice, it felt so very real. But on the other hand, the extreme graphic nature of war was also portrayed without anything held back. It was horrifying and heartbreaking and I cried quit a bit. Just knowing what's coming brought tears in some scenes. It was overly graphic and I can't unsee what I saw, but i also respect the produces for showing the reality of war without distorting or holding back. It was truth. Just that. I definitely recommend this movie if you can stomach real war visuals. And I mean more real than I've even seen, and I've seen it all. There were several times I covered my eyes, ears or both. But in the end I left saddened and overwhelmed but also left with a higher respect for our brave servicemen and women and also the realization that they are just people, like anyone else with lives and families outside of their service and uniforms and this reality grips you when the many photos and videos of the real men that were portrayed in the movie are shown at the end of the movie. There hasn't been a movie affect me so much in a very long time, if ever. And I was not the only one affected. I heard and saw many tears. I have a much different outlook after watching this movie.

		<fullReview>Since I have never been in the military, I am not sure if all the details of this movie were accurate, but once I got into watching it, that really didn't matter to me.The only reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10, is because there is one disturbing scene, that I think could have been much less graphic than it was. Mark Wahlberg was excellent in this movie, as were the other actors. Since this movie came out Christmas Day, I figured by now most would have already been to see it, but that was not the case. The theater was packed, the movie was sold out, and it was difficult to even find a seat! When I saw that, I knew the movie must be a good one. Either way, this movie made me respect the young men and women who serve our country. It made me appreciate those that I personally know who have served or currently serve in the United States Military much more than I previously did.This movie is rough to watch, and will stir up emotion in almost anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Harrowing and Taut Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether talking about a cinematic experience or hearing details of the real thing, the gallantry and heroism of our men and women at arms can never be overstated, be it in service to the defenseless, protecting the nation or for reasons with which everyone may not agree. Though ironically just that ? overstated ? at a number of junctures, Peter Berg's Lone Survivor is nevertheless an often breathless and riveting tale of a small band of brother's desire to survive, and how a greater objective can become a moot point at a moments notice.Lone Survivor once again makes the case that focusing on a smaller portion of a greater conflict is the proper way to go when attempting to make the events of a war film hit close to home. While sweeping, melodramatic conflict driven dramas have their place (and there are some great ones) there is little substitute to spending an intense two hours with a few select individuals as you follow them through a life or death ordeal. When the film's very title overtly hints that there will certainly be more death than life on screen, the experience becomes that much more uncomfortable and traumatic as we watch in unfold, unable to do anything but act as helpless spectator.The biggest compliment that I can pay to Lone Survivor is that it uses the already established nature of its outcome to its advantage rather than allow it to become a constraint that would dampen the impact. Despite the fact that only Mark Wahlberg's Marcus Luttrell escapes from the mountainous Kunar province of Afghanistan after the botched Red Wings assassination mission, equal time is spent with his three fellow Navy SEALs, never using them merely as canon fodder as our indestructible hero defeats the odds. The film treats them as humans, with loved ones, fears and souls and in doing so, as they are overcome by their ordeal, the losses hit closer to the heart.The simple fact we are aware of the outcome means the very journey organically notches up the suspense and all encompassing sense of dread. The stench of death is oppressive and in caring for these individuals and knowing and witnessing their fate it evokes a sort of anger reminiscent of the unfairness present in real conflict. Good, honest men may die, and it may be the furthest thing from fair or just, but that's simply the ugly nature of the beast, and Lone Survivor mirrors that frustration through its execution alone.The four principle cast members are all extremely solid, utilizing their shared screen time to great effect be it alone or with the group. Wahlberg, perpetually the everyman, anchors the picture and brings both the physicality and necessary weakness as the film evolves from firefight to survival situation. Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch have just the right look and overall level of public exposure to recede into their doomed characters, as they too sell their respective journeys towards the end. By far the most surprising member in terms of performance was that of Taylor Kitsch (reteaming with Berg after the dreadful Battleship) who in addition to acting believably as the squad leader employs a delicate blend of grace, heroism and humanity to a role that could have been anything but. This performance proves this young man has a future far beyond doomed blockbusters.The film's biggest folly comes when it paints these soldiers as nearly indestructible machines of war. Amidst what is some of the best shot and choreographed fighting in recent memory we get so many noble, eyes to the sky, slump to the knees, death scenes it both seeks to undermine the credibility of the situation and the otherwise brutal and realistic injuries these men endure. It's at those points that Lone Survivor makes itself clear it's no Saving Private Ryan. In films of that echelon when someone is on the receiving end of a bullet, in that moment at least, it is anything but heroic and patriotic. It's a person, alone in a pool of blood, gasping on a last few futile breaths, and its all the more searing because of it.All that being said, Lone Survivor puts us and its protagonists through the ringer and while presenting them as the supposed elite, never releases its grasp on the situation at hand in favour of pro American pandering. It's as intense and grisly as an experience you're likely to witness this year and though it stops short of greatness, its strides are mighty enough to take us places we don't want to be, and that we can't leave behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actions speak louder than words.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start of the film there is a slow build up to what to expect from this movie, however it's a good thing. It let's the viewer build up a repore on the characters and gently eases you into the film.Everything about the film has not been Hollywoodised, for this I mean it's like "Blackhawk Down" meet's "Act Of Valor", RPG's go off in a blast of smoke and debris rather than a huge explosion of flames, they change empty mag's often rather than the Hollywood 2000 round mag, the kit and equipment is spot on to every detail and I mean every detail, clearly the team working on this movie have done some major homework for this to be achieved and it works perfectly.As for the acting, to be fair the film is more about the operation so actions speak louder than words, Mark Walberg for me has never been a great actor, yet he plays all his parts in every film well, this however is his best to date. It's clear to see his time spent with the "teams" has had an effect of him this time around and the interview (after the film was shot) shows this.For me 2 great moment's shine through, 1st at the point Mike knows he has to get to the ridge to make the call and sacrifice himself in doing so. One of the members of the team is carrying a paint colour chart with him as his wife wishes to paint the house at home, upon his capture and imminent death it is this what he cares about the most. It's seems strange but believe me when you are hit with this situation you thing of the strange things that remind you of home. 2nd is Jeff's death drawing his final breath after his own fight for life, personally it was as real as it get's and made cinematic history with how it was done.Overall this for me was the most realistic movie of modern warfare to date and a class act to follow. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget politics or patriotism (whether blind or the real thing). This movie made absolutely no tactical sense whatsoever. I cannot believe that elite seals could make such stupid tactical decisions. It has to be Hollywood's attempted dramatization for effect - which essentially ruins the movie for anyone with half a brain. Equally nonsensical was the seal 4 man recon team's ability to absorb fire. Seriously, how many 7.62mm rounds can one unarmored human take without bleeding out or at least going into shock if not plain old dying (and where the hell was their armor)? Multiple RPG blasts at 1-2 feet away without so much as ringing ears, much less brain hemorrhaging? Oh and lets not forget that gravity + rocks = bouncy castle injuries.If you want to see a proper combat movie, go for Black Hawk Down (Eric Bana is 1000x better in that). If you want to see marky mark as a baddass soldier then watch Shooter. Don't watch this unless you're bored and it's free... and you're drunk... or naturally kinda dumb already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have a problem with this movie, then watch the Youtube vids of Marcus about this movie. This intent was accuracy as the events unfolded. The language was meant to be very accurate. If you have any issues, it is all in direction.Did they really fall down the mountain like they did? Yes, they did fall, but the "movie" might have made it look too Hollywood...well, it's a movie not a documentary, but they did fall down that many times. The injuries were accurate after the fall and how they died. Marcus was not on the hill when his Seal brother made the life saving call, but the gunshot wounds reveal how many times he was shot and it is not hard to deduce this scene. The call was verbally accurate.Wahlberg was decent, but average actor...he is more a personality. The real acting came from Ben Foster and the others. Foster was excellent! Eric Bana strong support. My main issue with Wahlberg was his acting chops when he was to act "emotional" when caught. He does injury and pain well, but not so much when he need to be vulnerable. This is why he was so good in Shooter...did not have to display as much needed talent. Also...his monotone delivery is signature, but flip to any other movie he does (I was watching Planet of the Apes on TV a few seconds and it is the same character or Wahlberg being Wahlberg)...he needs to hit the classes and take it to the next level or just be satisfied until we all get tired of the repeat. Advice: look at what Matthew McConaughey has done past two years...do that! The end of the movie was most touching. These were the real men that gave their lives...they did not skimp here...they played it out and it made it impossible to leave theater...I teared up and it "sealed" how real this movie was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to live in Albuquerque and never realized how much Sandia mountain looks like Afghanistan. I loved the cameos of Marcus Luttrell in several of the early shots. The look on his face says it all "Let's do this right folks". The stunt men earned their pay on this one. Accurate portrayal of how the team messes with each other during down time. Would like to have seen some of the practical jokes they are so famous for but realize it's hard to get so much into a 2 hour film. What these guys do in real life as far as decision making is literally life and death. Unlike politics where a bad decision not only has no consequences to the decision makers they are usually covered up or denied. I was happy to see that unlike most productions out of Hollywood this one had no political spin in either direction, left or right. How the liberal critics can compare this to Saving Private Ryan is beyond me. SPR was pure fiction with a huge liberal spin done by a huge liberal cast. Lone Survivor is the real deal just like the men that it honors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best true story movie that I have seen. Lone Survivor is one of the most gripping and compelling movie I have seen in years. I have never been in a sold out theater that was so quiet because people were getting so involved with the action. I knew and had met Marcus Luttrell in 2008. I knew him as a remarkable man but to see what he had to go through 3 yrs prior to our meeting was to say the least heartbreaking and eye opening. To walk through hell and lose those close to you and still come out on the other side with such a positive outlook on life is amazing to me. I think every American needs to see this movie to get an idea of what we ask of these soldiers. We take for granted the lives lost and/or changed forever just so we can enjoy our freedoms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Operation Red Wings is a botched attempt at trying to capture/kill the Taliban leader. After letting a group of goat herders go free, the four men on the mission find themselves between a rock and dozens upon dozens of Taliban. Lone Survivor right off the bat tells you one thing if you are not familiar with the story. Only one of these men survive. I'm putting my money on Marky Mark. Peter Berg, who helmed the disastrous Battleship, somewhat redeems himself here with a realistic take on a poorly planned Navy Seals operation. Berg uses restraint in some much needed areas, which builds tension. Little to know music, dead silence is used to escalate the fear and it works to great effect. Then he goes an kind of ruins it with some melodramatic music cues at other areas, but for the most part, this is an excellently directed film. I point to the sequence in which the characters literally throw themselves off a cliff in order to get away from the gunfire. The stunt coordination for them tumbling down the cliff side is some of the most brutal things put to film. How many times have you seem people jump off a cliff side and tumble down the side in a nice choreographed sequence that has them "hurting" a bit once they hit the ground. These guys are thrown around, break bones, cut skin, bleed, cough blood and worse. Watching them being thrown like rag dolls heightens the realism that was needed in Lone Survivor. The film begins and ends with real footage of the men in the Navy Seals. Berg's nod to patriotism for the film. The dramatic parts are too concerned telling the story of these four fellas fight for survival to be bothered with the American flag waving propaganda. The film is small, intimate and personal. All four men give great performances. They all have genuine chemistry with each other, which is what is needed for you to root for their survival. You'd think because they're American and the enemy is the Taliban that it would be automatic, but you'd be surprised. Eric Bana has a small role, anyone could have honestly played that part. The film takes its time to build up to the action sequences, once it hits that note, it never lets up. These men are in the fight for their lives, a fight most of them lose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Berg has made one hell of a war film here. The action and acting is excellent, and emotions flow in this film as strong as rapids in rivers. I know for sure that this the most entertaining best quality movie of the year. The movie is absolutely filled to the brim with action, emotion, and better than decent acting. The story follows four soldiers chosen to eliminate the target of a dangerous Taliban said to kill 20 marines each week. And when they encounter a small group of goat herders they are pressed with a decision to either let them go, tie the. Up and leave them, or eliminate the compromise. From there the rest is epic and history.If this film doesn't get at least a nomination at the Oscars it will be one hell of a shame. The film is more than worthy of a nomination or two. In my mind this is a must see and is actually worthy of multiple viewings. Forget and ignore any hate given and enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, One That Feels Real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one had so much coming against it. It had probably one of the least interesting trailer of the year. In addition, to vastly overrated films had soured the anticipation of seeing anything with a related topic. "Lone Survivor" is apparently defying expectations, and it earns every little bit of praise, as it is a movie that combines action, suspense, drama, some very moving moments, and takes you to the brink of emotional highs. Everyone in the cast is amazing, but Mark Whalberg, just like Tom Hanks is able to connect both with both his co-stars, the camera, and us.The film follows a group of soldiers who are stranded in the middle of a mission, in very hostile territory. Watching as each of them falls is heartbreaking, with some breathtaking camera work and stunts, we see, hear, and feel every bullet zoom by, every burst of fire, and every bone shatter. Yet, it is not at all a matter of technical wizardry because nothing would work if the camera just rolled and gave some of what has previously been noted as "realism". This one gets close enough to see physical and emotional wounds, doesn't shy away from the pain, frustration, fear, and horrors of war. We "feel" each loss, feel the loss of humanity, the madness that takes over and destroys us.At our screening, we had an audience of men, women, and children who were glued to the screen, forgot their movie treats, the anxiety caused by a movie that promises but bores. At the end, some stood and applauded because we finally got true account that touched us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Riveting. Our Navy Seals are BADASS."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw Lone Survivor tonight at Regal Cinemas staring Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell and Taylor Kitsch as the late USS Michael Murphy. Great movie! It just goes to show you the sacrifice many American people have made for/to the United States to preserve our way of life, including myself! Secondly, the film depicts the importance of radio communications and air-support from the The U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, United States Air Force, and we can't forget The U.S. Navy in the Theater of Combat Operations! The movie has strategic moments but it mostly features very intense/violent scenes including a beheading and several gun fights with the Taliban in Afghanistan and traumatic injuries to members of United States Navy Seal Team 10 who took part in Operation Red Wings (June-July 2005). Crazy movie, but as Justin Timberlake tweeted via Twitter: "Go see #LoneSurvivor now... Riveting. Our Navy Seals are BADASS." Indeed! I give it a cinema score of 9/10! MUST SEE! http://www.lonesurvivorfilm.com/site #maverickradio?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book Lone Survivor 2 years ago in 2012. I'd like to say that the movie is 85% accurate compared to the book. 10% of the movie did not show things that Marcus had done during the time when he was crawling to the village, and the book is obviously more descriptive than the movie, but that is the same for all movies based on books. I think that the movie is 5% dramatized, but it is a Hollywood movie. it is definitely a must see movie. I am 13 years old and in 7th grade and this movie was perfectly fine for me as gore is concerned. I'd recommend any one over the age of 10 to see it. There are some morbid scenes in it, but they are trying to make it as realistic as possible. GO WATCH IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring story turned into another forgettable Wahlberg action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is spot on. I have read Luttrell's heartwrenching book of the same title and had the privilege of seeing him speak while at school, and he and his teammates deserved better than this film. Wahlberg, as usual, is distractingly bad. He doesn't even attempt Luttrell's thick southern accent, or ever convince you for a moment he's his character rather than Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg makes bad action movies, and he's good at that. Peter Berg also makes bad action movies. This mix is NOT what this true story deserved. The film never really reels you in, provides no character or plot build up or even makes it really believable, which should have been easy since this was a true story. The actual events were overly dramatized (think all four SEALs jumping off a cliff in slow motion with an explosion behind them. Yes, this happened. Or Foster saying in a sudden lull in fighting, "you can die for your country, I'm going to live for mine" and then of course blows away a bad guy. Bad. Action. Movie. If anyone has read Luttrell's book or even watched an interview where he recounts what happened, one will immediately see the movie did an embarrassing job of staying true to his story, though Berg claimed throughout production this was their priority. The film doesn't even show the most incredible part of the story, Luttrell crawling 7 miles through the Afghan mountains with 7 gunshot wounds and paralyzed below the waist before being found near death by his Afghan protectors. How is this portrayed in the movie? Wahlberg falls down a hill into a pond directly below the fighting and the villagers happen to be standing there, 20 feet from a raging gunfight. Luttrell did actually pull out a grenade to threaten these villagers, having lost his rifle, and refusing to be captured alive by the Taliban. However, leave it to Berg and Wahlberg to make this horrifying and courageous last resort appear as an absolute joke. This true story of sacrifice and amazing bravery deserved more than being another forgettable Wahlberg action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly, the real life characters that this movie is based upon are real hero's. My only issue with these sort of Invincible Warrior genres are the theatrics of the hero's absorbing multiple gun wounds while the antagonists get felled with one shot. Similarly, the tumbling over cliff sequences belie the reality of what this would actually do to your spines/necks and internal organs, let alone the ability to continue the fight. Also, the idea of 100's of antagonists vs the probable reality of some accounts suggesting that maybe there were 8-10 antagonists, takes away from the invincibility idea. As a propaganda tool with recruiting benefits, these sort of films are no doubt successful, but the reality of what flesh can take is borne out by the sad consequence that many brave men actually died from operation Red Wings. At least the film didn't whitewash this fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe this guy made Battleship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the Weidman vs. Silva fight I saw a short interview with Peter Berg and the real life hero, Marcus Lutrell promoting the film and was curious if Battleship boy found a big shovel or not to get him out of that deep pit he put himself in. (I realize there were complications and Peter wanted to make this film first but the fans don't know these things, just the end results.)To begin, Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg and any other folks with a berg in their name involved in this film should be very proud of this result. I'm not a Wahlberg lover or hater but have seen most of his work and this stands apart from the rest by far. All actors are amazing and there's not enough space to give proper kudos, but extra points to Taylor Kitsch after bad beats with Carter and that ship mentioned and who continues to show great acting chops after Savages. This kid's going places ma.It is clear from the start that there is realism and presence and insight provided not only from our true surviving hero Lutrell, who was to say the least, intensely involved with the making of the film and proclaimed what a great job Walhberg did of transforming himself into him, but from many other actual soldiers who faced the fire and were extras as well.It was upsetting to see so many reviews focusing only on and condemning how unrealistic the battle scenes are. I've personally broken my back in two places on a fall which was an absolute minor fraction of the seemingly endless cringe-worthy falls these guys took but at the end of the day if they didn't absorb falls and bullets a bit more than normal this film would have lasted 45 minutes tops. (I would've cut things a bit more but it's Hollywood folks, suck it up.)As a proud American who would usually just say go and nuke em and start over, it was also a huge breath of fresh air and reality check to see portrayed actual kind and decent Afghani folk who did in fact risk their own lives unnecessarily for an American life, tradition or not. Even if it looks like it was filmed in great camping locations in the Midwest, the acting was first rate by all and compensated for these minor errors which will only be picked up by a small margin of viewers.All in all this is an excellent piece of work which I'm still shocked was done by the same guy that did Battleship. It's as if he sat down with Kathryn Bigelow and took serious notes, but nodded out here and there on occasion or lost some of his notes on the way to the edit room.Now here's a humble critic's short list for how this film could have been edited to perfection and why it lost only three stars:1. No matter if the book title is the same or not, this is one of those rare situations where it is not only unnecessary to keep the same name, but an absolute necessity to change it. I kept asking myself the whole film, "I wonder how this guy's gonna get it?". Please explain where any value comes from giving away the fact everyone dies but Marky? (I simply don't get the reason for giving away the whole story when most of the viewers haven't heard of the book or the Red Wings mission.)2. The cute clean-cut blond kid recruit with the perfectly moussed hair - no way. This guy would be doing everything in his power to emulate his mentors who all looked like they just rolled out of bed after camping for a month without any hygienic supplies whatsoever. It's not anywhere near as bad as casting Rihanna, but if you're going to leave popcorn alien and go heavy serious it matters and counts. (Even if he wasn't yet allowed at his rank to go full grunge he wouldn't have gone GQ.)3. There's one short line where Bana barks out an order and it is in his pure Australian accent. (Sorry Eric, you're a hero.) It's short and maybe hard for most to catch, but clear. That's a quick fix. Someone should have caught it.4. Even as a person with no military experience I continually kept questioning the setups and tactical locations they chose out in the open. That, coupled with the seemingly bionic ability to take pain like Wolverine and keep going is where we left reality entirely.5. I hate it when a director like the one hit wonder Shamylamylan guy or Berg feels the need to put themselves in their films even if it is for a couple seconds. If you absolutely must do this how about we make it non-speaking roles in the future? It doesn't matter if you like him, you're not Hitchcock and fat boy likely rolls in his grave a bit over this. (Because it's such a short arrogance shot no actual stars were taken away, just annoyance points earned and reality points taken away.)Cut out those minor infractions, in one fan's opinion, it'd be perfect. Great job.Side note to Michael Bay:As you can see, it is possible to make both complete popcorn nonsense and serious gut-wrenching drama. I am aware you two do know each other so I ask that maybe you call and take a tip from your pal Pete and leave your ego at the door for once and let someone else do the writing, casting and all other major input and who knows, maybe someday at the Oscars they'll at least point the camera where you're sitting?

		<shortDescription>Not a movie for the squeamish...but a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie, and all I can say is, "Wow." This movie has a gritty authenticity that makes it great, and at times almost unbearable to watch. The movie begins with BUD/S candidate training. You get a feel for the grueling training/qualification/preparation that is designed, as the movie says, to show the candidates that their mind can make their body do more than they ever thought it was capable of...this training is put to good use by the men in the field.Watching the SEAL team pay a price for a responsible and kind-hearted act was very difficult. By doing the "right" thing, they knowingly put their own lives in jeopardy. An extremely graphic "Saving Private Ryan" type of realism fire-fight shows the toughness and superior warrior skills of the SEALS, as they fight against overwhelming odds. It's hard to watch, yet at the same time, shows just how physically and mentally tough a SEAL warrior is...it's amazing.I'm trying really hard not to write a book here, or give any spoilers. However, I think everyone should see this movie to understand what our men in uniform go through in battle. Since virtually all SEAL missions are classified, we never get to hear about the heroic actions of men like these that result in saving lives for their brother soldiers, as well as innocent civilians.The movie brought a tear to my eye, and made me reflect on the sacrifice so many have made for this country. I don't agree with any need for the USA to be in the Afghan or Iraq wars, but I do respect those who serve so unselfishly. This movie made me reflect on their ultimate sacrifices--most of which we don't hear about.Go see this movie. I hope it serves as a catalyst to bring our brave soldiers home once and for all.</fullReview>

I had my hopes up for Act of Valor but that turned out to be a badly acted and less than average movie. You know what I'm talking about if you're a big war movie fan; Saving private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Tears of Sun, We Were Soldiers, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Bravo Two Zero, Rescue Dawn and Enemy at the Gates. These are Great War movies, you care about the characters, there is some realism and they are highly entertaining. So how does Lone Survivor compare? It is more than deserving of a place alongside these movies! The heart pumping, adrenaline filled tension never let's up and you feel every bullet and grenade like you're really there. Obviously certain parts were dramatised but so what? It's a movie deal with it. I see that reviews on IMDb so far are very mixed. A lot of the people complaining are saying that it is too unrealistic and that the team couldn't have been shot that many times. Well the director visited the parents of the dead members of the team and the father of Dietz revealed from the autopsy report that his son was in fact shot 11 times. So there may be some embellishment but the facts it is based on are all sadly true. This is a truly great war movie, I hope it gets the acknowledgment it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely does a movie that I want to see completely blow me away in how much I like it, this is one of those rare occasions. Most people won't agree with me but this is probably now my most favorite war action movie. It might not have all the character development, but honestly that's really the only thing that people could complain about and I don't think it hurt the movie at all.The opening of the film are shots from real US Navy Seals in vigorous and brutal training. But this is important as you watch the movie because what the 4 Seals go through and the way they continuously get back up, it shows that the training is for a reason.From the trailer you know the story, the 4 Seals have a predicament, they can either kill the 3 civilians to keep cover or let them go and hike it back up this very large mountain where at the top has no cover and very rocky terrain. They know the consequences for each choice and in the end, let them go. It's a great scene as the 4 of them realize how hard of a decision this is.After this is when the action picks up for about the next 45 minutes or so. They become surrounded by the taliban, and as soon as the first shot is fired, all hell breaks loose. It might be the most intense gun fight I've ever seen and definitely one of the best I've ever seen. It felt real, like we were there with them. They don't come away unscathed like the rest of Hollywood movies where the heroes constantly are able to dodge these bullets. They are severely outnumbered but put up the best fight anyone could imagine.I don't know how accurate this is, but quite frankly I don't care. If what was shown on screen was even remotely close to what really happened, hats off to the 4 Seals because what they go through seems unbearable. The pain of several gun shots, falling down a mountain with hard rocks waiting for them at the bottom, while constantly under fire is insane. The fact that they did as much as they did makes me proud to be an American because these guys were true heroes.There is also great chemistry between the four main actors and even in the most intense scenes, a few lines make you laugh to lighten the mood a little bit. But on for a few seconds and its back to reality. This may only be the second week of January, but this will without a doubt be on my top ten list of 2014. I loved this movie and suggest everyone go and watch it. 10 out of 10 with no hesitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is great about this movie: the casting and character development is well balanced and engaging, the interlacing of actual military footage is perfect and priceless, the plot and pace will keep you on the edge of your seat and engaged -- and the action sequences are riveting, engaging and compelling. You will not be bored watching this movie and you will probably find it disturbing in a good way -- i.e., thought provoking. It is very gritty (a plus in my book for this type of film). This movie is not perfect, but I gave it a 10 because based on a comparison to the competition it is definitely a top 5% flick. What's not so good (spoiler alert): The sophomoric hillside debate about what to do with captured Taliban soldiers/sympathizers seems unrealistic and ludicrous. If that decision wasn't made ahead of time someone needs to rewrite the mission briefings. The combat sequences drag out because apparently is takes at least 10 hits to kill a Navy Seal with 7.62 (AK) ammo while Taliban fighters drop dead like a sack of potatoes with one or two hits of 5.56 NATO. I think there is a better way of portraying the heroism of the characters than having each one shot again and again with no significant toll until all and each has about 5 bullet wounds - but that's Hollywood. The cast was great and I like Mark Wahlberg but this was not an Oscar performance for him. I am afraid like many Hollywood regulars he has done so many movies this seems like another day at the office for him (I'd rate his performance a B+) - however, the rest of the cast is great, keep the fresh faces coming! A must see for all viewers who like politically relevant/action flicks unless you really just want totally mindless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing story of a brutal SEAL mission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been fascinated by the Navy SEAL's, and the amount of training which they are required to complete in order to achieve the rank of NAVY SEAL. I feel that the movie did a very good job of highlighting the amount of persistence, strength, and skill required for these men to become the elite.After reading the book "Lone Survivor", I was captivated by the story, and level heroism portrayed by our elite servicemen during Operation Red Wings. The movie remains close to the written accounts of Marcus Luttrell, and is a realistic, and brutal recount of the ongoing war against the Taliban. The movie is violent, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Although i would not recommend this for the squeamish, it is a must see. It really makes you appreciate the selflessness and sacrifice the men and women of our Armed Forces go through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that will make you cry, male or female alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely find time to review the movies I watch. But after watching "Lone Survivor", I just had to make time to share with you guys the amazing story that this movie delivers. From the beginning of the movie, we start sharing the lifestyle and conflicts of the Seals by getting a glimpse of the intense, hardcore training they had to endure. Craftily acted, and carefully choreographed, the characters of Marcus Luttrell and his three companions leave a deep impact on the audience's heart. Even before the Operation goes wrong, we can't help but feel pathos for the characters we know are going to die in the next hour. Now, the addition of "Peeta" as the new Petty Officer, was kind of funny, even though his mohawk and clean-shaved face greatly contradicted the rough, realistic look of the other actors.Mark Wahlberg was just amazing as Marcus, maybe because his name is so similar. But truth being said, he had dedicated a lot of time to pace himself as a Seal, and it clearly shows in the movements and his behavior in the movie. Now the action scenes were just epic, with bloody gore, and PG-rated violence, this is a must watch for teenagers and adults alike. And even if you are not a big fan of violence, the emotional roller-coaster that every character goes through will be enough to keep you locked onto your seat. Now that 1 star this movie lost was because of its sometimes ridiculous portrayal of the hard and tough Seals. I aspire to be in the military, and I have seen enough reality shows on Navy Seals to tell you that their training is so brutal, that civilians will flinch just by looking at them doing it. Who can do a 1000 push ups and sit ups in one day, and also run 6 kilometers, swim a few kilometers, and constantly get screamed in the face? You guessed it- A Navy Seal. This proves that they have been trained to take a lot of pain and suffering and survive even in the harshest of conditions. That being said, there are only a few people in the world who could get shot more than 10 times, and still have the ability to shoot back, armor or not, seal or not. Now of course, this was necessary to provide the popcorn flick that Hollywood audiences expect. And it delivered thoroughly. For those complaining about the two scenes where they roll off the cliffs, they are not actual "cliffs", just slopes with rocks. And even after that, it is not as if they jumped off those 100 meter slopes and walked away unharmed. Every single one of them had cuts and bruises as a result. 3 out of 4 of them broke or twisted their legs. So anyone who doesn't consider that realistic is either a retard, or just drunk. Finally, the heroic acts of the team is just mind-boggling, and emotional. If your eyes at least doesn't get moist at any part of this movie, there is something wrong with you. Is it worth the watch? I will bet you 10 dollars it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You kind of know where "Lone Survivor" is headed once you hear the title. You also work out the identity of the title survivor once you realize that Mark Wahlberg plays the Navy SEAL who eventually wrote the book on which the film is based. With that pedigree, no one would blame you if you approached the movie with a measure of skepticism. Yet, "Lone Survivor" is better than you might think. It's not perfect, but it is a perfectly mounted recreation of the tragic events of Operation Red Wings, a mission that took place in Afghanistan in June of 2005 and claimed the lives of 19 American soldiers. What the movie lacks in personality, it makes up for in the scenes of cold reality of soldiers under fire.The movie opens with real-life footage of navy recruits being put through their brutal Navy SEAL training, at times seemingly brought to the brink of death. The training seems to be designed to prepare these men for any kind of condition. The irony is that the rest of the film shows soldiers under conditions that, in reality, no one could have been prepare for. We meet the men of SEAL Team 10, led by Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg) being briefed on Operation Red Wings, under orders to capture or kill Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. The mission seemed simple enough. Drop in, kill the bad guy and fly out. Yet, something happened that put a kink in the plan, and soon the soldiers found themselves fighting for their lives.Most of the movie deals with the firefight, and how a handful of soldiers found themselves not only under attack by Taliban soldiers but grossly outnumbered. Trapped on a dangerous rocky mountain slope, they find that they often cannot see their attackers who are using the trees for cover. What makes these scenes work is their orientation. We know where the Americans are, but very often we don't know the location of the enemy. That's writer-director Peter Berg's technical achievement. He allows us to know the placement of the characters to draw the suspense. He doesn't just hammer us with confusing quick-cuts to create the confusion, he allows us to map their location in our minds. Berg also doesn't pull back from the brutality of war. Soldiers are hit, bullets pass through their bodies, bones crunch and we feel their pain.The movie is short on character development, yet that doesn't become a problem. We meet the four principle players. Besides Luttrell, we also meet Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Deitz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). They don't have much development as characters, so Berg depends on our familiarity with these actors to draw our emotional interest, and it pays off. We care about these guys, and the melancholy of the fact that most never came home makes the story all the more dramatic.Up until now, Peter Berg couldn't exactly be called a world-class director. His list of credits are over-loaded with junk like "Very Bad Things", "Battleship" and The Rock adventure "The Rundown". Here, he shows a sure-hand as a director. His action scenes work because they've been thought out. He takes a tragic true story and doesn't disgrace it with a lot of phony camera tricks or needless subplots. He knows the story he wants to tell and he tells it very well. This is a lean, spare film that gives us just enough information to care about what is happening. It is far from perfect but what it does, it does very well.*** (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor is a an accurate portrayal of a true story about a mission that goes horribly wrong in northern Afghanistan. The attention to detail by the director from the mission down to the footwear of the SEALs is spot on, adding an even greater sense of realism to this gripping story. The fire fight, which basically consumes all of the 2nd act, had me on the edge of my seat, gripping my arm rests, and gave me a feeling of being right there in the battle. No jerking cameras and no cheesy first-person shooter video game shots. You really feel the isolation and desperation felt by the SEALs and even though I knew how the fight would end (from the book) I still felt myself holding out hope. What this movie captures better than any I've seen, is the "fog of war" and that soldiers (using this term universally here) are human and can make mistakes. This mission is doomed by inaccurate pre-mission intelligence, bad communications due to the terrain, and the untimely appearance of local national civilians. These small break downs have the potential to ruin even the most well-planned operation and, while years of training prepare our nation's soldiers to handle these "fog" moments as best they can, sometimes the difference between success and failure, living and dying, comes down to luck. The raid to kill UBL in Zero Dark Thirty was a great success. But if that helo had crashed in a different part of the compound or at a different angle, there could have been deaths or men trapped in the wreckage, and the mission would have taken a completely different turn. Lone Survivor shows us what can happen when things go wrong and men are left fighting for their survival. I can't rave enough about the authenticity of this movie. I've spent time in the mountains of northern Afghanistan and the terrain is spot on (the country is not just a big desert) and I've experienced communication "black holes" out there where satellite communication just doesn't work and you can't figure out why. Lone Survivor is not political nor is it propaganda. It simple tells a story of survival and shows that war is an ugly thing. Hopefully people will remember this movie and take pause whenever they hear on the news about service men and women being killed in action in a land halfway around the world. Luttrell's survival allows him to pay proper tribute to those who lost their lives on that mountain and not just have them be another statistic in the war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purposeful pro- Amero-Israel propaganda and nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening credits this looks like a total glamorization of the USA military industrial complex. The triumphant music plays as shots of marines/special forces training flow by, then finishes with a "Silent Night" Christian song being sung by the troops. Cinematography is excellent. Following are shots of a USA army base in the middle east somewhere with family photos on the wall of Americans accompanied by relaxing Midwest guitar twangs. Glamorization? Yes methinks. Total propaganda. Join the Army son! All the opening marine characters are Gentile white man, one of whom has an Asian wife, whom he speaks in ebonics to on a overseas computer chat. What follows is a beheading scene by the Taliban. OK, now we are sure of it...thank you Hollywood. USA = good guys, everyone else = bad guys. We get it! Basically, if you're looking for a political commentary, or perhaps an intelligent, well-sided look into the current state of American foreign affairs, don't watch this movie.This is nothing more than a glamorization of how the Gentile is sent out to fight the wars for its Israeli puppetmasters. Once the viewer concludes this, they can then take their thinking caps off and simply gloss over the amazing cinematography and action sequences (of which there are many).Action starts fairly soon and doesn't stop until the end of the movie, very good action scenes, good fighting, and scenery. Some of the violence is very gruesome. Headshots lost limbs etc.Climactic all-American one-liner: "You can die for your country, I'm going to live for mine!", proceeded by a flurry of Rambo-esque gunfire.All in all a decent action movie. Unfortunately it is purposeful pro- Amero-Israel propaganda and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not the target audience for this film. I found it really hard to pay attention to. I get how its supposed to be this big production of the story about the guys involved in this mission. I just question the fact that this story is entertaining enough to make into a film.The movie takes a while to get entertaining. The whole beginning I had a hard time paying attention. When they show the guys talking about their personal lives I thought that was kind of boring. Mostly because I couldn't really tell the difference between the guys because they all had the same hair and beard. As a female non-military person I didn't really understand the military terms they used to explain the mission in the first place. I literally had no clue what was going on (obviously I could figure out the basics). It was boring until the last half hour.However, it seemed like a very accurate portrayal of how the actual mission occurred. The special effects/shooting scenes were done well. (but when the whole movie is guys shooting at each other it gets pretty boring unless you like that stuff.) You could really sympathize with the US guys as they kept getting hurt and shot at. I can't even imagine what that would feel like. It was informative about the mission and all involved. That is all it really is.Regardless: THANK YOU TO ALL WHO SERVE AND RISK THEIR LIVES LIKE THOSE IN THIS MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Lone Survivor" tells the story of four Seal Team 10 members who were ordered into mountainous Kunar Province in order to kill or capture Ahmad Shahd, a warlord associated with both Gulbadin Hekmatyar and the Taliban. The movie is based on HM-1 Marcus Lutrell's (the mission's lone survivor) New York Times 2007 bestseller.Faced with a difficult moral decision whether or not to kill four Afghan civilians who were sure to reveal their presence to the Taliban, the Seals are cut off from rescue as they are surrounded by a much larger force of combat-experienced Taliban. As they attempt to fight their way to safety, together, each Seal is forced to tap unknown reserves of strength and resilience as they fight until three of the four are killed.But they never quit. Running so low on ammunition they were forced to strip the body of each Seal killed so the dwindling group of survivors could keep fighting, those chair-bound reviewers who are critiquing "Lone Survivor" for dialog, special effects, or patriotism miss the point of the movie - the Seals fought as a team and they never quit.And that's the point of the movie, which will soon be recognized as one of the Great American War Movies. Similar to 'With the Marines at Tarawa,''Saving Private Ryan', Black Hawk Down', and "We Were Soldiers;' 'Lone Survivor' memorializes the ethics, dedication, and voluntary sacrifice of those Marines - Sailors - Soldiers - Airmen who stand guard overseas for you. Yes, you chair-bound reviewers; they stand guard for you.</fullReview>

America hater or not, I think you will Enjoy this film as much as I did for the performances, and the action, but the Direction, and realism are beyond anything that has come before so you will most likely come away from this changed even if just a little. I was cringing more watching this than some of the most insane moments in a Jackass movie, then moments later impressed that these guys were back on there feet, and moving at all. The folks who compare stuff will be comparing this moving with others for years to come, as this is going to be a benchmark to shot at for a while at least.

		<shortDescription>Fan of Both the Book &amp; Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to see an advanced screening of Lone Survivor this evening in Chicago. I read the book awhile back, but much of it was still stuck in my head as it's not the type of novel you forget easy. I'll avoid any major spoilers, though I would imagine many people are rather familiar with the story at this point. I will make some comparisons between the book and the film, so for those who want to go 100% blind into the film, please stop reading.To start I'm a fan of Peter Berg, Battleship wasn't as terrible as it could have been. I think The Kingdom is a very underrated film and Berg has a niche for doing military action movies while telling a good story. Similar to The Kingdom, Berg uses a familiar score to the film, which I really enjoyed. All of the actors in the film do an incredible job in the movie with Taylor Kitch and Ben Foster being the standout performances. Berg does a great job condensing the first part of the book, being the Navy Seal training segment that Luttrell speaks about in great detail. The film condenses this entire segment into the films intro that aptly summarizes some of the hardships and intensity that is required to even become a Seal. This is done through using what appears to be actual stock footage of Seal Training camps and regiments.After the Seal Training segment, we are introduced to the four main characters and the brought right into Operation Red Wings. We also get a few cameos of the director, Peter Berg and Marcus Luttrell himself. This portion of the movie may seem "slow" to some people, but one has to take into consideration that this is an abbreviated version of a True Story so it's not going to be non-stop action throughout the film. One our team of Seals are dropped into the Hindu Kush, the film does a fine job of depicting the "hunt" and strategy of their mission. One of the segments I remember most from the book is Marcus and his ghostwriter describing the patience of a sniper and the importance of positioning and background. The film achieves this in a very subtle and effective way.It isn't long until the team encounters the goat herders and the negotiations amongst the team take place. I was particularly interested in this piece as this was the most controversial part of the book. This segment of the film also does a great job of depicting Marcus' opinion of the American media as illustrated in the negation with his team regarding the fate of the goat herders.It isn't long before the firefight occurs and this is really where the movie shines while equally became very difficult to watch. As in the book, you can't help but to feel a wide range of emotions during this segment. Sadness, frustration, anger, patriotism are some that come right off the cuff. Berg nails the courage, bravery and epic endurance the four Seals must have went through in those mountains. There are some tough scenes here folks, there were claps, gasps and sniffles in the packed theater.The closing segment of the film is the largest divergence between the book in the film. You can tell this was done in the interest of time and the changes didn't bother me much as I understand that Berg didn't want to run the film on after such a grueling emotional roller coaster. The manage to sneak a couple of small details into the film that were in the book which I liked, specifically the bottle and the old man. Those parts also stuck with me from the book.The closing of the film was probably the hardest to watch and if you don't feel anything then you're probably a Taliban yourself. I won't say what Berg does specifically as you should experience it for yourselves. I will say that people were crying all over the theater though. I hope everyone has a chance to check the film out. My biggest fear when movies like this are made is that people will want to go out, grab a gun and want to shoot up some Taliban. Whatever your political affiliation is, it should bother you that American troops are dying and question what they are exactly dying for. One last point that the film does a great job of slipping in twice. It is mentioned in the film about having a lack of equipment, which is also mentioned several times in Bowden's Black Hawk Down. With the massive scale of the Defense budget, I do not understand how this is even possible. Anyway, hope the review encourages you to see the film and let me know what y'all think when you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Survivor: well used formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War movies are a staple of the cinematic art. The ones made during a war are usually quite different from the ones made after the same war.When I was a kid I had a broad array of war movies to watch, mostly about World War 2, with the ones made during mostly patriotic efforts to rev up the folks at home and the ones made after mostly dramatic offerings of regrets along with a group of massive, star studded epics that were rah rah rah.And, those were for movies about a war we clearly won, fought during a very simple time when communication was often delayed and filtered and content as we knew it was subject to the mores of society almost always.So, here we are in the age of total communication, no filter necessary, during a war we are probably about to just walk away from without a discernible 'win'. In addition, if current polling is accurate, a war the public is not only fatigued with but anxious to end.Yet, Lone Survivor is being called the best thing since Saving Private Ryan. Apparently, there still is a filter when it comes to warm films made during a war. And, there clearly is humor in some marketing for this film.To present his story, in the above-mentioned atmosphere, Mr. Berg has chosen to go the formulaic route used by many other directors during World War 2. In the setup we get to know a bit about the characters before they go to battle, then during the battle have that point of reference as they suffer their fates, and at the end all the schmaltz one expects when the formula is in use.But like I said, this is a movie about a war we are still fighting. You only need to look at the avalanche of horrible reviews for 'the Green Zone' a few years ago to see the hazards of not adhering to the formula. I believe that Mr. Greengrass made a much better war movie in his effort, but by straying from the cheerleader formula that Mr. Berg uses here he got trampled under the feet of the inertia that goes along with adherence to formula.Yet, I consider the Green Zone a pretty great movie and Lone Survivor only a good movie. Be careful when you run up against some other person's idea of patriotism, religion or culinary arts.It's too bad that Mr. Berg didn't use a truly great movie for a point of reference. Imagine if he had used the formula in Tay Garnett's 'Bataan'. Or, maybe Zoltan Korda's 'Sahara'.I have no doubt that soon after this war is over we will see movies that do a better job of expressing the despair and pointlessness of Afghanistan, but not now and not from Mr. Berg.</fullReview>

Filmmaker Peter Berg's top-heavy adaptation of Marcus Luttrell's book about his involvement with a doomed mission as a SEAL Team 10 op in Afghanistan to locate a Taliban leader focuses on the quartet of soldiers (all players equally determined and stoic) sent on the patrol that goes disastrously wrong incredibly fast. More "Black Hawk Down" than "Saving Private Ryan" the film's merits are in the impossible odds while the band of brothers attempt to save one another with limited resources. The visceral violence is further impacted upon by ace make-up work from veterans Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger.</fullReview>

Training to become a SEAL who are the elite soldiers of the U.S. States Military is rough and very selective via testing past ones endurance's and beyond and it is an honor to be one and a necessity to have these boys ripe and ready to go and do what needs to be done. This film makes that point. Be ready to strap yourself in after the first few minutes because you are going to experience some tension a good thing I might add because the price of the ticket just made sense. Your being entertained and moved in a quality way. Enjoy this. Highly recommend some finger foods, tasty drink and go to the bathroom prior.

		<fullReview>Movies should entertain, enlighten, or inspire. "Lone Survivor" does all three in measured doses. Special Forces (including Delta, Green Beret, UDT, LRRP et.al.) soldiers form a bond far stronger than even marriage-check. UDT Training is SO intense, many recruits actually have to be revived from near death-check. Special Ops must follow ROE, and not kill unless in imminent danger- check. Not ALL Afghans are bad-check. When surrounded, Navy Seals kill a lot of enemies-check. Not much new there. Gut-wrenching suspense- check. Lots of big explosions, check, check, CHECK! Entertaining-yes! That the actors and director wanted this movie SO MUCH many took a pay cut to do so explains why it was made in the first place, when there have been so many similar films with more compelling story lines in recent years. I liked it, but I liked Back Hawn Down, and Zero Dark Thirty far more. Lone Survivor entertains at an 8, enlightens at a 5, and inspires at a level that depends solely upon your individual patriotism. Wrap yourself in Old Glory and give it a 10, if you like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luttrell's miraculous survival and rescue could have been infinitely more thrilling had it not been spoiled from the start by the movie's title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story behind the failed military mission Operation Red Wings is undeniably intriguing in both the decisions made by the soldiers and the resulting tale of perseverance. With the actual Navy SEAL involved acting as consultant on the film adaptation, "Lone Survivor," offers a level of intensity and gritty realism not generally seen in Hollywood. For all its authenticity, however, several of the storytelling techniques hinder the pacing and the impact, from tension-diffusing flash-forwards to oddly juxtaposed expositional segments. Even the epilogue dismisses relevant information in favor of candid photographs. Once the moral dilemmas segue into chaotic firefights, "Lone Survivor" barrels towards its thrilling conclusion with a rip-roaring amalgamation of spirit, resilience, and violence.Tasked with reconnaissance and surveillance to confirm the location of terrorist Ahmad Shah, four Navy SEALs fly into Afghanistan for Operation Red Wings. After quickly locating their target in a remote village, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Matt Axelson (Ben Foster), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and team leader Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) find themselves unable to report in due to faulty communications equipment. When a group of goat herders happen upon the scouts, Murphy decides to let them go, resulting in Shah's men ambushing the soldiers. Cornered, outnumbered, and outgunned, the four SEALs must make a last ditch attempt to reach higher ground and call for air support.Undeniably tense, gripping, graphic, grim, and nerve-wracking, "Lone Survivor" is an authentically portrayed, realistically realized vision of the Afghanistan War with a hellishly close point of view, made even more dizzying through sniper scope cameras, slow motion, deafening sound effects, and sequences of unnerving silence. At times it rivals the intensity of "Saving Private Ryan" and "Black Hawk Down." But it's also infuriating as it depicts a situation that seems plagued with unpreparedness and egregious errors. Despite all of the training and discipline, the catalyst for the catastrophic gunplay is uncertainty in the face of warfare.Moral dilemmas, while usually a thought-provoking or controversial topic, lead to the one decision that shouldn't have been selected. In the context of the film, three choices are presented; there were at least 3-4 other options that were never explored or genuinely considered and the ultimate release of the prisoners resulted directly in the deaths of a considerable amount of soldiers. Conflicted opinions on the value of human life and acceptable sacrifices merge with insufficient communications gear and a substantive lack of numbers. Apparently the rules of engagement were not made perfectly clear to the reconnaissance team (despite training for nearly every other death-defying scenario).It's based on a true story, but it's certainly not common knowledge. Luttrell's miraculous survival and rescue, alongside indescribably formidable comrades, could have been infinitely more thrilling had it not been spoiled from the start by the movie's title. Not only is his outcome already spelled out for audiences, but the editing, which starts at the end for a few minutes before plastering "3 Days Earlier" on the screen, is entirely unnecessary and repetitive. Luttrell narrates the opening and closing shots, further betraying his end result, while his fellow SEALs' conclusions are given away as well. A couple of surprises make their way into the script, but the name "Lone Survivor" says far too much.Similarly, while the ethical code of Pashtunwali is briefly explained via coda, nothing is said of Shah's eventual death or the disruption of Anti-Coalition Militia activities. There is also no mention of Operation Whalers, which essentially picked up where Red Wings failed. Nonetheless, the sustained scenes of unrelenting combat are riveting and eye-opening, building up anticipation as complications slowly arise ? before all hell breaks loose and a shocking tragedy is brutally visualized.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>#1 reason NOT to waste $$$ on "Lone Survivor" theater ticket (+8 reasons it should NEVER have been made)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary: I convey 8 reasons why this movie should never have been made, and highlight the #1 reason why you shouldn't waste your money seeing "Lone Survivor" in the theater:Reason +1: It's Not Worth the Price of AdmissionQuite simply, having been based on a factually dubious "memoir" that has more in common with fiction than any genuine biography, "Lone Survivor" movie fails to deliver significant value in exchange for the cost of admission. This film should be avoided until it's available on DVD for a fraction of the cost.Eight reasons why "Lone Survivor" should not have been made into a movie, based on violence dot com:Reason 1: Luttrell got his facts wrong.Marcus Luttrell exaggerated the importance of his target Ahmad Shah, totally misunderstood why the US went to Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, and even over-estimated the number of fighters in the ambush. How can you take seriously a movie based on a fictionalized war memoir after reading mistakes like these?Reason 2: The backlash could be gigantic.Remember the backlash from Soldiers against the Hurt Locker? Lone Survivor will get a full blown tidal wave, and from more than just the mil-bloggers. Liberals will think it is too ideological, and Soldiers will think it is too over-the-top. Based on what some people wrote in our comment threads, even SEALs laugh at Luttrell. Reason 3: Lone Survivor is too political.The character of Luttrell is nauseatingly partisan &amp; political, when war stories (in print or celluloid) shouldn't be political, they should be honest. "Black Hawk Down" worked because it ignored politics. It told the story of Army Rangers in an awful situation, but it told it forthrightly. Lone Survivor doesn't come close to this level of honesty, and unfortunately this movie mirrors the SAME DISHONESTY that characterized Luttrell's horrible book.Reason 4: There were better stories.The battle of VPB Wanat. The attack at COP Keating. Operation ROCK Avalanche. The Pat Tillman Ambush/Incident. Peter Berg could have told countless stories w/ more honesty and importance than Lone Survivor, without the political rants or exaggeration.Reason 5: Lone Survivor will get soldiers killed if they follow its implicit advice.Simply put, Luttrell doesn't get counterinsurgency. If Soldiers followed Luttrell's advice, they would either get themselves or innocent civilians killed in Afghanistan (or anywhere, really)Reason 6: Luttrell needlessly vilifies Muslims and Afghans.Luttrell (the "author" and the character) labels all Muslims--Shia, Sunni, Persians, Afghans, and Middle-Easterners--as hate-filled terrorists. This is ignorance at its best. First, not even 1% of Muslims are terrorists, and two, terrorists can be from Africa, Japan, Pakistan, or even America (think Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber or Eric Robert Rudolph). Only lust for money could lead a director or a studio to validate and promote Luttrell's hate- filled propaganda.Reason 7: "Lone Survivor" the Movie corrupts and impedes political discourse - you won't "learn" anything from it (Except how to die)You can't call liberals evil, hold them responsible for the death of your friends, like Luttrell terrible book, and then have a courteous political discourse. Afghanistan shouldn't be a Democratic issue or Republican issue, it should be an American issue. Letting partisan politics get in the way of serious security issues is disgusting (but apparently the American way).Reason 8: It will ruin the history of Afghanistan for years.Many Vietnam veterans don't like Vietnam war movies because the twisted reality they promote is often how most Americans who see them remember Vietnam. Many active service members hated "The Hurt Locker" because it misrepresented the experience of War in Iraq. Lone Survivor movie does the exact same for Afghanistan. And Hollywood makes the same mistake again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is so hard to describe this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK...*Deep Breath*...I just saw Lone Survivor. This movie is one of the most influential films of my lifetime. After watching this incredibly heart ripping, realistic War film based on a true story I was light headed, and literally wanted to kiss the American soil. Thank you Mark Walhberg for this treasure and the entire cast and crew. Watch this movie. The scenes of warfare will be forever ingrained in my head. I don't want to shake them either. People are fighting for our freedom and I do not want to forget about it. (The trailer in my opinion should be re done the current ones make me not very interested in seeing it, and I want everyone to see this movie.) Mark, Ben and Emile were amazing!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a special screening of the movie Lone Survivor last Thursday. I was really looking forward to seeing this as the trailer really caught my eye and I had some high hopes with Peter Berg directing and an awesome cast to go along with it. After taking a few days to think about it and get the right words together and are some of the things I liked and didn't like about the film.Check out the review here - http://wp.me/p2MUTr-vv 1. Peter Berg - Peter Berg wrote and directed this movie based off a true story of "Operation Red Wings". Berg is an unbelievable director and his work on FNL hasn't been matched. Berg brought his A game to this film and from start to finish he paints an amazing picture of this brotherhood that is known as our military.The movie starts off with some great banter amongst the soldiers and just goes off from there.He made it believable, these soldiers were shot and broken down by calling down flights of mountains but still fought with the big picture in mind. The detailing of the gun battle is some of the best you will ever see in a movie.In one scene he built you up and all hope was found for the two soldiers that were left and bam, Berg took it away and made you realize that it's not as easy as a chopper coming to save the day. It was a gut-wrenching scene that left you on the edge of your seat.He made you understand the battles of not only what the soldiers go through but what Afganhistan and the Taliban have done as well.2. The Action - The 40+ minute gun battle was just perfect. It also painted this picture of how inexperienced the younger Taliban soldiers were and not being accurate with their shots and showed the soldiers plucking them off with accuracy and precision.I also enjoyed how the soldiers fought. They got shot but still kept fighting, took the hits and kept reeling. You don't always get that with movies and how chilling it is that this being a true story hits even harder knowing that there are man and woman going through this on a daily basis.Berg never let it get to personable, you knew only bits and pieces about each character and he let the acting and action do the talking throughout the film.Berg belongs in the Best screenplay/Best director/Best picture for what he brought to the table in this film.3. Mark Wahlberg - He was unbelievable in this film. Easily one of his best acting jobs he has done in any film. He was smart, funny, witty and when it came time to get down he did. Just the way he clicked with the other guys and how he portrayed such an important and pivotal role in this film was amazing. I would have no problem with him being nominated for Best Actor for this.4. The Supporting Cast - The rest of this cast was out of this world. It was nice to see Berg use Tyler Klitsch (FNL fame) who has been in a bit of a rut as of late (Battleship, John Carter). Berg brought out the best in him in this film. He has great chemistry with Wahlberg/Foster/Hirsch.I won't lie I didn't know much about Ben Foster prior to this film but I will be looking up some previous films and checking them out. He played a true bad ass. He took the biggest beating of the four and the way it came off was awesome. Just the way he handled how his character took the gun shots and still kept fighting for his life and fighting for his fellow soldiers was great.Emile Hirsch I have seen play in multiple films in the past (boy he's come a long way from when he was in "Girl Next Door"). He was the 4th and final piece of this awesome casting.5. The Score - Berg reunited with Explosion in the sky who he used a bunch in Friday Night Lights. EITS were amazing in this and the score for this film was brilliantly put together.6. The Credits - After a little over hour and half gut wrenching film, they did an amazing montage of the actual soldiers that were involved "Operation Red Wings". You just watched a movie surrounding the story of what happened and how these guys fought for their lifes and seeing the photos of them with their families was surreal.The Verdict 5 out of 5 stars Just a chilling and mind blowing look into what happened "Operation Red Wings". The acting from the entire cast (Wahlberg Oscar Worthy performance included) combined with Berg's writing and directing makes this one of the best films of 2013 and quite possibly one of the best films I have ever seen.Check out the review here: http://wp.me/p2MUTr-vv Lone Survivor hits theaters limited on December 25th and worldwide January 10th, 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" LONE SURVIVOR " Beyond 4 THUMBS UP with DIAMONDS for every Brave Soldier that chooses to PROTECT OUR FREEDOM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" A true story of four Navy SEALS sent on an ill fated mission in 2005 to capture or kill a notorious Taliban leader. Viewer discretion is advised as you will face life and death on the battlefield that our soldiers accept every day. The first 10 minutes shows actual Navy Seal training going beyond the limits of any human endurance that prepares each soldier to accept pain and continue under any circumstance never accepting defeat. The last 10 minutes is and honorary tribute with pictures of the actual people involved in Operation Red Wings. Marcus Luttrell was the only member of his team to survive.Everyone should see this picture once to understand the realities of war and to honor our brave service men and women that put their life on the line and protect our freedom in this country every day ". Russell &amp; Cissy Starring Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster. R &amp; C Warnings - strong bloody war violence and pervasive language(139) mostly the 'fancy' word..Rated R RESTRICTED Not recommended for children under 18 Universal Studios - Release Date: January 10, 2014</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad screenplay, bad directing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all, the screenplay was not well crafted and written, there were scenes after scenes obviously were added up to compile together to make a hollow combat record longer than it should be. the directing was so poor that made this film look like a patching work. there are lot of viewers, especially males, who just like to gobble up anything related to 'special forces', 'rangers', and 'navy seals' military movies but never watched them with 'reasonable doubts'. here is a movie that cheated us with fake terrain of afghanistan, the terrains showed us in this movie are absolute American, new Mexico or some location in the rocky mountains, part of the budget was spent on building some look-alike mud square buildings, houses imitated what should be look like in afghanistan, it's just horrible to watch a film so carelessly chose the locations to fool the viewers. the screenplay also suffered a fatal arrangement to put scenes on the enemy, those ragged headed actors looked so modern and phony. the whole sequence of the operation was pretty laughable and amateurish. if the real military operations in afghanistan were like this pathetic arrangement, no wonder we American ground forces in that country would have suffered such a big loss of soldiers and crippled so many young men without any probable cause. this is a horrible military film written by amateur(s), directed by amateurs, wasted by a bunch of actors who just tried very hard to wear cool sunglasses, un-shaved faces with beard, special forces costumes and weapons, but none of them, including the sole survivor, looked as the real deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent movie. It literally changed my life, made me realize some things. But for whoever says it's authentic, you have no idea what your talking about. There are several parts that differ from Marcus Luttrell's account of what happened. He wrote the book, and Hollywood changed several parts so please don't say it is brutally authentic, it was changed for entertainment purposes. Please see this movie, if there are any people that truly don't like this, get the hell out of America please. Please attend Marcus's patriot tour, NEVER forget Danny, Mikey, or Axe Hooyah Marcus and your fallen brothers, as well as the brothers downrange.</fullReview>
