		<shortDescription>A joy of a movie for people of all ages and one of the best remakes ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aah, where to begin. I was five years old when the original came out and it was the first ever film I saw on the big screen. For that experience alone I'll treasure the "old" 'Pete's Dragon' forever.Now to the "new" film. I'm not normally into family movies, but because I hold such a deep love for the original, I just couldn't resist to go to a pre-screening of this remake. If they didn't honor the original, at the very least I could voice my opinion afterwards on the internet. I needn't have worried. This new 'Pete's Dragon' is about as far away from a cheap cash grab as it could be. Unlike the original, the new film starts on a somber note (think the beginning of The Jungle Book, Tarzan or Bambi) in that a little boy is orphaned by an accident and left alone in the woods. But just like the best fairy tales, I feel a good story often needs some darker themes: for without those, the joyous moments wouldn't feel as intense and rewarding. And this is very true here, for what follows is a tale of friendship, adventure, magic and wonder like I hadn't seen since those wonderful Spielberg films in the eighties.The story is sentimental - but never cheesy - and that is one of its greatest strengths: it dares to have a heart but it's not the kind of over-sugary tripe we so often get from big studios. The film's biggest asset, though, is easily Elliot. I had feared (because I had seen a trailer) that Elliot would be a cringe-worthy CGI creature of the worst kind, but the trailers really did the special effects wizards a bad service: the dragon design is perhaps the most beautiful (and I'm not ashamed to say it: cute) I've ever seen.It blends perfectly with the natural surroundings (gorgeous New Zealand forests) and while this particular dragon has more traits of a playful, over-sized dog than of a dinosaur, it looks so realistic you believe you can touch and feel Elliot's fur (the 3-d works great for this film), and his face is so expressive you forget you're watching a CGI character.All in all, this really is a film I can whole heartedly recommend to people of all ages, but if you have kids, watch it as soon as possible, you won't regret it. It's a throwback to a different era when Disney made the best quality family films (which were so good they are still immensely popular today), utterly devoid of the now so common cynicism and full of heart, joy and wonder. 9 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Ignites A Flame That Hasn't Burned in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney originally purchased the unpublished short story in 1957. Pete is separated from his family for a brief moment and he finds himself in the dark and eerie forest alone and petrified he stumbles upon a creature that even his wildest imagination wouldn't dare to conjure, As his chest starts pounding and his adrenaline levels spike, he finds himself facing imminent death or so he thinks, until he realizes the creature is friendly and he forges a bond with the beast. Also, if anyone has any doubts about the visual effects, They can rest easy, As I was blown away by the visual feast, I might not have been stunned if I had actually done my research on who was behind the the camera rendering away, because if I had know Karl Chisholm was a part of this feature film, I wouldn't have been skeptical before going in, As Chisholm is best know for his work in the LOTR trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would you like cheese with you dragon sir?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I know this film is aimed at the younger audience but does it really have to be so cheesy and clichéd? From the get go I realized that it was going to be only for the younger audience and us older folk would just have to grin and bear it. There were numerous times throughout where I felt the hairs stand up on back of my neck and my cringe meter when full throttle. I.e Pete howling like a wolf and when some non important character states "Let's go catch a dragon" I'd like to say the kids will enjoy it but there were two sitting in front of me that were clearly getting bored after 45mins. Average film with average acting</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you are a fan of the original Walt Disney's Pete's dragon 1977 you will most likely be very disappointed.the story is a complete change, well i say story there isn't much of a story in this film i don't want to give anything away but the only thing that is the same in the re-make is that there is a boy called Pete and he has a friend who is a dragon called Elliot.I've actually thought that i might not watch any of the new live action remakes that Disney are going to release but i'm worried that they will be completely changed just as this one wasi wouldn't recommend this movie to anyoneVERY DISAPPOINTED :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: A traumatizing experience for a kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have small children - don't take them to this movie! I took my nephew last night to Pete's dragon. How on God's green earth is it remotely acceptable for a movie for children to start with the following scene: a 5 years old boy and his parents, in a car, going on an "adventure", and suddenly, a deer shows up in the middle of the road, the father sees it too late, pulls off the road, the car crashes, landing up side down, then the kid is all alone, crying, petrified, next to the car with his dead parents inside, then he runs, gets surrounded by wolves who chase him, in the middle of a deep dark forest, and eventually the dragon shows up to the rescue! The car crash scene and the wolves chase is disturbing for an adult, let alone for a 5 year old! The movie had a huge impact on my nephew, who woke up in the middle of the night shouting uncontrollably and could not stop for 5 minutes! It's the first time he gets such a reaction, when he was able to speak, he started to mumble random stuff about cars crashing, parents dying!!! How did you guys ever thought such images and such a message would be OK for a kid to see? I hope that you will get sued and pay in full for such a stupid idea! So please don't take a kid to this movie! As an adult, the story is boring and pathetic. If it wouldn't have been for my nephew traumatizing experience, I would rate it a 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a very sentimental movie, which would make you cry all long. Should it be like this or the creators of this remake tried to cover something with it? It's a fairly cheap trick to cover up no so great story, which goes closer to nonsense. The movie is too dark and twisted for my taste. The creators of this remake pressed too much on our emotions about the family, the friends, etc. There are so many strange moments starting with the absolute absence of a character of any kind of Jack. I think that the manly role should be more pronounced. The main woman role - Grace - is too sensitive and always on edge of crying, which makes it only miserable to see. The only role, which was a strong and decisive enough to create a connection with the reality, was the girl Natalie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pete's Big Green Dog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I worry about taking pot shots at a movie like Pete's Dragon. No one wants a twentysomething's jaded take on a kid's movie. I am aware I am not the target audience. The ticket vendor's surprise at my selection was no surprise to me. What can I say? The other option was an anthropomorphic hot dog. I took the chance because a children's film can be a light fantasy. Disney has taught everyone that "fun for the whole family" is not a death sentence. So when I criticize Pete's Dragon, understand I am not assailing aspects of the genre, e.g. the simplistic plot. That's not the movie's goal nor should it be my point. Pete's Dragon fails because it is utterly devoid of wonder.True, wonder is a pretty squishy concept. Fortunately for me, my sense of wonder need not go on trial. That's because of my official co-reviewer, the kid who sat immediately next to me in the otherwise empty theater. He looked about the same age as Pete, our protagonist. I regret not asking. Regardless, I understand why this story could be appealing to my new colleague. Pete is tragically separated from his parents, but is rescued by a forest dwelling dragon. Pete names his new friend Elliot and together they spend their days playing in the woods and sleeping in a tree/cave/house. It is an idyllic existence, but it is ruined by the interference of other humans. Pete is threatened by greedy loggers and, the Nazis of family movies, child protective services. However, our hero finds some allies in ranger Grace (Howard) and her storytelling father (Redford). The entire movie scored two responses from my associate. First, a chuckle when Elliot gets a dosing of soot from a chimney. Second, a genuine chortle when an EMT dropped a stretcher. That part was my favorite too. Almost Two hours, two laughs. I refuse to believe this is the best Disney can offer. Admittedly, my second did applaud at the close, but this reaction was not half as enthusiastic as when his dad bought him a Slurpee.Now hopefully I can take over explain what went wrong. First, the titular dragon. It is a dog. Elliot the big green dog. Elliot chases his tale. Elliot sneezes on people. Elliot is a dog. Whyyyyyyyyyyy? This is one of the most pathetic attempts at satisfying the boundless imaginations of children I have ever seen. Even the flying shots are derivative, all rendered in CG that just screams "I was meant to be seen in 3D." Well I'm cheap. All the other characters were equally tedious. Any idiosyncrasy or characteristic would have been appreciated. You can learn all there is to know about these personalities in 15 seconds. For the remainder of the movie, they will never surprise you, or charm you, or do anything worthy or remembrance. Part of the reason I attended Pete's Dragon was to gather data on the condition of Redford's career. I dread saying this, but this another performance suggesting he is washed up. Then again, in the role, Redford might never have stood a chance. Watching him mug like he was witnessing the second coming because a dragon turned a lighter shade of green was embarrassing. Another sad waste of talent was the cinematographer. The forest itself was the most magnetic character in the film. The natural beauty set a tone, only to be beaten down by the ham-fisted elements. So yes, I guess there was some wonder. Not enough to be redeemable. Pete's Dragon is a soulless morality tale on the importance of the nuclear family. Its grand aspiration was being inoffensive enough so you could bring your children. Disney can do better and we should watch better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New but Certainly not Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are a really hard market to sell to, especially if the remake in question is of a film that's not very old in the first place. Yes, I admit, the original was long, and full of songs, but it's a film that is still fresh in the minds of any Disney film loving person, ages 25 to 50.Why remake this film in the first place? Was it purely for money? It's not like they're rejuvenating an animated film into live action here! That's what made the new Cinderella and Jungle Book so fun (however, Disney had done those in live action before too, but the quality wasn't there).Who can forget the original, it had some great moments, and pretty good stars. This version has Robert Redford (is he trying to make a comeback?). Redford's performance is lackluster, I wasn't impressed. More thought and planning could've put this version up there with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years most enjoyable films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where fellow recent family films such as Steven Spielberg's misguided and glaringly obvious The BFG haven't, Ain't Them Bodies Saints director David Lowery has hit the jackpot with his big budgeted Pete's Dragon, a reimagining of the little known Disney film of the same name from all the way back in 1977 that in many ways feels like the type of film Spielberg himself would've made during his peak period in the 1980's through to the 1990's.Instilled with a sense of wonder, heart and joy that can be enjoyed by those of any age, this Pete's Dragon is the year's most fully formed piece of family storytelling that will go down as one of the Summer's biggest successes when Box Office receipts are removed from the equation entirely.Likely to become a new kids favourite once it hits the home video market, Lowery's film is about as polished as films of this ilk get, with the filmmaker showcasing the visual flair he produced in the quiet constrains of Ain't Them Bodies Saints and everything else about the production continues on Disney's exemplary run of recent films in this space (other than The BFG), that have seen the House of the Mouse record all new levels of financial and critical successes.Lowery had the clear benefit of a standout cast willing to join him for the reimagining of the sweet and often moving tale, about the orphaned Pete and his friendship with dragon Elliot that is threatened by the intervention of humankind (the film carries a never intrusive message of conservation and finding oneself in the world), with newcomer Oakes Fegley hugely impressive as the Mowgli like Pete and backed up by the ever likable Bryce Dallas Howard, the having-a-blast Karl Urban (playing the films version of a villain) and the nice support from the likes of Robert Redford, Wes Bentley and fellow child success Oona Laurence.It's not hard to see that these recognisable actors enjoyed bringing the fantastical story of Peter and Elliot (himself a fine feat of CGI wizardry that will have children wishing they too had a dragon guardian) to life and with their commitment to the project evident from the word go. Pete's Dragon becomes more than just a mere piece of family entertainment but a wholesome film that will bring everything from smiles to possible tears as the journey takes it various turns and pivots.For lack of a better word, Pete's Dragon is a lovely family film and a must see big screen experience that feels a cut above the usual offerings in the marketplace thanks largely to a considered telling of a marvellous little story filled with fine performances and brave directional choices from Lowery (the film's confronting opening few minutes testament to this), and as it stands Pete's Dragon's is one of the year's best offerings regardless of genre and a breath of fresh air in a hugely disappointing Summer of tentpole films.4 ? sneezes out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure how you can make a story about a dragon boring, but they did with this movie. From the soundtrack to the cinematography, to the acting and storyline, I've honestly seen better movies on Lifetime. My kids fell asleep about halfway through it and I suffered through the predictable storyline and cringe worthy "feel good" moments. A Disney movie about a dragon should inspire the imagination, excite us, surprise us, and touch our hearts. This movie fell short in all areas. The last ten minutes of the movie are worth seeing but the lead up to those moments takes far too long. A concentration on better humor to break the nonstop sentimental expression would have gone a long way with this movie. I love fantasy and adventure movies and hopes to share a great evening with the kids. Unfortunately we fell asleep at an overpriced B rated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartwarming family film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete's Dragon is a remake of the 1977 Disney animated film of the same name. It tells the story of a boy named, Pete(Oakes Fegley). Pete lives in the woods with his best friend, Elliot. What is really interesting is, Elliot is a green, massive &amp; furry dragon. Pete's Dragon is an amazing film. Director David Lowery has masterfully retold the story of a boy &amp; his loyal companion. I haven't watched Pete's Dragon(1977). I am positive this movie is better though. The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is wonderful. The forests in the movie, look breathtaking. The visual effects are flawless. Elliot looks magnificent. It is really refreshing to see, a dragon being portrayed as a friendly beast. Elliot is the most adorable dragon to have ever appeared on the big screen. Elliot's green &amp; furry exterior, just makes you want to run up to him &amp; give him a tight hug. The 3D is awesome. Performance-wise everyone does a good job but, Oakes Fegley steals the show. Oakes Fegley is outstanding as Pete. Fegley is one of the young actors to watch out for, in the coming years. Bryce Dallas Howard is spectacular as Grace. Robert Redford is brilliant as Meacham. Oona Lawrence is excellent as Natalie. Wes Bentley is great as Jack. Karl Urban is good as Gavin. Isiah Whitlock Jr. is impressive as Sheriff Gene Dentler. Levi Alexander is adorable as Young Pete. Pete's Dragon is a must watch, with your entire family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Fell In Love with This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't give 10/10 stars to very many movies--but I saw "Pete's Dragon" tonight, and it completely won me over. I grew up in the 80's, and as such I remember seeing bits and pieces of the original "Pete's Dragon" on TV as a kid--but to my knowledge I never watched it all the way through, and if I did I've completely forgotten the plot of the original movie. All I remember is a green cartoon dragon on screen alongside real actors.That being the case, I went into this remake a bit blind and not knowing what to expect. I found myself pleasantly surprised by how much the film appealed to me. I do take in family and kid- friendly movies now and again, despite my not having kids of my own, and having seen several films in this genre in recent months ("The Jungle Book"; "The Legend of Tarzan"; etc), I found "Pete's Dragon" to have a charm that few such movies have exhibited this summer. The tale was intriguing, the acting above average, and the overall production quality top notch.I think the thing that really sold me on this movie, though, was Elliot the Dragon. What a fantastic bit of special effects! He totally won me over and made me care about him as a character, as did Pete and others. Robert Redford, Karl Urban, and Bryce Dallas Howard all offer good performances in their respective roles as well, and in the end it just comes together in a way that makes for a great family friendly movie.Again, I don't do this often, but I have to go with 10/10 stars for this one. It may not have been the best movie I've ever seen, but there was just so little not to like about this movie--overall I find it to be superb. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Inventions of a Disney film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lowery who has an impressive catalogue of shorts and a couple of main features under his belt takes on a reboot of the '77 Disney live animation hybrid of the same name, however Lowery likes to put it out as a reinvention as oppose to a remake. The core story is there but with some changes, making Pete a lost child instead of the original orphan on the run. It's actually a welcomed change making the back story more relatable. Pete, played by an awesome Oakes Fegley becomes lost in the forest after a tragic accident and is quite literally taken under the wing of a green, furry dragon that he names Elliot that's more doglike than dragon with a face of Seth Rogan. Elliot the dragon reminded me a little of Gorbash from Flight of Dragons and Falkor, the Luck Dragon from the NeverEnding Story, however Elliot lacks speech making him a more fun dragon playing both pet and guardian to Peter; similar to the relationship Bumblebee and Sam share in Transformers. Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard goes from fighting dinosaurs to chasing dragon tales, one of which is spun by her father, played by Robert Redford. Great to see Oona Lawrence (Southpaw) again who also befriends Pete whilst he tries to come to terms with the human way of life. Karl Urban does good as the wannabe town hero wanting to catch Elliot and make his fame and fortune which creates conflict by also being Bryce's brother-in-law. The CGI is spot on as expected from a Disney movie and Lowery does a great job of capturing the emotion and keeping a good pace. There's a constant tension throughout the film until the very end which is both pleasing and heart-warming. Daniel Hart does an impressive score also being his first Disney film after a list of smaller movies, he's certainly one to keep an ear out for. Overall the film is of typical Disney calibre and makes you want to believe, being dreamy and enchanting. Its shares that same emotional value from Bigfoot and the Hendersons, it's touching and heartfelt, probably inspiring children to want giant, green furry dragons in their back gardens. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 7 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for great storytelling and a great reinvention. 75% 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great kids' film weighed down by cheesiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. It is the perfect movie to inspire a sense of imagination in children and doesn't really talk down to them even if it is full of clichés.Unfortunately, however, this film just didn't do much for me personally. As I mentioned, the story is predictable and full of clichés, though I do appreciate many of the updates from the original. The original very much felt like a product of its time while this one feels very timeless. The acting from Bryce Dallas Howard and the little girl is atrocious, though most of the other actors manage to keep it to a reasonable level of cheesiness. The one stand out for me was the little boy, who did an incredible job interacting with the CGI dragon. The animation on Elliot was amazing. You truly believe this is a living, breathing character, and the acting from the little boy just heightens this even more. Every time Elliot was on screen I enjoyed the movie a little more, but the human parts just weighed the whole thing down for me.Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, because it's not. The people who worked on this clearly put all of their effort in. Even the actors, who are totally hamming it up, obviously care about the movie and weren't phoning it in.I normally love Disney films, but this one hit too many clichés for me. If you have children I would recommend it, but otherwise wait until it is available to rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring and bland tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty underwhelmed after watching the movie. Disney needs to rethink what live action movies they are making. The jungle book was renown and popular and almost everyone knew about the same and it was a good retelling of the story nothing spectacular but enjoyable. Pete's dragon at least for me was a film that I had no prior knowledge about and after seeing the film the content of the original story seems to be pretty bland. This is a film purely for kids below 10 years. The dragon is very well animated but the acting by the child actors is average at the best. the "villain" is shoehorned just for the sake of it. The content just was not riveting enough and it is a boring and bland 2 hour movie with some moments which will draw out an emotional response and those are very few and far between. If you have kids go watch it with them they would surely enjoy it. The theater I went had majority of the audience in the 6-10 year group and there were enough giggles and awes to know that they were enjoying the movie. Only recommended for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Script and Average CG Work Doesn't Help a Furry Dragon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what is clearly the year of films about man meeting nature/animals (The Jungle Book, Legend of Tarzan, Pete's Dragon), Pete's Dragon doesn't manage to bring anything new to the sub-genre. But there's still some magical moments to be had with the latest Disney adventure.Helmed by Ain't Them Bodies Saints director, David Lowery, Pete's Dragon tells the story of an orphan boy, Pete, who finds a home in the forest outside a small town, with a mysterious dragon. Of course, natural comparisons can be made to Dreamwork's 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. But Pete's Dragon, although live-action, feels a bit more childish and dumbed down. With that said, I don't think aiming this film towards a children-heavy audience is necessarily a bad thing, it's just disappointing. It's a cute story, but I don't think it has the mass appeal that the previously mentioned films do.The cast is well-rounded with talent including Bryce Dallas Howard, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, the great Robert Redford, and relative newcomers Oona Lawrence and Oakes Fegley. Howard and Redford shine as likable characters who help Pete along his way, but them along with the rest of the cast, are stuck in some weak dialogue. However, no actor was more out of place than Urban. Great in most things, he's far too over the top in his clichéd antagonistic role. Whether it was Lowery directing him into frustrating clichés or his doing, it wasn't good.Luckily, there still is the power of Disney behind this project. It definitely takes a bit for the story to get where it wants to be, but I finally did come around to the magical tale. If nothing else, I bought into the dynamic between Pete and his (furry?) dragon, Elliot. The emotional undertone to the adventure is about discovery and looking further than what meets the eye, and you certainly get that. But the problem is that this story is structured on what feels like mindless dialogue.Another small issue could be that Elliot not only doesn't really look like a dragon, but the CGI is average at best. Dragon's look better on a smaller budgeted TV show, Game of Thrones, than they did on a Disney scale budget on the big screen. Look, Pete's Dragon has its moments of Disney magic, and kids will love it. But it doesn't have a mass appeal nor does it have the best script or execution.+Disney magic+Pete &amp; Elliot's relationship-Dumbed down dialogue-Average CGI-Over-the-top Urban6.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dragon's Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's "Pete's Dragon" is surprisingly poignant. It is a great movie. The amazing Robert Redford as Bryce Dallas Howard's father, Meacham, tells his daughter Grace the unembellished story of his encounter with the mythical Mid-Valley Dragon. He had sensed magic about the green dragon. He says, 'Magic makes you see the world differently.' It made him see Grace differently. The magic of family, in all its possibilities, is a profound theme of Director and Writer David Lowery's "Pete's Dragon". This is more than a kid's movie; it's for everyone. "Pete's Dragon" is a Disney remake. I don't recall much about the original other than the cheesy animated dragon. Lowery and Toby Halbrooks wrote the screenplay based on the screenplay by Malcolm Marmorstein, which was based on story by Seton I. Miller and S.S. Field. A little convoluted. This "Pete's Dragon" resonates with the acceptance of loss and the beauty of unconditional love. In a heart retching scene the literally cornered Pete (awesome Oakes Fegley) is consoled by Grace (Howard). Pete screams, "Woooo!" for his protector Elliot, the Dragon. The astonishing envisioning of Elliot as a hulking furry warm blooded creature with gentle eyes inspires the sublime bond of Pete and Elliot. The brilliant CGI deepens the narrative. Lowery eloquently reveals toward the end that Elliot has an even bigger heart as he embodies the power of letting go. I was in tears. "Pete's Dragon" is all heart. The story begins in the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest (filmed in gorgeous New Zealand) as 5 year-old Pete is riding with his parents. In the seemingly disturbing Disney tradition, Pete's parents are killed in a horrific accident. Pete survives. He is rescued by the giant benevolent dragon. Pete names him Elliot after a character in his favorite book, which he has. Oaks Fegley is innocently captivating as Pete, the long maned child raised in the woods, whose only family is Elliot. He has a fearless spirit fostered by his fierce protector. Elliot has a magical power which allows him to remain a secret?up to a point. Six years have passed. Grace (Howard) is a forest ranger in Mid- Valley. She has a touching relationship with Jack (solid Wes Bentley) and his precocious daughter Natalie (Oona Laurence). Jack and his belligerent brother Gavin (bold and funny Karl Urban) run a lumbering company, which is rapidly depleting the woods near Pete and Elliot's home. Natalie first discovers Pete in woods near the lumber yard. Natalie, who is about his age, seeks him out as a friend. Laurence has a radiant spirit.Eventually, Pete is discovered by the authorities in his attempt to guard Elliot. Howard as Grace brings a gentle power and soulfulness as Pete's new guardian. She is curious like everyone else how Pete was able to survive in the woods for so long. She enrolls her Dad (Redford) into this journey, as Pete's stories of Elliot ring familiar. Redford's easy gravitas speaks to the hero in all of us in "Pete's Dragon". Granted parts of the story are predictable in terms of the conflict and the secret of Elliot. Lowery's touching direction allows everyone to emerge at their best. Karl Urban is masterful in this context. In "Pete's Dragon" the protected transform into the protectors. Heroes inspire new heroes. For Pete and Elliot, their love is unconditional and forever. "Pete's Dragon" is very special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affable/Likable If Ultimately Safe Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So at its best and worst, Pete's Dragon...Disney's latest live action adaptation from their back catalogue of films is an earnest by the numbers family film experience.The general plot of the film focuses upon Oakes Fegley's character Pete who as a five year old child is involved in a car accident with his parents who unfortunately are killed in said accident, scared and alone Pete runs into the forest where he happens upon a large furry green dragon who recognising maybe a similar isolation to himself takes Pete into his care where they spend the next few years together, we then have a 'six years later' cut which takes us to the next stage of the film and from here we hit all the marks, the discovery of Pete by regular society, followed by the misunderstood hunt of the rather friendly dragon by selfish individuals, pretty standard stuff I think it's fair to say.It's capably performed by the likes of the parent figures of Bryce Dallas Howard and Wes Bentley, Karl Urban who becomes the foe/nemesis of Pete and his Dragon, Robert Redford as the wise old sage and newcomer Oakes Fegley playing the titular Pete.When the film employs it special effects or action sequences they are pretty well done. The pacing of the film could certainly be accused of being quite pedestrian and this is a film that only clocks in at around 105 minutes.My main issue with the film is that we've pretty much seen this archetype of a family film many a time before and although like I've stated previously that pretty much all the components are satisfactory...that is all they are, there's not too much to jump up and down about and it doesn't really offer up anything new to genre or the cinematic viewing table in general.So this is hard review really because it reasonably entertained me at the time but for any casual viewer it could be easily forgotten, maybe this is why the film hasn't hit the right notes in terms of it's financial returns? Who's to say...When I've recently seen The BFG as well, a film that is going for exactly the same target demographic yet that film charmed the hell out of me and in part because it was offering us up something slightly different to what we are used to seeing and I still do consider The BFG to have problems but having seen Pete's Dragon I think I now appreciate those positive aspects of The BFG in a much stronger light.So to sum up, Pete's Dragon is an affable &amp; likable family film if too by the numbers &amp; slightly lacking in inspiration at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Pete's Dragon", starring Bryce Dallas Howard-Jurassic World, Terminator Salvation; Robert Redford-Captain America:The Winter Soldier, Indecent Proposal; Oakes Fegley-Person of Interest_tv, This Is Where I Leave You and Karl Urban-The Star Trek movies, Ghost Ship.This is a live action Disney remake-or reboot, actually-of the 1977 animated movie by the same name. Oakes plays the little boy that looses his parents in an accident while traveling through the woods somewhere in the Pacific northwest. Oakes then gets adopted by a dragon that he names Elliot. They become fast friends and live undetected in the woods for 6 years-Elliot is very good at camouflage. Robert plays a man that had seen Elliot years earlier but no one would believe him-they thought he was just getting senile or something. Bryce plays Robert's daughter, who is a forest ranger and Karl is a lumber jack that is always looking to make an extra buck or two-when he sees Elliot, all he sees are dollar signs. This is a nice family movie, that focuses on the importance of family. It's rated "PG" for action, peril and some language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 42 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD or not but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Cinderella, The Jungle Book, and now Disney's new and improved live action adaptation of the 1977 animated film Pete's Dragon. Yes, this is an improvement in not just visuals but story, and characters. But let me get this off my chest. This film is a mixture of several different films rolled into one. It resembles The Jungle Book with its natural environments and wild nature. How to Train Your Dragon with a "boy and his dragon" story. E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial: a boy befriending a animal or otherworldly being. DragonHeart: again with a boy meeting and befriending a dragon. And Eragon: for the same reasons I said before. Yes, the elements aren't at all original, but the reason this film works for me is Elliott himself. They really make him the star of the film. The animation on him is outstanding, they make him so gigantic but are still able to make him move very believably and naturally. His dog-like personality is very appealing, and fits his character traits and did a good job with him overall. Pete is OK, not as involving as Mowgli but he is serviceable. Robert Redford gives his best performance in a long time. And Howard is good as well. Its a film for everyone to enjoy. Not as dark a Jungle Book, but not kiddie either. Now to grade. Characters: A Animation: A+ Music: A- Visual/Special Effects: A Story: B+ Originality: D Overall: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Example of Remake Much Better Than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the Disney properties to adapt/remake for the 21st century, Pete's Dragon is by all accounts a quixotic choice. Those who remember it, I'm sure remember it fondly but anyone who has seen the 1977 version lately wouldn't even rank it in the ballpark of Black Cauldron (1985). Maybe within the same vicinity as the jubilant sentimentalism of The Apple Dumpling Gang (1975) but let's face it, the original is not a classic no matter how many can find it in the dusty recesses of their VHS collections.If summed up, the original film was the story of a truant hillbilly boy whose invisible pet dragon gets him into all kinds of zany mischief. In the remake, the boy is less a loose chain of vaudevillian clichés and an actual character worth investing in. As a five-year-old, Pete (Fegley) finds himself recently orphaned and alone in the middle of a vast rural forest. Alone and afraid, Pete quickly befriends a dragon who stays undiscovered by the nearby town thanks to his cloaking abilities. five years later, Pete wonders near a lumber work site and is discovered by Park Ranger Grace Meacham (Howard). She brings him back to civilization and invites him into her family which includes fiancée Jack (Bentley) and daughter Natalie (Laurence). Despite Meacham's hospitality, Pete still wants to return to the forest to stay with the dragon he dubbed Elliot. Meanwhile Elliot finds Pete missing and searches for him capturing the attention of Jack's overzealous brother Gavin (Urban).Tonally, Pete's Dragon is a much more mature rendering of the original high-concept. Young audiences may well be delighted by the dazzling flight sequences and the precious few attempts at humor. Images of a huge dog-like dragon sneezing huge wads of snot is pretty much the funniest thing you're gonna get out of this movie. In addition, kids will enjoy young Oakes Fegley who brings depth to a character that would otherwise be a young Tarzan routine.Older audience will no doubt appreciate the positive themes of family and bravery not to mention the most spare and concise justification of faith put to the big screen in quite sometime. Most of those themes are drummed up by Robert Redford's wily granddaddy Meacham, who seems to be doing his best impression of Garrison Keillor in all his folksy, folksy charm. The film digs deep and pecks at the neurons hiding your fondest E.T. (1982) memories and almost makes it to the finish line with enough panache to justify its run time.If there's one glaring weak point though it's the central conflict. Gavin and his rag-tag group of lumberjacks head into the forest with no plan and seemingly no serious work their leaving behind. Once they come face-to-face with Elliot for the first time, Gavin focuses most of his attention on convincing Jack of what he saw instead of, I don't know, calling the authorities, probing deeper into Pete's story, bringing a bigger posse next time etc.. Granted it's a little refreshing when Redford calls Gavin out after his second run-in with Elliot, concluding "you really don't have a clue do you?" But the characters lack of motivation apart from "git r done" seems less of a villain story oversight and more of a decision by Disney to not make Big Lumber the bad guy this time around.Elliot's creature design is remarkable given the relatively small scope and occasionally iffy green screen work of the film. He's a cross between the original 2D green goofball and Sully from Monsters, Inc. (2001) only with a snout resembling a dog. It's certainly a different take on the mythical creature and part of me longs for a revival of the Smaug meets Dragonheart (1996) aesthetic but let's not get carried away; this is a Disney movie after all.As a remake, Pete's Dragon blows the old one out of the water and as a kids movie, the film smuggles in some honest and wholesome family- oriented plot devices. Yet as a movie period, Pete's Dragon is a bit too stiff and a bit too light in the conflict department; even if talented actors like Dallas Bryce Howard and Oakes Fegley are working extra-hard to make ends meet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie and I don't rate 10's easily. I was most impressed by the ending, often a problem child for many script writers. This ending wrapped up every loose end neatly and wonderfully! Pete and the Dragon 2016 was an unexpectedly touching and fun movie to watch. The acting was good, the plot took a few unexpected turns, and it was nice to watch a really good film without the violence and action that are taking up 75%+ of movie time in films these days. Robert Redford displayed his usual gentle form of fine acting, but this movie was not my usual favorite type of movie that is based on characterizations. Instead I just enjoyed the fantasy centered around a dragon named Elliot. What fun! Just relax and enjoy!</fullReview>

I grew up on the old original Pete's Dragon and I still like the original Pete's Dragon better because the original version was a musical and comedy mixed together. And the original Pete's Dragon is one of my all time favorite Disney movies. Robert Redford did a really great job in the movie and really so did Bryce Dallas Howard who plays Grace. The director did a great job. The movie had some funny parts. And it is a family movie. Disney made me proud with the remake of Pete's Dragon. At first when I saw the trailer i was not that happy about the remake of Pete's Dragon. But when I saw the remake of Pete's dragon I got more happy and excited to see the new version of Pete's dragon. Go and see watch Pete's Dragon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wanna say that it's been ages since I watched a whimsical fantasy aimed at kids, but we just had Spielberg's BFG out last month. For my money though, and only if I were to compare, this remake of the late 70s musical live action fantasy is the better movie. One of the surprising things for me, going in, was the creature design of the dragon itself, which is quite different from anything that has visualized a dragon so far, be it live action, or animation. And I'm including works like How to train your dragon, Dragon heart and Return of fire. This one looks and feels more like a shaggy dog that one's wants to pet all the time, with grasshopper wings, and mainly, something that won't give your kids nightmares. This whimsical fantasy is backed by excellent technical work, especially in the score department, which is uniquely Southern folk, and I don't think I've heard that many scores that sound as pleading to the ear as this one did, though I'm sure it's also a matter of taste, and will affect those who keep an open mind more than those thing in with mainstream (non) expectations. Even the shot selection, and the pace, is all mostly long take, and languorous, something that I thought 'The BFG' world have had more of. Something that might annoy those who want their movies play like rapid fire advertisements filmed by Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich. The performances are more than competent from this ensemble, with Robert Redford taking a surprising gentle approach in the rendering of his cookie cutter old man with a past character, and making it his own. Bryce Dallas Howard, Wes Bentley and Karl Urban are all good, and support the lead children's characters admirably. Both the lead child actors ('This is where I leave you' Oakes Fegley, and Oona Laurence from 'Southpaw' and this year's 'Bad Moms') are fantastic, making this as much their triumph as it is the casing department's, or director David Lowery's (Ain't them bodies saints). There are quite a few sequences that result in a lump in the throat, and it's all earned. What the movie has in abundance, is heart, with even the so called bad guys displaying theirs, without breaking character or having discerning movie goers working their(character) motivations at the makers' whims and fancies. Few things that stood out: - the conversation about 'imaginary friends' - af few creature expressions, especially when he's surprised/baffled, and a particular sequence of flightA key sequence in the beginning has been filmed in an almost beautiful and poetic way, without deadening or doting the impact it might have on younger minds, that had to be appreciated for, yes, the heart it displays. 1 aspect kinda took me outta the movie though, and this is a very minor nit to pick, because this is ultimately a mainstream flick, but the knowledge of language demonstrated by a character who is supposed to be as grown up as a 3-year old, did not ring true. But it IS a minor nit to pick indeed, since the suspense of disbelief includes believing in the central conceit itself. :-). Also, the ending was a little too pat. The sequences before were taking the movie into territory that was a little too dark (though par for the course), and this kinda course-correction at the end felt like something that could give one Whiplash. Not to be missed, especially with friends and families, on the big screen, preferably on 3D.Trailers &amp; Clips - https://youtu.be/Fm3v2jxxs5Q</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best remake since the jungle book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Petes dragon is a remake off the 1977 musical of the same name and tells the tale of a young boy named Pete who's parents tragically passed away in a car crash leaving Pete an orphan. But luckily Pete meets a dragon named Elliott who has the ability to disappear since his Pete's imaginative dragon friend who rears Pete in the forest. Later we meet a young woman named grace played by Bryce Dallas Howard who stumbles upon Pete and lives with her father played by Robert Redford. Things happen to Pete and grace tries her best alongside a young girl called Natalie who becomes friends with Pete. But will Pete choose the forest over a new family. Overall you guys this film was brilliant. The story has been done before but the effects were outstanding especially on Elliott who was just so adorable. There were a couple of scenes that made me just lose it as it was so heartbreaking even my younger brother teared up at the film. Overall if you love how to train your dragon,the jungle book and Tarzan you will love this film. Also if you seen the 1977 version be prepared as its completely different to that film. 9/10 excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to pick one word to describe "Pete's Dragon", it would be "authentic." Not because the effects are state of the art (which they are), and not because of the fact that the film was shot in real locations and not a sound stage.No, I say "authentic" because it feels real. The characters feel like real characters (thanks in no small part to the talented cast), and the story feels like something that could conceivably happen. There are no mustache-twirling villains and there are no perfect angels who can do no wrong. "Pete's Dragon" is filled with complex, messy people who nonetheless love each other, and it's their flaws that make their bonds so powerful.From beginning to end, watching "Pete's Dragon" feels like watching a real-life adventure play out before your eyes. Director/co-writer David Lowery is not afraid to let the characters talk, feel, or enjoy each other's presence. These slow moments only add to the moments of splendor, and the wonder never stops being fantastic. Don't miss your chance to see this film in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>anybody remember the 1977 Disney film of the same title, we'll this version made me remember it a little, that starred Mickey Rooney. It was a fun campy Disney musical, that is how Disney films where made at the time. After the success of How To Train Your Dragon and Jurassic World, some filmmakers thought it was time for a remake to Pete's Dragon.This is not a shot for shot remake, it is not a musical, and no winking at the audience. It's played very serious, but fun style. The kid playing Pete is actually quite good, he never suffers from annoying child actors thing, he plays it very real, has if someone was stuck in the woods for so many years. The effects of the dragon named Elliot was a perfect CGI creation, although my only argument is that there is no build up to when we see Elliot for the first time, he just kind of shows up. But it is a fun adventure film for the whole family. Bryce Dallas Howard and Robert Redford are great here. So was all the other cast. If your kid loved How To Train Your Dragon, then I hope they will love Pete's Dragon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's latest remake is one of a mostly forgotten live action/animation mix from 1977. I've seen the original, but not in forever and I have only the vaguest memory of it. I don't think there are many similarities besides it being a movie about a boy and his dragon. In the new one, Elliot (the dragon) adopts Pete after his parents die in a car accident (shown vaguely enough that the youngest members of the audience won't quite get it). Several years later, Pete runs into a forest ranger (Bryce Dallas Howard) and a crew of loggers (including Howard's boyfriend, played by Wes Bentley, and his brother, Karl Urban). Howard and Bentley take Pete (Oakes Fegley) out of the forest, prompting Elliot to go searching for him. It's a pretty simple, and, honestly, not too interesting story. What makes it work, though, is a wonderful control of a warm, nostalgic tone by director Lowery (Ain't Them Bodies Saints). He's well aided by cinematographer Bojan Bazelli and composer Daniel Hart (and also some really great folk songs, including a very welcome use of Leonard Cohen's "So Long, Marianne"). I don't think the film's especially memorable, but it's exceedingly pleasant and likable. The film also stars Oona Laurence (who was also quite good in Bad Moms) and Robert Redford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pete (Oakes Fegley) was going on an adventure in the forest with his mother and father when they got in a terrible car accident. Letf alone in the middle of nowhere Pete went into the forest where he encountered Elliot, the dragon. Without any reasons not to accept the kindness the dragon was showing him, Pete decided to go with him, this marked the start of a long friendship. Six years later we find Pete and Elliot living peacefully in the deep of the forest, only to discover that humans are about to reach their home.Without ever having been a fan of the original and actually actively hating the film as a kid, 2016's "Pete's Dragon" proves to be one of the most surprising films of the year, a story with murky potential is turned into a modern fairy tale, full of sensibility and emotion which touched me in a way I was not expecting even if the coating might occasionally be too sugary.David Lowery really shocked me with this feature. I did not know his work previously, but I am sure to go back to it now that I have seen this wonderful vision of his. Whilst there are sporadically moments of too many people hugging and melodrama emerging, Lowery has crafted a picture of small moments and deep emotions, all encapsulated into a film visually breathtaking both in its big moments and, especially, in its more contained ones.The relationship he manages to build between Pete and Elliot through solely visuals is truly touching. Yet, his great sensibility doesn't stop there: he crafts a fantastic visual piece throughout the whole duration. There are great moments made so by very simple, but incredibly effective editing. The visual grammar the film establishes is never broken and combines storytelling a beauty seamlessly, bringing to life a world that I got truly immersed in despite its bare setting.Yet, the great world building doesn't stop here, the filmmakers apply it to everything and the character work is just as brilliant. I have no ideas where Disney finds these child actors, but it seems they are casting one after the other just trying to surpass themselves and every time I find myself saying there will be no way Raffey Cassidy in "Tomorrowland" could ever be beaten. Then Neel Sethi comes in and leaves us all mouth open. Finally, here comes Oakes Fegley playing Pete and standing up if not surpassing his counterparts. We are going to need to start talking about getting underage actors their own Oscar category because as it stands right now they are squeezing the space for the main categories. I mean this is a great performance on its own not even considering he is a child. It's incredible, there are no other ways to say it. You are absolutely convinced of him as a character and his co-star Oona Laurence is just as good as him.The whole cast however has to be taken in to consideration. Karl Urban, Wes Bentely and Robert Redford all make the good writing they are served justice and don't end up feeling like the flat characters they might have been, all having a worthy three dimensional dynamic in place. Bryce Dallas Howard unfortunately, whilst great in her moments, does end up feeling slightly two dimensional and positive of a figure for the film's own good.I keep coming back to Lowery, but his vision is so complete and coherent, he really left me with something to think about. from the way the dragon is used, to the way Pete moves, everything rings so true to the story world. By the way, the effects on Elliot were cutting edge, I mean the weight they managed to convey on the creature was incredible, showing once again that CGI is not a problem, the way it is used is the real challenge and the filmmakers might have just given us an ultimate example on the correct ways to do so.As I said the movie can get a little too pushy with the emotions, but those moments are really overshadowed by the amazing moving moments that ring true and gut wrenching and give the film a depth and a thematic value that I really was not anticipating. "Pete's Dragon" is one the best films of the year, a new beautiful fairy tale of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely different remake that's both thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After surviving a car crash that led to his parents death Pete is found ,after many years, in the middle of the forest. But how has he been able to survive for so long alone?It seems to be that the only thing that this remake of Disney's 1977 musical feature is that a boy called Pete has a dragon called Elliot. So is this completely different remake any good? Yes. It is. And I was surprised. I wasn't sure what to think of the trailers as they didn't show much and I wasn't very sure of the film itself. But as always I went into the cinema with an open mind. And I think even if I went in thinking that it would be bad I would have most likely thought that this was a good film by the end of it. One of the many things that I enjoyed about Pete's Dragon was that at certain points it felt like it was paying s great homage to classic Disney films while seeking like it's own new fresh and original story, despite being a remake. It was also able to be heartbreaking but enjoyable at the same time. Throughout It seemed to remain on a constant high. Yes it does have a couple of moments where the narrative seems to take a small dive and one or two scenes are on the edge of dragging but the film is able to quickly pick itself back up and continue on almost the same note it was on. The dragon isn't the most realistic CGI dragon ever witnessed on screen but for once this fact doesn't get in the way of plot, character design,etc,etc. When it comes to acting Oakes Fegley (in the lead role as Pete) does a brilliant job of spending a lot of time talking to a CGI dragon that gives little but a lot of response. The rest of the cast (which includes Robert Redford, Karl Urban and Bryce Dallas Howard) also give good performances which make the film that bit more better and also show that a lot of care went into making it. All of this comes through in the final product which is both mildly heartwarming and thoroughly entertaining.When it comes to live action Disney have ,from my perspective, more than made up for this years earlier remake of The Jungle Book, or if you enjoyed it then it continues on that same high streak. It's brilliantly entertaining throughout and not only one of this summers best films but possibly ones of the best of this year. **** &lt;-- Four Stars (Out Of Five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 1977 Pete's Dragon is one of my favorite Disney movies from my childhood, and based on Disney's job with the new Jungle Book, I had high hopes for this one.This is an impressive re-imagining, although it's much different than the original. The tone isn't quite as dark, and gone are the themes of alcoholism and abuse. This one is about magic and believing in something without seeing it.Director, David Lowery wanted this film to stand on its own apart from the original. Keeping true to his goal, there are basically zero nods to its source material.It's practically a remake in name only--with the exception of the 2 lead characters, Pete and Elliot. But not to worry, because it still hangs on to the spirit of its predecessor.The film opens up with a young boy, Pete (Oakes Fegley), becoming abandoned in the forest after a car crash kills his parents. Elliot, a giant green dragon, takes him in and the two become best friends.It's one of the best friendships in recent film history, and a lot of emotion is drawn out of both Pete and Elliot by Lowery. It's not a film where the emotion tries to manipulate you. It's naturally charged.Fegley is excellent as Pete. He's not overly precocious or coy. And the supporting cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard, Karl Urban, and Wes Bentley, fills in the gaps around him nicely.Pete's Dragon doesn't take itself too seriously. For a family film, it understands humor, and the jokes never come off as childish.At times, things in the film are taken slowly. This isn't a bad thing at all. Throughout the whole movie, you won't see any 21st century technology. Even the cars are ambiguously dated. It's to keep the time period vague, but it's also to compliment the film's philosophy on exploration and adventure.But the heart of the film is the relationship between Pete and Elliot.It's emotional. I didn't just cry. I balled my eyes out. Anyone who's had an animal as a best friend will get this movie just a little bit more.It's a simple film. Which proves even more how good it is. If a film is this simple without being boring, you know the filmmakers are doing something right.Twizard Rating: 100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't a massive fan of the original - it was quirky and quite cute but paled in comparison to other Disney movies. Having seen this remake, I'm going to go back and re-evaluate!First off, as seems to be the case with all these live-action remakes, the casting is spot on. Fegley is fantastic in the central role - a child fending for himself in a forest, showing a wonderful blend of naivety and maturity. His friendship with Laurence works well too as she acts like an older sister to him. Howard is brilliant and brings a richer and more emotional tone to some of the scenes, becoming the mother figure and moral compass to the movie, and her relationship with her father, Redford, is natural and touching - fantastic!The real star though is the beast himself. Elliot the dragon is beautifully imagined, designed and rendered. It's a genius idea to make him furry, like a (very) big dog, cuddly and friendly - his face is more expressive than most of the cast! The broken tooth and scar hint at a more tragic, but unexplored, back-story, but his true quality is his partnership with Pete, as his friend and protector.For the most part, the movie is well written too - easier said than done when talking about a giant dragon living in a forest with a child! The dialogue is organic and believable, the story is simplistic, engaging and well paced, and the characters seem to have proper depth and motivations - even Urban's not-too-bad guy, whose only really villainous trait is he's a little greedy. For me though, the movie weakened slightly towards the final act. It's mostly a story dealing with loss, fear, bravery and friendship, but the last half-hour tries to give it a little more action and spectacle, which I really felt it didn't need. It's a calm and touching movie, it doesn't need added excitement to make it interesting.Lowery has done a great job of bringing this remake to the screen, complete with a gentle, lush visual palette amidst the trees, some terrific CGI, and a brilliant soundtrack (enhanced by Hart's touching Williams-esque score). A beautiful and simple experience for the whole family.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful for those 6 and older</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does contain spoilers. This movie is absolutely wonderful for older children and adults, but that said, the child should be at least 6, even seven years. SPOILER: There is a scene in the movie where the dragon breathes fire onto a bridge melting a hole in the road causing a truck with two parents in it to fall through plummeting 300+ feet. This was incredibly suspenseful and stressful for my almost 5 year old granddaughter. I guess, because it was titled "Pete's Dragon," I thought it would be gentle with maybe minor suspense, that was a mistake. She actually said that she did not like the movie and she has never said that about any movie. I don't think this is an isolated response. So as for a review: Great movie, but be aware it is not for most children younger than 6 or 7, or at least not those children who still only watch animated films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'PETE'S DRAGON': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Disney's live action-animated remake, of their classic 1977 kids' film (of the same name); that was also animation combined with live- action footage (and a musical). The film tells the story of a five- year- old boy, who befriends a dragon in the woods; after becoming orphaned there. Six-years later, the child reenters society, and the dragon follows him. The movie was directed by David Lowery, and it was written by Lowery and Toby Halbrooks (it's based on the 1977 script by Malcolm Marmorstein). The film stars Oakes Fegley, Bryce Dallas Howard, Oona Laurence, Karl Urban, Wes Bentley and Robert Redford. The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it's also bombing at the Box Office. I think it's a better- than-average kids' flick.The story begins in 1977, when Pete (Levi Alexander) is just five- years-old. He's on a road trip with his family, when his parents are killed in a car accident; but he survives. He's chased into the forest, by wolves, where a dragon saves him. Pete then befriends the dragon, and names it Elliot. He lives happily with it, in the woods, for six-years. When Pete is eleven (Fegley), he's discovered by a young girl (Laurence), and her family. He's then forced to reenter society, and Elliott goes looking for him. This causes trouble for both Pete and his dragon.I remember watching the original 1977 Disney movie, as a kid, several times (and liking it). I don't remember a lot about it though; I heard this remake is more of a re-imagining/reboot, than a faithful adaptation. Either way, I think the filmmakers did a good job; it reminds me of the type of movies I loved watching as a kid. I'm sure kids today will love it as well. It's about the same quality, of kids' flick, as 'THE BFG' (from earlier this summer).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>updated Pete's Dragon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie for the scenery, the animation and hoping that the film focused on the children's view of the dragon. It did not fail me - the animation of the dragon was very good and believable. The connection between Pete and the dragon was believable and beautiful. The connection between the two was maintained for the whole movie. The adults were believable - and the portrayal of the brothers was good. One wanted to preserve the forest and one wanted his way. And when he captures Pete - I heard some children booing him. The primary story is the relationship between Pete and Oliver - and the innocence of children's love for those who are good to them. I'm sure there were challenges in the green screen filming and making is mesh with the reality filming. The cinematography if beautiful - makes you want to go into the woods. A movie that some young children may have difficulty with - so above 5 with an idea of what happens in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Disney Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't grow up with the original Pete's Dragon, so I didn't have much of a reaction when I heard it was being remade. I watched a little bit of the original a couple of months ago and, I think it's just okay. It's nothing I'd watch again, and there are certainly better Disney movies out there. But I can kind of see why quite a few people have an attachment to it. It's very wholesome, cute, and the actors are putting their all into it. So how does Disney's newest remake hold up?Personally I think this remake is better than the original. It's not perfect, and I don't think I enjoyed it as much as the Jungle Book remake, but this was a good update to a movie, that I feel has gotten a bit dated.The story itself isn't particularly original, it's the sort of E.T. or Iron Giant type of story. But they tell it really well, and it's a nice change of pace from the very complicated stories we've been getting lately. It's nice to have a more simple story for a change.I was really impressed with the first 10-15 minutes of the movie, most of it doesn't really have much dialogue in it. It just kind of show's what daily life is like with Pete and Elliot. And it's all done visually, for the most part. I really liked that, and honestly think that's my favorite part of the movie.This movie keeps up Disney's trend of fantastic special effects. Elliot the Dragon looked great. There wasn't one moment where I thought "That dragon's not really there." Every time Elliot was on screen it was just like when the animals in the Jungle Book movie were on screen, or when Rocket Raccoon was on screen in Guardians of the Galaxy, I believed he was real. I know a lot of people complained about Elliot's design in this movie, and honestly, I don't get it. Yes, it's not necessarily a "traditional" dragon design, he has fur instead of scales, but he still looks like a dragon, and they did a good job of making him look like an updated version of the Elliot from the original movie.The acting is very good in this movie. There's not one actor I can name that I felt wasn't trying. Bryce Dallas Howard was especially great, as the park ranger who finds Pete in the forest. The child actors do a surprisingly good job as well. There's not one moment that felt like they were just reading lines, or weren't emoting enough. The boy playing Pete especially sells the performance of a kid who hasn't interacted with people for six years.Some of the main problems of the movie come from the supporting characters. Outside of the main child characters, and Bryce Dallas Howard, most of the other characters are kind of one-note. The "villain" just kind of serves to be a villain, that doesn't really listen to reason. Bryce Dallas Howard's father just kind of serves to be the old supportive father figure. It's not as annoying as it might sound, but it just kind of feels like they could have done better with the characterizations. But I think the performances slightly make up for it.The movie could also get a little too schmaltzy, specifically with the musical score in some scenes. I wouldn't say it's too much, but they definitely could have toned it down.Overall I think this is another great kid's movie from Disney, and while I think the Jungle Book was better, this was still a nice movie to sit through, I'd give it an 8/10. I can't say how fans of the original are going to like it, seeing as how I'm not a fan of the original, but I would encourage them to give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great moving family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete's Dragon (2016) is a great movie. It's funny, quite moving and great to watch. Although the first film (1977) may be disappointing to some this film will make them happy. Elliot the dragon is really funny at some points. Unlike the first movie, there is no singing or dancing by the characters in the film. This film can get quite dark at some points. The darkest part in the whole movie is the first 5-10 minutes where Pete's parents are killed in a car crash. Pete runs into the woods and is met by a pack of wolves. This can be quite tense because at the time Pete is only 4 years old. This will likely go over kids heads but to some adults and people who have experienced a similar event it can be quite overwhelming. The movie does really well at connecting the audience to Elliot. When he gets shot by darts it is quite sad and the audience begins to hate the antagonist(s). It is a great family film which kids and some adults will really enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We took our kids to see Pete's Dragon to celebrate my five year old's birthday.It was entertaining and well done. The very first few scenes are a bit disturbing and suspenseful for young viewers. There are suspenseful moments near the end of the movie where some characters are in peril that can be a bit stressful on young viewers.Overall, it was a good family movie.I don't particularly recommend seeing it in 3D but then again i'm not a big 3D fan. My 5 year old kept saying "my glasses aren't working" but that was an expectation thing (him thinking everything would be 3D all the time).Many of the scenes are dark (hard to see) which seems worse b/c of the 3D glasses.There were a few subtle nice scenes of 3D scenery but overall i see no reason to see the movie in 3D.The acting was good (especially Howard) and the dragon was very well done (not particularly scary, more of a big lovable animal).</fullReview>

Pete was so good you can tell the actor loves what he does. It was a brilliant cast. The whole family will love when Elliot saves the day. Petes dragon is a heartwarming film that will leave you in tears. The 3D was good, but not great. The coolest part of the movie is when Elliot saved the day. Parents if you think this movie is going to be a great family film then you are right on the money.

		<shortDescription>A boy and his dog movie minus the dog but with a Dragon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney really are into something with their live action remakes. After the delightful Jungle book, it is time for Pete's Dragon to get the live action reboot. However, the original jungle book still hold well today while the 70's Pete's Dragon has not aged really well in comparison and was not considered a jewel crown in the Disney film catalogue to begin with so a remake was a good idea. This Pete's Dragon is not a musical and the director chose wisely to cut the unnecessary trimming from the original. No more razzle Dazzle three dimensional villains, no more outdated animation that distracted us from actually genuinely caring about the two main protagonist the film was named after. This film is refreshingly simple. It's about a lost little boy and his pet Dragon who get their little world turned upside down by the outside world. Firstly Elliot the Dragon is just adorable, the director decided to give him the mannerism of a dog and that works perfectly as it makes him more relatable to audience. Oakes Fegley gives a very touching performance as Pete! Seriously it's easy to forget that the kid was mostly working with thin air yet he makes his bond with Elliot feels so real and strong. It's a very quiet and beautiful performance for a child actor, you really genuinely care for little Pete, a lot more then you did in the original. The other supporting actors are also very good. Bryce Dallas Howard has a real warmth to her that the director uses to great effect.she his very endearing as the kind Park ranger and mother figure to Pete and has real chemistry with Fegley. Robert Redford has the narrator is wonderful, after all he his Robert Redford! Wes Bentley is not much in the film but does a decent job, same goes for Oona Lawrence as the little girl who guides Pete to the scary outside world. Karl Urban plays the incredibly human antagonist, I say this because he his not really bad, there is no real villains in this film, I personally liked this. To make it short, if you are looking for a big blockbuster film with a fire breathing Dragon on a crazy and wild Adventure stay away but if on the other hand you are open for a sweet, more intimate emotional film that will probably make you tear up a little, I couldn't recommend this film more for all kids and kids at heart. I give Pete's Dragon a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie!!! Tulsa's newspaper critic said it was boring and the CGI was crude. Well, he needs glasses is all I can say! You meet Elliot in the first 5 minutes of the show and it's love at first sight. He is SO lifelike and the detail is so fantastic you just want to reach out and pet him. His facial expressions and the sheer wonder of it all are just amazing! The story does not lag at all in my opinion. In fact the entire 1:44 run time was full of anticipation and excitement. I cried about 3 times, so be prepared blubber heads. It's about love, friendship, family and belonging.

		<shortDescription>Magically animated and Flying High With Emotions. A Remake That's A Different Kind Of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's age of remakes continues strongly as they bring more cartoons to life. Their latest product is Pete's Dragon, a whimsical, musical that many of us remember dancing to as kids. So naturally they want to try and recreate the magic with a remake. Robbie K here with another review on the latest movie to grace the silver screen, so let's get started. LIKES: ? Elliot was animated fantastically ? Decent story with deep emotions ? Good ActingAs I mentioned, Elliot was a cartoon dragon who hummed and sang the movie away in a colorful display. So to see that two-dimensional dragon brought to life in three-dimensional computer animation was certainly awesome. Elliot's transformation was beautifully done and incredibly detailed from the slobber of his mouth to the green mass of his fur. The dragon's lovable mug, deep caring eyes, and magnificent persona were all captured in his design and brought with it a wave of nostalgia (minus the absence of the purple hair and tuft). In terms of his animation, again the CGI team at Disney brings top-notch work from majestic flight to blending into the background of the forest. Some people were definitely paying attention in anatomy-physiology class. Outside of the animation, the story is surprisingly deeper than initially expected. If you remember the first movie, it was film set on whimsical music and a cute fun atmosphere. Not the case for this film. Instead of singing and dancing, this rendition chose to take a deeper journey that explored concepts like loyalty, family, and love. Despite their adventures among the forest and animated deer, Pete and Elliot's relationship felt more like guardian and pet, rather than best pals to pull pranks with. Once the other humans joined up with him, the emotional kick only hit harder, building up to "heated" moments that tugged at your heartstrings. While I didn't shed a tear, I can't deny that at times I felt something brewing in my chest. And helping bring that story to life is a well selected cast who brought their A game to the table. Bryce Dallas Howard played the overbearing, wannabe parent well, especially the overly doting atmosphere. Robert Redford, rocked as the wise man of the town, bringing comedic relief to the mix and fun grandpa atmosphere. But the real star of the show for me was Oakes Fegleyy, who played the wild Pete exactly as I expected him to be portrayed with a wild sense of curiosity matched only by his innocence and loyalty. Plus the kid knew how to act with an imaginary creature. DISLIKES ? Not as much fun ? Diluted antagonist ? A bit cliché at timesOkay the movie was still fun in its own manner, but I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I did the original. I missed the colors, music, and energy of the first film that held immense energy that used to have me singing and laughing for days. This movie's more serious nature, darker color scheme, and powerful symphony music hold little of that energy. Only a few playful moments came close to that classic fun, primarily when Elliot was more like an adorable pet fetching sticks. Another thing that I didn't enjoy as much was the supposed "bad" guy of the film known as Gavin, played by Karl Urban. Urban did a fine job with his character, but the directing team did not design a villain as rotten as the original's Dr. Terminus. Gavin was a single-minded boob, who had little character development, a rather lame goal, and a surprisingly effective arsenal. He brought little threat to the movie, and most of the "exciting" conflicts were actually pretty low key that robbed the film of excitement. Finally the overly cliché moments of the movie are a bit cheesy and a bit lacking in the fulfilling department. Much of the "surprises" are not really that surprising, but instead go down the expected avenue of Disney plots. Some times these moments are actually nicely done, well designed and well orchestrated to fill you with a warm feeling. Other times these moments are very shallow and overly cheesy, like something out of an episode of Full House. However, this is a very minor weakness for me and at least brings good lessons and character development with them. The Verdict:Pete's Dragon is certainly another display of Disney's ability to modernize their movies. Insane animation, a well-constructed cast, and an emotional story are certainly the selling points of this Disney movie. I can definitely appreciate the direction they took this in, but it still wasn't as much fun or filled with Disney magic as the original 1977 film. Still, the young and young at heart will have fun with this movie and most likely enjoy the theatrics. I think I have told you the recommended audience to see it in the theaters, but this reviewer would state this one can wait for the RedBox. My scores are: Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film full of cheesiness and clichés...but somehow it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right away, it was pretty obvious that this movie was going to be a pretty run-of-the-mill family movie. I probably could have told you exactly what was going to happen for the rest of the movie after watching 5 minutes (although I'll admit that I mispredicted the ending). The adult characters' dialogue is all pretty cheesy, and it is pretty obvious right away who the good guys and bad guys are. But for some reason, I still loved this movie and consider it one of the best movies I've seen in theaters this year (I work at a theater, so that's saying a lot).The movie of course relies heavily on the relationship between Pete and Elliot. If the filmmakers don't convey their fondness of each other well, then the entire movie is a bust. But it was all done perfectly, especially given the limited amount of screen time that the two have together. And especially considering Elliot can't even talk, it amazes me that the filmmakers were able to make me feel so strongly about him.The two child actors were absolutely wonderful. As was Robert Redford. I couldn't help but compare this to the Jungle Book because of the child main actors, and overall I definitely enjoyed this more, and even felt that Pete and Elliot were a more lovable dynamic duo than Mowglie and Baloo, which is hard to beat.If I had to make one complaint about this movie, it would be the final scene. I won't go into details about what happens, but it completely caught me off guard and left me with a few questions. But overall it really doesn't detract from the overarching plot, so I guess it isn't that big of a deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pete's Dragon is the most definitive reason why remakes exist!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It'd be almost pointless to call Pete's Dragon a remake at all. Built on the core foundations of the original, the movie takes such a fresh the angle on it that I'm surprised that they kept the name. Rightfully so, since the original was - however ironically fun - weirdly outdated even for its time; obviously trying to replicate the success of Mary Poppins, the movie squanders the otherwise interesting "Calvin and Hobbes" influences in favor of bizarre song numbers and old-timey camp. It takes a special talent (namely David Lowery coming off the shoes of the indie crowd with Ain't Them Bodies Saints) to rework this from the ground up and ultimately surpass the original by a country mile, and the people involved succeeded. Pete's Dragon captures the childlike awe and the rustic setting like the original but with a much more meditative, gentle tone, resulting in the most honest and emotional family tale of 2016.The movie starts with a very young Pete as the sole survivor of a tragic car crash (a sequence that defines messed up) in the isolated woods in the Pacific Northwest. Alone with no family left, he scours for refuge after being chased by wolves, until he encounters a gigantic but also a friendly green dragon, who is appropriately called back to Falkor from Neverending Story. The dragon takes pity for the lost boy and the two instantly form a bond. After a huge, yet delightful, piece of the first act focusing on the dragon (called Elliot) and Pete just playing around, they soon encounter a lumber company led by Karl Urban who wishes to cover more ground in the woods under the disapproval of Bryce Dallas Howard as his park-ranging stepsister. Alongside her is Oona Laurence as her daughter who soon greets Pete and soon makes a connection with the rest of the family. But when Urban grows suspicious of the woods after his confrontation with Pete, he soon develops a different motive for proceeding further in the woods. Now before you say anything, yes, the story isn't all that new and you probably know where this is going. The lumberman might step into the bad guy role in the pursuit of the dragon. Pete winds up retreading the fish-out-of-water story beats. There's a subtle tension between Pete and Elliot in the beginning of the third act. Heck, there's an old man (played by an otherwise fantastic Robert Redford) who tells a story about the dragon who turns out wasn't crazy after all. However, this movie goes to show that how you approach these clichés is important, and the amount of patience and rawness Lowery approaches these should be given more credit. From the very first scene to the last, David Lowery proves himself as an unexpected master of rural scene geography and cinematic language. It's big things like the setting and tone, which feels reminiscent of an old Terrence Malick piece. It's small things, like the way it shows certain plot points rather than telling us and the personal dynamics between Pete, Elliot, and the family. And it's the things with individual scenes, like the first act devoting itself to just Pete playing around in the woods with his amazingly rendered dragon friend, and a sequence where Pete interacts with the unfamiliar town in which might be the best version of such moments. The clichés themselves are given more honesty and complete lack of plot contrivances. It all culminates in a piece that largely feels fresh and accessible without being too twee or fluffy. But the biggest accomplishment of this film truly lies in how it does wonder with its coming-of-age parable. Despite some effective adult development with Redford, Howard and the rest of the family - Urban himself isn't much of a bad guy in this as he is a man who's ambition goes too far - it's all kept just simple enough to let the child perspective to truly sell. Referring back to the Calvin and Hobbes influences, Elliot himself embodies a child's struggle to cope with the loss of friends or family, even as far as resulting Elliot resembling more like a giant dog or teddy bear than an actual dragon. So the whole film structures itself as a trial for young Pete to fully embrace human connection again. In the end, Pete's Dragon implicitly tells the youngsters that it's okay to move on from your loneliness, and it does so without any stupid dance numbers or weirdly dated stereotypes. And believe me, guys, this results in probably one of the most heartbreaking endings I've ever seen in any kids movie. This perspective almost comes with a weakness during the third act, where some of the characters classify him as an actual freaking dragon while the perspective mutes most of Elliots grand scale. This issue is honestly almost all throughout the movie but only highlights itself more prominently during the end. That minor issue aside, Pete's Dragon proves worthy of its own place of original works, let alone as a remake. It's the type we get seldom these days, where the remake redefines its own name by having a man with a unique vision builds a whole new creation out of the same blueprint much like David Cronenberg with The Fly or The Coen Brothers with True Grit. Everything from the true nostalgic charm to the rustic geography to Elliot's unique design to the introspective tone works wonders in a movie I've never thought I see in my life. I'm usually bad at spotting a classic, but this might be the one.For more reviews, check out my blog http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/08/review-petes-dragon.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has heart.I remember the first Pete's Dragon, which was a live action movie that used a cartoon dragon. This time around, the technology of cinema has made it that they can Crete a CGI dragon that looks like much more than a cartoon.And it's filled with those great heartfelt performances:Robert Redford knocks it out of the park in a role usually given to Morgan freedman. Bryce Dallas Howard, Karl urban, Isiah Whitlock Jr. from the wire successfully stepping out of his element doing this quiet family movie. The dialog these actors had to spew was pretty corny but well played by the actors.It's a classic Disney tale redone in the same classic motif.

The ballad "Puff the Magic Dragon" is NOT heard here; Disney's subliminal opinion-molding suggestions are far more sophisticated and subtle than that. But by fashioning its dragon "Elliot" as a FURRY GREEN entity afire at one end, Disney's title character is essentially a giant flying blunt. The U.S. Rich People's Party invented the whole REEFER MADNESS hoax in the early 1900s when Symbionese Liberation Army founder William Randolph Hearst decided to replace renewable high-quality hemp pages for his newspaper empire with planet-killing acid-soaked rain forest rags to turn a quick buck (that is, he demonized the medicinal effects of MJ as a ruse to corner the market on trashy paper!). Even though America was founded by pot growers such as George Washington, Robert Redford and Opie's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard had to flee to New Zealand to make PETE'S DRAGON free of intimidation by Rich People Party thugs. Pot might kill a handful of U.S. residents annually, but more die from peanut allergies and U.N. statistics show that 1,231 Americans are killed by alcohol for every pot-related fatality. But when's the last time you heard someone saying we should criminalize peanuts and booze?! One in 250 Americans can benefit from medicinal alcohol; one in seven need the healing touch of marijuana to deal with Modern Diseases. As the flock of baby flying blunts illustrates at the end of PETE'S DRAGON, pot's eventual triumph is inevitable.

		<shortDescription>Not a blockbuster. it wasn't meant to be one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try to avoid spoilers.I saw the original 'Peter's Dragon' when it reran in the neighborhood theater in 1979. It was the second movie I saw in the theater. I still remember crying, laughing and booing at times. This movie is a remake like so many others these days. Disney, just like Hollywood, apparently has a dearth of original ideas so they are looking for easy money in redoing classics. The original 'Pete's Dragon' was and is a classic. I went into this expecting the worst.I am pleased to say I was wrong.This is not 'Gone with the Wind' or 'Casablanca'. This is not 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek' or any of the other many cheap ripoffs of those two. This movie is not about deep drama or over the top action. The core of this movie, as in the original, is about family.Pros- 1) The CGI works well. (Elliot EASILY steals the show.) 2) It is very hard not to root for Pete. (Especially when he tries to clobber a full grown man. Guy deserved it!) 3) ROBERT REDFORD! ('nuff said) 4) For once, the dragon is not the bad guy.Cons- 1) Some cheesy dialog. (He did NOT just say that! He did? Who the hell paid him to say that?) 2) Some things not explained at all or very well. (Don't know about you, but I do not want to live in a tree with no shoes in mountain forest in winter.)Conclusion- Good family movie. Not Oscar worthy, but then again, why WOULD it be?Not entirely what I expected, but I did enjoy it. That is the point right? To enjoy something instead of looking to see every little fault in the CGI fur?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with soul.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer largely dominated by lousy sequels and tired franchise extensions, Pete's Dragon is a movie with soul. A meditative kids' film, in a great way. The movie was well told, with likable characters and a theme of family and friendship. It will have you believing love can conquer all. Bring your tissues. This story is a tearjerker that strips away the excess and keeps on stripping. On the most basic level, all that's left is the elemental friendship between boy and beast and a lovely affirmation of family. First and foremost, Pete's Dragon is a movie about real people. The dragon that brings them together is secondary. I found the lesson of the movie Go and see it and enjoy with your kids. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may be by the numbers, but its heart is in the right place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the 1977 original well as I used to see fairly often when I was a kid. I remember it being fun and having that Disney magic. It also had some musical numbers, which was the norm back then.I was a bit unsure when this was announced as I felt the original was of its time and that the transition into 2016 would not work. But in the people involved in front and behind the camera gave me hope that we could have a respectable re-make.It ends up being that. The tone, story and message that it sends out may have been done a thousand times before. But is that a bad thing, no. It remains to be a solid watch as its heart is in the right place and it has an old school feel to it which was refreshing to see. It almost had a feel of early Spielberg to it, especially in the final act, and also had a similar tone to a lot of Robert Redford's directed films. So I could definitely the potential of a really good film in here, rather than just a decent film.I was impressed by the cast that they got for this and they all did their roles fairly well. Oakes Fegley was really good as Pete and does look a lot like the kid who played Pete in the original which was pretty cool. Oakley was quite a draw and very believable. Bryce Dallas Howard was classy and definitely was well suited in the tone of the film and felt like a warm character. I felt Robert Redford had a nice screen presence and you felt safe every time he was on screen. I was really happy to see Karl Urban as he seems to be great in anything that he does. Like Dallas Howard, he fitted into the tone of the movie really well and played a solid villain (of sorts). I was also great to see Oona Laurence again in a role after her brilliant performance in Southpaw last year. As for Wes Bentley, he was completely underused and anyone could have done that role and it would not have changed my opinion on the film.I felt the design of Elliot the dragon was quite good. I liked the look, the personality, he made me laugh and on the whole is a really cute and sweet character.Most of my negatives are minor. The pacing felt too slow for me, especially in the first act. It felt as if they did not have enough of a story to fill the duration and decided to just stretch it out. It is hard to compare it with the original. But I felt the characters in this one were not as memorable nor as well developed. There was also less fun I felt. But my big negative with it came in the very final scene. I obviously won't spoil me. But it just felt wrong in what they did in the end and in the end just did not make sense at all.It goes at a gentle pace and has a simple story that everyone can follow. Kids aged between 5 and 7 will probably get the most enjoyment out of it. But it is first and foremost, a nice, heartfelt and pleasant family film that everyone can get on board with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fair attempt to make a good film and good example for those people who want to make remake movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I knew this is a remake movie I feel very curious about this film and wanted to watch this movie. Talented cast also makes a good hype watch this movie. Though the name of the movie is a little bit confusing and also misleading but the attempt and the director's effort really appraisable. If anyone saw the trailer, must be thought it is a typical routine adventure movie and maybe will compare this movie with Narnia and Eragon but ultimately this is not that type of movie and the storyline is completely different. Sometimes the plot maybe over the top and over fantasized. But if you are searching for a good family film this must be a fair choice for you.I didn't watch the original film but I heard about the film. That is why I am not going to compare these two film. Maybe the original movie is better than this but I can surely tell you this is a good attempt and a worth watching. There are lots of good movies released this summer but this must be a good choice and a well-made movie.A very talented cast are appointed in this movie. Robert Redford, Bryce Dallas, and Karl Urban has done a very good job and Oakes Fegley also judged fairly to his role. The direction is good, the attempt of trying a good movie is also very good but this could have been better by creating some good suspense and made the pace faster. The Dragon is also well made CGI and almost realistic for the plot. One of the most negative things about this movie is the plot is very predictable. The emotional scene and bits also not well made and very predictable. Sometimes you will feel the plot is over fantasize and unoriginal which are also big mistakes for the director and example of poor writing of the screenplay. If you want to watch an adventure movie which has not a typical storyline you can watch this movie and I believe This will meet your expectation almost 60%-70%. Enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a gorgeous atmosphere and gentle tone, Pete's Dragon is a brazzle-dazzle of a remake that's better then the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's an interesting fact about me; Pete's Dragon was the first movie that I ever saw or even owned. I had to be only two or three, but the Disney clamshell VHS was there for years as I watched young Pete and his animated dragon Elliot go on their adventure. You can understand that I have a nostalgic soft spot for the musical from 1977, even though I gave the old movie another watch recently. I can say that Pete's Dragon suffers from being overlong, too over-the-top, and it's extremely corny (at least by Disney standards). It'll always have a place in my heart, even if the film is flawed. I doubt most children know about this old movie. So news of a remake intrigued me. Disney has been on a remake roll recently with moneymaking movies like Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book. Though some were fine, you have to question on whether their aware that their animated counterparts were already the better adaption of one's source material. What makes a remake of Pete's Dragon interesting is that it's an original story. What we have with this new Pete's Dragon is a completely different story with Pete and Elliot the only things from the original.When he was little, Pete was going on a camping trip with his family in rural Washington State when a car crash changes this little boy's life. With his parents killed, he meets the fabled dragon of the forest, and finds it very friendly. The dragon, that Pete names Elliot after a children's book character, spends the next six years caring for the boy as they live in the woods. One day, Pete spots some lumberjacks and a park ranger nearby. He's discovered by park ranger Grace (played by Bryce Dallas Howard), her boyfriend Jack (played by Wes Bentley), and his young daughter Natalie (played by Oona Laurence) where he's separated from his dragon after an injury. Pete uses his feral skills to try and escape back to the forest, but is caught by Grace. She then takes him back to her place to relax for a bit to try and figure out how he's been able to survive for six years. His attempts to tell them about Elliot fail as everyone thinks that the dragon is imaginary. The only believers are Grace's father, former park ranger Mr. Meacham (played by Robert Redford) and Jack's brother Gavin (played by Karl Urban) who saw the dragon and wants to hunt him down.For those that want to know how to do a proper remake, Pete's Dragon is that perfect example. This is a wonderful family movie that seems to respect children by providing something gentler and slower. It's all about friendship and the power it can build. In turn, this gives us a story that might be thin, but really embraces it's atmosphere. The movie is gorgeously shot and allows its forest and lumber town to be taken in. This feels like a live action Hayo Miyazaki anime. The casting is top notch with guys like Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford and Karl Urban bringing a lot of personality to their characters, along with newcomer Oakes Fegley as Pete who balances a feral-toughness along with a genuine curiosity. Elliot looks great as something of a cuddlier beast and still manages to get a lot of emotion in it's limited vocabulary of grunts and whistles. The film feels even with it's story and pacing, even if the third act can feel a bit rushed. I think a little more could have been with the history of the myth of dragons in the mountains, but I doubt that most people would care.I'll give this nine Elliots out of ten. Pete's Dragon is the prime remake done right. This is what Ghostbusters should have done; finding it's own style and story rather then relying on the original. I'd make the case that this is better and I now promise that my future child will have a copy of this when he's three. Though I'll still keep a copy of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful World of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Close your eyes. Think of your best friend. Some call it fate. Some call it luck. Some call it magic. Walt Disney has been and will always be a family oriented magical place filled with awe and wonder.On November 3,1977, a year and 11 months before I was born a vision by the way of a friendly dragon entered onto the big screen. His name - Elliott. Along with his good friend, Pete, they had so many adventures together.39 years later, on August 12, 2016, the adventure rekindles. The joy, the laughter, the suspense, the heartfelt emotions just came back rushing over. It's like he never left.That sense of magic that Elliott left still leaves in us today as we are reminded that all we have to do is close our eyes and reach out and believe.Pete's Dragon will once again leave that magic in our hearts and that warm fuzzy feeling that we are to believe in magic and friendships once again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pete's Dragon is one of the best Adventure ;) your family will experience this year! Although not as well made as The Jungle Book it is incredibly fun, I think Oakes Fegley did a phenomenal job in the role, all the little details are done beautifully! Also the cinematography is breath-taking Robert Redford and Bryce Dallas Howard also deliver good performances but the stand out is Elliot, although the Fur on the dragon seemed like a bad choice in the ad campaign, it works amazingly in this film, Elliot is one of the cutest thing I have seen in a movie this year! But this movie is not perfect but it would have been if it wasn't so rushed, the film felt really short despite it's 1h 43m run time. Karl Urban is another mistake for the movie, his performance is one dimensional and when ever they would cut to a scene involving his character Gavin, the movie falls flat, however the ending was good even though Pete's new look was not "On Fleek" - Yousef Al-WaeliSource: http://www.huludb.com/movies/321060-petes-dragon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somehow, this version is just as long, slow, and devoid of movie magic as before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a sudden accident separates young Pete (Oakes Fegley) from his parents, the boy is stranded alone in the woods - but only momentarily, as he soon encounters a giant, friendly green dragon, whom he names Elliot. Years pass without incident, until loggers begin encroaching further into the forest, threatening Pete and Elliot's simple, isolated lifestyle. When lumberjack manager Jack (Wes Bentley), his daughter Natalie (Oona Laurence), and his girlfriend Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) discover Pete near a harvesting site, they take him back to their house for the night and promise to help Pete look for Elliot in the morning. But while the well-intentioned family attempts to reunite the boy with his magical companion, fearful townspeople - led by Jack's brother Gavin (Karl Urban) - hunt the creature for their own avaricious purposes.It begins with a somewhat terrifying opening scene, which demonstrates both the best and the worst aspects of this redux of a much-loved '70s venture. A lost, scared, tiny child is rescued by a benevolent creature, as gentle as it is enormous. But getting the boy to that point is an aggravatingly overused gimmick of camera viewpoints and predictable tragedies that works to nullify the poignancy of a mighty guardian and a helpless orphan. This mixed approach to storytelling tactics resurfaces frequently later on, as adults become villains, humans immediately confront unknowns with fear and hatred, and an anti-deforestation message is infused into the already tiresome family-friendly morals.It may not be difficult to best the success of the 1977 picture, but this 2016 re-imagining certainly attempts to fall into the same traps. This version is equally overlong, slow, and inundated with music; no less than three car-ride sequences showcase songs presiding over wide eyes staring out windows. It's as if the filmmakers couldn't come up with any other way to segue from one location to the next. And though the computer-animated Elliot is crisper, sharper, and far furrier (the whole dragon is covered in bristling hair to replace the purplish mop perched on the traditionally-drawn predecessor), he's also not as cute or endearing. And his actions and behaviors are virtually equivalent to a standard dog.Perhaps this film's genericness is its biggest detractor. Every human character acts and reacts exactly as they've done before in everything from "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" to "King Kong." The government wants to control the situation; hunters want the fame for catching a monster; and children just want to return the beast to its home and freedoms. The plot also borrows from "Tarzan" and "The Jungle Book" (particularly with the addition of a love interest - or a romantic curiosity for the boy), while following the exhausting, commonplace paths for conflict, the stopping of villains, and the exhibition of Elliot's propriety in helping even those who would hurt him.In all of this ordinariness, a few repeated lines hold significance, a couple of decent laughs find their way into the script, and many of Pete and Elliot's interactions prove genuinely emotional. But with the updates in special effects, environments, and the general sincerity of acting, it's more difficult than before to accept the existence of a chameleonic dragon and his tranquil touch (and his extreme intelligence and understanding of English). This, of course, also makes it more inconvenient to merely dismiss Pete's increasing proficiency with the language, despite his not communicating with anyone else for such an extended period of time. It's all meant to appeal to the very young, but it's the kind of subject matter - and production - that could inspire a decent theme park ride more than one's imagination or sense of wonderment.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>
