		<shortDescription>Very well told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely amazing and tragic true story, told eloquently by the man who lived it(Nick Yarris). With very very effective flashback scenes and images; that do add to the story very well indeed. I'm still thinking about it a few days after seeing it. The story takes you up and down, it makes you laugh and makes you cry. I found it and the man so inspirational that I needed to leave a review(can't believe there inst one already!). I could listen to this man tell me his true-life story, all day long, I'm sure there could easily be a whole 'Making a Murderer' Netflix style series made about his life. He's not perfect, but who is? Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You wouldn't think it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the face of it, a documentary that spends a full hour and a half sitting with one guy as he talks to the camera doesn't sound all that interesting. Yet THE FEAR OF 13 turns out to be stark, compelling and ultimately moving viewing, because the interview subject has one hell of a story to tell.In essence, this is a story of Death Row and the life and death struggle that takes place within. Nick Yarris was sent down in the 1980s, but his life story incorporates much more than a simple tale of life behind bars. There's action in the form of thrilling police chases, a murder mystery, courtroom drama, a blistering critique of the American justice system, and finally catharsis of sorts.Director David Sington commendably avoids tricks for the most part, content for Yarris to tell his own story in his own words - after all, it needs no embellishment. There are a couple of flashbacks and some evocative music and sound to fit the theme, and it all works. THE FEAR OF 13 is a fine piece of film-making and one that deserves to be seen by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible, a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me about this film was Mr Yarris's incredible story telling ability. It is non-fiction but I immediately had to IMDb it to check because I was sure he was an actor. His talent with words and elegance with delivery grows throughout the film. This, coupled with skillfully placed flash back scenes, completely immerse you into the story. Yarris's life could easily be argued as one of the most tragic ever to be lived. For a film which is essentially a 90 minute interview, I was completely blown away by how much it entertained me and moved me. A dark horse of quality film and story telling. Added to my repeat watch list and recommended to everyone I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definition of Real Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched many documentaries about crime and listened to people who have committed crimes. I don't usually rate documentaries because they provide different information that is important across the board and I can't put a rating on that.This is my first ever review and the reason why I chose to review this film is because it's one of the most captivating and detailed story I've ever listened to, about crimes someone have committed. Throughout the film, I kept asking myself, why is this (former) prisoner so good at storytelling and why was he in prison, it is almost like you almost can't believe that the story actually happened because of the way he was conveying it. The cinematics were just enough to compliment Nick Yarris' story which made it all together very engaging and beautiful. Even though he went back and forth in history while he told his story, it was still easy to understand because it all came together as he spoke.A wonderful story that everyone should hear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring and motivational treat, wrapped in a tale of bad decisions and tragic events.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really awesome doc here, me and a friend watched this the other night and I was blown away. The narration and structure are phenomenal in this piece, a very close to heart tale and the context in which it all unravels is remarkable none the less. I'm so glad I watched this doc, which I wouldn't have expected could be so personally inspiring and motivating regarding how much knowledge is really garnered from reading. I mean, of course, I know reading is important and I do my share of knowledgeable reading each day. But, I'm simply referring to those that really read as a fun activity and not just because you have to read for the moment. I'd be lying to say I'm not guilty of that sometimes, but after viewing this doc, I'm extremely inspired to do way more. I understand my review is not as detailed, or as intricate, regarding the context of the overall film. However, I wanted to reflect and share on the personal inspiration I was able to take from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resurrection: from death to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching "Fear of 13" on Netflix and was blown away by this true life story.After being mistreated as a boy, Nick Yarris' young naive life took a turn. He chose to act out by doing illegal acts which eventually led him to become more than a mere suspect, but a victim of backward and judgmental law enforcement during the days prior to DNA testing.Ending up on death row, Nick, through dedication, becomes well educated, borne out of the kindness of one guard who tells him to do one thing. That one act led to intellectual growth, after which Nick begins to seek aid from numerous officials and one particular person/organization.This is not the sort of story one wants to pause to fix a sandwich or rush to the bathroom, as it is all too engrossing. Throughout the film, Nick is well spoken, tells his life story with words and manners that reflect the person he alone grew to become, despite having been locked in a cell, in solitary confinement, for decades. Not letting all the terrible incidents that took place in confinement to turn him into an evil person, he, instead, became filled with purpose and vision.This film is a must watch for all fans of liberation. Please, don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving and well made documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Yarris was convicted of a horrible crime and sentenced to death ? this is his story. It is basically Nick telling the story of his life to camera and mostly done in a chronological fashion. There is some re enactment of his past life as a child but that is a small part of the film.For a film that basically just has one man talking to the camera for the majority of the time, this is incredibly powerful. It is an amazing, sad and moving story and I challenge anyone not to be moved by it. I watched it over a week ago and have only just decided to write a review to see if the film had lost any of its potency and nope it has not. To say any more runs the risk of spoiling the story so I will demur, this is recommended to anyone who appreciates the uniqueness that real life can portray and who appreciate quality in their film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtly moving, haunting, and powerful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no patience for documentaries that aim to tug a variety of heart-strings and make it obvious from the first few frames. Nick Yarris's story is different, perhaps mostly because it's treated objectively by the film's director. Instead of an hour and a half of old morality play, we simply sit and listen to a guy tell his incredible tale. At no point does Yarrow pretend to be anyone other than himself; at no point does he ask us to see him differently. He just tells us what happened to him, the good and the terrible, and does not ask us to judge, convict, or even forgive.It is for that reason that I found his story so compelling and emotionally evocative. It is, perhaps, a reminder that we all have amazing, emotional stories to tell and that we should all try to sit back and listen more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly haunting, downtroddenly reflective documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 2002, Nick Yarris, a death row prisoner since 1985, wrote to the authorities, eager to move his execution date forward, not relishing the prospect of going through another appeal, before some startling new evidence came to light and quashed his conviction after many years. Speaking directly to the camera, he narrates the tale of the build up to his arrest, the circumstances surrounding his life at the time, his experiences in prison and some traumatic events from his past that further shaped his mind.There can't be much more interesting sights to witness than that of a man with nothing to lose. A man who can reveal his innermost desires, thoughts and feelings without any sense of trepidation, given he's already building up to the final moment when it will all be gone. From our first moment with him, Nick Yarris strikes us as a guy with words just flying off the tip of his tongue, but with a surprising degree of eloquence and articulation (having taken up reading old books during his lonely hours on death row) in how he conveys them. And, in a short time frame, director David Sington draws out plenty of backstory from him.Yarris was hardly a model citizen before his incarceration, and if you consider we don't even learn of his innocence until the end, it's even harder to illicit sympathy with someone who still describes a life with little respect for the law and individual liberty. But nonetheless, he still spins quite a gripping yarn, and Sington further enhances the experience with the use of the camera, slowly hovering over seemingly mundane objects, and capturing the eerie silence of the empty prison with great clarity.It takes a deeply unappealing individual, and somehow manages to illuminate him as a human being, and enthral you in his woes and wherefores. A stirring and emotional tale that shines light from the darkest place. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTI am so used to documentaries like this having horrible endings that I constantly waited for the next horrible twist in this man's incredible story. I say incredible story, but not only is the story incredible, this man is incredible. He has had bad luck beyond belief, fueled by a couple of bad decisions. So when this story ended the way it did, I almost shed a tear, which is a very rare thing. Despite the static, empty and gray environment of his confinement, the horrible treatment he received, the indifference from the legal system, he endured it all, and not only that, he grew to become a better and wiser man at peace with himself. How he managed this is beyond my understanding, and it would be an honor if I could ever shake this man's hand. Hearing him tell his story, aided by highly effective visuals, sound effects and music scores, you are taken on an emotional tour through his life. I can easily say that this documentary has affected me more than any other recent title. I recommend watching this to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary and harrowing tale of the struggle of a man to clear himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** SPOILER ALERT -- THIS SUMMARY CONTAINS PLOT DETAILS ****In the interests of full disclosure, I should mention that I am vehemently opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances. What I found extraordinary about Yarris's account is the dispassionate manner in which he tells his story, in the form of interviews and flashbacks to past events. Yarris is no choirboy -- this is made very clear when Yarris describes his successful escape from death row during the course of a transfer, and his time spent on the lam committing auto theft, robbery, and other serious crimes.Yet Yarris draws the viewer into his tale, in which the viewer learns about the botched handling of DNA evidence, which became available in the 1990s and which resulted in literally hundreds of prisoners (many on death row) across the nation being released from prison EVERY YEAR following the reversal of their convictions.We learn of Yarris's self-motivation and his ultimate success in teaching himself to read and to understand complex words, and his subsequent immersion into the world of books (thrillers, suspense novels, and nonfiction accounts -- one nonfiction account named "Crime and Punishment!").Yarris describes the manner in which he was prosecuted for assaulting a police officer, attempted murder of a police officer, reckless endangerment, resisting arrest, and other charges stemming from his recapture. Clearly, Yarris is not the model prisoner or model citizen one would wish to have as a next door neighbor.But the inexcusable screw-ups in the handling of DNA evidence which finally exculpated Yarris make it clear that our criminal justice system is far from perfect, and that innocent people can and do get convicted, causing one to speculate as to the number of actually, factually innocent prisoners who have been executed, particularly in the decades before DNA evidence became available.At no point does Yarris engage in bathos or naked attempts to appeal to emotions. His account is calm, collected, and coherent at all times. Even his ultimate vindication and the reversal of his conviction are described without much emotion.What becomes clear is the psychological cost of sexual assault which is not addressed by therapeutic intervention (in this case, of Yarris himself as a youth). The writer was also left with serious doubts as to whether or not conditions on Pennsylvania's death row comport with Eighth Amendment prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must start this review by saying a few things... I am NOT involved with this documentary in any way shape or form. I am not really a fan of documentaries. I only watched this because of the reviews I read here. I was VERY skeptical because I have been mislead by reviews so many times before. but the positive reviews here are truth!, watch it! so please believe me when I say these things... The telling of this story was SPECTACULAR and as near to perfection as you can possibly get!all I can say is "WOW", it is worth your time! I am going to recommend this to everyone I know...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another INNOCENT MAN faces the Dept. of Justice and serves 21 years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant documentary. Nick Yarris sits in a half-lit chair for most of his story and was so excellent that I thought he had to be an actor until the final credits! Do not miss this beautifully filmed, heart breaking story of "Justice" at its worst! After watching the film I sent him a short note to his Face Book page (you can Google it up). He lives in England for the most part since his release from prison for the twenty-one years he served for a murder/rape he never committed. At the time he was accused and tried in the 1980's DNA had not yet been "discovered" and only blood type was used to try and match killers with victims In the mid 80's while he is sitting on death row, DNA is discovered and allowed in court! Nick is ecstatic only to learn that the FBI has since "LOST" the evidence that would have exonerated him! It is 21 years of roller coaster riders and there just beginning!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating storytelling from a Death Row inmate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Nick Yarris was completely alien to me before I saw this documentary. The first impression I got when introduced to him was that of great sadness and loss. His face and body looked tired, drained from whatever he had experienced - at the end I understood why. The Fear of 13 does not necessarily tackle new issues; nor does it highlight anything one hasn't seen before. The struggles of convicts, their fight for survival inside a maximum security prison is no new genre. However, this story sucks you in from the beginning and keeps you listening all the way to the end. Stripping the documentary down to the bare essentials keeps it intriguing. Atmospheric music complements Yarris' somber voice with recreated scenes as he opens up about his past. And although the narrative of death row inmates have been shared before, there is an eloquence about Yarris that makes his story unique. There are times when I doubted the authenticity of certain professed anecdotes, but it was hard to disagree with the vigor in which he spoke about them.</fullReview>
