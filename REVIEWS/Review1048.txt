		<fullReview>"Dark Passage" offers a different take on the San Francisco noir genre. This is a movie in which we get to know about the story that unfolds in front of us told in narrative style by the hero, who is never seen until about one hour into the picture. Delmer Daves, adapting the David Goodis novel has created something seldom seen in this type of films, in which, the hero's presence is required at all times.The film has a great style, as it offers a view of the San Francisco of the 1940s in ways that hadn't been seen before. The director was lucky to be able to open up the book in excellent ways to keep the viewer hooked from the start. The 'moderne' style of that era is seen in glorious detail, especially Irene's apartment, where much of the action takes place. The effect of the glassed enclosed elevator makes a dramatic contribution to the look of this movie.The story of an innocent man, falsely condemned to prison for killing his own wife, parallels other movies. What's unusual here is that the presence of this convict is seen in another light with his own slant in to what really happened to the dead woman. There are other elements in the film that make it appealing. as the relationship between the escaped man, Vincent Parry, and the woman who rescues him, Irene Jansen.Sidney Hickox's stylish cinematography is one of the best assets of the film. The crisp images that one sees of the city, or the surrounding areas, add to the enjoyment of watching the mystery unfold. The mood is set by the swing music of the time as Frank Waxman's score is heard. Richard Whiting contributes the great song one hears in the background.The film is dominated by Humphrey Bogart, which says a lot about his power as an actor, and as a personality. When one considers he is actually not seen completely until after an hour into the movie, it speaks volumes of how the actor and the director were able to pull it through. The Irene Jansen of Lauren Bacall is another of the things that work in the film. Ms. Bacall's radiant beauty dominates every scene she is in. This actress had such a style that no matter what she is doing, she pulls our attention to her. The camera loved Ms. Bacall.The other best thing going for the film is the strong performances Mr. Daves has obtained from his cast. Agnes Moorehead makes a phenomenal appearance as the evil Madge Rapf. Her last scene with Mr. Bogart stands as one of the best moments in a film noir of the era. Ms. Moorehead's expressions as she is confronted with the facts, keep on changing as she absorbs everything being thrown at her. Clifton Young who plays Baker, the opportunistic would be criminal, is also effective, as he adds a layer of intrigue with an angle we didn't figure out existed. His fight with Parry at the bottom of the Golden Gate bridge is beautifully choreographed. Finally, the kind cab driver Sam, who helps Parry assume a new identity, as played by Tom D'Andrea is one of the highlights of the film, as well as the plastic surgeon, portrayed by Houseley Stevenson.This film, while not perfect, shows how well Delmer Dave's gamble paid in his conception for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogey is an escaped prisoner. Bacall helps him stay escaped. To maintain his anonymity he has a face-change operation.It is a gimmick film, but the gimmick doesn't just serve its own purpose - it highlights a theme of faces, and what faces tell you about the person beneath.You can tell when something is being explored onscreen for the first time - its done more thoroughly and more excitedly than it ever will again. Think back to that first film about the phenomenon of email (Disclosure) or the internet (The Net), or what about the first film exploring chronology-changes (Citizen Kane) or hide-the-protagonist (The Third Man), or the excitement of acting (Streetcar Named Desire). That initial excitement is never really matched again - after that it becomes just another device, or a reference. The thing here is partly first-person narration (this came out the same year as Lady in the Lake), but wholly plastic surgery, the idea of changing your appearance.First-person narration is actually quite rare in cinema. Lady in the Lake is one of the only examples where they stick with it for an entire picture, resorting to gimmicks like having Robert Montgomery looking in a mirror. Its used to great effect in the first half of Dark Passage, in order to hide Bogart's face. It was partly mechanical. Its a face-change movie. Instead of starting with Bogart and changing his face to a different actor, they wanted to pretend he looked like a different person (which we only see in a few photographs), and then after the operation he just looks like Bogart. But what the device of hiding his face does is create suspense, and focus on the issue of faces, which is a recurring theme throughout.And it works to the positive for this film: what's the best way to hide someone's face? Put us behind their eyes! You never see your own face unless you're looking in the mirror. So until his operation, we see through Bogey's eyes - and the result is quite cinematic. It really frees up the movie, unshackling it from the static trappings of most studio pictures of this era. Instead of us just looking on from the edge of a set, which ends up looking like a stage, we're really taken into the action - its marvellous!And, to save the best till last - Bacall absolutely burns up the screen in this. She sets the celluloid on fire. Any single shot of her in this movie is magic. Just being onscreen and being magic, its the definition of the X-factor.9/10. What a star-vehicle for Bogey. This was his Third Man. And Bacall is sensational!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supporting Actors Outshine Two Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching a "feature" on the DVD the other day after viewing this movie, it was interesting to hear that "Dark Passage" was never a popular film despite the headliners being Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.That was because studio head Jack Warner was displeased that Bogart's face wasn't shown for the first half of the film and so he didn't give the movie much publicity. The fact Bogey's face didn't appear for quite a while apparently didn't settle well with the public, either. That was their loss: this is a fine film. The stars of it, really - the actors who put the spark in the story - aren't Bogey and Bacall anyway but the supporting actors. I can't recall a movie where the supporting cast was so good, so entertaining, as in this film. Before naming them, let me preface by saying Bogart and Bacall still give good performances and Bacall still had a face in those early days that was mesmerizing BUT the people who make this movie click are:Tom D'Andrea as the cab driver; Houseley Stevenson as the strange and extremely interesting plastic surgeon; Clifton Young as the blackmailer; Tory Mallison as Bogart's old best friend and Agnes Moorhead as the villainous snoop. These people are fantastic.As an escaped convict on the run, we only see what Bogart sees until plastic surgery turns him into the familiar face we recognize. That sort of thing - seeing only what one character sees, using the camera as his eyes, was done in another noir, "Lady In The Lake," but not done as successfully as in this film. Here, it works as we meet these other weird characters as Bogart sees them. Actually, every character including Bacall's, is a bit odd. The script doesn't always make sense, either, to be honest, but it's fun to play along.It was a simple but effective story with some neat twists along the way and pretty good suspense here and there, too. I think it's a very underrated film noir and very glad the long-awaited DVD gave it a nice transfer. This is another example of a classic film that looks far better on DVD than it ever did on tape. I hadn't realized how well-photographed this movie was until I saw it on disc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a GREAT MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart made three unforgettable landmark films: Maltese Falcon, Big Sleep, and Dark Passage. Of the three, Dark Passage is the least known, which is tragic, because it measures up to the other three and in many ways surpasses them for atmosphere, characterization and psychological mood. Based on a novel by David Goodis, who also wrote the novel that Shoot The Piano Player was based on, it hits top marks in rankings of films in the categories of Film Noir, Existentialism, Dostoyevskian outlook and Kafkan world-view. Filled with forever unforgettable scenes and quotable lines, heart-wrenching views of fog-bound 1940s San Francisco and characters who seem to be stand-ins for the all our own private inauspicious never-to-be famous or successful friends and acquaintances, it's a brilliant metaphor for that dying species: the "individual". Also, of all the Bogart/Bacall pairings, it was the softest, tenderest &amp; most romantic. Movies like this should be on some kind of everybody's-required-viewing-list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark Passage is a forgotten masterpiece and a personal favorite. Delmer Davies captures the 1940's magic of San Francisco from hill hugging wooden stairs to fog horns to shrouded atrium elevators to some of the best character acting I've ever seen. Tom D'Andrea and Housely Stephenson are wonderful as the so smart but so decent cabbie and the end of the dark ally plastic surgeon. Agnes Morehead is persistent annoyance morphed into utter villainy personified. She is nails scraped on a blackboard good and you can't take your eyes off her Madge. Becall and Bogie tie it together with fine understated grace. The flick ends and you want to go find that little beach front café in Peru.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Softer Side of Bogart and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The absorbing documentary featurette on the DVD edition of the 1947 mystery DARK PASSAGE (DP) suggests that Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's participation in the star-studded Committee for the First Amendment, intended to defend colleagues called before the HUAC, might have been the reason that DP wasn't as big a hit as the real/reel-life couple's earlier screen collaborations. However, I suspect that audiences past and present may have found DP harder to cozy up to because, instead of the cool, insolent, wisecracking Bogart &amp; Bacall of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT and THE BIG SLEEP, this film version of David Goodis' novel THE DARK ROAD presents a more melancholy, vulnerable Bogart &amp; Bacall -- which is not at all a bad thing, just unexpected from this star team at that time. That Bogart &amp; Bacall chemistry is still there, but it's sweeter here, as if they'd decided to let down their collective guard and allow tenderness to take over. Instead of the cocksure Bogart character we all know and love, DP protagonist Vincent Parry is wary, fearful, fumbling in his attempts to clear himself of his wife's murder and elude the cops like he escapes from prison in the film's opening scenes. His only allies include the mysterious Irene Jansen (Bacall), who followed his case during his trial and ends up in a position to help hide him while he proves his innocence, and Sam (Tom D'Andrea), a kindly, lonesome cabbie who steers Parry to a back-alley plastic surgeon (Houseley Stevenson) to get a new face to help him fly under the law's radar.1947 was The Year of the Subjective Camera, with DP's first hour shot from Bogart's point of view and Robert Montgomery's film adaptation of Raymond Chandler's LADY IN THE LAKE (which I've discussed elsewhere on the IMDb) using the technique throughout. Unlike LADY..., DP's plastic surgery gimmick provides a good plot reason for the audience not to initially see Bogart's face, though we frequently hear that unmistakable Bogart voice to make up for it. We also get to see the lovely Bacall and lots of spellbinding character actors in lieu of Bogie. There isn't an uninteresting face or a bad performance in the bunch, with standout performances from the leads, D'Andrea, Stevenson (wise, kindly, and vaguely sinister all at once), Rory Mallinson as Parry's musician friend, the ever-dependable Bruce Bennett, cheap hood Clifton Young (with an oily grin and a cleft chin that looks like it got lost on the way to Cary Grant's face), and especially the magnificent Agnes Moorehead as Madge Rapf, the kind of woman who won't join any club that'll have her as a member, a stylish dame who spreads stress and misery wherever she goes. Sticking her nose into everyone's business, Madge manages to lure people to her and push them away at the same time, and if she can't have you, she'll make damn sure nobody else canhave you, even if that means murder. With her delivery dripping honey one minute and venom the next (especially in her climactic scene with Bogart), the quicksilver Moorehead's commanding presence and her unconventional, undeniably striking good looks ensure that you can't take your eyes off her whenever she's on screen.If you're looking for a tight mystery plot, look elsewhere. While DP has many suspenseful moments, it's primarily a character study and a mood piece about loneliness, redemption, and starting over, with a strong undercurrent of postwar paranoia, all underscored beautifully by Franz Waxman's stirring music (with contributions by an uncredited Max Steiner). The bus station scene is a touching example of this. But the reactions of people who meet Parry with his post-op face and new name, "Allan Linnell," are so suspicious I wondered if writer/director Delmer Daves (who cameos as the photo of Irene's doomed dad. His real-life kids have bit parts, too) was indicating that Parry was really projecting his own paranoia onto the people around him. His new name in particular makes people look at him like he just dropped in from the planet Neptune: "Linnell? That's a very unusual name." What's so freakin' unusual about it?! What, it's not blandly Anglo-Saxon enough? I wonder if John Linnell of They Might Be Giants fame ever had to field such questions...but I digress... :-) Even when DP drops the subjective camera style so we can see Bogart in all his glory, the visuals are striking thanks to Sid Hickox's moody black-and-white photography (although with the emphasis on Madge's love of all things orange, I can imagine a partly-colorized version a la SIN CITY, with everything black-and-white except Madge's orange clothes and belongings... :-) and some innovative visual techniques. I particularly liked the use of the glass floor when Bogart discovers a dead body -- a tip of the hat to Alfred Hitchcock's THE LODGER, perhaps? Speaking of Hitchcock, DP and Hitch's 1958 classic VERTIGO might make an interesting double feature since they share themes of loss, loneliness, new identities and fresh starts as well as a San Francisco setting. If you want to see a softer side of Bogart &amp; Bacall, DP is well worth watching. You may also enjoy the DVD's other fun extras, like the original theatrical trailer (for me, the hyperbole of that era's movie trailers is part of their charm) and SLICK HARE, one of the Bugs Bunny cartoons affectionately lampooning Bogart (rumor has it that Bogart liked to pal around with the animators at Warner Bros.' "Termite Terrace" and he actually did his own voice work for SLICK HARE and 8-BALL BUNNY).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally unconvincing star thriller which succeeds because of its professionalism?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart's third teaming with Lauren Bacall was in "Dark Passage," a murder-mystery film which depended upon contrivances rather than good scripting to see it through? The film opened with the use of a subjective camera (MGM used it throughout their "Lady in the Lake" that same year) with Bogart's off-camera narration establishing the plot as we watch our hero escape from prison with the intent of finding the real murderer of his wife, the crime for which he had been wrongfully jailed? Once he meets up with Bacall and goes to a plastic surgeon, the subjective camera is forgotten as Bogart now utilizes his own face and carries on the investigation? "Dark Passage" was energetically directed and written by Delmer Daves who used some atmospheric location shots in San Francisco to underscore his drama? The film included an unusual number of bizarre and eccentric characters, all competently played?Agnes Moorehead essayed a superb1y schizoid characterization as a bitchy "friend" of Bogart and his dead wife? Bacall showed definite signs of improvement in her acting and Bogart was properly bitter, sour and nonplussed? For all practical purposes, this film marked the conclusion of Bogart's famous "image" period? Now he was to forsake his romantic leading-man roles for acting assignments which he hoped would raise him to greater heights as a performer? He was to succeed, in many cases, magnificently?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agnes Moorehead steals the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if she has only two or three scenes she steals them all.And it speaks volumes when the stars are Bogart and Bacall.This is my favorite B/B among the four films they made together."The big sleep" has a plot I've never understood -Hawks used to say it was the same to him-,"to have and to have not" fails to excite me (Bogart a resistant and Gaulliste at that!"Key Largo",on the other hand, is a close second to Daves' movie .Not that the subjective viewpoint/camera was that much new.Robert Montgomery filmed his hero the same way in 1946 ("Lady in the lake" ,and we only saw his reflection in the mirrors).Hitchcock knew the technique as well and he used it with virtuosity during short sequences.But Daves who is best remembered for his westerns ("broken arrow") pulls it off effortlessly.The depth of field gives a dreamlike atmosphere to the first sequences with Bacall and the surgeon -dream which becomes nightmare during the operation when Bogart sees in his bad dream all the characters involved in the story- There are plot holes of course,particularly Madge 's character .Parry is in Irene's house and presto here she comes.It takes all Agnes Moorehead's talent to give this woman substance.The first third is Bogartless,as an user points out.But he could add that the last third is almost Bacallless too.Only the ending,which I will not reveal of course ,is not worthy of a film noir!Maybe the producers imposed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, we are really asked to believe a lot in this film. Typically movies can only get away with one or two unlikely plot elements, but somehow I still enjoyed 'Dark Passage' despite numerous key elements' implausibility.The film opens to a shot of convicted felon Parry (Bogart) in a barrel in back of a truck headed down the road. He shakes the barrel, takes a nasty roll and staggers out. It's just the first of many doubt-inducing sequences.The film, with its plot problems aside, is really an excellent film noir study. We are taken through most of the first half of the film from the first-person Parry (Bogart) view. I found this fascinating, despite wooden dialogue and continuous unrealistic steadiness of the camera. I think the base story of 'Dark Passage' is superb, with all its film noir elements. I especially like the first-person view, which then transforms through a surrealistic imagery scene of plastic surgery, into the normal third-person view.One plot element I particularly take issue with is that, although Parry gets a new face, we are asked to believe that his distinctive Bogart voice cannot be recognised by the closest of his acquaintances. He makes no effort whatsoever to account for this, and this is given no thought in the slightest.The film is one I would personally love to make - I would like to direct the thing myself, and revise the script a bit, make it more real in dialogue and plot primarily. This is a feeling I've not oft encountered, because I've almost always felt a director has done, even when he presents a wrong point of view, a better job than I could do. Due to my love for the story here I was torn - torn I tell you - in my selection of a vote for this film, but arrived at 7. I took off for the unrealistic factors, but made sure to preserve the respectability of the film. It is, incontestably, a classic - and in my opinion, just because a film is old doesn't mean it is. I respect this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The terrible script completely destroys this film. That's a shame, because I'm a huge fan of Bogart and Bacall. The film has first person camera work which is excellent, and the supporting cast is fantastic. However, Bogey's character acts like a total moron, leaving his fingerprints on every crime scene he finds himself at, and crime scenes follow him like a a five year old follows an ice cream truck. There is one phony plot contrivance after another. Bacall's character would have to be insane to believe that Bogey's character is innocent -- every time he goes to see someone, they die! He always has an explanation, and it always sounds false.In short, the awful script destroys what is, in every other way, an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, If Offbeat, Crime/Noir Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the least-known and, really, the least impressive of the Bogart/Bacall features, this is still a solid, if rather offbeat, movie that combines a film-noir atmosphere with a gimmick that is meant to drive most of the story. The gimmick works moderately well, though it is really just a diverting sideline to the main drama and acting, which are what really make the movie work.The premise is interesting enough, at least for a while, and it is interesting to see just how long they can go without showing the face of Bogart's character. They might have stretched it out just a bit too long, since there is more than enough in the rest of the plot to make any further use of the device unnecessary. Bacall and Bogart work together well from the beginning. In itself, the pairing works almost as well here as in their three better-known movies together - it's just that here there is a less for them to work with.The two stars do get plenty of help from Agnes Moorehead, who plays her role with relish. Tom D'Andrea and Bruce Bennett help out when they get the chance. Delmer Daves also creates a generally believable atmosphere to serve as the background to the story, and to help get it past the less plausible stretches. Overall, while hardly up to the high standard of the other Bogart/Bacall pairings, "Dark Passage" is a solid if unspectacular feature that is worth seeing if you like the stars and/or the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This is a one of a kind treasure from the Bogie library. The entire first half of the movie is shot like you are inside of Bogie looking through his eyes. It has been imitated but never equaled. Starting from his exciting escape from San Quentin; with many close calls, that are both realistic and suspenseful, you need to have this in your library. You might think after Becall gets Parry back in her apartment it gets boring but no way. She has a plethora of visitors always almost catching Bogie. Bennett her old boyfriend, Madge played by the human tarantula Agnes Morehead; villains define the success or failure of movies, what till you get a load of her, what a sweetie. The plastic surgeon bit, ripped of in Minority Report, shamelessly, is done much better and believably here without all the crap of that overrated Stevie picture. As he hides out, they develop the characters and a believable romance builds between the two of them. This is the genius of the movie, it uses the stuck together Becall and Bogie to deepen the characters and provide real emotional connection to the burgeoning romance. After he gets the bandages off, we switch back to the standard outside spectator point of view. I missed the novelty of being inside of Bogie; it is such a stroke of genius. How else to deepen your connection with him then to look through his eyes outside into the world? There are plenty of surprises with the jerk who gave Bogie a ride stalking him and trying to shake him down. If you know Bogie, this is never a very good idea. Also, Bogie has a showdown with the Black Widow villain of the movie Agnes Morehead. I will not spoil it for you the scene is well written and completely unpredictable; this is always the mark of a good screenplay: unexpected events. The film was attacked for spending too much time with Bogie hiding out with Becall, please, this develops their romance. The movie really is truly a romance but even I, a philosopher, enjoyed it. The romance is believable given their being trapped together. It is never maudlin or unbelievable. There are plenty of surprises and twists in this script; I have all of Bogie's movies; this is one of the ones I watch over and over. It is such a unique one of a kind movie. Looking out at the world through Bogie's eyes; experiencing what he goes through is so existentially powerful. It makes you really sympathize with him. It is like no movie you have ever seen before. A Real Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this one a disappointment on just about every level. The Bacall-Bogart relationship in the film is just too odd to ever get comfortable with ... oh yeah, she's always secretly thought he was innocent and oh yeah, she just happens to be driving in the area that day, and on and on and on. The look of absolute love she has on her face in every closeup just comes from nowhere. And as others have noted, the coincidences in this film are too many to list, it's almost the only thing the story is based on. Every character seems to have Moorehead's number, but no one does anything about it ... and the way she meets her maker is just too crazy to believe.Helpful tip for people driving near prisons ... don't ever pick up hitchers, especially when sirens are wailing! I really like noir, and I really like Bogart, but this film did zippo for me. My wife (who cares not much for either)was thoroughly unimpressed. Gimme the Big Sleep with all its inconsistencies anyday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, or perhaps not, most condemned prisoners do not have a dame, a dude, and a plastic surgeon around to break their falls when they escape. But when Bogart busts out of the big house, San Quentin, the Good Samaritans start popping up like dandelions. His method of escape is to throw himself down a steep incline in a steel barrel. The cameraman rides tandem and becomes his eyes and point-of-view. Bogart hitches a ride with a nosy fellow I've seen before in the movies. He has deep-set eyes and a divot in his chin. Bogart quickly dispatches the mug to dreamland and ventures out into an uncertain landscape of creeps and coppers. Instead, Bogart catches a break: he discovers he has a groupie played by Lauren Bacall. She is out painting landscapes when she hears the bulletin over the radio. She knows everything about his case. She even sat in the courtroom during his trial. She felt he got a raw deal. The dude he meets is a close friend who plays the horn. He allows Bogart safe haven to rest. Incredibly, Bogart steps into the cab of yet another sympathetic character. The cabbie guides him to a doctor who wields a wild scalpel. Bogart's ex-flame also knows Bacall--and is a royal pain in the neck. The coincidences pile up higher than The Golden Gate Bridge. Bogie and Bacall may have more well known films on their resumes, but this one will keep a big fat smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coincidence City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The least known of the four Bogey and Bacall movies and deservedly so has to be Dark Passage. The other three have become classics to some' degree and this one hasn't.There are just too many coincidences and too many plot holes for the good ship Dark Passage to float. Lauren Bacall just happens to be out painting when Bogart crashes out of San Quentin, she just happens to know some of the principals in the case that sent Bogart up in the first place, Bogart happens to get into a cab where a friendly helpful cab driver happens to know a good plastic surgeon. It's all too too unreal.Yet Dark Passage does have its good moments. Bacall and Bogey are smoking up the screen as they did in To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, and later in Key Largo. Agnes Moorehead steals the film from both of them with an over the top performance which is a text book example of overacting. My guess is Agnes was simply trying to overcome a bad script.Delmer Daves who is a fine director for outdoor films, westerns like Jubal and 3:10 to Yuma is also not the right director for Dark Passage. If Alfred Hitchcock had directed it with a better script, Dark Passage may very well have been the best instead of the worst of the Bogart Bacall teamings.One character I really liked though was Clifton Young who first picks up Bogart on the road after the escape. Bogart slugs him when he catches wise, but later Young returns for some blackmail. He's a two bit punk, very much along the lines of Elisha Cook, Jr. in The Maltese Falcon and you really are happy when he meets his fate.Dark Passage also helped the great Richard Whiting-Johnny Mercer standard, Too Marvelous for Words get a revival. Didn't cost the brothers Warner a dime as they owned the rights to the song, it having been introduced in the Ruby Keeler musical, Ready, Willing, and Able. Just like As Time Goes By got a revival from Casablanca.But we remember Casablanca a whole lot more than Dark Passage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A con named Vincent (Bogart) breaks out of prison to be befriended by a woman (Bacall) who sympathizes with his case which was akin to her father's. He gets a new face and tries to discover who really killed his wife and then his best friend. This is a rather tedious, unoriginal movie, with none of the snappy, quick dialogue that films of this era often display. It's slow-paced - lingering on humdrum scenes, repeating unimportant information such as Vincent's doctor's advice - and fairly predictable, even unintentionally comic (the silly anesthesia scene). The first half of the movie, we don't see Vincent; instead we see the action from his eyes. Perhaps that was interesting then, but I felt it added nothing to the movie. Morehead, as the dead wife's shewish friend (this is one of those movies where the good guys act predictably good, and the villains act only nasty) chews the scenery something awful in her confrontation scene with Bogie. Good acting by Bogie and Bacall, plus some scenes with a delightfully bullying thug, help save the film from being a total waste. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Passage (1947) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Parry is a San Quentin convict wrongly accused of murdering his wife, who escapes from prison and is taken in by a gorgeous Good Samaritan (that would be Lauren Bacall as Irene Jansen). She lets him hide out at her place for awhile, but eventually Vincent takes a ride with a very perceptive cab driver who recognizes him and also has a heart of gold; he pulls his cab over to the side and just happens to know this plastic surgeon friend who wouldn't mind putting his neck on the line to alter the face of a wanted fugitive. After the operation is completed and the bandages are unspooled, Vincent Parry turns into Humphrey Bogart, and he is now able to set out to discover who really murdered his wife.I'm not one who usually can't suspend his disbelief when watching movies, but there are a lot of contrivances here, even for me! I think the director made a poor choice in spending the first 30 or 40 minutes without showing Bogie, and even more importantly by using a very grating "point of view" camera technique to substitute for the character of Parry for far too long. This subjective viewpoint, where the camera becomes the eyes of the convict, as people look and talk at him, hand him cigarettes and so forth, is extremely effective at first but quickly grows into overkill. I think this would have been a much more interesting film if another actor was utilized to portray the pre-surgery Bogart.Everything just falls too neatly into place, and once Bogart has his face transformed, he doesn't really get involved in too much hard detective work on his own before easily stumbling onto the real killer's identity (you can't really blame him; it's quite obvious). One begins to wonder why he even bothered with the plastic surgery. Lauren Bacall is beautiful to look at, and I can watch her doing just about anything. But I think her rapport with Bogart this time out is kind of lightweight. The real surprise of the film for me was Agnes Moorehead, who turns in a delicious performance. This is a film worth watching for its stars and a generally intriguing premise; it's just unfortunate that it couldn't have worked out a little better. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film noir is a rich genre, and "Dark Passage" has the surface requisites: crime and passion writ large, with hard-boiled men, melodramatic women, and chiaroscuro photography. It also has Bogart, Bacall, and a solid supporting cast.But this is a mediocre movie, and I'm not even talking about the truckload of implausible plot turns. The movie is boring. No scene is crisp (worst: five shots of Bogart laboriously descending a fire escape). It's dialog-heavy to a fault: everything is spelled out, nothing is left for the visuals to reveal.And boring isn't the only problem. Dark Passage fails at something even more basic: characters. They're noirish stereotypes. One in particular typifies the problem: Agnes Moorehead delivers a spectacularly mercurial performance, particularly in her final scene: She starts as an austerely beautiful woman flirting with a stranger, but then her face swiftly and thoroughly contorts into a mask of age and rage when she realizes who he is--the man she couldn't forgive or forget, but didn't recognize because of his facial reconstruction.And that's the problem: a woman obsessed to the point of homicide with one man, yet flirting instantly with a total stranger? Moorehead almost brings it off, but we just don't care. Her motivation is so muddled it has no resonance. And Bacall's motivation is even more implausible. Unfortunately, treating the characters as plot devices rather than people is a fatal flaw, and it kills the soul of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 out of 10... add 3to 4 to 5 to (reading some of the reviews on IMDb) 6 points depending on how much of a Bogart/Bacall coolaid drinker you are. With the exception of the beginning of the film, which I'll admit is very interesting, this script is a disaster. Sounded like some hack writer aping "film noir" speak or some has been writer aping himself. The film is unwatchable after Bogart recovers from the plastic surgery.Many of the lines play more like a satire of film noir than actual film noir. All the actors approach this pretty earnestly, more's the pity. Agnes Moorehead gives the worst performance of her career (Endora was more nuanced). But I did believe Bacall loved Bogey, both in the film and in real life...can I join the club, now?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An escaped convict (Humphrey Bogart) undergoes plastic surgery and hides out with a pretty young woman (Lauren Bacall) while he tries to figure out who murdered his wife, the crime for which he was convicted. Excellent film noir written and directed by Delmer Daves with beautiful photography by Sid Hickox. It's the last film Bogie and Bacall did together and it's easily the most underrated of the three. Both are terrific here and have that same wonderful chemistry we all love, albeit with less sexy banter than their previous movies together. The real scene-stealer of the picture is Agnes Moorehead, who gets the juiciest role and one awesome scene in particular. Tom D'Andrea has a great bit as a talkative cabby and there are several other fine character actors in small roles.The first forty minutes or so is filmed mostly from a first person point-of-view. We don't see Bogart's face until over an hour in, after his character has had plastic surgery. A pretty gutsy move at the time to have your big star, Humphrey Bogart, heard but not seen for such a large chunk of the movie. But it's so well-done and effective, it's probably my favorite portion of the film. Another favorite part is a little bit of business referring to a famous line of Bogie's from a past film. That sort of thing is commonplace today but wasn't then. It's a funny part in a terrific script by Daves. The movie does meander some, usually for little moments with side characters. While many of these scenes aren't necessarily needed they add something extra to the picture that I enjoyed. Definitely a must-see for Bogie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if I like this film or don't. Bogart and Bacall would have chemistry in an Army training film, but somehow the plot line of this film just doesn't give them the best opportunity to make the most of it.There are unbelievable coincidences and it appears that everybody knows everybody else but don't know each other. And how easy is it to get picked up by a beautiful girl while you are making a prison break? And how many cabbies would do what Tom D'Andrea does when he takes Bogie to a back street plastic surgeon and the whole transformation is done in 90 minutes with no assisting nurse? It's all very convoluted and full of plot holes.BUT, on the other side of the coin, it does hold your interest and the POV camera in the first of the film is well done (unlike Lady in the Lake which is seriously flawed). Agnes Moorehead is a true psycho and revels in it......what a bad dame she is. Exactly how she goes out of the window still puzzles me......didn't she know it was there or did she do it on purpose? The ending ties it all up in a neat little package which isn't very satisfactory but, hey, Bogie and Bacall get to live happily ever after.....or do they? He is a killer after all......remember Baker? Whatever the faults as I see them, you still can't beat Mr. and Mrs. Bogart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of noir. I do think Bogart was used well in a few fine films. Moreover, there are some amazing films experiences I have had with the POV camera.Independent of these two, I have fond regard for stories that are situated among "little people" trampled by the system. This specifically and pointedly does this. But this is a failure all around. You can't have noir (at least at this period) and also have human conspiracies. They're two different notions of who is pulling levers. But beyond that, even if this profound mistake hadn't been made, the simple storytelling here is broken. One dynamic in storytelling is the simple craft of telling us not what we need to know to move the story ahead, but what we want to. These wants can be manipulated, even mostly fabricated by all sorts of tricks, but you do have to put narrative fragments where our minds are directed. This director (who co-wrote this) hasn't a clue. We see things that get in the way. We see things we already know or don't care about. We see things that pander. There's one sequence where presumably the hero is under some psychotropic anesthetic and hallucinates faces in precisely the manner that symmetric lens mirrors can display. Its "horror" that works against itself. Its horrible, embarrassing.Nothing works. The point of view at the beginning isn't for cinematic effect, rather to avoid showing the face. Its clumsy. The threads of desire that draw the two characters together are spoken about, but we just do not see them. So they aren't there. There are supposed to be underlying conspiracies and threats, but none are well drawn.Shucks, this is turning into an ordinary comment. Here's something interesting: there's a long tradition of actors playing characters who are acting. One branch on the tree of this tradition is characters with new faces or bodies. Normally, we get some self-referential comment about acting that sometimes is a special event. There's none of that here, none. Its as if the new face was simply a disguise, not a confusing new persona. A good actor would see this opportunity and fill it regardless of the cluenesses of the director.Watching Bacall and Bogart fumble about with their lines, shows you just how profoundly weak and inflexible they are outside their "box."Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, but flawed, Bogart-Bacall murder-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intriguing, but flawed, Bogart-Bacall murder-drama.A convicted murderer, Vincent Parry (played by Humphrey Bogart), breaks out of prison. He had been wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife. Along the way he is helped by young woman, Irene Jansen (played by Lauren Bacall) who is convinced of his innocence. Soon he has to make a decision between leaving the city or staying around to find out who the real murderer is. And his troubles are just beginning...Intriguing drama. From the word go, when all we see of Bogart's character is shadows or first-person views (why becomes apparent after a while), there is an air of mystery and suspense. Not perfect though. The plot is not watertight. The chance meeting that sets up everything is just so implausible. Many other plot developments, including the climactic scene, are implausible and/or contrived.Can't fault the acting though. Bogart and Bacall are great (as expected) and the supporting cast give solid performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful adaptation of the David Goodis novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Dark Passage about fifteen years ago and had not remembered much about it, but I recently became interested in the fiction of David Goodis. After reading the novel Dark Passage, I decided to give the film adaptation another chance. I was surprised by how faithful the film was to the Goodis source novel.Either the Production Code or the studio insisted on a few changes. Bob and Madge are turned, rather illogically, into a bickering, engaged couple instead of an estranged, married one. I suppose someone did not like the idea of Lauren Bacall's character dating (albeit, casually) a married man. In addition, Vincent's hallucinations during his surgery have been altered, so they no longer provide a clue to the killer's identity (they should have been dropped altogether). Finally, the film adds a final passage to the Goodis story to provide a slightly more optimistic ending (similar to what Shawshank Redemption added to "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption").Having acknowledged all of that, I am surprised by how much of Goodis's book remains. Goodis is a novelist of characters. Perhaps, then, I should not be surprised that the best scenes deal with supporting characters. The great scene between Vincent and the cabbie is almost verbatim from the book. Some might think that the scene stops the story, but it is a small, perfect sequence in both book and film (great playing between Bogart and Tom D'Andrea in that scene). The portrayal of Dr. Coley by Houseley Stevenson is dead on. The plastic surgeon may be world weary, but he has his own code of ethics. Finally, there is that great scene where Vincent with his new face calls on Madge Rapf (a perfect Agnes Moorehead). It's the one scene in the film that needed to be in color to highlight the orange motif, even if the dialogue is pure noir.This last example also highlights the film's one, big weakness. I know this is a minority opinion, but, I don't particularly like Lauren Bacall. Despite the fact that she and Bogart were a couple, I believe that Bogart had more screen chemistry with Ingrid Bergman (Casablanca), Mary Astor (The Maltese Falcon), Gloria Grahame (In a Lonely Place), and Ida Lupino (High Sierra). Meanwhile, Bacall has always struck me as a rather cold presence. I simply do not know what this Vincent would see in this Irene. By contrast, that scene between Vincent and Madge, where he is pumping her for information as she is contemplating a pumping of a different kind, is smoldering with sexual tension. Of course, in Vincent's case the tension is an act, but there is still more heat with Madge (act or not) than in any of the scenes with Irene.Lauren Bacall aside, Dark Passage is a good film. The film uses the San Francisco locations nicely. The film was daring in having Vincent's face being impossible to see for the first half (before he becomes Bogart). Lastly, there are those great characters brought to life by wonderful character actors. Of the three David Goodis's novels I have read, Dark Passage is probably my least favorite, even though it is a good read with great parts. The film adaptation of Dark Passage is as good as the novel. How often can one say that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Without a Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Passage" is an example of how a gimmick can work wonders.Humphrey Bogart plays an escaped con who was wrongfully accused of murdering his wife -- of course he was wrongfully accused....he's Bogie! To evade the law, he enlists the help of a shady plastic surgeon to give him a new face. While he's waiting for his face to heal, he's nursed by none other than Lauren Bacall, fetching as hell as a do-gooder who wants to help him because her own father was similarly wrongfully accused of a crime. The gimmick is that we don't see Bogie's face for the first half of the movie. Much of the film is shot in first-person perspective except for the occasional establishing shot. Once his face is in bandages, the film switches to a more omniscient perspective, but we still don't get a glimpse of that hang-dog mug until the bandages come off.After Bogie becomes Bogie again, he sets out to solve the mystery of his wife's true murderer, which brings Agnes Moorehead into the picture, absolutely sensational as a shrill harridan with whom Bogie has some history. Moorehead steals the picture simply by being on the screen, a considerable feat given the screen presence of Bogie and the visual sizzle of Bacall.The first half of "Dark Passage" is effectively eerie; the first-person camera work really adds to the atmosphere, and Bogart's bandaged visage lends a creepiness to things. The second half is more conventional in terms of filmmaking, but by then the engaging plot and the presence of Moorehead have successfully filled in for what the film loses in visual interest."Dark Passage" is a real winner.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and gripping yarn in which the camera sees through Bogart's eyes and only hear his voice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absorbing and worthy suspense film about killings , entangled relationships and dark secrets , dealing with an inmate who escapes from San Quentin (San Francisco) to prove he was framed for the murder of his spouse . A man convicted (Humphrey Bogart as an escaped convict and for the first 40 minutes you don't see the star , only hear his voice) wrongly jailed of murdering his wife breaks out of prison and works with a woman to try and prove his innocence . He undergoes plastic surgery and it is only after when the camera turns on his new face ; he is subsequently aided and hidden by a beautiful girl (Lauren Bacall in an ordinary glamorous character as a valiant woman who hides him from the authorities , her scenes with Bogart are delightful), as he tries to find the real murderous . And , if you don't know the story , you'll be hard put to unravel its solution .This first-rate but slow-paced picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama and emotion . Twisted film Noir about murders , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets ; being based on the novel by David Goodis also titled "Dark Passage¨ and screen-written by the same director ; though stars can quite compensate for some far-fetched moments . It has a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Exciting as well as rare film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by Sid Hickox and magnificent musical score by Franz Waxman . This is pure cinema from the first to the last shot, where there's nothing left and each image has its sense and meaning . Perhaps the most unusual adaptation on Noir Film , this results to be a tough and tortuous thriller . Additionaly , the subjective camera record Humphrey's impressions while he listens to people talk . A neat cinematic trick that was utilized to equally nice effect a year later in ¨Lady in the lake¨ with Robert Montgomery . Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever , his scenes with Lauren Bacall are awesome though underplayed compared to those they shared in The Big sleep and To have and to have not . Supporting cast is frankly well , such as Agnes Morehead who overacts shrilly , Bruce Bennett and Clifton Young . The motion picture produced in enough budget by Jack L. Warner and Jerry Wald was well directed by Delmer Daves . Daves employs the highly original and brilliantly successful device of telling the tale entirely in the first person through the eyes of the principal role who is rarely seen except in bandages . Nice work by Delmer Daves in demonstrating his skill at all areas : as technical , using all kind of resources for illustrating the interesting as well as dramatic story with an engaging screenplay , adding great actors , attractive filmmaking and enjoyable narration . Daves was a Western expert , including his characteristic use of landscape , for the reason he lived a long time of his boyhood with the Navajo and Hopi Indian tribes as he realized the notorious trail-blazing ¨Broken arrow¨ the first movie for many years not treat the Indians as cannon-fodder for the cavalry , which made the picture unpopular in some quarters . He went on directing the suspenseful ¨3:10 to Yuma¨, other pro-Indian as ¨The last wagon¨ and about Modoc Indians as ¨Drum beat¨ , the Shakespearian style of ¨Jubal¨ , ¨Return of the Texan¨ and ¨Cowboy¨ which a fairly spectacle about a long cattle drive . From 1959 Delmer Daves becomes embroiled for the remainder of his career with teenage love epics and very popular films but so-so direction at the Box-office successes as ¨A summer place¨, ¨Parrish¨, ¨Susan Slade¨, and ¨Rome adventure¨, among others . And of course , he realized Noir films such as ¨The red House¨ and this ¨Dark passage¨ that is absolutely recommended . Rating : Above average , it is a nice tale with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>many crashes in the dark passage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of the good cinematography, Humphrey Bogart &amp; Lauren Bacall, "Dark Passage" succumbs to a weak plot - too many coincidences and hitches.Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart) runs away from the San Quentin State Prison. He's on the road to hitch a ride and he must be out of the area quickly before the police start searching for him. He is picked up by a woman (Lauren Bacall) who knows his name and more about him. She wants to help him. As he said: "I don't get you". We also don't understand it. Mystery! But it's all right, puzzles are welcome. My interest was raised.But the script was written in order to keep up a continuous interest - characters are linked together without any concern for logic, people behave in a way that only a script-writer could imagine and so on. After a while the story ceased to interest me and I followed the images and Bogart &amp; Bacall instead. That for me was good enough. Anyway the camera work is interesting, especially in the beginning when we see the action through the eyes of Vincent Parry.If you don't care too much about logic the film will surely entertain you. But I think that after a very interesting beginning (let's say the first 30 minutes) the film goes a bit down. The story goes on with its own logic till the amazing happy ending. The producers wanted to satisfy the public and I think they reached their aim at the time. This was Hollywood after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of plot devices are crammed into this enthralling mystery movie. A prison break, plastic surgery, blackmail, and even a love story spill forth in this 106 minute film. We don't even get to see Bogart until an hour passes, but we ARE Bogart's character up until this point. DARK PASSAGE uses a gimmick, the 1st hand point-of-view, to enter a supposed killer's world, one he broke out of prison to obtain. Only a shady shape is seen from the other actor's perspectives. Actors talk to the camera, an aspect that would later find its way into the films of Jonathan Demme, Cameron Crowe, and even Stanley Kubrick. The picture is by no means a groundbreaker. It is yet another good film-noir. How can you go wrong with Bogie and Bacall in black and white?If you think about this movie deep enough, you might come up with a theory that THE FUGITIVE was loosely based on it. A man is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife, escapes, and attempts to find the real killer. Again, I say loosely, but both films are that outlandish in plot. It is ironic that Harrison Ford starred as the accused doctor, considering he is often called the Bogart of today's Hollywood. Only the plastic surgeon adds the extra element of implausibility. This is good stuff, however. The surgery scene is quite demented. Bogie goes under the knife and sees (or imagines) multiple dissolves and triple exposures of the odd doctor, with a distant Bacall at the center. Its a nightmarish sequence, something out of Hitchcock.Most video guides tend to put this flick down and say it is average at best. Don't take their word for it. Its a multi-layered enigma of that great era of filmmaking: the dark 40's. Look for a good performance by the mother of 'Charles Foster Kane', Agnes Moorehead. Her scene with Bogie is a shocker. Well worth renting.RATING: 7 1/2 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By most objective standards this film would not stand out. It's more like a stage play than a film, with only a few scenes that take place with actual extras. It is sort of one-note. If you buy into the "innocent guy who escaped from prison" bit, it is, at best, interesting. If you are waiting for the other shoe to drop, it never does. It has all the earmarks of a film noire without any of the kick, like champagne that left out too long. And the tricky bit at the beginning with the "POV CAMERA" seems so shallow you might think it was done to save on makeup, as much as to advance the story.That's the bad news.If you a fan, well, pal, wake up and smell the bacon because it is Christmas morning. Bogey and Baby. Bogey and Baby. Bogey and Baby.Bacall delivers entire scenes with her eyes and cheekbones. Bogey (especially when he is wrapped in bandages), or doing that POV nonsense, delivers entire scenes with that one-in-a-million Bogey voice.The backgrounds for the scenes here would not have raised an eyebrow at the time, but for students of film they are the motherlode. A Rococco style apartment so high up you could lose 40 pounds in the walk alone. A diner that looks like it could fit in your garage, where the fry cook just wants to know how you like your eggs. And an old jalopy (that oddly is part of the story arc) which can't get above 30 mph.And a plastic surgeon at the end of a back alley who gives a 10 minute performance that will creep you out for weeks.Wow. Fire up the Wayback Machine, Mr. Peabody. We're going on a trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wary Bogart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director, Delmer Daves, has been described as a "dreary" artist but I'm not sure why. There's a lot of schlock on his curriculum vitae but his first feature, "Destination Tokyo," was a slam-bang, no-nonsense Warner Brothers war story. And in "The Pride of the Marines", there was not only some powerful dialog ("Get 'em in the EYES, Lee.") along with the preaching, but some unexpected and effective photographic tricks involving a John Garfield's blindness and what I consider one of the most dramatic and effective scenes of combat ever put on film.The dialog here lacks sparkle but there is plenty of visual legerdemain. Vincent Parry, unjustly convicted of murder, escapes from prison in a barrel. The barrel rolls off the truck bed and down a hill. And the camera gives us Parry's point of view, spinning round and round until the barrel finally comes to a halt.With the help of a friendly cab driver, Parry finds a shady doctor willing to alter his face. When the still-unseen Parry is under anesthesia, there are multiple images of the doctor and his scalpel, with the doc's voice echoing one of his pre-op jokes, "I COULD make you look like a bulldog -- or a MONKEY." The doc's face is marvelous, reassuring with a hint of the demon in it.However -- forget the doctor's face and concentrate on Lauren Bacall's instead. She's the very rich art student who picks up Parry, whose head is now all bandaged up, and takes him to her home to recover. This happens to me all the time. When she finally "unveils" him, he ought to look like he's just gone ten rounds with Mike Tyson. Instead, he looks exactly like the Humphrey Bogart we've all come to know and love, except he needs a shave.Do Bogart and Bacall fall for each other? Does a baby-face small-time crook find Bogie and try to blackmail rich Bacall through him? Does Bogart take care of that baby-faced, small-time crook good? Is Agnes Moorehead the villain of the piece? Does Agnes Moorehead confess to everything before she "stumbles and falls out the window"? Do Bogart and Bacall get together in a small Peruvian town on the ocean at the end, with the night club band playing their song, "Too Marvelous For Words"? No power on earth could drag the answers from me.But except for Clifton Young as the blackmailer and Agnes Moorehead as the venomous narcissist, these are mostly restrained performances. Bogart is not the cocky smart guy of his earlier films. He's wary, vigilant, and he should be -- in this movie there seems to be a cop on every corner and in every coffee shop just waiting for him to make a slip of the tongue about racing at Bay Meadows, where I once took a very pretty young girl named Helene to a dance, or about the price of AT&amp;T stock. He's afraid. He's very afraid. Not only for himself, of course, but for the wide-eyed and sensual Bacall. When that slimy, buck-toothed extortionist holds a gun on him, Bogart looks positively scared. It's nothing like the gunsel Wilmer pulling a pistol on him in "The Maltese Falcon." Together, though, Bogart and Bacall seem quite relaxed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bogart's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is, to me, one of Bogart's best movies, Agnes Moorehead almost steals the show with her eccentric (and excellent) performance. She is definitely someone you don't want to know. Her references to the color orange make you long to see this movie in color. Bogart masterfully deceives the old witch to find out who killed his wife - a crime he had been serving time for. Moorehead's response is stunning. Bacall swoons for Bogart before he knows who she is, but it is the beginning of the film - when we don't see his face - that she does her best acting. Even though I own the DVD, I still watch this movie on television as often as I can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart, Bacall reunite in Delmer Daves' durable San Francisco noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Jim Thompson, David Goodis stood in that second tier of hard-boiled writers whose work would generate several titles in the noir cycle and its aftermath: The Unfaithful, Nightfall, The Burglar, Street of No Return, and Dark Passage. In this last, Delmer Daves wrote the passably tight script (a few holes remain undarned), which he then directed, resulting in one of the more memorable San Francisco noirs.We open on an oil barrel teetering around on the back of a truck. A pair of hands on the rim (from within) indicate that its occupant is trying to dislodge his container from its berth, which he does, as well he might, as he's an escapee from San Quentin, in for murdering his wife three years ago. We know from the iconic voice, with its wisp of an impediment, that it's Humphrey Bogart, but we don't get a glimpse of him for quite a while. Fired up by the dubious "subjective camera" technique of the Robert Montgomery's recently released The Lady in the Lake, Daves, too, casts the camera as his main character's eyes. Luckily, he's inconsistent in using this conceit, and once Bogart gets a face job, that's the end of it, and not a second too soon.After hitching a ride with too inquisitive a driver (Clifton Young), whom he pummels into silence, Bogart is picked up by Lauren Bacall, who seems to know all about him and whisks him back to her moderne two-floor apartment in the city (the lighted elevator glides up and down a glass-brick column; the building, by the way, still stands). Bacall took an interest in his case since her own father was wrongly executed for murder (in the newspaper clipping she keeps, Daves' photograph does service for Dad). What's more, she travels in the same ritzy circles as did Bogart and his defunct wife, and do viperish Agnes Moorehead and coveted man-about-the-town Bruce Bennett.Bacall sequesters Bogart as long as she can in her more than comfortable digs, what with a well-stocked liquor cabinet, home-cooked dinners by candlelight and Jo Stafford styling torchy numbers from the radio. But comes the time when Bogart must exchange his mug for a less recognizable one, and the movie must go down the mean streets of film noir. Young's distinctive convertible jalopy parked outside is the first clue that's something's amiss, but Bogart takes heart from good-hearted cabbie Tom D'Andrea, who not only drives him to the spartan rooms of his best friend, a jazz trumpeter (Rory Mallinson), but who just happens to know an unlicensed sawbones who specializes in $200 plastic surgeries. Bogart plans to stay with Mallinson for his week of recuperation, but finds him dead, bludgeoned with his own trumpet. Bandaged up like The Invisible Man, he makes his way back to Bacall's layout, determined to smoke out his wife's killer....Despite jumping rather impulsively from one plot strand to the next, Dark Passage keeps up a not-so-slack pulse of tension. Daves works up a few evocative and suggestive sequences. Houseley Stevenson delivers toothsome little character study (sinister? Benevolent?) of the back-alley surgeon, and when Bogart strikes out on his own, wanting little more than eggs-over-easy at a diner, he's spotted by a police detective who comes on like a Gestapo agent ? it's a neat way of expressing the vulnerability that Bogart thinks even his new visage can't disguise.Dark Passage is far from flawless. In their third major screen pairing (Two Guys From Milwaukee is best overlooked), off-screen couple Bogart and Bacall fail to generate the playful erotic spark that Howard Hawks coaxed out of them in To Have And Have Not and The Big Sleep; granted, Dark Passage is plenty shy of playfulness. Worse, the various strands of the story often come across as episodic, unconnected; Daves (or Goodis) doesn't weave the tenuous but tough web of murky connections that a Raymond Chandler could. Still, as one of Daves' better efforts, it still holds up ? and it's fascinating to watch that elevator slide up and down its crystal sheath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expect a solid film noir with a camera twist and a straight-up Bogart, and it'll work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Passage (1947)If you don't swoon over Bogart kissing Bacall (they are like dry ice on screen, whatever their hype at the time of their affair and marriage), the real fascination here in the first half of the film is its point of view. Bogart's face is in bandages, and most of the time the camera is shooting from inside his eyes--true subjective camera. In fact, the first ten minutes of the film are a fascinating, pre-Steadicam kind of fluid cinema as he escapes from prison, with long sweeping (and sometimes jerking) takes from the point of view of a man on the run. The 55 gallon drum on the truck stars in the first minute--watch the hands around the rim, as it starts tipping tipping tipping, and then wham!The plot overall is a kind of film noir twist, for sure, and it has some unlikely villains (watch for the man driving the car) and a likely but improbably heroine (yes, her). This might strain credulity, but it makes for a surprising plot at times. If it flags once or twice (like the driving around in one scene), just blink and swallow and enjoy the scenery--the location shooting in San Francisco, above all. Though Humphrey Bogart was a huge draw and Lauren Bacall certainly a tagalong attraction, the filming itself seems relatively low budget, not just from the many shots made out of the studio, but even by having so many scenes of just Bogart's hands, or the relatively simple special effects required. There are a few odd cuts but then there are plenty of exciting angles and close-up dramatic views. In that sense, it feels more like an underground noir film than it is, and it's really a lot of fun. That Bogart is innocent we rarely doubt (that is no spoiler), especially with Agnes Moorehead loitering as an unusual kind of villain, not a femme fatale in any ordinary sense, but fatal all the same. It might be Bacall who holds the core of the film together, and her cool sureness and sometimes coy smile are like sniffs of a good brandy. Assuming Bogart is the hard stuff itself, almost literally a stiff drink once his bandages come off.No one says this is a great film by any means, but it has innovations, and it isn't a clunker--the lighting and pace of editing are right on, and the photography worthy of the subject. See it as part of the Bogart lineage, or as a necessary film noir a year after Robert Montgomery's more awkward but still intriguing "Lady in the Lake" (with subjective camera all the way through, which wears thin). If director Delmer Daves is more writer than director (he is both here), he did earlier in his career pull off a reasonable Cary Grant effort that gets watched a lot ("Destination Tokyo", a war film made during the war) and the now-famous first version of "3:10 to Yuma". Those two might get your expectations in line, and let you really enjoy this one for what it is.And what is it? A novelty noir, with a few terrific side characters (the doctor is a precursor to the insense eye surgeon in "Minority Report") and with some decent writing. Definitely worth a good look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Point-of-view photography: great art or movie gimmick?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tough, gleaming black-and-white noir has Humphrey Bogart portraying an escaped convict in San Francisco who is helped by a well-meaning girl played by Lauren Bacall, Bogart's new bride in real-life. The cinematography by Sid Hickox is vivid throughout, though his first thirty minutes are used as POV photography from Bogart's eyes, and it's a tricky but ultimately taxing maneuver cinematically (awaiting Bogart's elongated emergence, we have too much time to gaze at Bacall playing nursemaid, her nostrils flexing, her hair and attire perfectly in order). The slim story would surely take a backseat to the star-duo if they were allowed to actually emote, but this script puts the squeeze on them right from the start (where Bacall comes in makes little sense, and her romantic involvement with Bogie is a puzzler; it's left up to the viewer to decide since the script is busy exhausting itself trying to make everybody in the cast fit into the puzzle). The locations are fun (and that's a dandy elevator up to Bacall's luxurious apartment), Agnes Moorehead has a great time as a shrike, but the other characters are negligible. There's a big scene where Bogart gets pulled away from his breakfast by a cop that goes nowhere, and the ending is a little too breezy for a glowering drama like this. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as Goodis got</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two movies teaming Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were based on novels by heavyweight authors Ernest Hemingway ("To Have and Have Not") and Raymond Chandler ("The Big Sleep"). This third match-up, from 1947, is a film-noir venture based on a novel called "Dark Passage" by a lesser-known American writer named David Goodis. A glance at the book shows that it is packed with noir ingredients: homicide, double-dealing, revenge, two mysterious women?one virtuous and one deadly?and another element that often turned up in crime fiction of the day, plastic surgery. Here the main character, Vincent Parry (Bogart), is a man who has been wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife. He escapes from San Quentin and is taken in tow by a beautiful woman named Irene Jansen (Bacall) who appears out of nowhere to give him shelter and help clear his name while he recovers from surgery intended to disguise his identity. Naturally they fall in love. Most of what happens during the film's 106 minutes is hooey, but it is entertaining hooey. The Warner Brothers production, with screenplay and direction by Delmer Daves, invites us to ignore the story's implausibility and enjoy an exciting ride. While some film critics have called "Dark Passage" a failure, I would be somewhat more charitable. The story is far-fetched, but many of its weaknesses are redeemed by the presence of the two stars. Bogart and Bacall work so well together that I wouldn't mind watching them do a dog-food commercial. There is a dog (substitute the B-word) in this movie?a character named Madge Rapf. She is played by Agnes Moorehead, who turns her supporting role into a tour-de-force. Bruce Bennett plays Bob, Irene's ex-boyfriend; and Tom D'Andrea, Clifton Young and Houseley Stevenson are admirable in small but important roles. A song called "Too Marvelous for Words" is heard throughout the film, but it doesn't function as well as the title song in "Laura" or?how could it??"As Time Goes By" in "Casablanca." "Dark Passage" takes place mostly in San Francisco and is shot mainly at night, enabling art director Charles H. Clarke and cinematographer Tom Hickox to create a mood that is by turns menacing and hair-raising. At the end the setting switches abruptly to South America, where Vincent is again on the lam. A short scene reunites the lovers, and the screen glows with sentiment as a nightclub band plays "Too Marvelous for Words," but Goodis did not include this scene in his book. His novel ends with Vincent asking Irene to join him south of the border at a future date, and the reader is left wondering if she actually will. More about David Goodis: he belonged to that unhappy breed of writers who have early success and then descend into alcoholism or some other mode of self-destruction. After "Dark Passage"?his second novel?Goodis's life gradually deteriorated, but he published 16 more suspense novels before dying in 1967 at the age of 50. In 1960 his "Down There" was transformed by director François Truffaut into a film called "Shoot the Piano Player."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting But Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this movie a while ago and although I thought the film was unintentionally funny in several parts and that there were a lot of bizare and outlandish happenings, I found it oddly compelling and pretty entertaining. On the plus side was the cool first person camera work. Though it was also seen in LADY IN THE LAKE, this type of filming always interests me. The San Francisco locations also gave the film a nice air of authenticity. The biggest plus of course is the Bogart/Becall team. The chemistry and the heat is quite obvious and Bogie comes off as charming while Becall sizzles with her "innocent" sexiness. Some things just had me shaking my head in amazement though and chuckling a little to myself. I mean, Bogart just gets into this cab and right away, the cabbie knows people because he studies faces and immediately he knows Bogart is the prison escapee even though his face is completely covered in darkness!! And just like that, the cabbie happens to know this doctor who performs facelifts and on and on it went. I mean, Bogie just happened to get into the right cab at the right time in a huge metropolis! Timing is everything I guess. And how about the cop at the diner? Just because Bogart didn't realize a certain race track was closed and because he wasn't wearing a raincoat, he was automatically a suspect who needed to go down to headquarters even though he looked nothing like his old self??? Wow! And don't get me started on Bogie's final confrontation with Agnes Moorehead! Anyway, there was still something about the film that kept me entertained and interested to the end but all in all, DARK PASSAGE in not a great film and I prefer something like THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love The Darker Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man (Humphrey Bogart) convicted of murdering his wife escapes from prison and works with a woman (Lauren Bacall) to try and prove his innocence.The film is notable for employing cinematography that avoided showing the face of Bogart's character, Vincent Parry, prior to the point in the story at which Vincent undergoes plastic surgery to change his appearance. This first person view is so rare, it is quite powerful, predating the "found footage" BS we have today (2016) and reminiscent of such things as a certain Prodigy music video.Reviewers at the time pointed out that one of the best things about the film is the San Francisco setting. And I have to agree with that. As much as this is a noir film, it seems to me the best place for noir has always been and will always be San Francisco. I mean, as a Wisconsinite, I would love to see a Milwaukee noir, but that's just not realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man With Bogart's Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Passage is one of the more experimental movies of Hollywood's golden age, with majority of the film's first third being filmed from the first person point of view of Humphrey Bogart's character. I never thought a black &amp; white movie from the 1940's would remind me of a modern video game. I would like to see more films which experiment with this point of view style. MGM's Lady In the Lake (also released in 1947) was filmed in POV for the entire film, which the studio promoted by claiming the POV style was the most revolutionary style of film since the introduction of the talkies. Nope, it didn't catch on. The use of POV took me of guard at first, as I wanted to watch some Bogart but I did not get to see him on screen. Bogart's distinctive voice alone though helps carry the picture, thanks in part to his many witty remarks. We're then given a section of the movie in which Bogart doesn't talk and is wrapped in bandages, looking like a horror movie character (these scenes also make me squeamish). Considering we have to wait a whole hour until we finally see and hear Bogart in his entirely, makes Dark Passage nothing short of a daring role.For the plot you do need to suspend your disbelief at the number of highly improbable coincidences. Irene (Bacall) just happens to be out painting near San Quentin on the day Vincent Parry (Bogart), the man she has an obsession with escapes and she knows where to find him. Oh, and she also happens to be friends with Madge (Agnes Moorehead), who gave false testimony in court against Parry that he murdered his wife. I find it is easy however to just roll along with the ridiculous plot as the movie plays out like a dream, culminating in the satisfaction of seeing Bogart get his revenge on Agnes Moorehead (a useless old bag and real love to hate character), and seeing these two characters getting their happily ever after, together in South America. One minor complaint I have is the reveal of Frank Parry's face on the newspaper, prior to getting plastic surgery; because the character doesn't actually have Bogart's face, I would have preferred the mystery of not knowing what he looks like. Also, a plastic surgeon who can give you the face of Humphrey Bogart? Someone should have told Woody Allen that in Play It Again Sam. Dark Passage in part sees the return of gangster Bogart, but still has the romantic elements of his on screen persona which he developed after achieving stardom. Right from the very beginning we're in classic gangster territory, a prisoner escaping from San Quentin, the type of setting not seen in a Bogart film since High Sierra. The on location filming in San Francisco also really adds to the film, giving you a sense of the world the movie inhabits; and Irene's apartment with the two floors and the art deco designs, I want it!I once said 'All Through the Night' was the most Hitchcockian film Bogart starred in. But Dark Passage wouldn't be far behind it. We get the innocent man falsely accused on the run while trying to prove his innocence. The focusing on landmarks (the Golden Gate Bridge), while the San Francisco setting has some Vertigo vibes. The trippy plastic surgery sequence feels reminiscent of the Salvador Dali dream sequence in Spellbound; while Madge's death rings a bell of the character death shots in Vertigo in which someone falls from a great distance.When attempting to review a movie, I can't always predict how much I will have to say about it. Occasionally though you get movies like Dark Passage, which have layers and layers of fascinating details worth talking about. Dark passage is my favourite Bogart &amp; Bacall film, although to be honest I was never a huge fan of their partnership. To Have and Have Not bored me, and The Big Sleep was well, a big sleep. Plus I never fully got the appeal of Lauren Bacall; she never struck me as a massively interesting screen presence. I find Bacall plays a much more interesting character than in the previous two Bogie &amp; Bacall pairings. Not a vamp, but a lonely single woman who purses painting as a hobby. During the first kiss between Bogart and Bacall, I had the reaction of "Ok, now I'm getting it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart &amp; Bacall Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Passage" stars Bogart and Bacall in a classic cinema noir story about a man (Bogart) who escapes prison to prove his innocence of the murder of his wife. The entire film follows Bogart. Almost the entire first part of the film is filmed from his perspective. Eventually, he realizes he is too recognizable, so he undergoes facial surgery to modify his looks. When his new face is revealed, it is Bogart's face.Bogart finds an ally in Bacall's character, who feels that he is innocent. She assists him in eluding the police. However, it seems wherever he turns, he runs into another threat.I love the cinematography. The San Francisco surroundings provide great scenery. The score is also marvelous. The supporting characters are noirish--not exactly caricatures or comic bookish, but quirky and memorable. Other posters have noted a Hitchcockian style, justifiably so. The similarities are impossible to ignore. And, like "Rear Window", our protagonist is partially disabled and has to rely upon the help of his beautiful accomplice. I find "Dark Passage" to be enjoyable primarily due to the ending, however, which is satisfying. I can overlook the coincidences in the story. The only thing that distracted me from immersion in the plot is the method of demise of one character, which I won't detail here.This is a noir classic and, as part of the Bogie/Bacall filmography, it is a cinemaphile's must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For its first two thirds, this movie is filmed in first person perspective, as the story's main character, Bogart, escapes from prison after being wrongly convicted of killing his wife, and hides out with a "fan", played by Bacall. Later undergoing plastic surgery, aided further in his recovery and search for his wife's killer by Bacall, who curiously disappears in later scenes.The effect of showing 60% of the film in first person perspective is effective to an extent, but is negated by the fact that by now, everyone knows what Bogart looked like, so his reveal holds no suspense. As good an actor as he was, perhaps casting an unknown actor in the role might have helped build suspense more?

		<shortDescription>Improbable, but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, as a lot of posters have already noted, there are a lot of improbable situations that pop up in this film and all of them work to the main character's advantage. As unrealistic as that is, it is what it is and no amount of complaining will change it.That being said, this is still a wonderful example of the noir genre for several reasons. The way the San Francisco locale is used so that the city itself is a character in the film, the terrific performances of the supporting cast, especially Agnes Moorehead, and the settings and costumes give the film a distinctive look that few films, noir or otherwise can match. This was the third pairing of Bogart and Bacall and by now their legions of fans were willing to forgive a few plot contrivances in order to watch the glamorous pair at work. Lauren Bacall as beautiful artist Irene Jansen glows every time the camera is on her. Although this is far from Mr. Bogart's best work, even his mediocre is better than a lot of actors' best. The real reason to watch is Agnes Moorehead as Madge Rapf, the jealous, vindictive, ex girlfriend of Vincent Parry, Bogart's character. She's the one that framed him and she's not through doing nasty things ,as we find out as the film progresses. She is magnificent as a truly vicious woman that will stop at nothing to get what and who she wants. Woe to anyone that gets in this dame's way! A word about the sets and wardrobe. As mentioned earlier in this review, San Francisco, its neighborhoods, landmarks and general atmosphere are used to full advantage in a way that was rare in the 1940's, as most studios preferred to do everything on a sound stage and backlots rather than shoot on location. 1947 was actually a big year for location shooting as Naked City was filmed entirely in New York City that same year. The wardrobe for this picture was wonderful as well. Watch Madge as she shows up unannounced at Irene's apartment, dressed to the nines in a leopard print dress with a matching hat. No question she was on the prowl. Of course, Ms.Bacall is stunning in every frame whether wearing a satin jacket and flowing pants or a casual plaid jacket and woolen slacks. Her experience as a model served her and her costumers well . The other supporting players were fantastic here as well, especially Tom D' Andrea as the cabbie that puts Vincent in touch with the plastic surgeon. All in all, this is a very good film, even if some of the plot contrivances are a bit unbelievable.</fullReview>

He first gets a back-room face-lift to alter his appearance from the police, then changes his name to Alan Linell. Later, he makes contact with sympathetic artist Irene Jansen(played by Lauren Bacall) who hides him from the police, and aids him in his efforts to find the true murderer, and clear his name. Film starts out from Bogart's POV, seen from his eyes, until his bandages are taken off and we finally see Bogart about an hour into the film!

		<fullReview>This is a good movie which features an interesting performance by Humphrey Bogart. The first part of the story is told in the first person through Bogart's character, which is heard but not seen for reasons that have to do with the plot. This device works well to heighten the tension. However, once Bogart's character is seen, the movie loses its uniqueness and becomes a conventional crime drama with an ending that is anticlimactic. Lauren Bacall is charming as the Bogart's love interest. It is too bad that the director did not stay with telling the story from the first-person point of view. The plot itself tests the limits of credibility as it includes scenes that simply are not believable. Also, that Bogart's character is not vindicated is another flaw which leaves the story with loose ends. That is, the question of the guilt or innocence of Bogart's character is not conclusively reduced. Agnes Moorhead is especially effective in a supportive role. This movie is worth watching as an example of first-person story-telling and a sample of the film-noir genre that was popular at the time of this movie's release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd still give the movie 8 out of 10, but I found it a bit disappointing in its full-length version that is now available on an excellent Warner Video DVD. One of the problems is that none of the characters are particularly credible or even sympathetic. Another drawback is that the plot seems to lose its momentum and its hold on our attention about halfway through. The author starts to introduce characters that he has obvious problems getting rid of. What's worse, I found the final plot resolution most unsatisfactory ? particularly from the point of view of audience involvement and sympathy. All the same, the first half of the movie with its remarkable first person camera, its nightmare montage, its fascinatingly seedy characters and its dark underworld mise-en-scene certainly ranks amongst director Delmer Dave's finest work. And of course it's an absolute must for both Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall fans. Photographer Sid Hickox should have been nominated for an award, but despite his lengthy movie and TV career, 1916 through 1971, with no less than 166 titles to his credit, he was never so much as nominated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine noir where we don't see the protagonist's face for an hour!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Vincent Perry, a man convicted of the murder of his wife, escapes from San Quentin Prison he is surprised when a woman, named Irene Jansen, helps him get to San Francisco despite the fact that she knows who he is. It turns out that she didn't only hear about his escape on the radio; she had attended his trial and believed he was being treated unfairly. With his face on every paper he can't stay in the city long; indeed when he catches a cab the driver recognises him; but rather than turn Vincent in he takes him to a plastic surgeon. Vincent intends to recover at a friend's house but is shocked to find him dead? which leads to the police thinking he has killed again. With no-one left to turn to he returns to Irene's house. A week later he removes the bandages and sees a new face; that isn't the end of his problems though; he still has the same fingerprints and somebody else knows who he really is? if he is to avoid living in fear for the rest of his life he'll have to find the real killer.This might not be one of Humphrey Bogart's best known works but it is still well worth watching. As one would expect he puts in a fine performance but unexpectedly we don't see his face in the first hour. At first we only see what he sees; then we see him with his face hidden by bandages? there can't be many films that don't show the protagonist for so long; especially when he is played by such an iconic actor; it is a credit to the director that this works well rather than seeming like a cheap gimmick. Lauren Bacall is good as the friendly Irene but it is Agnes Moorehead who stands out amongst the actresses as the poisonous Madge Repf; a woman who is only happy when others are miserable. The story is fairly gripping and makes good use of its San Francisco locations without looking as if was sponsored by the tourist board. If you are a fan of Bogart's this is a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite Noir By Numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Passage" is a 1947 Warner Brothers film starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. That sentence telegraphs a few things about the film: it's a film noir with murders, betrayals and a femme fatale. A little formula isn't fatal for a film noir, since the genre is dependent on how human the archetypes can become -- is the existential hero believable? Is the femme fatale just tragic and mysterious enough to be alluring? Is the hero's faithful but ill-fated friend more than a plot device? As noir goes, "Dark Passage" is a bit too generic, but as filmmaking goes, it's a clever experiment that works more often than it fails. As a bonus, Agnes Moorehead turns in one of the most unexpected performances in cinematic history, and that alone makes "Dark Passage" worth viewing.As a man falsely convicted of killing his wife, Bogart plays a standard noir hero with a troubled past and no future. To compensate for his commonness, director Delver Daves shoots most of the first part of the film from Bogart's perspective, which, as a choice, turns out to be more of a gimmick than a thematic choice but the early scene of being in an oil drum rolling down hill is pretty cool anyway. The movie is, naturally, concerned with finding out who murdered Bogart's wife, and the plot is a little muddled and weighted down with too many expository scenes. (Howard Hawks had just directed Bogie &amp; Bacall in "The Big Sleep" and demonstrated that the more complicated the plot, the less important the exposition. I guess Daves didn't pay attention.) Bacall shows up as Bogart's helpmate, there are creepy supporting characters speaking strange monologues (another noir trademark), and enough weak but interesting men to keep the plot moving forward. But aside from the camera work, the most remarkable thing about "Dark Passage" is the casting of Agnes Moorehead as the de riguer evil woman. Sure, we can all know that Ag can play a domineering rhymes-with-witch, but who thought she could play a sexually voracious one? Her character of Madge is never fully explained, but seems to be an annoying rich woman whom everyone must tolerate because of her social position. To be bearable, Madge must be attractive in some way, and since the stately Ms. Moorehead exudes all the smoldering sensuality of a Mother Superior, she has to act sexy, which she's just talented enough to do. You've seen in "Citizen Kane," "The Twilight Zone" and "Bewitched," but you've never seen her like this. Check her out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Passage, a new character for Bogart?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To enjoy this film, one must be able to suspend disbelief. The picture begins, Bogart escapes with sirens all around, suggesting they know he has escaped, yet they fail to note a truck with a large barrel? I think here, the audience is supposed to pay little attention, as this could be a story in itself. The story begins with Bogart narrating his own thoughts and planed moves; such that we soon become aware, he has not much a solid plan. The film is to hurry the audience to the beginning of the drama: he meets the inquiring small time burglar, then, disliking his gab and being suspicious, Bogart asks to be let out of the car and here he meets Lauren Bacall. It seems unusual to me, for Bogart to play such a vulnerable character, as well, Bacall, as Miss Jansen seems motivated only because she had a belief that Bogart was not tried fairly, yet we do get some indication of something beneath her 'mater-of-fact- exterior. There is no strong passion, yet at this time (1940s) there was many such films where passion not topical,, yet evident in actions, beguine, as well, deleterious. There was a hunger for emotional depth, which went beyond outward affections. Next scene,Bogart is picked up by the most affable and benevolent cabdriver, such as I never encountered! As many cab rides I have taken, not once was there more than banal exchange, unless he was one of the gooney ones who thought he could score with me. Not only is the cabdriver nice and accommodating, he also knows an iconoclastic plastic surgeon who lost his legal practice and is now doing surgery in his house at 3:00 AM! As I previously mentioned, this film requires suspension of disbelief; this was more common during this time than any other, as even the 1950s placed more concern on realism and this seemed to come to a peak during the 1970s. It is a matter of taste, as to how much of what seems impossible in a film based on a serious subject may be overlooked for the more interesting aspects, such being love, hate and indifference. Much of this confusion was part of what made film noir appealing at this time, meant persons were disillusioned, yet tried of the big glitzy pictures that distracted the effects in the Depression, ten years before. People had more outer security, but felt lost, after WWII. Many of these films are about alienation, the need to be needed overwhelms sensibility. We see Irene Jansen revealed as someone safe, yet alone and here he have a different Bogart, as another confused lost person who is looking for escape, yet without direction; he is not the tough detective, or arch criminal, but the victim of a cruel jealous woman, who would rather harm him if she cannot possess him; here, this character lacks the street wise wit most expect from Bogart, he is just an average man in search for redemption. He wants to find the true killer, to solve a crime and vindicate himself. Moreover, this Bogart, as Allen is hoping to find a way into the light. As the film ends, we find two unlikely characters both looking for what is darkly missing,, which is love. The picture is quite good, although too incredible for realism; the story shines though for those who appreciate something more a mystery, melodramatic film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Little Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very cool little film-noir starring Humphrey Bogart as Vincent Parry, a prisoner escapee who has been framed for the murder of his wife. With the help of a kind-hearted cab driver and disgraced surgeon he undergoes plastic surgery to conceal his identity. Now with a new face he and his lone ally Irene Jansen (Lauren Bacall), he sets out to try and clear his name.Since revisiting The Caine Mutiny (1954) earlier this years I've been sucked right in the movies of the late Hollywood giant Humphrey Bogart. With still many more to see Dark Passage is the most recent and the second I've seen out the four films in which he starring along side Lauren Bacall, the first being Key Largo.I really enjoyed this film. The first person perspective at the beginning works great. It had me glued to screen and only hearing Bogey's iconic voice it made me want to see his face so badly; which we don't until a good third of the film is over. It's shot very well; it's stylish and captures the city of San Francisco in all its breathtaking beauty. Performances are great all round with a strong cast of characters, Bacall just absolutely shines along side Bogart.A very good film if you're a fan of the genre and style of film making, and a must see if you're a fan of its two stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I like about Dark Passage is not simply the clever gimmick of using point-of-view camera-work before the plastic surgery changes the main character's face (though Bogie's inimitable voice never seems to pose an issue). It's also the story itself that is not so standard. Dark Passage is film noir, it has guns and fistfights, people wind up dead, there are heroes and villains, there are femmes fatale, there is suspense, but the story and its characters have a completely different way of completing that list than most other thrillers and old noirs. No one is a gangster or a professional killer. There is a small character who turns out to be a small-time crook who decides to make a big-time score, but he is incidental in a plot full of normal people. Bogart escapes from prison to prove that he didn't kill his wife. Bacall helps him. She's an artist. Bogart's friend is a lonely trumpet player. The femme fatale is simply a highly manipulative woman. The most interesting character is a brilliant and imposing but highly helpful cab driver.None of this makes it terribly memorable for me, though. I find Dark Passage, just as I find many older Hollywood films, to be a bit too light to leave an impression. I was not thinking about it when it was over. it only holds you over for the duration of its running time and doesn't have any residual effect. It's a bit forgettable. As a movie from 1947, it is very progressive in the cinematic techniques it uses, though the one thing that makes the film dated to the point of a small bit of laughability is the dream sequence during Bogart's unconsciousness during the plastic surgery. The surgeon is made to look as if he's some comic book mad scientist in the dream.Bogie and Bacall are very refined and wonderfully old-fashioned as the two leads, and their famously tense sharing of the screen is challenged by the unconventional film-making. Agnes Moorehead is the highlight of the cast, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stylish noir with Bogie and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in San Francisco, "Dark Passage" stars Humphrey Bogart as an escaped convict who was found guilty of killing his wife, and Lauren Bacall, as the woman who helps him. The Bogart character knows someone framed him for the murder and is desperate to get away from the police. To accomplish this, with the help of a chatty cab driver (Tom D'Andrea), he has his face changed by plastic surgery.Though Bogart's distinctive voice is present throughout, the first part of the film uses the subjective camera, a la "Lady of the Lake." In "Lady of the Lake," the camera was at all sorts of odd angles and at one point, focused on a mirror where the viewer could see the face of Robert Montgomery. In this film, the camera is less obtrusive. Either that, or because it's an icon like Bogart, the viewer pictures him even though he's not on camera. After the plastic surgery, Bogart is revealed.The plot is okay, but it's really an excuse for great chemistry between the two stars, a rich atmosphere, and some wonderful cinematography. The idea of loneliness is everywhere; it's in the bus station, it's in the isolated way that the Bacall character lives. And it's also about taking a chance and reaching out.Bogart gives a strong and honest performance, putting his strong presence to good use as he dominates the film even when only his voice is used. Bacall is at the height of her sultry beauty, with her luxurious hair framing a perfect bone structure, pouty lips, and sensuous eyes. She is absolutely fantastic to look at and listen to, and she imbues the role with vulnerability as well as a feeling of cold isolation and the loneliness she feels.The supercouple gets wonderful support from Tom D'Andrea, the Gillis of the Riley series I grew up with, Agnes Moorhead as a nasty friend of Bacall's, Bruce Bennett, and Houseley Stevenson as the excellent but borderline maniacal plastic surgeon. One almost expected thunder and lightning after he spoke.Very entertaining, highly recommended, and I loved the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Film Noir with Bogie and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrific film noir film made just after the end of WWII and starring Hollywood's biggest star, Humphrey Bogart, and the dazzling L. Bacall. This movie has all the elements of film noir. 1) a wrongly accused man (Bogart) who needs to change his identity through plastic surgery to prove his innocence. Fate seems to have dealt him a bad hand and to determine his outcome as it does in all noir movies. 2) much of the movie is set at night in the big city (San Francisco) with an especially good and tense scene set at a greasy spoon on Fillmore St. Douglas Kennedy is especially good as the threatening dick in the diner who quickly spots Bogart as out of sync (he asks for the results at Bay Meadows when that horse racing track has already been closed for a month). The uncredited Tom Fadden also superbly plays the counter clerk at the diner and his lament, "I should have kept my mouth shut" underscores the sense of doom and fate in which Bogart seems to be trapped. Fadden is the kind of character actor you can spot but never know his name. 3) maybe the most riveting performance in the entire movie comes from the terrific Agnes Moorehead who plays the femme fatale (Bogart's wife who set him up for a murder rap). She's sharp, nasty and comes to her own doom by falling out of a window in a terrific scene with Bogart. 4) Another great performance is turned in by another character actor, Clifton Young as Baker, the small time hood trying to make it into the big times. His lament, "I sure learned a lot at San Quenton; they got some real smart guys there!" even earns a smile from Bogart. Of course, he utters that line shortly before being pushed off a cliff and dying at Bogart's hands. 5) Yet another terrific performance comes from Houseley Stevenson as the sinister and near criminal plastic surgeon. He teams up with the cabbie (Tom D'Andrea) in one of the better Mutt and Jeff teams of the underworld and it is to them that Bogart has to turn for help. 6) Let's not forget Bacall. Who can? She sizzles throughout the movie and especially is hot on the telephone call near the end of the movie to Bogart. He calls from a bus depot in San Francisco while their favorite song, "Too Marvelous for Words" (lyrics by the unforgettable Johnny Mercer) can be heard in the background from the jukebox that Bogart drops some small change into.Maybe because Bogart is involved (note that in all the cases of death that he is involved with, he plays an innocent role) and Bacall, this noir has a happy ending. Again with "Too Marvelous for Words" announcing Bacall's meeting with Bogart at a small bistro on the sea in Peru.Presiding over this wonderful movie is the little known and under appreciated director and writer, Delmer Daves. He gets terrific performances from his entire cast and the movie moves along briskly and with tension (notice all the policemen lurking in the backgrounds of so many scenes and how the police are not seen as saviors but as repressive troublemakers). Daves was a native of San Francisco so it is understandable that he turned that city's beauty into one of the stars of the pic: you see Telegraph Hill, Coit Tower, cable cars turning at the foot of Powell Street and a great scene where Boggie escapes from a possible murder scene by grabbing on to a cable car plus one scene is shot at an all night diner on Fillmore and Post. Bogart too made some of his most memorable pics in San Francisco (Sam Spade). Note that as with the "appearance can be deceiving" theme with Bogart's surgery, San Francisco, the director suggests, is more than its glitter. It, and American society, has a deep undercurrent that this movie and other noirs explores. Director Daves has a string of terrific movies aside from Dark Passage and they include: The Petrified Forrest (also with Bogart; Daves was the script writer); Destination Tokyo; Broken Arrow; 3:10 to Yuma; A Summer Place; and Spencer's Mountain in a career spanning more than 4 decades in Hollywood. Daves also had a law degree from Stanford so it is interesting to see him show the legal world, including the police, as far from a benign institution. Daves also uses the "subjective technique" extremely well: we see the movie through Bogart's eyes (and his wraps from the plastic surgery) for the first hour of the movie or so. This cements the audiences sympathy with Bogart of course. All in all, this is a great movie that can be watched again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative and Quaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart) was sent to prison for the murder of his wife. When he escapes from San Quentin, he hitches a ride with a man named "Baker" (Clifton Young) but as they're driving the radio gives away Vincent's description. A fight breaks out and just when Vincent is about to kill Baker another person named "Irene Jensen" (Lauren Bacall) drives up and convinces him to get in her car. Realizing that he needs a place to hide out, he leaves Baker's unconscious body on the side of the road and goes to San Francisco with her. She then reveals that she had been following his trial with great interest and believes him to be innocent. He appreciates this but not wanting to be a burden to her he decides to leave. However, when he gets into a taxi the driver recognizes him immediately. Once again he gets lucky because the driver also believes him to be innocent and recommends a plastic surgeon to get his face altered. Now, prior to the plastic surgery the audience is never shown Vincent Parry's face except in a newspaper photo. Instead, we are shown the people he talks to as if we were looking at them through his eyes. I found this to be both imaginative and quaint. But once the bandages come off the plot thickens and the film gets very interesting. At any rate, both Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall performed very well together and the chemistry between them is quite evident. Likewise, I also liked the performance of Agnes Moorehead who played the part as the evil harpy "Madge Rapf". In short, this is a very good movie and I think most people will probably enjoy it if they give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous but fascinating film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Passage" is a silly film when you look at it objectively, but an effective film noir, a subgenre that, though set in the real world, has an exaggerated, almost feverish quality, emphasizing the dread, anxiety, and paranoia of modern life.Humphrey Bogart plays a man who escapes from prison where he was sent after being wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife, and tries to prove his innocence and bring the true culprit to justice. The plot may bring to mind The Fugitive, but unlike that film's hero, Bogart's Vincent Parry remains a fugitive even after undergoing plastic surgery to conceal his identity. This is film noir, after all, which rarely concludes on a happy note.In retrospect, "Dark Passage" was an unusual choice for Bogart at a time when he was at the height of his box-office power. We are 37 minutes into the film before we see him, and even then his face is covered in bandages. Prior to that, we hear his voice and see the action through his eyes. Those bandages don't come off until we are one hour and two minutes into the action. Jack Warner is said to have opposed a production in which the star spends a third of its running time off-screen, but his protests were registered too late, after filming had already begun on San Francisco locations.Warner may have also had qualms about the story. It's far-fetched, with Bogart crawling through the bushes after his escape while a police chase is in progress. Bacall, as an artist who never met Bogart's character but followed his trial in the newspaper, just happens to be driving by at the time. She gives him a ride, and then shelters him in her classy apartment. "I don't believe in fate or destiny, or any of those things," she tells him when explaining how she rescued him. Director Delmer Daves who wrote the screenplay based on a novel by David Goodis, may not have believed in those things either, but, what the heck, bring 'em on if your story is too weak for more sensible solutions.Bogart's encounter with the plastic surgeon occurs after equally unlikely circumstances. A chatty cab driver who "can tell what people think, what they do, sometimes even who they are" from looking at their faces, recognizes Parry, but is sympathetic to his troubles. Rather than turn him in to the police, he takes him to see a friend, a plastic surgeon who works out of a tiny office hidden away in a dark alley. "I perfected my own special technique 12 years ago," he says, "before I was kicked out of the Medical Association." This is the kind of doctor who also did the work that turned Jack Nicholson into the Joker in 1989's "Batman," but Bogart fares much better, emerging with the face of the world's greatest movie star.The film's most memorable scene is when Bogart, obviously drugged during surgery, hallucinates, and we see the surgeon cackling hysterically like the mad doctor in a horror movie. Drugs and their effect were pretty much a new topic in movies in that era (see "Murder, My Sweet" for a similarly grotesque hallucination), but it was not unusual in film noir."There's no such thing as courage," the doctor tells his apprehensive patient. "There's only fear - a fear of getting hurt and a fear of dying." Fear haunts Bogart throughout Dark Passage, and is often the dominant emotion in film noir. The poor guy can't even eat in peace when he stops at one of those all-night diners that frequently turn up in noir. A detective grills him about his identity, and Bogart is on the run again."Dark Passage" is not a great film, but it's weird and interesting, a must-see for devotees of both Bogart and film noir.

		<shortDescription>Bogey and Bacall must be watched, but as for the plot....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just have to see Bogey's face to give a film a 7. Add Lauren Bacall and some of the best footage of San Francisco (my home town) I've ever seen from the period and we're up to 8, easy. However, this film doesn't ask you to suspend disbelief -- it requires you to put it into a medically-induced coma. Bogart escapes from San Quentin to be rescued by Lauren Bacall, a landscape artist who just "happens" to be painting nearby and "happens" to have a personal interest in his case. Later, when he leaves her apartment and hails a cab, the driver recognizes him as the escapee, but volunteers to help him by taking him to a back-alley plastic surgeon to *completely reconstruct* his face. In a 45 minute operation. (The $200 cost is believable enough; after all, when you adjust for inflation that's something like $6.5 million dollars.) After the operation, Bogart appears for the first time. The surgeon says he made him look 10 years older, possibly to help explain the romance between Bogey and Bacall in spite of their age difference. Ironically, this is one element that doesn't need to be made believable, since almost every viewer knew that the two stars were married in real life. Bogart, who was imprisoned for the murder of his wife, finds the real killer in a plot that swings between fantastic and difficult to follow. And yet, I'd watch the film again tomorrow. One of several high points: When the police stop Bacall as she approaches the Golden Gate Bridge, the camera stays on her face as she bluffs her way through their search of her station wagon (Bogart is hiding in the back). The combination of this unconventional direction with her acting is riveting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER!I forgot I had this film. Didn't get around to re-watching it since I'm not a huge Bogart/Bacall fan. I was amazed to see that Bogart had his face hidden from view half of the film! I wonder how audiences reacted to that when it came out. I did not mind that at all and the effect of looking through his eyes works, giving the film a mysterious feeling. Bogart were Bacall are alright in The Big Sleep but, as in that film and in Dark Passage, it's the other characters that make the films interesting. There's loads of atmospheric scenes with sinister characters like the guy who picks Bogart up in his car, the taxi driver and the plastic surgeon (that scenes goes on a long time!) I liked the George character and Agnes Moorehead is just amazing. She's a little like the poor man's Bette Davis. You can always count on her to deliver a wicked performance. Her last scene ends a bit abrupt. Did they have to re-film it or what? The ending of the film is a bit of let down all together. The plot is quite far-fetched but all in all it's good little gripping film noir. Good views of San Fransisco too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Best, But I Kept Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this DVD last night and although I thought the film was unintentionally funny in several parts and that there were a lot of bizarre and outlandish happenings, I found it oddly compelling and pretty entertaining. On the plus side was the cool first person camera work. Though it was also seen in LADY IN THE LAKE, this type of filming always interests me. The San Francisco locations also gave the film a nice air of authenticity. The biggest plus of course is the Bogart/Becall team. The chemistry and the heat is quite obvious and Bogie comes off as charming while Becall sizzles with her "innocent" sexiness. Some things just had me shaking my head in amazement though and chuckling a little to myself. I mean, Bogart just gets into this cab and right away, the cabbie knows people because he studies faces and immediately he knows Bogart is the prison escapee even though his face is completely covered in darkness!! And just like that, the cabbie happens to know this doctor who performs face lifts and on and on it went. I mean, Bogie just happened to get into the right cab at the right time in a huge metropolis! Timing is everything I guess. And how about the cop at the diner? Just because Bogart didn't realize a certain race track was closed and because he wasn't wearing a raincoat, he was automatically a suspect who needed to go down to headquarters even though he looked nothing like his old self??? Wow! And don't get me started on Bogie's final confrontation with Agnes Moorehead! Anyway, there was still something about the film that kept me entertained and interested to the end but all in all, DARK PASSAGE in not a great film and I prefer something like THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT to this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Goodis' novel "Dark Passage" was adapted for the screen by director and screenwriter Delmer Daves and starred probably the most charismatic couple in cinema history (Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall). The result was a well directed off-beat thriller which contains numerous unexpected and often improbable developments which are, nevertheless, very entertaining.Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart) who had been unjustly imprisoned for murdering his wife escapes from San Quentin to track down the real culprit so that he can prove his own innocence. He waves down a passing car driven by a guy called Baker (Clifton Young) who initially seems helpful but soon becomes very irritating by asking numerous questions in quick succession. Their conversation is brought to an end when a radio announcement about Parry's escape leads to a struggle which ends with Baker being left unconscious and Parry changing into his clothes. A woman named Irene Jansen (Lauren Bacall) then stops her car nearby and takes Parry to San Francisco where she allows him to stay at her apartment, buys him some new clothes and provides him with money to help with his search for the real killer. Irene explains that she'd attended his trial everyday and had been so convinced of his innocence that she'd written to a newspaper about it. Her strong feelings were strengthened by the fact that her father had also been unjustly convicted under similar circumstances and had, in fact, died in prison.Parry leaves the apartment to carry on his search but during a taxi journey is recognised by the driver who knows a plastic surgeon and suggests that Parry should consider having an operation to change his appearance. Having agreed to this suggestion, Parry goes to his best friend's apartment and makes an arrangement to stay there while he is recovering from surgery. After his operation, Parry returns to the apartment and finds that his friend George Fellsinger (Rory Mallinson) has been murdered. In desperation and with his face heavily bandaged, he heads back to Irene's apartment and notices Baker's vehicle parked close by. Irene helps him again but things get complicated when it becomes apparent that the police suspect him of Fellsinger's murder and Irene's current boyfriend is the ex-fiancé of Madge Rapf (Agnes Moorhead), the woman who'd given the false testimony which had led to Parry being convicted.After his face heals Parry sets off on his mission again and adopts a new identity. This, however, doesn't prevent Baker from catching up with him or attempting to blackmail him. As he isn't able to pay the money demanded, Baker orders him at gunpoint to drive to the affluent Irene's place so that he can extort the money from her. On the way, a fight between the two men results in Baker falling to his death at the bottom of a cliff but this only happens after Parry has elicited some information from Baker which enables him to identify his wife's and Fellsinger's murderer. In a confrontation with the culprit, Parry tries to obtain a written confession but this proves impossible when the murderer suddenly dies in a very shocking and bizarre manner.In order to avoid showing Bogart's face before the plastic surgery, most of the action in the early part of the story is seen from his point of view. This technique was, no doubt, as unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the actors as it was for the audience, but fortunately, was executed well enough to serve its purpose without jarring too much.It seems incredible just how relaxed Irene remains about the fact that four people who are close to Parry all die in unusual circumstances in a relatively short space of time. This would surely raise some doubts or suspicions in most people. Similarly, taking into account how passionately she felt about the unjust treatment meted out to him, why would Irene be friendly with the woman who perjured herself to get him convicted? Furthermore, if she was a friend of Madge's, how likely is it that she would then start a relationship with her ex-fiancé? Despite all the credibility gaps (and there are others), it has to be said that "Dark Passage" is very underrated and has an ingenious plot with plenty of action, atmosphere, suspense and good acting. Also, in typical film noir style, the ending has a bitter twist because although Parry succeeds in finding the murderer, he is still left in a position where he can't prove his innocence and so remains condemned to a future of having to avoid being brought to justice for both Fellsinger's murder and his escape from prison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Passage, light journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Parry has been imprisoned in San Quentin for murdering his wife, he escapes at sets about clearing his name. After being picked up, and then hidden by Irene Jansen {who has followed his case closely}, Parry gets a tip from cab driver which leads him to an underground plastic surgeon. After being given a new face, Parry must keep away from the police and find out just who did in fact kill his wife?OK, so the plot isn't much to write home about, but the star appeal of the leads and a quite simply brilliant supporting performance, lifts this noirish thriller way above average. Humphrey Bogart is Vincent Parry, and Lauren Bacall is Irene Jansen, so it's with a tinge of sadness that Dark Passage is considered the weakest film of the four collaborations from the special duo. And tho in plot and screenplay that may well be true, I maintain that the sexual chemistry here is as electric as it is in The Big Sleep. Has to be said tho that both Bacall &amp; Bogart are playing second fiddle to a waspish turn from Agnes Moorehead as Madge Rapf, she ups the ante and grabs the attention span when the film drifts close to a maudlin stand still.The clever camera technique of viewing the events from Vincent's eyes works well for the first third of the film {we never see Vincent's face}, but heavy with Bogarts narration, this loses impact once Vincent gets his new face. The mysterious element to the plot doesn't quite get the jolt that it should, sadly we know it's Bogart from the off, so when the reveal comes about it just falls a little flat. Still the film works as a more than serviceable thriller, great acting and a very tidy turn of events in the ending make Dark Passage recommended viewing for Noirish Thriller fans. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run Humphrey! RUUUUN!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the least famous film that pairs Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall (next to "To have and have not", "Key Largo" and ? of course ? "The Big Sleep") but still a very powerful film-noir and a feast for all senses. "Dark Passage" is an adaptation of the glorious David Goodis novel in which a man, wrongly convicted for murdering his wife, escapes prison and attempts to clear his name after he's given a new identity and appearance through plastic surgery. He's assisted by a gorgeous young girl whose father went through a similar hell but thwarted by ancient enemies and small time crooks all over San Francisco. Like it is mostly the case with 40's cinema, I simply worship this production for its mesmerizing dialogues and utterly stylish cinematography. You can't but realize that cinema is the purest form of art when you're beholding the interactions and chemistry between our legendary on-screen couple. Yet, it also is the first time that there are actual flaws to detect in a prestigious movie like this. The plot contains a few holes and it's not always clear what connection the different characters share. The fact that Bogie's face is kept hidden until late in the movie is quite silly too, especially since his masculine voice is all over the place. No matter how ingeniously director Daves and cinematographer Sid Hickox try to camouflage Vincent Parry's face, you just patiently sit and wait for Humphrey to take of his bandages. "Dark Passage" contains loads of exiting action-sequences and non-stop suspense. This unquestionably also is THE movie that makes the greatest use of San Francisco as a location. All the obvious and less obvious aspects of this wondrous city are very well presented in the sublime photography. Dark Passage is an undeniable work of art and regretfully still a very underrated film. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Magnificent Film-Noir of Humphrey Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart) is a fugitive from San Quentin, convicted of murdering his wife, who claims to be innocent. He is helped by Irene Jansen (Lauren Bacall), a wealthy woman who loves him. A taxi driver sends him to an efficient surgeon to make a plastic surgery on his face, and Irene takes care of him while his face heals. With a new face, Vincent chases the real killer. This movie is another magnificent film-noir of Humphrey Bogart. Lauren Bacall is extremely beautiful and elegant in the role of Irene, and the couple has a great chemistry. The supporting cast is excellent, highlighting Agnes Moorehead in the role of the evil Madge Rapf. Tom Andrea has also a minor but great performance as the cab driver who believes on Vincent and helps him. There is a great flaw in the beginning of the story, when Irene Jansen coincidentally finds Vincent Parry, but it does not diminish the greatness of this film. The black &amp; white photography is amazing, with spectacular shadows. The camera is very innovative as a first person camera, and Humphrey Bogart face is just showed on the screens about 62:30 minutes running time. The art of the Brazilian DVD is wonderful, and there is another attraction in the Extras: a Bugs Bunny cartoon called 'Slick Hare', making a joke with the couple Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in a fancy restaurant and ordering rabbit for dinner. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Prisioneiro do Passado' ('Prisoner of the Past')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the worst scripts that poor Bogie and Bacall can't save even with wonderful Agnes Moorehead (pre-Broom days,altho this part is so badly written you'd expect her to fly out a window-which in a way she does!) The really contrived monolouge for the cab driver is enough to make you wonder if indeed a 12 year old had typed in the script and sent it to Jack Warner? You wonder what is the motivation for the cabbie to help out this mysterious stranger that Bogie's character is to him... Puh-leeze...Weak story line and script that fine actors can't salvage! Some of the exterior shots are fine,but the dream sequence is unbelievably bad and rather amateurish when you consider other effects even 25 years before. The only satisfying ending is that you know these outstanding actors(especially Bogart and Moorehead )will have excellent roles ahead of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kindness of Strangers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you ever start watching a movie, knowing from the very beginning that you were going to really, really like it? Maybe even love it? That's what happened when I first discovered this gem, directed by Delmer Daves and based on the original novel by David Goodis with a very strong musical score by Franz Waxman. I like the movie so much that I am even willing to overlook what other reviewers have reasonably described as "improbable holes" in the plot.And what about those alleged plot holes? Considering Irene Jansen's (Lauren Bacall's) behavior throughout the film, couldn't she realistically have been so obsessed with Vincent Parry that she wanted to be physically close to him and therefore regularly painted in the hills near San Quentin? It would have been nothing unusual for her, but why would she want to admit that openly to Parry yet? And was her friendship to the movie's villain, Madge Rapf (how's that for a perfectly loathsome name?), far too coincidental, or could she have sought out Madge's companionship from all of the other social possibilities in the city of San Francisco just in order to gain the opportunity to get even with her for helping to send her innocent idol, Parry, to prison for murdering his wife, Gert? I haven't yet read the book, but I intend to do so with the hope of discovering that the screenplay omitted a few key circumstances behind what others have reasonably concluded to be "far fetched".Possible plot holes aside, I somehow knew that I would love this movie from the moment that the barrel started swaying precariously from the very rear of the prison truck while the sirens of San Quentin blasted into the surrounding California countryside. Then, as a viewer, I am suddenly spinning down the mountain in the dark barrel, just as escapee Vincent Parry is doing. For the first thirty minutes of the movie, I only see the action in first person point of view as Parry experiences it and as the events are narrated by the actor who portrays him so adeptly, Humphrey Bogart.From the very start, this movie never disappoints. At every moment, there is a new and unexpected turn of events and a new and interesting person, usually but not always a total stranger met entirely at random, entering the life of Parry. There are so many large and small fascinating and quirky elements, including characters, in this film that I don't know where to begin, so I'll start with the wonderful, dramatic score of Franz Waxman, prominently featuring the Mercer-Whiting classic song of the era, "Too Marvelous for Words". Who can more ably deliver us into the lap of 1947 but Jo Stafford as she sings what would soon become Vincent's and Irene's very effective theme song?Clifton Young perfectly plays Baker, the very disagreeable, small-town crook and blackmailing weasel, who drives a jalopy that can't do more than 40 mph with seat cushions made of a circus tent that must have matched evil Madge's obsessive, favorite color, orange, even when disguised in black and white. In this movie, when the traffic light turns orange, proceed with extreme caution! As soon as we meet this repulsive guy we too "want to crack open his head full of figures" as Vincent justifiably warns him. No, Baker, you little rat, I know Vincent Parry, and you're no match for Vincent Parry, so save yourself the trouble, see!Then we embark on a very tense journey through a police dragnet from one end of the Golden Gate Bridge to the other, set up specifically in Vincent's honor, with Irene nervously behind the wheel and Vincent hidden in the back of her station wagon with her wet oil paintings. And who knew that the cop at the tollbooth is none other than Vince Edwards (aka Dr. Ben Casey)? Next we are invited into Irene's fascinating art deco building somewhere in the hills of San Francisco with its glass elevator and unique glass hallway wall, etched in some maritime or sky theme that must have been very avant-garde in 1947, along with the spiral staircase in her apartment that leads to her very private bedroom.Tom d'Andrea as Sam, the gregarious, lonely, and very goodhearted cab driver, is another valuable asset to the film, as is the appearance of Housely Stevenson, who plays Dr. Coley, Vincent's plastic surgeon. Is the doctor the fiend that Vincent imagines him to be in an unforgettable nightmare episode that immediately reminds me of my own anxious moments as I was being sedated for a very real, major operation? "Got the money?" This is another high moment among many in this wonderful film.Agnes Moorehead is perfectly detestable as the very annoying and very unlikable Madge Rapf. The intense drama of Madge's and Vincent's eventual encounter at her apartment is another effective turning point, thanks to the efforts of not one but two of the best professionals in the business, Bogart and Moorehead, head to head with an excellent script that is worthy of their exceptional acting abilities. Madge's "moment of truth" in the midst of their gripping conversation, and her sudden exit from the scene are not to be missed. Do you think that those shoes sailing through the Bay Area breeze might be bright orange too? Just a thought.In the end, we are finally rewarded for all of the nervous tension that persists throughout the film by a very serene and very soothing scene that, in my humble opinion, conveys unlike any other the love that Bogey and Bacall felt for each other in real life. Too marvelous for words. You can say that again, Mr. Johnny Mercer. I love this movie. I guess you already know that by now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this film has a lot going for it. Bogart and Bacall for starters. Hard to top that. Their performances were, as always, top-notch. Agnes Moorehead playing the schemer, which was right in her wheelhouse. The interesting and unusual filming device in the first part of the movie. Since I knew nothing of this film going in, I discovered the reason for it at the right time. I understand why the studio may have been dismayed by it.But the film's one glaring weakness: I understand that if nothing unusual happens to the characters, then there's not much to make a movie about. But I think that scripts should be limited to only one extremely unlikely and fortuitous coincidence per movie. This film has at least three.Still worth seeing, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Muddle, Except for One Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wanted man tries to prove his innocence as he knocks about the streets of San Francisco.There's one noir scene that almost redeems this otherwise narrative mess. Fugitive Parry (Bogart) flees across a 1940's nighttime cityscape to where else but an all- night diner. The grease almost drips off the chipped walls, just like the sweat off Parry's brow as he eludes every cop in Frisco. The diner's empty except for one guy at the far end. It only takes a couple ill-chosen words, and the guy approaches Parry. He's big and assertive and has cop written all over his manner. Parry better think fast or he's toast. The paranoia is right out of Kafka?no place is safe, not even an empty all-night diner. Now the cop leads the star-crossed Parry down a dark flop-house street to where his true identity will surely be revealed. There is no escape in the city, not even for an innocent man. It's noir all the way.In my book, it's an iconic little scene that comes out of nowhere in this otherwise turgid muddle. As others point out, the script comes straight out of the Would You Believe It school of bad screen writing. More time should have gone into a plausible script instead of the distracting pov set-ups. After all, what can you say about a movie where the scariest thing is Agnes Moorehead in heat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passage into Darknes? Barely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Passage" (1947) is the third film in the hugely successful Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall pairing, the previous two having been "To Have and Have Not" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1946), both directed by Howard Hawks. The real life couple would go on to make one more together, John Huston's "Key Largo" (1948). This film noir entry was made by Delmer Daves, who is perhaps best known for his string of thoughtful Westerns made in the nineteen-fifties, including "Broken Arrow" (1950), "The Last Wagon" (1956) and the classic "3:10 to Yuma" (1957). This film, however, is far from thoughtful: a thriller of the likes that only Warner Brothers Studios made, this is based on a previous years novel of the same name by David Goodis.The story is thus: Vincent Parry (Bogart) escapes from San Quentin after being framed for the murder of his wife, and with the aid of Irene Jansen (Bacall), he sets out to the find the real killer, as well as having a face change to avoid the police.On paper, it might sound fairly routine, but there are enough gimmicks and plot contrivances to keep it afloat: the first thirty-five minutes are mostly seen directly from Parry's point of view (meaning you never see Parry's face in the flesh, only through some newspaper photographs. You do see his new face which turns out to be Bogart's), although we are spared the fate of multiple things thrown at the camera, as is wont when this trick is used. It just about comes off, thanks to great, agile photography by Sidney Hickox, shot on location in San Francisco that lends the movie a wonderful "open-air" quality.Some of the plot twists are pretty improbable, if highly entertaining, and it is all whisked along at a breathless pace by director Daves. The two stars are great, and the supporting cast perform admirably, with Agnes Moorehead and Clifton Young particularly memorable.It's not a great movie, and it barely scraps by with a film noir label, but it is fun and enjoyable, which is a lot more than many movies ever achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart Is Two-Faced!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First-rate noir film in which Bogie escapes from prison after unfairly being accused, prosecuted, and found guilty for the death of his wife. We catch up with him as pretty, wealthy socialite Lauren Bacall just happens by and rescues him from being caught by the police. Bogie and Bacall have obvious chemistry in this their third film together. What really makes this film work is the above-average storytelling based on a splendid David Goodis novel and the taut, imaginative direction of Delmer Daves who also wrote the script. We don't see Bogie's face for a good third of the film at least and see everything from his perspective. Soon, after conferring with an amiable cabbie, Bogie is convinced to see a , how shall we say, doctor of dubious repute, that will change his face so he will not be recognized. After the bandages come off, we see the real Bogart and then our point of view changes from First to Third(actually changes when we see the bandaged face of Bogie). This camera gimmick really works well as we see close-ups of the faces Bogie talks to which add to the tension of the story. The character acting all around is first-rate as we follow Vincent Parry(Bogart) try and find the real killer of his wife. Tom D'Andrea as the cabbie and Housley Stephenson as the doctor do remarkable jobs as do the two leads Bogart and Bacall. But acting honors in this film go to a young, odious Agnes Moorehead showing us just how good an actress she is playing a busybody that had been the only real witness to Bogie's wife saying her husband had murdered her. Moorehead is a real treat as she oozes oil out of every line. They just don't make films like this anymore and that's a shame as this is certainly a very fine film as example of Bogart's/Bacall's/Moorehead's work or as a film noir piece. Some of the scenes I found most impressive other than every bit with Bogart walking about bandaged were the atypical ending and the lone scene between Bogart and Moorehead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star vehicle for Bogey and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is interesting because we do not see the face of the first-billed star, Humphrey Bogart, until halfway through the film. It's a clever ploy that works brilliantly. Bogart never loses an inch of his territory though, he's still a major presence through his voice and actions. However, this is Bacall's film.The husband-and-wife team made 4 films together. I believe that Bogart was the true 'star' of two of them, 'The Big Sleep' and 'Key Largo'. In this and 'To Have and Have Not', Bacall is the major player. It is her face we see speaking directly to the camera as she addresses Bogart (remember, we see the action through his eyes), it is her acting and ability to carry a film without Bogart's face beside her that is being tested. She passes with flying colours.This is a noir, but it's an unusual one. We get a happy ending, and as with the Bogart-Bacall teaming, there is really no standard fall guy-femme fatale thing going on. The feeling of equality is even more pronounced in this film than any of their others, as Bogart relies on Bacall for support after his operation, and Bacall needs Bogart's love. The closest we come to having the traditional femme fatale is in the venomous harpy of Agnes Moorhead. She's plain trouble, and Bogart and Bacall know it.'Dark Passage' really achieves the atmosphere and 'feel' of the noir picture. It is suitably downcast, and well-directed. However, it just ain't up to par with the greatness of the other three Bacall-Bogart vehicles. It's still terrific entertainment though.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the top-of-the-line noir thriller, but pretty good anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mostly well-constructed noir film, in which escaped convict Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart) is rescued by Irene Jensen (Lauren Bacall), whose father was wrongfully jailed for killing his wife, as was Parry. The twist is that Parry, whose face we never see partly because the film is shot from his point of view much of the time, and when it isn't he's buried in film noir shadows, until he gets his faced fixed by a charming old plastic surgeon (Housely Stevenson) and when the bandages come off, he looks amazingly like Bogart. This point of view recurs occasionally in the post-plastic surgery section, but gradually disappears. Everywhere Parry goes he encounters good luck?Irene falls for him, a friendly cabby takes him to the doctor?and bad luck?his best friend gets killed, and Madge (Agnes Moorhead), a brittle piece of bad news, detects his presence. So does a young hoodlum in an open coupe, a toothy guy who follows Parry after he knocks him out during the escape, just before Irene picks him up, and this hoodlum tries to blackmail Parry, but it wasn't a good idea. Finally Parry figures out who killed his wife and his best friend, the odious Madge, who seems to have a nasty fixation on Parry?she hates him but nobody else can have him. She exults in her control over Parry, and to make it final she jumps out of a high window, knowing her death too will be blamed on him. Still, he escapes to Peru, where Irene eventually joins him and there's music again and moonlight on the waves. Bacall is dazzling, as always, even though she doesn't have snappy lines, and Bogart is strong and dark and weary, but not so weary that he gives up on Irene. Some good photography, shadows, and camera angles worthy of noir honours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mysterious strangers keep popping up at just the right time to aid Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart), convicted for the murder of his wife and on the lam from San Quentin. Watching this film requires a healthy dose of detachment from reality as the situations presented all feel like contrivances to keep the story moving along. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy the film as a noirish thriller, but when unbelievable elements get in the way they have to be acknowledged.The first half of the movie is told in a first person narrative style that has the viewer looking through Parry's eyes, a device necessary to avoid showing the face we'll recognize later as Bogey's own. I've got to admit that after repeated viewings, the film's style has me subconsciously recalling Christopher Walken's turn as The Continental on 'Saturday Night Live', and with it an involuntary chuckle. The feeling reaches it's crescendo with the appearance of Dr. Coley (Houseley Stevenson), the back alley surgeon who performs Parry's transformation. Where else can you get your face changed at three in the morning, and arranged no less by a cab driver on a first name basis with the doc? Why haven't we seen Stevenson in more mad scientist films of the era, he looks perfect for the job.Bogey's third team up with the Mrs., Lauren Bacall, is probably the one that most dramatizes the differences in their age. One almost questions what Irene Jansen sees in Parry, other than her belief in the innocence of his wife's murder; her father was framed the same way. Jansen's obsession with Parry's case has her giving him shelter during the post op. Did you wonder as I did why Bacall's character might have had a man's razor in her bathroom? Consider if you will how inept the authorities were in tracking down their man. Parry really shouldn't have been so hard to find, like Clint Eastwood, he leaves dead bodies wherever he goes. If you pause your video player and proceed frame by frame, you'll notice how the detective who accompanies Parry out of the diner doesn't really get hit by a car, he actually jumps into the side of it as Vincent makes his getaway. I wonder why the scene was left that way, a retake or better editing job would have made it more believable.The one superb casting decision was Agnes Moorehead as the vile scorned woman Madge, a former flame of Parry who epitomizes the description of a match made in hell. Wasn't she great? That look on her face when Vincent slowly turns the knife on his identity should be acting school required viewing. But come on, didn't she know the window was there? OK, maybe it was a suicide, but she should have needed a hammer to break it!The movie's final curtain lowers in a café in Peru, but not the one in Indiana - Bogey and Bacall in a clinch, just the way they were meant to be. One good reason for Bogey to keep talking to himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall only made a handful of movies together. Three of these movies ? The Big Sleep, To Have and Have Not, and Key Largo ? are in that special class of films that I call great. Dark Passage, on the other hand, is merely a good movie. It's not great by any stretch of the imagination ? just good. The story involves a man wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and the woman who wants to help him prove his innocence after he escapes from jail. As you might expect, Bogart and Bacall have a very natural on screen chemistry. There's nothing fake here. The scenes in Dark Passage that feature both of them are some of the real highlights of the movie.Unfortunately, their on screen time together is limited by the decision not to show Bogart for the first third of the movie. The whole concept of telling the story from the first person perspective until Bogart's character has plastic surgery is, at first, a novel idea that presents the opportunity for several unusual and innovative scenes. But I've always felt this goes on far too long. What starts as "novel" turns into "tiresome" before we finally get to see Bogart's mug.Beyond Bogart and Bacall, there's quite a bit to enjoy in Dark Passage. The cinematography is nice, the San Francisco locations are interesting, and the dialogue is snappy. The supporting cast is more than adequate with Agnes Moorhead being the standout. Although her role is limited, she steals scene after scene from Bogart and Bacall ? something that doesn't appear to have been an easy thing to do.I suppose the biggest weakness I see in Dark Passage is the implausibility of certain plot elements. For example, when Bogart's character escapes from prison, he just happens to end up on the road that Bacall's character just happens to be driving on. She just happens to notice an abandoned car on the side road and just happens to recognize Bogart when she pulls her car over. Too many coincidences for my liking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly a Great Film; Taut; Fascinating; and Innovative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladies and gentlemen alike respond positively to this exciting and very unusual thriller. It stars Humphrey Bogart, who is not ideal for the part but does well, Lauren Bacall who is very good as the woman who loves him, talented Agnes Moorhead, and veteran actors Tom D'Andrea, Bruce Bennett, powerful Douglas Kennedy, Houseley Stevens, and Rory Mallinson. The strong, straightforward and intriguing plot line has a man convicted of murdering his wife, a crime he did not do, escaping from prison bent on finding out who did it, and discovering who has framed him and planning to exact revenge. The entire pre-surgery part of this movie--Bogart needs to change his face in order to escape detection, and a cabbie helps him to find a doctor who does the job--is seen from Bogat's p.o.v. After that, he is taken under her wing by Bacall, who had admired him during the trial and believed him innocent. This is classic noir--artist Bacall believes him, the police do not, and they are on his trail. He tries to trust an old friend, who betrays him; everyone is a potential whistle-blower; and he traces the guilt to Moorhead, who falls to her death escaping from him. Now what does he do? he cannot prove his innocence. He flees the country to wait for Bacall, in a bar he knows in a very foreign place. In lesser hands than those of writer and director Delmer Daves, this film could have been something forgettable. But with superior sets, lighting, and direction among other commodities--aided by the music of Franz Waxman and Max Steiner--it becomes a memorable odyssey to light on the part of a man betrayed by a justice system that did not work for him at all. Bogart defeats the conspiracy, finds out the truth--and gets the girl at the end of a stormy romance-cum-nightmare. A classic among connoisseurs and an interesting artistic challenge to the filmmaker, which was answered beautifully on almost every count. Watch for the now-defunct Angels' Flight cable cars in Los Angeles in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wrongfully accused of his wife's murder, Vincent Parry escapes from prison and ventures into San Francisco in an effort to clear his name by unmasking the real killer--and in order to conceal his identity from the authorities undergoes plastic surgery.In order to carry off this plot device, the first half hour of the film is shot from the visual perspective of the character: we see what he sees. Once he undergoes surgery, however, the perspective shifts, and we discover that the surgeon has created (surprise!) Humphrey Bogart.DARK PASSAGE will never compete with the likes of THE BIG SLEEP: although interesting, the "through my eyes" cinematography of the first half hour is more successful in concept than execution and the improbable story relies largely upon the romantic chemistry of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. But even in this lightweight vehicle that chemistry remains very potent, and the film is further buttressed by the supporting cast, which includes Agnes Moorehead at her most enjoyably acid. Film noir fans will find it entertaining but mild, but Bogie and Bacall fans will have a good time.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bogart/Becall film to put on your "to see" list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen this movie until it was on TCM a while ago. While I did not think it was quite as good as the other Bogart films that I have seen it is still worthwhile to watch. Becall is a bit older/mature in this film compared to her debut in the excellent "To Have and Have Not". You can readily see the change in her as an actress if you care to compare both performances. Bogart is, well, Bogart. If you saw this man walking down the street you would probably never give him a second glance or ever think to believe that he was an actor in Hollywood. The man captures your attention whenever he is in a scene through his own personality and talent coupled with the skill of the director and the cameraman! Houseley Stevenson is also a small delight in the film playing the role of the plastic surgeon who somehow has gone astray and is reduced to making a living in a shady manner. All in all this is a film to put on your "to see " list and enjoy. I plan to review it again to see what meanings/inferences I may have missed the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie and Bacall make this movie great entertainment despite some plot holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dark Passage' is third of the four Bogie and Bacall pairings of the 40s. It is also the least remembered, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching. Despite a few plot holes it's great entertainment and Bacall and Bogart really steam up the screen. For me they are the best screen couple of all time and have a chemistry that has never been equaled. The movie starts off brilliantly, shown from the P.O.V. of a prison escapee, who has been wrongly incarcerated for his wife's murder. While on the run he is picked up my a beautiful girl who has been following his case for personal reasons of her own. Of course she is Lauren Bacall and after some plastic surgery the prisoner becomes Humphrey Bogart. The way the two characters meet threw me for quite a while. It was so hard to swallow I expected it to be some kind of set up, and so in the back of my mind I was trying to guess plot twists which never came. It was just some dubious plotting, but I quickly came to accept it and move on. Agnes Moorehead's performance is a real stand out and one of her best outside the Welles films she first appeared in. The rest of the cast are adequate but this is Bogie and Bacall's movie all the way. It isn't anywhere near as good as their previous film together 'The Big Sleep', which is a Noir classic, but I still enjoyed watching it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More slate than noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the least of the four films Bogie &amp; Bacall made together, "Dark Passage" is still a must-see for fans of the noir genre. Actually, more slate than noir, i.e., more gray areas than the coal black of other Bogart classics like "Maltese Falcon" &amp; "The Big Sleep". He plays a prison escapee who was framed for murdering his wife &amp; is supported by a young lady bountiful (Bacall) who believes in his innocence. Agnes Moorehead goes above and beyond in the evil woman department; she is as unrelenting as a crow at fresh roadkill. Even Clifton Young, looking like a cross between Richard Widmark &amp; Tim Robbins, is appropriately smarmy as a young punk with a grudge; a pity he died so young in real life. Only Bruce Bennett fails to register, even more wooden here than he was in the same year's "Mildred Pierce". The film is like a car wreck you can't help but investigating for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape Clause</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "The Lady in the Lake," this starts off as a subjective POV film seen through escaped convict Bogey's eyes (and with a craftier excuse than Montgomery's film: we're never allowed a good look at the hero's face until after plastic surgery has turned it into Bogey's). Early on, you may notice "Bogey" is a little awkward unbuttoning a shirt, no doubt because one guy's left hand is working from one side of the camera, and another guy's right hand from the other. (Talk about saving money on the actor's salary: You never really need the star on set for any of these scenes...)But even after the POV camera angles are discarded, this flick has plenty of arcane camera angles, noirish shadows, and vintage San Francisco locations going for it. No one except Bogey and Bacall has more than a few minutes of screen time (Bruce Bennett appears for exactly one scene, and even the villain who dun it doesn't stick around for long), but plenty of shady characters pop in and out to keep things interesting.I've always felt the ending was a letdown; that, having painted himself into a corner, the author weaseled out of it by allowing the hero to run off to South America...Still, more interesting and certainly more hard-boiled than most of Daves' work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A convicted murderer escapes. He says he wants to prove his innocence. Or does he want revenge?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in almost every film I've seen them in together. They had chemistry like no Hollywood couple today has and they chose roles with bite. In this film Bogart plays a convicted murderer on the run from prison who is innocent and Bacall helps him escape and hides him. It seems a little naive and dangerous for her to help a murderer and believe he is innocent but a similar thing happened to her father. Bogart ends up getting plastic surgery. In the film up to the part where he gets the surgery we never see Bogart's face and most of it is shot from his POV (point of view).So he is out to prove he's innocent but when he finds out who killed his wife and framed him... well what would you do? I highly recommend this little mystery. I love a good mystery in black and white made at least 40 years ago. Especially one with Bogie and Bacall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agreeable, but not Bogey and Bacall's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This is the one in which Humphrey Bogart is not seen on camera until the movie is about a third over. (He's an escaped con who is going to have plastic surgery.) We see his "old" face in a newspaper photo, and then we see Bogart in bandages, reminding me a little of Claude Rains in the original The Invisible Man (1933), and finally we Bogey's face when Lauren Bacall removes the bandages.Although Dark Passage is representative of one of my favorite eras in film, namely the late forties/early fifties, on display here is not the best work of either of the principles. Two better films starring Bacall and Bogart are the Howard Hawks production of the Raymond Chandler novel, The Big Sleep (1946), and John Huston's Key Largo (1948), both classics. Delmer Daves, who went on to direct a number of mid-brow indulgences that achieved some box office success, including Broken Arrow (1950), Kings Go Forth (1958), and A Summer Place (1959), is here the victim of a mediocre script and his own tendency to disregard plausibility and plot logic in favor of moving on to the next scene. On the plus side, Dark Passage is free of the heavy-handed schmaltz and imbedded social messages that sometimes marred Daves' later films--that is, until the bus station scene, when, for a brief moment, I guess he couldn't control himself.Lauren Bacall is shown to advantage, and when she gets misted up, she is indeed very beautiful. But there is little challenge in the part she plays.Bogart is his usual self of course, and manages, once he gets the bandages off, to continue that very fine portrayal. However, the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall doesn't amount to much (although Bacall certainly is trying) until the phone call from the bus station.What Daves does manage well is the atmospheric feel of mid-century San Francisco. (I wonder if Florshiem Shoes and The Owl Drug Store paid for the shots that lingered on their lighted marquees...) Bacall's apartment with the winding staircase and the hi fi record player console, and the suits and hats of the men, and Bacall's languid, sleek dresses with the boxed shoulders, the cigarette cases and the pre rock and roll pop tunes on the radio (especially Mercer and Whiting's, "Too Marvelous for Words," sung by Jo Stafford) offer a nostalgic sense of time and place. Also good is the work of some of the supporting characters including Tom D'Andrea as the cabby and Houseley Stevenson as the plastic surgeon. Agnes Moorehead is memorable as Bogey's villainous ex. Perhaps the highlight of the film is the corny, but entirely agreeable, finale at the Peruvian cantina.</fullReview>

I think Bacall plays very well in this section and also in general a better act than Bogart. The plot never tires and as usual with these two the dialogue is entertaining, suave and a joy to listen to. Not as riveting as 'The Big Sleep' but fun entertainment.

Perhaps a list is in order.The chemistry between Bogey and Bacall, exceptional B&amp;W cinematography, Bogey (the actor) and/or Bogey's character analyzing his face/identity in a mirror, strangely isolated and awkward acts of violence, non-random random events, psychodrama, a distended sense of time, and a devastating performance by Agnes Moorehead. In a genre in which good acting is relatively rare, her final scene and its conclusion is a mindblower.If film noir is your glass of milk, then Dark Passage (Freudian implications and all) is a film you'll crave.</fullReview>

But aside from that there is a good deal to like here. While not Bogart's best performance by a long shot, the first half of the film, which is mostly just done with his voice and his first-person viewpoint is handled very well. Once we see him it is almost a disappointment. I expected his character to say. "Why on earth did he make me look like Humphrey Bogart! How am I supposed to walk around incognito like this!" The setting on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco is also perfect, many of the locations in the film are still there unchanged. So next time you are in SF, wrap your head in bandages and climb up the Filbert stairs in honor of Bogey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Person POV can get awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart) is an escaped prisoner convicted of the murder of his wife. Irene Jansen (Lauren Bacall) is a fan and helps him escape. The first part of the movie is shown without showing Bogart's face. Sometimes the scenes are shot using Vincent's POV. He gets some back alley plastic surgery to change his look. When he goes to his friend George's home, he finds him murdered. He takes refuge at Irene's home, and now finds himself the suspect in George's murder.The POV shooting style in the first half is interesting in small doses. In large doses like this, it feels awkward and unnatural. I do like the Bogart-Bacall pairing. There are worst things in the world than staring at Bacall's face. However when Bacall isn't in the picture, the gimmick doesn't work well. After that, Bogart is all bandaged up. The drawback is that he doesn't really speak. It limits the interaction. It turns into a monologue from Bacall. The movie moves into more normal territories once the bandages are removed. However I wish Lauren Bacall stays with Bogart more in the last half of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Previous Tales of the City.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the all time great film noirs that works in spite of some implausibilities too picky to mention. Major stars rarely succeed in film noir, and Humphrey Bogart is one of the few. It is perhaps that the genre requires a darkness we can't see in star performers, and if Bette Davis, Clark Gable or Katharine Hepburn were to have worked in this genre, they would be too bright on our screens to show the darker side of society. Along with Barbara Stanwyck, Bogart was able to succeed in film noir because of a world weary quality seen beneath the surface. Here, he is an innocent man who escapes from San Quentin to return to San Francisco and prove his innocence of killing his wife and undergoes plastic surgery. For 3/4 of the film, you only hear his voice, and like "The Lady in the Lake", this is a powerful narrative that makes the story intriguing. We only know what the real character looks like because of a few shots of his picture in the papers. But when Bogart is unwrapped, sees his face for the first time, and realizes he doesn't look like a bulldog or a monkey, you sense the world weariness isn't gone, only hidden. Lauren Bacall is the mysterious lady who agrees to help him, and you know from the beginning that she has underlying motives that could be either good or bad, but still there just the same.Tom D'Andrea is fascinating as the friendly cab driver who if played wrong could be extremely annoying. His story of the man with the gold fish is both funny and touching, a desperate attempt of a man alone in the world reaching out to a stranger for simple conversation. Houseley Stevenson gives a truly spooky performance as the plastic surgeon, and the scene where Bogart comes out of the anesthesia after the surgery is almost something you'd expect in a Val Lewton horror movie. And then there's Agnes Moorehead, giving one of her gloriously bitchy performances as a woman whom today we'd call bi-polar, but she is so much more. Moorehead, along with Judith Anderson and Gale Sondergaard, was a delightful screen dark lady, adding her theatrical roots to a characterization that is unforgettable. She may only have a few scenes, but boy, do you remember her when the film is over. Some great 40's shots of "the city by the bay" (particularly a scene under the Golden Gate Bridge) makes this a must for lovers of both film noir and films shot on location. The scene of the widowed mother and the friendly man on the bus towards the end is a nice touch for Bogart's sadly cynical character to witness. Like the song heard throughout the movie, this film is "Too Marvelous for Words".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience you will never forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart made many great films during his prime time era of the 1940's. This being one of them, but it is very unusual in the stylistic direction of anything you have probably seen him in.The first hour or so into Dark Passage is in first person view, with various camera shots. For a film made in 1947. Today there is so many things possible with the computer and CGI, but with this being made from real people, and real things it makes it more impressive than anything you will see in 3D or computer generated today.Bogart plays a man who must undergo plastic surgery after escaping from prison and is wanted by the police everywhere from the verdict of murdering his wife, which he did not do. This again is why the first half is filmed in first person view. Also it shows that the lack of technology made them a bit more creative than what you would see today.For every Film-Noir there is dark movies, and for every one that Bogie did, this ranks high as in the darkest films he ever made. There is a lot of suspense, and build up in the plot that I will not give away and force you to watch and experience on your own. I gave this movie a solid 10 out of 10, which I normally won't give. It's worth every bit of it. Sadly this movie is not well known as The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca but I believe it stands as a monument in creativeness from the late 1940's with it's first person view camera shot, and the storyline is very well plotted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film noir thriller with odd dreamlike atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something I love in movies and it's common in a lot of my favourites. One character begins relating something to the protagonist, it could be something trivial and very specific and not even marginal to the plot but completely circumstantial, and then it slowly drifts into the abstract and the meaningful. And it's usually not just the actual spoken words that suggest icebergs beneath the tip of it, but something more intangible that vaguely hits me on a guttural level. It could be a certain kind of look in the character's face, a certain kind of nuanced delivery, a sound cue in the background, or usually a combination of these. An inverse breakdown in communication takes place there. "Now we're truly communicating". At around the half hour mark, Vincent Parry, escaped convict on the run for the murder of his wife, visits a plastic surgeon to get a new face. The plastic surgeon begins talking to him about how he perfected his own technique before being kicked out of the Medical Association, then they discuss the price, the plastic surgeon says how he could make anyone look like a bulldog or a monkey and he grimaces in a strange eerie way looking straight in the camera (which is a subjective shot of Vincent Parry looking up at the surgeon), then somehow the surgeon is saying that "there's only fear, a fear of getting hurt and a fear of dying", and for just a moment there's magic in the air, that weird feeling that we're talking about something else here, something really important that you should be paying attention to, life and death.That's 80% of what makes Dark Passage great. There's a faint air of something half-remembered in the hours after waking up, an odd dreamlike ambiance that suggests meaningful things if only you could put the pieces of the puzzle in the right order, a certain weird uncomfortable way in which characters seem to know key things about the protagonist. Vincent Parry tries to hide, indeed the movie hides him from our view for the first half by never showing his face, everything is subjective shots from his POV (which means amazing camera-work that glides over fences and peers from behind bushes, it travels stairs and goes through car doors), yet characters simply walk up to him and know who he is and what he's done. It's all a bit like a nightmarish guilt trip except it's never explicit that way, it's encoded inside a gripping noir thriller. Vincent Parry sneaks into his girl's house from the back to find a car parked outside, and the stripped seats set off bells in his head. Something's not quite right here.The rest 20% are small details and they have devils hiding in them. I wouldn't call Lauren Bacall beautiful, striking yes, her face is a mask that projects something indomitable and fierce, but when Bogart kisses her she tilts her head in a kind of funny way and her eyes get glazed over and husky and that's beautiful. I like how Bogart isn't cocksure about any of this, how he's shaken and gauche. Then we get lots of 'steep road' San Francisco atmosphere and two guys fighting with the Golden Gate bridge looming heavy in the background.In the end Vincent Parry kind of accepts his situation, he resigns not to fatalism but a certain kind of acceptance of inevitability and he is then able to find meaning in the resignation, so that he's all alone in the world with every cop in five states on his back, but he's got a girl somewhere that loves him, and they both have a small town by the sea somewhere in Peru where no one's looking for them and they can be alone with each other. Delmer Daves cuts to huge waves crushing down against an overcast sky and then Irene Jansen is there with him in a smokey tavern; they don't say a word, they just embrace and dance, and instead of it feeling contrived, it feels just right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and Bacall in an unsatisfying mystery, with Agnes Moorehead taking them all on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie which probably should have remained a book. For a Humphrey Bogart vehicle, it also has one fatal flaw. Bogart's voice was as distinctive as his face. It was impossible for me to disassociate the image of his face in my mind while I heard his voice during the first hour of the movie. Even after I finally realized that the faceless Vincent Parry would emerge from the bandages as Bogart, it made no difference. Seeing the real Parry's face in the newspaper 30 minutes into the movie didn't help. Parry's page-one photo was of a middle- aged, square-jawed, pencil-mustached man who could have been an unsuccessful insurance salesman. Pitching that face against Bogart's voice was jarring. Several other flaws drain a lot of energy from the movie. The coincidences undermine the story in a major way. There is a lot of narrative exposition. In other words, too much talk. The personal and romantic relationships among the characters, living and dead, is too complicated. There is no mystery; the killer is identified by just about everyone early in the story. The ending may be technically a happy one, but for an innocent man it seems unsatisfying. At another level, a Bogart movie with only his eyes for us to look at for a while is not effective. After the surgery just his eyes show through the bandages. For me, Bogart's eyes, sad and drooping, without the rest of his face lack a lot of energy. And Agnes Moorhead, when she's on a tear, can suck the air away from any actor who shares a scene with her. In Dark Passage, she's at the top of her game and makes everyone else, including Bogart, wilt a little next to her. Still, the movie has a great San Francisco look about it. Clifton Young as the baby-faced hood was fun. And Houseley Stevenson as the corrupt surgeon, amoral but with a sense of humor, stole every scene he was in. On balance, I think the movie might have worked better if it had been made as a straight B programmer with a competent but largely unknown actor as the lead, a red herring or two added and a more satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to suspend an elephant-sized amount of disbelief, but "Dark Passage" is still a compelling film noir because of the chemistry between Betty Perske ..., oops, I mean Lauren Bacall, and Bogie. Also, all the character actors give startlingly vivid performances. The fascinating location shots of San Francisco in the 1940s make the scenery practically a character in the movie.And, as for Agnes Moorehead, she steals every scene she's in. Her final confrontation with Bogart is absolutely riveting. She makes a scene that could easily be preposterous into something truly hair-raising.This was Warner Brothers studio firing on all cylinders during the peak of film noir. You can't be a noir freak and not check it out.In one respect, it's a time capsule from another era and that's because of smoking. Not only does every single person in the movie smoke, they are constantly offering each other cigarettes, lighting each other's cigarettes, blowing out the smoke and gazing into each other's eyes as tendrils of smoke waft between them. Even with his face so bandaged his mouth is just a slit, Bogart smokes through a holder. With his nemesis holding a gun on him, what does Bogart want? A cigarette, of course. At one point, Bogart drops his cigarette on the floor and grinds it out with his shoe ? in someone's house! Amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writer director Delmar Daves gave the public a very intriguing film noir in this one. There is the illogic has to why the Lauren Bacall would do so much for the Humphrey Bogart character as she says after she's saves him from capture that she didn't him. That she though her father was wrongly convicted for killing her step mother isn't enough.However, location shots of 40's San Francisco as seen through Bogart's eyes is quite innovative and unique. It also had its limitations but it saved Bogart from wearing a face mask and help establish he's the main character throughout. Also, why would Clifton Young be so interested, whose appearance is very similar to Elisha Cook, Jr. and in fact that Bogart would take his gun away from him recalls The Maltese Falcon.Also, why would the cab driver be so helpful? However, every movie requires suspense of belief and even has a fun surrealistic moment when Bogart gets drugged and goes under so he can finally look like himself.I somewhat know that Agnes Moorehead was the real villain behind it all and the scene where Bogart confronts her as one of the many highlights of this film.The plot holes are enough to stop this being considered a masterpiece like the other three Bogart - Bacall films are. But both are in top form and actually this is the most film norish of the four they did together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie &amp; Bacall in the first FPS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually one of my favorite Bogart/Bacall vehicles. The storyline is a bit fantastic, especially for 1947, but not beyond belief and if you can immerse yourself into the environment, it is a very enjoyable ride.Note: Bogie was always better playing the borderline character, neither entirely good nor entirely bad. It is honestly closer to what we all really are ourselves; neither the devout hero nor the dedicated villain.In this flick, he is a falsely accused and convicted murderer who escapes to settle the issue and find justice. For pretty much the first third of the movie, you see things through his eyes, like a FPS video game. You and he go for some plastic surgery and then experience a fairly rapid healing. The upside is that you have Bacall to look at during your recuperation! Agnes Morehead (Bewitched's 'Endora') is perfectly despicable in a form that makes you really wonder if she was ever liked by anyone, even when she was young.I am a fan of movies from this era and a Bogie fan as well so I am admittedly biased. But I do also hold many critics accountable on this reel because most of the complaints are artificially generated so there's something to write about. Simply put, this isn't a movie that was ever designed to bring an Oscar but rather, one that was made for fans of the actors and genre. In that aspect, it easily does well.For the unique storyline (for the time) and the presentation (FPS) and the setting (San Francisco) and the leading actress (Bacall) and the villainess (Moorehead), this is a movie worth seeing at least once. And if you're like me, every time it comes around on the classic movie networks! ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and Bacall do it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Richard Maltin nailed when he said that "Dark Passage" is not a great film, but it IS a very good one.It's actually a bit of a shock that this film survived Jack Warner's watch-dogs. I mean ... come on! A Humphrey Bogart picture where we don't even get to see his face until the last 40 minutes? Did someone fall asleep during the script approval process, here? Despite all of this, "Dark Passage" is a very decent Warner film noir ... with roots firmly embedded in the pulp fiction universe (Delmer Daves' screenplay was adapted from Dave Goodis' pulp novel). Plus, we get to see "That man" Bogart, and "that woman" Lauren Bacall, "together again." More than any other film that I've seen her in, "Dark Passage" features Bacall at her most charming best. And last but not least, as the audience, we're treated to what was considered a fairly revolutionary camera trick: first-person perspective, thanks to the invention of a new hand-held camera. Compounded by some really awesome San Francisco locations, there's really nothing that keeps our minds from wandering during this picture. The story is: Vincent Parry (Bogart) is an escaped convict, fleeing from San Quinton when we first meet him. After he knocks out a motorist and steals his clothes, Irene Jansen (Bacall) drives him into San Francisco ... where she obliges him with an expensive set of clothes and a thousand bucks. From there, he pays a plastic surgeon a 2 a.m. visit for a face lift. After some pretty nifty scalpel moves and a surreal dream sequence, Parry awakes with his head and face covered in bandages. Somewhere along the way, Parry's best friend is killed and the fore-mentioned motorist decides to extort Jansen, through Parry, for a couple hundred thousand dollars. In addition, Parry's old flame (consummately played by Agnes Moorehead), who sent him up years prior on a murder rap, has begun to cause trouble for Parry and Jansen. At the end of "Dark Passage," we're led to believe that things are going to end on a rather bleak note, but ... as in all good noirs ... things never are as they appear.I'll skip my comments on Bogart, simply because he's a hard act to top. What could be said about this man that's not already been famously stated a thousand times before? Even when we can't see his face ... when we have to rely on the sound of his voice ... Bogart dominates just about every facet of this picture. So much so that I started to feel a knot in my stomach when I fell in love with Lauren Bacall all over again. Had Bogart caught wind of this, I was kind of worried he might have stepped out of my television screen and roughed me over once or twice.But in all ... I think my favorite part of "Dark Passage" is the precise characteristic that most loathe about it: the absence of Bogart's physical presence throughout most the film. I'd really like to think that Delmer Daves was, rather sadistically, poking and jibing at us in forcing us us wait for "that man" to finally make his full appearance on screen. If that really was the case, then congratulations, Mr. Daves. More than any other actor that I can think of, Humphrey Bogart is a man who is well worth waiting for. I think this carved out a great new dimension to the film. Had it not been included, I'm afraid "Dark Passage" might have only be remembered as being, well, just another trifling all-star thriller. To me, "Dark Passage" is very entertaining because of its noir value. There's a lot better out there, lurking in the proverbial shadows. But why complain about it? We're presented with some extremely talented actors ... and given a dark, creative perspective on the genre. If you get a chance, check this film out, along with "Dead Reckoning," starring Bogart and the sultry Lizabeth Scott. It's another staple noir film that is visually stunning ... with characters that burn right off the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Born and raised in San Francisco, I really enjoyed discovering this movie recently. The City's atmosphere and location filming was wonderful to see and very nostalgic. I got a big surprise, however, when I saw Bogart's character at the little parking lot. It seemed strangely familiar! Then he goes into this hotel. Before he entered, my mind began to anticipate the hotel desk setup, and that there would be an elevator at the rear of the small lobby on the left side. Oh, I realized, that's the Keane hotel on Mission Street between 6th and 7th Streets. Our godparents owned it back in the 1950's! I never knew it was in a movie. Also, the small parking lot next to it (barely large enough to hold the angled/parked cars), was where my father used to park and then walk to the back to Stevenson Street and then down to 6th Street to the bar he owned (6th Street Rendezvous). Great Bogart movie, great nostalgic 1947 locations, and special memories for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course when you have a big star like Bogart, as much camera time as possible is desired by the movie studio as well as the audience.However, this is as unique an approach as I have ever seen to justifying the facial change. For those who are critical that he had the bandages on too long and it got overdone or they should have used another actor to play the convict and then after the face lift- low and behold it's Bogart.....rubbish! How would you convince the audience the other actor was the same guy? You'd have to find somebody with the same size and dimensions as Bogart and DUB THE VOICE on someone who Bogart's voice doesn't go with? To me, that would be worse! This way there was mystery, imagination as to what he looked like before.Remember this was during an era of imagination and a lot of stories were done on radio where imagination was the main key to helping unravel mystery in the story. So the people of this day still had an imagination and may have been putting their own idea of what he would look like into the story....that way, every audience member could get what they imagined and liked out of it. If they showed some wanna be actor as Bogart's character, many of those imaginative viewers would have been disappointed and not liked the rest of the film.It's true the Moorehead steals some of the thunder with her scary performance as the woman always snooping, always in the know, trying to find out everyone's secrets.But Bogart and Bacall give under-rated performances in what I think was an imaginative piece of film noir and a thriller that really thrills.</fullReview>

I first remember her a Endora on Bewitched, but in later years saw her in this film as well as Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte as a slovenly &amp; slightly crazy housekeeper.

		<shortDescription>Not Grade-A Noir. But who cares, Lauren Bacall is in it at age 22!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of "Dark Passage" is contrived and doesn't always fit with human nature too well. There's just too many people coming to the aid of a escaped violent felon for the plot to ring true. And, some characters are just one-dimensional, especially weakling George Fellsinger, who just wants to go to South America and play his trumpet. HUH? Sam the Cabbie is funny at times, but why such a goody two-shoes in a film-noir? He's got to have sinister motives, but doesn't and abruptly exits the action. Then, there's Irene Jansen, who sympathizes with Bogie's Vincent Parry becuz her own father was wrongfully-accused of murder to and died a broken man in San Quentin. She's a sophisticated dame, but oddly takes Vincent into her home, not yet knowing who's really guilty of the murder he got sent up the river for. Her behavior is unbelievable, but, as I already said, who cares what she's doing, it's the eternally-sexy Lauren, so let's us men just take a long, longing look at her for fantasy's sake if nothing more. Other characters ARE well-developed and satisfying, tho. Baker, the cheap opportunist, who pops up like Memesis during Bogart's attempts to clear himself, gets just what is coming to him near the end, but not until he delivers his timeless line, "There's a LOT of smart guys in prison." The skillful Agnes Moorehead gives us a fine villianess as Madge, who is somehow involved in every life in San Francisco; as Vincent explains it, "Knows everyone, pesters everyone." We learn to hate this character early on, and she never disappoints by turning good or kind. The Madge part deserves a better script. Houseley Stevenson as Dr. Coley is my favorite minor player in this film, perhaps in all of the noir genre. He's smart, skillful, kicked out of the medical association, on the edge of the law, and pleasingly-mercenary. The dream sequence involving this plastic surgeon is a real classic, mimicked time and again in various TV shows and theatrical spoofs. We instinctively distrust Dr. Coley, with his shabby office and harlequin face; Vincent could end up either turned over to the police or shamefully disfigured. Dr. Coley warns 'If a good plastic surgeon really hated someone, he could make him look like a monkey or a bulldog' as the Doc makes grotesque faces in front of our poor hero. What bedside anti-manner!! Still, Vincent puts himself in the Doctor's hands completely and to good effect. So, as with many films of the 30's and 40's, the sleazy down-and-outters turn out to be minor heroes while the hero and heroine must fear and avoid society's cruel authorities. The first sequences of this film are innovative, with the "camera in the hero's head" device. The roll down the hill in the garbage pail is nifty, too. You can almost feel every bump and bruise that Bogie is getting. Vincent's verbalized thoughts are done well, and don't irritate as with some movies where it's been tried. I re-watch this once a year or so, and most people will enjoy it just fine, if they suspend logic somewhat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart on the run...to find his wife's murderer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir was at its peak in the late 1940s and this is one of Bogey's best--although as far as the fireworks between him and Lauren Bacall, they're there but in a minor key. Actually it's Bacall who has the more difficult performance since he is swathed in bandages for the first part of the film while she looks after his every need, the camera on her as he sees her, delivering lines with that confident, casual air. In this respect, the film is more successful than 'Lady in the Lake' in its use of the subjective treatment of the camera. It's one of her better performances in a long career of playing such women. The plot sounds like a rehash of 'The Fugitive'--you know, man on the lam has to run from authorities to seek his wife's killer--a murder he is charged with. Delmer Daves makes smart use of the low-key San Francisco backgrounds and others have interesting supporting roles. But it is Agnes Moorehead who gets the juciest scene with Bogart when she becomes overwrought with guilt. Fascinating film noir that is made to order for Bogart fans--not great but a definite winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked the other Bogie and Bacall pairing, you'll like this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a sad and ironic fact that, for all the great chemistry Bogie and Bacall brought to the screen, they only made four films together. It is yet another one that "Dark Passage" is the one that is the least known of all of them. Just about any Bogie enthusiast has heard of "The Big Sleep". I would say an equal number at least know about "Key Largo". There may be a few less who know of "To Have and Have Not", but I wouldn't think that many. But "Dark Passage", true to it's name, escapes notice and attention. Why is that?It is a film that works superbly...provided you're willing to take it on it's own terms. As there's not that many clues or that many suspects, one can't really call this a mystery. Thriller would be a little closer to the mark, though I wouldn't say that it would be dead-on target. As I feel like the best scenes in this film revolve around the romance between Dr. Vincent Parry and Ms. Irene Jansen, perhaps one could call it a noir-romance.That may seem like an odd designation but bear with me. "Dark Passage" has definite elements of film noir in it (protagonist with the odds stacked against him, night scenes, friends who keep dying) but also those of romance, not the least of which is the theme of two lovers coming together in spite of all the obstacles in their path (most of which are planted by Madge Rapf, played by the underrated Agnes Moorehead). I imagine that it's a concoction that most mainstream critics find hard to swallow, but, thanks to believable and great performances by the ever-great Humphrey Bogart and Ms. Lauren Bacall (in fact, I would say that this is probably the best performance I have seen of hers to date), it makes it seem...real.As was said in it's original theatrical trailer, "Dark Passage" is "the best yet" of Bogie and Bacall. If you liked the better known pairings between the two, do yourself a favor and see this one.</fullReview>

Set and Bogart performance elements of this film that I would call very good.The film is all developed separately. Nothing much is interwoven in the noir themes. The manhunt, romance and eventually obviously dismissal mysteries. Bogart's character is definitely stiff. It is interesting to hear his voice, and not see it. Unfortunately, he was in that part got the most space. The film which lacks action. Incidents are present, but quickly go limp. Climaxes almost non-existent.Humphrey Bogart as Vincent Parry, his appearance for the first time was not so impressive. The obvious failure. Bogart always bring a good performance, but I repeat, it was interesting to watch the movie from his perspective. Bogart's eye.Lauren Bacall as Irene Jansen won the space with the main actor. In scenes with Bogart she is pretty good. Simply work. If she focused it can be called a good chemistry.Agnes Moorehead as Madge Rapf is fast becoming the main villain, perhaps by mistake. It brings the most energy in the film and is quite intrusive character.Solid film in which experimentation and lost in some basic segments.</fullReview>

One of my main interests was the scenery of 40s San Francisco when the US was still as Trump would say a great country.Bacall is 24 when this was made and Bogart 49. I got tired of viewing the glowing pans of her face and anorexic body. Bogart is much more watchable and down to earth. I knew the score it became popular in and of itself.It gets a star for the noir quality...

		<shortDescription>Unique Film Noir Vehicle for Bogie and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bit different from other Bogart movies, nevertheless, this one remains perhaps my favorite due to its creative first person shooting. That effectively forces the actors to talk to the audience or camera. With that and the surgery, we never see Bogie's face until an hour into the movie. Which is why I say this is unique and definitely worth seeing. It's a bit naive with the surgery and Madge's curtain call as the script is sometimes awkward but the plot is still quite creatively put together. Irene Janssen (Bacall) is the mysterious helper to the innocent escapee Vincent Parry (Bogart) and it seems her attraction is fetish but it somehow adds to the danger and shows she's a match for Bogie. It's fun when she reveals her interest in Parry to Madge and Bob (sometimes the truth isn't as believable as a lie). The supporting roles were terrific and director Delmer Daves had good talent to work with but somehow a couple awkward spots just keep this movie from becoming a top-notch classic. Bogie shows a soft, vulnerable side since he can't really do much to help himself (except run) in this movie but relies on strangers to help him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Last Great Noir of the 40's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is probably the first of it's kind where a "Crook" (Even though the character "Vincent Parry" pledges his innocence all through the film), rather that be shot or arrested, gets "away with it". This film directly defied the HAYES OFFICE and, as a film - "Gets Away with It".Another first was that the beginning of this film does not show "Vincent Parry" at all for the first 45 minutes, so for half of the film, we never see Humphrey Bogart and his brand-new hairpiece - The camera angles gives the viewer the impression that they are looking through Parry's eyes. And as a lot of that view is of "Betty" Bacall, this is not a bad thing.The final film first is the role of Agnes Moorehead as "Madge" - Instead of portraying a spinster Aunt, a Mother, a Pioneer wife, or any of the many other character roles she has played - In this film, she surprises us by being "Madge Rapf" - The nosy Redhead who had a lot to do with the Parry Character being imprisoned.Of the four films where Betty Bacall appears with Humphrey Bogart, this is the third and final film where she plays the hard, independent and worldly-wise young woman. This was probably the peak of her screen beauty, after this film, she was officially a Woman, rather than a girl. This film is the first very mature role she had, a difficult part, which she got better at as she also matured.Tom D'Andrea's cabby coupled with Housely Stevenson's crooked plastic surgeon were a couple of great Warner's characters - The Parry character was very lucky - Perhaps too lucky, but once a while a persons luck has got to hold out, Parry's luck holds out just enough. When the "Doctor" starts in, and mentions things like Bulldogs and Monkeys and Botched Plastic Surgeries, is a perfect setup for the little "Dream" sequence as Parry is operated on. Of course, it would be great for anybody to "wake up" as Humphrey Bogart.In a way, that whole section of film was "borrowed" for the 2002 film "Minority Report" where Tom Cruise needs to get his eyes replaced and he has to visit a doctor who was a lot like the "Dr Coley" from this film.There is a little 3-way confrontation between Bacall, Bruce Bennett and Agnes Moorehead which is one of the best double talk sessions ever recorded on film- A clever bit of writing which is also used as expose, revealing more of the backstory of Parry and his hapless deceased/murdered wife, leading to the "unveiling of Bogart" - One whole hour into the film.My only regret is that Dark passage is a short film at 106 Minutes, or maybe it that it moves very fast which may be the appeal of this film. Fast or slow, this film is 106 minutes of one of the best Delmar Davies films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOIR NON-SEQUITUR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ghoulishly entertaining noir balderdash is a star vehicle obviously assembled to pair off Bogart and Bacall after they scorched the screen together with their sizzling repartee in "To Have and Have Not" and "The Big Sleep". Not a lot of sexy banter this time around; it's all coincidences and threats and double crosses, with Bogie's face wrapped in bandages (he is an escaped convict from San Quentin who undergoes plastic surgery), and sleazy rascals ignominiously falling to their deaths for reasons too contrived to give a damn about. With all the overplotted razzle-dazzle going on, and since we don't see Bogart's face until the last third of the movie, this is like a screwball farce played by cadavers - loony things happen all over but nobody musters the required wit to play them for laughs. Featuring an understandably befuddled Humphrey Bogart in the kind of role Bela Lugosi could have brought off to insanely brilliant perfection. Also with Betty Bacall as a ravishing cardboard cutout, and Bruce Bennett, Tom D'Andrea, Clifton Young, Douglas Kennedy, and Agnes Moorehead again playing an unpleasantly vicious bitch with all the contempt her part really deserves. Delmer Daves carefully directed the traffic, following his hilariously outlandish script, based on the novel by David Goodis, a writer of masochistic skid row fables that must have been admired by Eddie Wood, whose own crime books and movies "Dark Passage" almost uncannily resembles. Well shot by Sid Hickox, mostly on location in San Francisco, using the then-faddish subjective camera technique (where we literally are the eyes of the hero/camera), also used in "Lady in the Lake", a Raymond Chandler/Philip Marlowe/Robert Montgomery thriller released the same year by MGM, directed by Montgomery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most Hitchcockian Bogart movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there's a lot more to say about "Dark Passage", I'm only going to explore the film from one angle, which is its similitude with Hitchcock movies, the Hitchcock movies featured in this review contain spoilers, the titles are mentioned in the beginning of each paragraph.It's regrettable that Hitchcock and Bogart, two icons on their respective fields and of the same generation (they were born the same year), never collaborated. Was Hitchcock too protective of his aura not to let Bogie steal his thunder, or was the opposite? I do believe that a Hitch-and-Bogie movie wouldn't have been as inconceivable as having John Wayne in a musical, for there is at least one Bogart movie that proves me right, a film with something Hitchcockian about his character, Vincent Parry, whose face is only revealed at the third act, but I'll get to that later.Yes indeed, "Dark Passage" is either full of reminiscences or premonitions of what would become Hitch's instantly recognizable trademarks, plot and style-wise. It's a paranoid thriller enrobed with a restrained romance finally blooming when approaching the finale, it's a suspenseful drama where everyone is a suspect from the mind of the wrongly suspected one, it's a tale of false identities and real assassins, it's one of the most memorable movies set in San Francisco and it's the third starring the legendary Bogart and Bacall duo. Yet, for once, the fascination doesn't rely on their undeniable chemistry (that mostly showed through Howard Hawks' movies) but on these little details that will remind you of Hitch's classic, so let's start the count.1/ THE WRONG MAN / SUSPICION / NORTH BY NORTHWEST: The false identity or the wrongly accused man is a common source of thrills in Hitch movies: a generally harmless man taken for a dangerous criminal, especially when every friend he visits meets with an unfortunate accident? that's a premise, banal to say the least, but it gets spiced up when the hero's only way to prove his innocence is risking his life and dirtying his hands. In "Dark Passage", Parry said farewell to Irene (Bacall) but his honor forces him to come back when her life's threatened by a blackmailer, just like in "North by Northwest" when Thornhill is free but learns that Eve is still in danger. There's always the moment where the protagonists turn from passive to heroic, many Bogart characters show their nobility at the end of the film, like many Hitchcock heroes? in other words, they're late-bloomers.2/ PSYCHO : The film was released with the Red Scare as political backdrop, it failed at the box-office after Bogart and Bacall retracted their protest actions and ended up testifying before the HUAC, but it's nonetheless a film of its era : dark, suspicious and paranoid. On that last aspect, "Dark Passgae" is a showcase of how paranoia can be conveyed by good writing and film-making, like Marion Crane, after she stole the money in "Psycho", every encounter is startling and unsettling, the less she wants to talk, the more talkative people get, the less suspicious she tries not to, the more she looks, exactly what Vincent goes through during the film. A man asking for a match, a cab driver too much questions, leading him to a plastic surgeon, but it could've been a police office as well ? and speaking of cops, the dialog where a new-faced Vincent tries to outsmart a detective is pure example of verbal suspense. Action is an easy catalysis for thrills but to make it through dialogs is pure virtuosity.3/ VERTIGO: Perhaps after "Vertigo", this is the only film where I saw relevance for it being set in San Francisco (not just for a car chase scene). The local touch is significant to the plot; not just some screenplay blank filler, like the scene where an exhausted Vincent climbs the interminable stairs to go to Irene's house on the highest side of that bumpy town, or how about his fist-fight near the Golden Gate. While it's easily forgettable that "Maltese Falcon" was set in San Francisco, it's rather impossible with "Dark Passage".4/ REAR WINDOW / VERTIGO : The fall of Madge (Agnes Moorehead) out of the window looks exactly like Jeff's fall at the climax of "Rear Window" and it's more convincing, too, but it's also closer to those from "Vertigo" ... with the obligatory shrill female scream, naturally.5/ SPELLBOUND : And lastly, there's this brilliant piece of surrealism during the face transformation sequence, working like an original and creatively designed parenthesis and a great transition between the first third of the film (subjective camera) and the second (Bogart's face covered with bandages), a sort of kaleidoscope of all the characters confusingly interacting in Vincent's mind? who's with him? who's against him? This is not Dali with his eyes and scissors, but it's mesmerizing nonetheless. Isn't the mark of a great movie to blow your mind, just when you think you had enough? with the long overuse of the subjective camera? Speaking of the subjective camera, isn't that something to have one third of the film without showing Bogart's face (for obvious reasons) and the second third in bandages. That's the kind of audience-fooling, tricks Hitch loved to do, he who deprived his audience from Marion Carne all through "Psycho" second half, Delmer Daves deprives us from Bogie's face all through the first (and more) but we don't lose much since the film is rich in great supporting performances notably, from Houseley Stevenson as the wacky (in a spooky way) mad-scientist, to Agnes Moorehead whose interplays with Bogart almost overshadowed the romantic interludes with Bacall.Speaking of romance, the film could have perfectly ended in the bus station, I don't understand why such a great film-noir had to end with a sappy ending ? la "Sabrina", but we can forgive Delmer Daves, even Hitchcock used to end his movies like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is the only way out !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the golden age of noir movies, (Delmer Daves) made another fine one. The story is simple yet bitter. A usual man is wrongfully accused. While being chased by the police, he chases many clues to just prove his innocence and live his freedom. The chase turns out to be doomed as much as it takes place in a world with no freedom for the innocent. The movie has interesting points. Some of them just blow my mind.The first third, done with a camera that sees only what the lead sees, is totally brilliant. The "subjective camera technique" originally began in director Rouben Mamoulian's (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ? 1931), at the first 5 minutes of it. Now, while being used in sure longer sequence, in a genre movie produced by major studio, it was boldly experimental and ambitiously exploring. It, with the narration, embodied how the lead is lonely and lost; integrating his mind, body, and heart on one side, and us as viewers on the other. And it represented a side of noir in pure and visual precedent that with Bogart's voice became a piece of the noir history indeed. The next stop, putting a gun in the lead's hand and many targets in front of him, then launching the first-person shooter video games in the 1990s (such as Doom and Half-Life).After the accidental death of the woman who had somehow the sole proof of the lead's innocence, he escapes perplexed and in great pain. At that moment he's pictured, from a certain angle, running alone opposite to an empty city. It's one immortal shot in my viewpoint, showing how that man is tiny in front of huge conquering monster buildings / circumstances that blockade him completely. It's a tableau of guiltless man vs. ruthless, literally stony, city. The next stop is the much sophisticated new wave cinema, then the much plain TV exploitation (The Fugitive for instance !). Before its last moment it gets very dark. The lead is hunted by stronger everything and everyone. He failed utterly at clearing his name. And nevertheless, he's not beaten or in jail, he's dancing with his baby happily, and let the world burn down (that meaning was portrayed best by the jazzy closing credits). It could be a dream the lead had while being in the abysmal crises, it could seem as forced happy ending for tragic, too suffocating, deadlock the writer couldn't solve. But for me it's where the movie's core exists : when justice is totally blind, world is hell of evil, and death is everywhere?love, if you lucky enough to have it, is all what matters.I have watched Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in this movie many times, but nothing is more truthful, romantic and delightful than their last scene. OH MY GOD; this is real love on screen folks. See his thirsty look, her bewitching, deeply relaxed, smile, the love glow in their eyes, all was natural. The reaction upon Bogart's face resembles a one upon an old expatriate who finally went home (the 25 years younger Bacall was, in fact, Bogart's fourth, longest and last marriage). See how she throws her head over his shoulder, dancing their sorrows away; she even forgot to put down her purse, but who cares, the way Bogart holds her gives ultimate safety, and there is nothing beyond that. It's ? as a whole ? like the title of the music they were dancing to : "Too Marvelous for Words". This is noir at its darkest and its happiest as well. I see it eventually as an optimistic movie due to its faith that every dark passage has one exit; its name is love. P.S : This is my review number 1000. I didn't find love yet, it didn't find me either. Maybe tomorrow then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Last time I Gave a Dam, the Judge gave me Twenty Years "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The duo of Bogie and Bacall created many memories which immortalized them in the hearts of their fans. For me these two were incredible together and their magical formula is rare for a married couple. Nevertheless, their partnership made this movie. The 1947 film is called " Dark Passage " and is the story of Mr. Vincent Perry (Humphrey Bogart) a convicted murderer who escapes from prison with one idea in mind, to find the real killer of his wife. Soon after his escape he is befriended by Irene Jansen (Lauren Bacall) who actually believes he's innocent and Sam, The Cabby (Tom D'Andrea). It's Sam who suggests he visit Dr. Walter Coley (Houseley Stevenson) a Plastic Surgeon who gives him a new face. Once Perry removes the bandages, he begins searching for the killer, and is beset with revolving questions and an odd assortment of characters which include Bruce Bennett, Agnes Moorehead and Clifton Young. Drama is at its best with this Classic movie, but watching Bogie at his best has always produced nothing but net and in this film the audience awaits said artistry as he removes the identity changing bandages. Excellent and easily recommended. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're a guy with plenty of trouble"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dark Passage (1947)' opens like a first-person shooter video game, the camera taking the main protagonist's point-of-view, and generally restricting the audience to what Humphrey Bogart can see. However, in choosing to utilise this unusual technique, director Delmer Daves does something very dangerous, almost suicidal: he doesn't show us Humphrey Bogart! This was not the first major use of the first-person perspective; Rouben Mamoulian tried it for the first five minutes of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)' and, even more impressively, Robert Montgomery constructed an entire detective story from Philip Marlowe's perspective in 'Lady in the Lake (1947).' But 'Dark Passage' feels more audacious than both of these, most of all because Daves chose, for the entire opening half of his picture, to obscure the face of Hollywood's most celebrated and recognised star. When studio head Jack Warner asked for just another Bogart-Bacall picture, he sure as hell didn't expect this. It was a gamble that ultimately failed (financially, that is), but I can respect any filmmaker who's willing to mix things up a bit.The film noir style is well-known for its regular decline into the creepy, surreal and absurd side of human existence. Writer David Goodis originally adapted the film's screenplay from his own 1946 novel, though Daves was subsequently commissioned to satisfactorily rewrite it. 'Dark Passage' follows escaped criminal Vincent Parry (Bogart), who claims to be innocent of his wife's murder, and who uses his tentative freedom to try to clear his name. After a sympathetic taxi driver (Tom D'Andrea) points Vincent in the direction of a demented plastic surgeon (Houseley Stevenson), he eventually accepts the accommodation of a mysterious young woman, Irene Jansen (Lauren Bacall), who staunchly believes in his innocence. The supporting cast really shines here, particularly Clifton Young as a weaselly small-time crook who hatches an ambitious scheme to blackmail Irene for $60,000. Uniquely, much of the filming took place on-location in San Francisco, California, with the outdoor settings adding a vitality to the photography that is rather refreshing.The chemistry between Bogart and Bacall doesn't quite sizzle here as it usually does, and that our hero spends much of his time behind the camera certainly doesn't help. The film is strongest when it spends time with its supporting characters, which makes me think that 'Dark Passage' might have been a better film had it been cast with relative unknowns. Daves obviously produced the film with one eye on his prized romantic couple, and the accompanying marketing opportunities, and, consequently, the story often tries too hard to create a memorable romance. Though the plot begins to meander towards the predictable in its final reel, the opening acts prove especially engrossing, not only because of the intriguing camera gimmick, but because we absolutely have no idea where this unusual story, with its cast of incredibly offbeat characters, is trying to lead us. It's also rewarding to try and guess how long Jack Warner could tolerate not seeing Humphrey Bogart's face until he threatened to shoot somebody; I think we can safely estimate this figure to sit just beyond one hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining and a dynamite ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an odd film because for about the first 20 minutes, you never see the leading man's face, but instead see the world through his eyes. This was very unusual but made sense, as this character was an escaped convict and you only see him AFTER he receives extensive plastic surgery. I guess they could have either put a lot of makeup or prosthetics on Humphrey or re-dubbed the dialog with his voice, but both cases probably wouldn't have worked very well, so the gimmick they used was probably for the best.Bogart's escape, it seems, was not orchestrated because he wanted to get away with murder, but to ultimately prove he never committed the crime in the first place. After receiving his new face, there were many twists and turns that occurred as he sought to re-investigate the crime and prove his innocence. Along the way, he was aided by Lauren Bacall. Her role, actually, was the poorest one in the film as the reasoning for her assisting Humphrey was pretty vague and I couldn't see a woman risk prison herself just because of some "gut instinct". But regardless, the rest of the film is exceptional--particularly the wonderful confrontation scene towards the very end. This and the final five minutes are HIGHLY UNUSUAL for 1940s film because what occurs isn't clichéd or formulaic. Finally, a movie that doesn't insult the viewer with a pat ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's get away from it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Escaping from San Quentin prison by hiding on a garbage truck, inside a garbage can, convicted wife-murderer Vincent Perry, Humphery Bogart, jumps out when the coast is clear and hitches a ride back to San Francisco. Baker, Clifton Young,the driver who picked Perry up gets suspicious when he hears a news report on his car-radio saying that a convict has escaped from San Quentin just fifteen minutes ago and then get's the hell beat out of him and left for dead by his new found passenger. Almost at once this young woman Irene Janson, Lauren Bacall, pops up and offers the dangerous escapee a ride back to her pad in Frisco without as much as a thought of the implications of her actions: aiding and abetting an escaped murderer. Watching the movie "Dark Passage" you wonder what exactly does Irene have to do with this convict-on-the-loose Perry? Why is she risking her freedom by getting caught by the cops with Perry in her station wagon or even possibly her life, by Perry a desperate and convicted escaped murderer killing her,in her actions? Back at her place with the befuddled Perry, he must have thought that he died in the San Quenin gas chamber and went straight to heaven, soon realizes that Irene is, what we would call today, a Vincent Perry groupie. It turns out that Irene attended his trial every day and not only collected every item in the papers about him but also wrote dozens of letters to the editors proclaiming Perry's innocence! It's also found out that Irene's own father was convicted, unjustly, of murdering his wife and Irene's step-mother and died in prison, which she didn't want to happen to Perry.Doing everything to make her guest comfortable, Irene buys him new and very expensive clothes and even gives him over $1,000.00 in cash. Perry now being free is determined to find the person who murdered his wife Greta and clear his name. It's during this time that Perry, with his photo plastered all over the newspapers, runs into this kind and understanding cabbie Sam, Tom D'Andrea. Sam knows that Perry is innocent just by looking at him, what a judge of character, and get's him to see a friend of his disbarred quack-doctor and plastic surgeon Walter Coley,Housely Stevenson. Coley is to give Perry a face-lift, or new face, so he wouldn't be recognized by the police who are on an all-state search for him. It turns out that even a new face can't help Perry with his every move and action giving him away. Perry is also involve in three more deaths while on the lamb which includes his trumpet-player friend George Fellsinger, Rory Mallinson, who he planned to skip out of the country with and end up in, of all places, Peru. Perry also kills Bake, in self-defense of course, who after recovering from the beating Perry gave him tracked Perry down to the home of the rich, and somewhat nutty, Irean. Blake tried to blackmail her, through Perry, for a payoff of $60,000.00. By far Perry's biggest disappointment was the demise, by accidentally falling to her death, of his ex-lover who framed him in his wife's as well as Georges murder the jealous and maniacal Madge Rlaph, Agnes Moorhead. with Madge's now gone the only person who could clear Perry of his wife's and George's murders is no longer around to confess to her, not Perry's, crimes. No longer able to prove his innocence Perry has only one option left to at least live out his life in relative freedom; a one-way ticket to a place called Piata Peru via Benton Arizona and having the star-struck Irene following him there when the heat's off. Like in the movie "Casablanca" with the song "As Time goes By" Bogie, Perry, and his girl in this movie Betty,Irene, have their favorite song that's played over and over again and ends the film with them together. The movie ends with Perry &amp; Irene dancing cheek-to-cheek in a petite ocean-side café in quaint and quite little Piata to the music of " Your just too Marvellous, too Marvellous for words".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb on all levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This vintage film noir from 1947 stars Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Sadly, it's one of their more forgotten efforts, rarely played on television (save specialty channels like AMC and TCM) and not given much of a DVD treatment in the vein of Bogie's other movies.However "Dark Passage" is easily one of his best films. It's enthralling, well-acted and very well directed. The methods and techniques were WAY ahead of their time - the first-person POV, for example, is something I can't recall seeing in films before "Halloween" in 1976.The real brilliance of this movie is that it hides the face of its hero for so long, then unmasks him s Bogart halfway through the film.The plot centers around Bogart escaping from jail to track down his wife's killer. It's nothing special. The best thing about this is how wonderfully ahead of its time it was.If you like film noir (as I do), you'll love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fairly entertaining film. I was very tired of the camera work before Bogart's bandages finally came off. Handing a cigarette to the camera, pouring it a drink, etc. wore thin for me rather quickly. However it's a good, fun ride with plenty of great performances and a great, tense moment at a diner. Bacall lives in a fabulous art deco building with a glamorous apartment filled with funky knick-knacks and styling chic furnishings. Agnes Moorehead is the character that you just love to hate, playing a part so evil she drips bile. Just don't stand too close to that window, Agnes! Plenty of crossing and double crossing goes on showing that there is no honor among thieves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strange, convoluted pseudo-mystery that doesn't quite deliver all that it promises. The 1st person POV stuff is a good hook, but we lose the chemistry of seeing the actors together (which is true for most 1st-POV stuff). And the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the potential of this device.I've seen this movie several times and have yet to understand the true relationships between all the characters; there are some wild coincidences. The ending left a bad taste in my mouth - it seems too easy and neatly tied up. But the acting is good and I love the line Bogart says to the plastic surgeon, "You're not gonna make me look like a bulldog are you?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twp-face Bogart bombs both as man &amp; star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In box-office flop DARK PASSAGE, Humphrey Bogart played a San Quentin Prison convicted murderer\escapee, who gets a new face from a defrocked plastic surgeon halfway through the flick while managing to cause the death of three more people. Ironically, according to the DVD talking heads, Bogie took time off during the shoot to travel to Washington, DC with his co-star\real-life wife Lauren Bacall as the front man for a group of 40 Hollywood crusaders intent on proving U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, R-WI, was destroying America with his paranoid witch hunt (which allowed conservative actors such as Reagan and Heston to take revenge against any screenwriter who'd ever given them a dirty look for slapping around women in L.A. bars by having McCarthy put them on a permanent "blacklist," which caused the writers to immediately lose their jobs, homes, wives, kids, and pets, leaving most of them to end starvation via suicide unless beaten to death by homeless guy thrill-killers first). As soon as craven studio money counters scolded Bogie, he swiftly put out a press release declaring himself a "bamboozled dope" for questioning McCarthy's sainthood. A month later, when McCarthy was exposed on TV as an alcoholic buffoon hellbent on wrecking U.S., Bogie's career took a permanent nosedive, since he'd exposed himself for all to see as more neurotic, wishy-washy, and "yellow" than his Capt. Queeg character (THE CAINE MUTINY) on Queeg's worst day.</fullReview>
