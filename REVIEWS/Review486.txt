		<shortDescription>Porn Doc Doesn't Fully Penetrate its Subjects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Changing careers is never easy, but it's even harder when your previous job includes starring in movies with titles like "Sorority Sex Kittens 3" and "Backstage Sluts," and doing anal is listed as a special skill. Bryce Wagoner's documentary, "After Porn Ends," interviews a variety of ex-porn stars to find out how they transitioned from adult video stardom to more mainstream lives. Real estate seems to be the preferred profession for a lot of them, though none of the women who went into that field?Houston, Raylene, Amber Lynn?stayed in it. Asia Carrera became a stay-at-home mom, while Crissy Moran and Shelley Lubben became born-again-Christians, renouncing their porn pasts. Self-employment is the easier path to building a life outside of porn: Randy West became a semi-pro golfer; the late John Leslie was a musician and painter (a pretty good one, too); and, perhaps the most interesting career switch, Tyffany Million (a.k.a. Sandra Margot) became a P.I. and bounty hunter. Seka is self-employed, but earns money from her website, capitalizing on her porn fame. Mary Carey used her porn notoriety to get some D-list recognition on reality shows and a couple publicity-grabbing runs for governor of California.Though "After Porn Ends" is fascinating, many of the stories start to sound alike. For the women, the narrative usually involves running away from an abusive family and battling drug and alcohol problems. For the men it's often a less complicated "Can you believe they PAY ME to have sex with all these women?" (Richard Pacheco recounts how he was contemplating studying to become a Rabbi when he was offered a part in a porn film. "It wasn't a tough decision," he says.) Though a good number of the former sex stars are fairly well-grounded ? notably Pacheco, Leslie, Seka, Million ? there is, predictably, a lot of sadness here. The pain is not always explicitly detailed and seldom explored, but it's usually visible. Just look at the eyes. Lubben, whose videography is so scant it barely justifies her inclusion in this documentary, and Moran seem to have psychological scars that go beyond their porn careers?scars that a devotion to God hasn't fully healed. As porn legend Nina Hartley observes: "A lot of people who are in porn have no business being in it." Besides the always enjoyable Hartley (I regret that her response to suggestions she enter politics can't be quoted here), former porn blogger Luke Ford and adult industry fixture William Margold offer insight to the pitfalls of life after porn. One of those pitfalls, it seems, is dealing with men like Ford and Margold, both of whom make it clear they don't have a high opinion of women in the industry (men in the X-biz are cool, though). Ford refers to women in porn as "prostitutes" and "hookers," and while starring in porn is similar, Ford's disdain is disingenuous. Margold at least acknowledges the hypocrisy of porn consumers looking down on adult video stars, but otherwise he's a Hawaiian shirt-wearing stereotype of a sleazy flesh peddler.Director Wagoner himself offers little insight, letting his subjects speak for themselves. On the surface this hands-off approach is a positive thing, preventing any moralizing or self-conscious sniggering, but there are several instances where I wished he'd asked follow-up questions, like when Lubben talks about how she and the man she eventually married got high on meth and discussed the bible(!), or when Mary Carey, the most vapid of the ex-porn stars, mentions that if she returned to porn she would, eventually, do a scene with a black man, seemingly implying an interracial scene is only a notch above gonzo porn.As other reviewers have mentioned, making a documentary about the lives of retired porn stars is so obvious it's amazing it hasn't been done before. Though Wagoner does a respectable job with "After Porn Ends," it's hardly definitive. There's room for this subject to be done again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting subject but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the topic interesting and think it was great that someone finally did a somewhat better job at the topic. It was very passive voice, no questions were asked, there were no interviews, just subjects talking, telling the story. Which was very humanizing but not as informative. I wonder why all the men subjects had been out of porn for so long. Surely there are younger men who have left porn. The industry has changed a lot. Thought their experiences weren't quite as relevant. Of course the bottom line is.....can you ever get a handle on how porn performers really feel about what they do or did? Would they tell the whole truth even if they could?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story You Don't See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Porn Ends (2010) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Director Bryce Wagoner takes a look at various porn stars and find out how they got into the business, what the work was like and then what they did with their lives after their career. Asia Carrera, Luke Ford, Mary Carey, Nina Hartley, Houston, John Leslie, Amber Lynn, Crissy Moran, Richard Pacheco, Raylene and Seka are just a few of the names who are interviewed about their time in the business and afterwards. I've seen quite a few documentaries on the porn industry and this one here is pretty good. Like most others, everyone who was involved each has a different story to tell as some are happy they did it, some blame the industry for taking advantage of their personal demons, some just want the money and that's it and others just want to be forgotten for what they did. The stuff here with Houston, who at one time held the record for a gang bang, was pretty interesting because of how she feels today and it's fascinating to hear her talk about how her daughter doesn't want her to go to certain functions because people will recognize her. Some other interesting stories deal with the downfall of Carrera whose life hit some very bad times after getting away from the business. It's doubtful fans of the genre are going to hear or learn anything new here but for the most part I think the film remains entertaining from start to finish. Those worried about actual hardcore footage have nothing to worry about as there's none of that but of course there's a lot of nudity. The only thing I would say is that I think a better film could be made out of interviewing those who didn't make it big. These people here mostly got fame and at least a lot of money for a short period of time. It would be interested to hear from those who got in the business hoping to make it big but just ended up in the more trashy side of things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique approach to an interesting topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining presentation and an interesting topic, I wonder why this movie wasn't made 20 years ago.I'm not a consumer of mainstream adult content, so I did not recognize the interviewees, however I was surprised at how easy it was to identify with them and understand the challenges that they face after they move on.I'm a fan of documentaries, so I'm biased toward the format, but Exxxit held my interest from beginning to end. In fact, I would like to see more work analyzing this industry, exactly because it is so unique and interesting.Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"X is forever."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite an interesting documentary film. I noticed it as a "new addition" to the Netflix streaming movies and watched it that way. One of those interviewed in the film is an agent in the porn film industry, and it is he who says "X is forever." And that is part of the running theme here. Many of the porn stars included in this film are in the 40 to 70 year old range, some of them out of the porn industry for some years. Yet, inevitably something creeps into their lives related to someone else finding out about their former careers. No matter what their current orientation, like strong Christian or real estate agent or just happily married and retired, it seems that yes, the "X is forever."Most of the females seem to have gotten into porn after family difficulties in their youth, while generally the men just lucked into it as a way to make a few extra bucks. Some of them, especially several of the women, come across as very intelligent and well-spoken. One, Asia Carrrera (birth name Jessica Andrea Steinhauser) is a member of Mensa. So in general all of them seem not too different from any random slice of life, except for their careers in porn film.Interesting documentary film, just to see what life after porn can look like. Of note, some of them have gotten back in again, often simply to supplement their income. Sex between two people has always been a private thing, "taboo" to share with family and friends, but many in the porn industry just see it as another, mostly emotionless, activity that they can get paid very well for.The film includes a modest amount of clips of films of the various stars, but in total it isn't even a "hard R" compared to many of the raunchy, R-rated films coming out regularly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are they now?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Porn ends is an insightful and often poignant documentary that not only reveals the different paths chosen by those who have retired from the adult movie industry, but which also delves into their reasons for entering that particular career in the first place.Amongst those interviewed for the film:Tiffany Millions, the bounty hunter/investigator, who has gone from sucking dick to being a private dick. Raylene, the estate agent, who turned to selling houses instead of her body. Crissy Moran, the religious convert, who is still to be found on her knees, only now it's while praying to God. Randy West, the golfer, who went from shaving his balls to hitting them. Amber Lynn, the counsellor, who now gives advice instead of head. John Leslie, the artist?less vinegar strokes, more brush strokes. Houston, the nursing student, who swapped ATM for A&amp;E.It's a wildly varying set of stories: some of the ex-pornstars seem to be thankful to the adult video industry for the money and opportunities that it afforded them, while others are clearly embarrassed or regretful about their past. Some of them entered the business out of choice, as a means of earning an easy wage, while others gravitated towards porn as the result of a difficult or abusive childhood. Some successfully stay out of porn, but others find it hard to say no forever. Whatever the case, it's interesting to see these people laying bare their souls instead of their bodies.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, aren't you? I didn't recognize you with pants on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before we start, a quick nit - why the "Ends" in the title, it doesn't add any understand-ability and it sounds more dramatic without it. Anyway, the documentary which covers precisely the material as advertised could easily have been a NPR "Frontline" installment except for the spliced in footage of the subjects' past lives. Kudos to Bryce Wagoner for using that footage both sparingly and as archival material rather than wallowing in it to raise the titillation factor of the film. Also kudos for a balanced presentation between "actors" who suffered from their prior involvement with those who profited from it and those for whom it was just something they did for a living in the past like selling insurance or bookkeeping. Of course, this does take some of heat out of the proceedings and the film does allow the audience's minds to wonder on several occasions particularly during extended interviews. Also, the subject is limited: of course, most former stars will go on to some of a normal life while others will hang on to the industry given a lack of other employment options. In short, a tidy but limited documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immensely entertaining, based on true story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over a dozen adult entertainment industry titans are interviewed for the documentary, including Asia Carrera, Nina Hartley, Mary Carey, Houston, Randy West, John Leslie, Amber Lynn, and Seka. If you're looking for something celebratory of the adult entertainment industry, go elsewhere. Dark and gritty at times, it's far from the most flattering look at the industry. Curious about the film and its sudden surge of popularity on Netflix, Poguide.com the director, Bryce Wagoner, to discuss why adult film starlets bow out of the business and end their careers. It's a complicated process with no easy individual answer. In short, Wagoner declares the age of the porn-star to be dead. "To be frank, you used to be able to have a relationship with these people over a number of years. Now it's 30, 40, 50 times a year you're going to see this person. You wouldn't want to see that over five years. And then audiences get tired of them and they're disposed of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think 'After Porn Ends' brings to light a prudent question: what those who make their living in the porn business do after... after... they finish it? Well, the movie tells us that not everybody in this field really stops for good; even the actresses, who are most requested in their early twenties or so, they can continue working in parallel or do something-porn-related when they get older. The main thing, according to the film, is that these people live in their own world when they are into this. The parties, the drugs, the trips, they're all consequences of this chosen life. You might raise the question: 'But why did they choose this kind of life?' a psychologist says that most of them see this as an only opportunity to be somebody, somehow; to escape from their own lives, usually a life of struggles, with financial difficulties; not to mention that some of them (I guess a small part, since the movie didn't delve into that much) were molested by parents or adults when kids. It's interesting to see some ex-porn stars doing something far different now. What seems they cannot run away is from being, to some extent, judged by other people in a moment somebody finds out on the Internet that this very person used to make a living by sucking a bunch of cocks, for example. I don't know,but those who left this industry behind seem to resent that they were part of it someday. The feeling is normally of shame and what's worse, they didn't get rich as they guessed. The film does a good job showing these people expressing their opinions. I just thought that it could go further on the psychological analysis - the psychologist speaks for less than a minute or two in the whole movie, while some ex-stars don't have, let's say, something too enlightening to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a messy money shot, this documentary was all over the place.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a love/hate relationship with the sex industry. I really don't get how screwing for money on video is legal, while screwing for money is illegal. It's very hypocrite type society law. It's weird that pornstar are sub-culture celebrities and prostitutes &amp; johns are ostracized criminals in the US. In a country that support freedom, it's very weird in its limited in the definitions of those sexual freedoms. I think it's a man or woman right if she wants to get into the sex industry. Still, I don't think it's should be celebrated or people should be punish for it. Indeed, sex is healthy for adults, but too much sex or lack of it, isn't good for you. I really don't like the sex industry; when people are forced to join the sex industry against their will, acts upon violence, misandry &amp; misogyny attitudes, careless of diseases, or target children. I just can't bared to watch it. Like it or not pornography is still a billion dollar industry. Sex sells. Like other modern media entertaining industry, it's slowly dying due to piracy and over market saturation. Its reasons like this, why a great deal of ex-pornstars at leaving the industry. Directed by Bryce Wagoner, the movie showcase a number of ex-pornstars after their own climax. Like any other type of work, retiring has its ups and downs. For these porn-stars, most of them, had a horrible job of adapting to life after porn due to the stigma of being the porn-industry. After all, it's rare that pornstar would be taken seriously in a serious job field. This is why no one looks seem acting in pornography as a legitimate career choice to put on a resume. While others, just cause their lives to get worst, by getting into drug or alcohol problem. If anything is to blame, it's their bad judgment and falling into vices. Yes, some of them were taking advantage of, but for the most of them. It was their call to go into it. There is few found any sense of success. The movie is not out to preach in either its favor or condemnation of having a porn industry, but it does tend to sway on focusing on the dark side of porn. The stories we hear varied from way depressing to watch, to just curiously. None of them were really that fun to hear talking. The only one that seem interesting was the pornstar that turn into a bounty hunter. The others interviewers lives are just too gloomy, mediocre, annoying or mundane. For a movie, that is supposed to be a movie after porn. They talk a great depth about how they got into porn, and what they did. The film-makers even need to overlay the audio from the interviews with some nude footage during the subjects' careers as if its fanfare so people wouldn't get bored. It's hard to take what they are saying about what they currently doing seriously, when the nude footage like the Houston 500 world-record breaking gangbang featuring 500 men making you spaced out when one of them are talking about her life with cancer. Are we really supposed to take the women that went to political activists or found God seriously after watching footage of her past fooling around? It's really hard to. Some of the footage seems really out of place, and the camera-work was lousy at times. Overall: Most of the interview felt like underdeveloped disorganized stories. It even dragged at times. Had the movie focused on, one direction, maybe the film could had work. Honestly, the movie does have a good compelling personal story if only it really dig deep and ask the tough questions. You really don't see that. The movie really needed a narrative. Some sense of storytelling with merit. Something to get us from point A to point B. It should be something like 2008's MTV documentary True Life: I'm addicted to porn about Jayden James or 2005's Inside Deep Throat about Linda Lovelace. Truly, indeed this is not a movie you could watch with your kids or parents. I was deeply surprised how much they didn't focus on. Like gay ex pornstars. Honestly, this movie would had at less, have one interview with one of them. Another one is more ethic ex- pornstars! I would had love to see how a black person or Hispanic is dealing with leaving porn. The movie could had also feature, life as an ex-pornstar while living in other countries. There are countless ex-pornstars in Italy, and Japan, alone. It would nice to see how strict, or sexual freedom, the politics are in those countries. The movie didn't even mention some of the biggest stars that the industry had. No mention of John Holmes, Traci Lords, Jenna Jameson, Linda Lovelace, Ron Jeremy and others was a letdown. In my opinion, the movie could had been told better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the provocative poster and provocative title, there's very little provocative material in here. For what you were actually expecting, I'd recommend Louis Theroux's documentaries on the subject. After Porn Ends seems content with the fact that porn stars have to exist after the cameras stop rolling, and after they retire; and as such, it meanders. There's no great sense of purpose or depth to any of the questions. Its more than a bit depressing, but not in a fascinating way like in Theroux's works. Having said all that, some of the stars are quite likable in small doses so I got some enjoyment out of that. Just not very much. 1/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Reality TV' exploitation and Content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- After Porn ends, 2010. A documentary produced by a porn producer/director/actor that tries to explore and visit porn performers of the past asking them about their experiences, regrets, and future. Many academics and spiritual leaders are consulted for their interpretation on the many pron stars interview clips.*Special Stars- Mary Carey, Asia Carrera, Luke Ford, Nina Hartley, John Leslie, Amber Lynn, Houston, Seka, Raylene.*Theme- The sex for money trade is seldom beneficial to most people involved in it.*Trivia/location/goofs- Documentary, produced by a 'many decades' porn individual.*Emotion- This film is just more present day 'Reality TV' exploitation motivation and content. I was disappointed and hoping that their would be more non-porn academics speaking here on these matters. By interviewing the porn stars now, you seldom get an honest answer to even the most investigative questions. What I saw in this film (that was my questionable conclusion from the film's beginning) you hear adults giving rationalizations for their bad behavior or "Sour grapes". You hear some honest regret. You see how some people have a harder acceptance of life's 'learning curve' with the sex industry. Most, almost 98% regret their time and wasted efforts in porn. I don't see why they couldn't make better choices for their lives from the beginning. Any industry that equates people's self-worth with sex, drugs, and money should be a red-flag for all to keep away from. The film was a disappointment.</fullReview>

A low budget hard to watch documentary about a subject that has been done before by better producers. Is very similar to after and before prostitution and would have been better with a little more research.As other reviewers have mentioned, making a documentary about the lives of retired porn stars is so obvious it's amazing it hasn't been done before.
