		<shortDescription>A love letter to Rocky and film fans alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no other way to say it; Creed is a knockout. From start to finish, this film exhilarates and crackles with brilliant on screen performances and masterfully directed fight sequences. It wholeheartedly captures what was so brilliant about the first film: the characters. Yes, I'll return to theaters to see the fights, but it's the characters, particularly Rocky and Adonis that truly captivated me from start to finish. I can't say enough great things about writer/director Ryan Coogler. The way he masterfully captures the modern spirit of Philadelphia and the visceral tension of standing toe-to-toe with a man who wants to see you hit the ground is second to none. What stood out the most, however, was his writing of Rocky Balboa. The subtle nuances that we love about the Italian Stallion are effortlessly worked into the script and flow like water from Sly's crooked mouth. Speaking of, the script would be for naught if it weren't for the beautiful performances by Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. I'm not ashamed to say I was brought to tears at various parts of this film. I'm just so happy to say that this film wasn't a disappointment. This film exceeded my wildest hopes of a 7th Rocky installment and had me feeling amped up for hours after the credits rolled. I can't wait to see more from the talent involved in this film, and I proudly endorse and recommend Creed to Rocky fans and film fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With grit, style and substance, Creed goes the distance as an exceptional crowd pleaser.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>History has a strange way of repeating itself. 40 years ago, Rocky Balboa became a household name and turned an unwanted actor into one of the greatest success stories in Hollywood. The fact that Rocky (1976) won three Academy Awards including Best Picture is of little importance compared to the real life struggle behind the making of that film. For Sylvester Stallone, it was a rags to riches story that mirrored his real life struggles to make a decent and honest living. Cut from the same cloth maybe, but Creed is much more than just the seventh installment in the Rocky film franchise. As a no- holds-barred sports drama, this is every bit an exceptional crowd pleaser with a lot of heart, plenty of amusing jabs to the ribs, and an unexpected but emotional haymaker to the gut. And a lot more.Co-written by director Ryan Coogler, there's no doubt that Creed is a passionate love letter to the first film, which in itself is a poetic love story about fighting the good fight. Although boxing is the central theme, and often frowned upon as a brutal blood-sport that causes serious injuries, it's never been about the fight but more about what you are fighting for. Coogler gets this spot-on when we are introduced to teenager Adonis Johnson in juvenile detention. We soon learn that Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, born shortly after the latter's death in Rocky IV. Appolo's widow Mary Ann (Phylicia Rashad) rescues young Adonis from what is certain to be a life on the streets and raises him as her own in the plush Creed estate in Los Angeles. Cut to present day and Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) is a corporate executive half way up the ladder. It's a stark contrast to Stallone's blue collar stiff in the first film, but this is where both films converge. Like Rocky, Adonis (calling himself Donnie) knows he is destined for something else, so heads to Philadelphia to meet his late father's rival turned best friend.The meeting with Rocky is one of several great moments in the film while also serving as a nostalgic homecoming occasion for every fan of the franchise. It's a fascinating intersection of the past but none better than the fact that in many ways, Creed is an inverted mirror image of Rocky. And before sending this film off on its own pulsating trajectory, Coogler reveals a full hand of spades. One of which is the legacy Rocky bestows on Donnie, and in essence, Stallone handing over the franchise baton to Jordan. We may not realize this at first and that's because we are already smitten by the father-son relationship developing between Donnie and Rocky. Their character study is the most significant aspect of this film. Donnie has always been an orphan and the reason why he never took on his father's name is an emotional revelation. Who he is and why he wants to become a professional boxer is his darkest secret.Both equally emotive and with comic interruptions, Jordan and Stallone deliver impressive performances. Stallone in particular gives what has to be his career best performance since Copland, and if this is his franchise swan song (owing to a devastating but befitting plot device) that's all the more reason why this film must be seen. But as they say, the show must go on and Jordan is more than capable of shouldering future films under the Creed banner. And with the inclusion of Philly local Bianca (Tessa Thompson), Donnie's neighbor and love interest, future sequels look to be set in Rocky's beloved hometown.Onto the production quality and it suffices to say that Creed has THE best technical aspects in the franchise, including spectacular fight choreography, astounding cinematography in the ring and around Philadelphia, and an upbeat hip-hop soundtrack fused with the original score from previous films. The only real letdown comes from Donnie's main opponent (Real life professional boxer Tony Bellew) who isn't as antagonistic as you would expect, given the villainous ferocity from Clubber Lang (Rocky III) and the evil Ivan Drago (Rocky IV). But that's a minor blemish to an overall outstanding film made with grit, substance and style. At its best, Creed is a very intimate film for fans and newcomers and an undisputed knockout for 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exhilarating Showcase of Talent and Heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Coogler's Creed delivers on everything that a great boxing film should, and represents a full return to form for Rocky. Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it's overused plot lines with a different take.From the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is "a fighter." The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they're standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends.One reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing "Creed" and "Fruitvale Station" I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa.Some may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes. The way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it's telling. Coogler captures the tone of the older Rocky films, while also making a film distinctly different. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be. In the end if you have the time go see Creed, it's a terrific 2 hours to spend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad - but unoriginal and overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Geez, I wanted to like this movie. I love the Rocky saga, and I was intrigued by the idea of introducing Apollo Creed's son as the new protagonist. And once the film started getting rave reviews, I got *really* pumped to see it.Unfortunately, I feel like I saw a different movie from everyone else. Sure, "Creed" has some good acting and a good heart, and it's somewhat respectful to the Rocky legacy. But, drat it, this film is really just a lazy remake of the first Rocky film, with Adonis Creed in Rocky's role and Rocky in Mickey's role. Worse than that - "Creed" rips off literally every preceding Rocky movie. It contains not a single original idea. Indeed, I recognized every scene - the illness subplot is recycled from "Rocky II," the boring office job material was previously seen in "Rocky Balboa," the training montage was in...well, all the old ones...and so on. Just changing the protagonist isn't enough to make this ancient material feel fresh.There were some opportunities to explore new directions, but the filmmakers squandered most of them. For example, the beginning of the film builds up Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) as a compelling new character - but then she gets dropped like a hot potato about 1/4 of the way through the movie. And Adonis Creed's potentially interesting romance with Bianca (Tessa Thompson) develops in a very clichéd fashion; all Creed ever does is lie to Bianca or spoil things for her, yet somehow she loves him anyway. Why?Even their "meet cute" scene didn't work for me. Bianca wakes Creed up by blasting music in their apartment building at 3:00 AM - which in a movie is charming behavior, but in real life would be incredibly annoying. Somehow, Creed is the only person in the building who comes to complain. Yeah, right.On a more depressing note, I really don't like what the film does to Rocky's character. If you thought Rocky was a sad old man in "Rocky Balboa," you ain't seen nothing yet. The Rocky in this movie has given up on life, and that's not easy to watch. At least in "Rocky Balboa," we got to see Rocky rebuilding his life after losing Adrian, by drawing closer to his son and developing a friendship with Little Marie. But in this movie, his son and Little Marie are gone, and Rocky is just...waiting' on death. Ugh, how bleak. And I guess I'm supposed to believe that Rocky's forced, chemistry-free friendship with Adonis Creed gives him a reason to live again. Yikes.I'm not sure why the critics are so into this movie - usually, they vilify sentimental, lazy remakes like this. I think perhaps they were really jazzed that Ryan Coogler of "Fruitvale Station" fame directed it. All I can say is, I hope "Fruitvale Station" is better than this. "Creed" is as unoriginal as a Star Wars movie about blowing up the Death Star. Worse yet, it reminded me of the inevitable passage of time in a sort of downer way. Yeah, I think I'll just pretend it doesn't exist, and toss it in the same bin with other passing-the-torch films like "Star Trek: Generations" and "Batman Forever." It's a better film than those, true, but no less of a drag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Micheal B. Jordan is a super star, and Sylvester Stallone's got his back!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Milking the franchise for everything it's got, Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa in the 7th installment in the series. This time, he's smart enough to know he's too old to get into the ring, so he gets some new blood with a familiar name.Micheal B. Jordan plays Adonis(perfect name), a man who was in his mother's womb while his father, the legendary Apollo Creed got his ass handed to him in the 4th Rocky. With the same passion to fight as his father, he seeks out Apollo's old rival and best friend the Italian Stallion to teach him the skills to reclaim his legacy and become a new legend.Like a good boxing movie should, Creed has heart. I'm such of fan of Micheal B. Jordan. He's got the charm and talent to become a movie star and Creed proves he's leading man material.And much respect to Sly, who as an aged Rocky, is in the same spot as once franchise regulars, Micky and Paulie. It's humbling for a movie star to take a step back and let Jordan drive the vehicle in front of the camera, and Ryan Coogler sit in the director's chair and pen the flick, but obviously Sly cares about this cow and sought out the very best to make it the very best. Stallone also gave a performance of a lifetime worthy of an Oscar nod for supporting actor. He is Rocky, and watching him on the screen with Jordan was incredible cinema.And the action in this movie was amazing. Some of the greatest battles in cinematic boxing are happening in Creed. We are so close to the action you can feel every hit. Also have to comment on Jordan's boxing skills. Creed, does an excellent job with showing a boxer going from having raw talent, to becoming a champion.Definitely a worth wild boxing movie to see, and I think the best Rocky film since number two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>average at best, predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How any idiot could have the audacity to rate this movie higher than the original rocky is so beyond baffling I have no words for my displeasure with IMDb. creed is a predictable boxing movie with potential for a good movie, but is ultimately diminished by a boring plot line, a lack of special moments, and epic build up that all the great rocky movies had. The training scene was boring the build up was bad the plot was un realistic. not to mention they tarnished the legacy of a great movie character in apollo creed by having an affair with his wife, although it is necessary for the plot of the movie I don't agree with putting the great apollo creed in that light, especially since the rest of the movie everyone talks about him as this amazing man, how are non die hard rocky fans supposed to buy that? a few other issues, why did they turn Mickey's gym into the "bad guy" gym? shouldn't he have started in a new retro gym and came to rocky to train and he took him to Mickey's gym? That would have given all rocky fans a goose bump moment instead they were left with nothing. the only real shocker about this movie and (spoiler alert) is giving rocky cancer, that was probably the most intriguing part of the whole story. Also the build up of the leading couple was bad, i felt no connection to the two outside of the girl having that hearing problem there was nothing interesting about them. Finally the training scene was so stupid having all those guys do wheele's around him as he ran was so weird and ruined the entire scene. The fighting scenes were much more realistic and well choreographed compared to all the other rocky's which was this movies only really well done part, the ending of the fight is to a rocky fan, too predictable, it was great in rocky 1 and it was a fitting end to rocky 6, but makes no sense here and ended with the viewers questioning what next? instead of riding off into the sunset. the acting was solid by everyone involved but the writing was too corny to over come for the most part. a C-level movie at best</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this movie getting such good reviews? There is nothing here. The plot is just like all the rest of the Rocky movies, they even bring back the poor chickens. Lots of jump rope too. Oh, sorry not exactly like the other Rocky movies, nobody died in this one, but he did visit the cemetery. Some stupid love interest that never went anywhere. An opponent that didn't even look like a boxer. Not enough boxing, probably because Stallone thought he could act well enough to carry the movie.Creed: Please Rocky, come back and train me. Critic: Please Rocky, just go away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The legend lives on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that being said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire cast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a good trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester Stallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B. Jordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that from this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as Creed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was engrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of respect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own place in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible this film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I think the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue. Again, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Creedence Revival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This HAS to be the year of nostalgia with the Original Star Wars trilogy remake, the Return to Jurassic Park Reboot and the memory of 1960's Bond in Spectre. But, the one I never asked for, nor anyone really needed, was to see Rocky XXXVIII.But?since so many people kept asking my opinion on it and how many rave reviews I've heard that might equate Oscar buzz, I decided to check it out. I am sorry I did.Not that the movie's ineptly made, it's just an incredible retread of countless boxing movies before it. Hell, it even played homage to all the previous Rocky training montages before it?and repeatedly. Over and over. Half way through I was ready to give up with the extreme number of clichés and unoriginal ideas/paths, but figured the second half HAS to be better since so many people loved it so much.Nope. The second half was just as dull and the same old story. In fact, once the climax hit ? the obligatory finale in any of these boxing movies ? I had completely tuned out. Not only did I know how it would pan out, I didn't care one bit.This movie had one singular fresh idea (son of former boxing champ in the Rocky series, Apollo Creed, is introduced) but every single other minute was unoriginal and predictable from six scenes leading up. It was so by the numbers, it's a wonder anyone even cared to even mention the movie to me. I wish someone would tell me how this movie is so great and stands out from every other boxing film. Okay, the lead, Michael B. Jordan was decent, but he was just playing his role in this "should've been made-for-Lifetime-TV movie." Sylvester Stallone has reinvented himself many, many years ago, as an aging action star, and now he's completely beyond that. It's getting old and perhaps it's time, Sly?I guess if you're heavily into boxing, boxing movies AND just want to see the exact same movie you've seen countless times before, you might like it. Otherwise, it's an extreme waste of more than two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 7th (and hopefully last) movie of the Rocky franchise seems to be considered the best after the original by the critics but don't believe the hype cause it's merely disappointing. The movie on the surface tries to go to a different direction exploiting all underground stereotypes. The hero is a young black that listens to hip hop. Rocky has retired and manages his wife's Italian restaurant. The biker gangs of Philadelphia support them. The young fellow is in war with his last name, Creed, and what that represents. The easily foreseen screenplay includes amped-up training sequences and climates to a title fight with an absurd number of punches landed in every round. Stallone's character suffers from (spoiler alert) cancer and there you have a golden globe for him as well an Oscar nomination (wtf?) for best performance in a supporting role. Stallone getting an Oscar sounds like the academy is trolling us. The movie is extremely overrated (8.0 in IMDb, 94% in rotten tomatoes) but even for a Rocky fan (as I am) it's extremely predictable and completely lacks emotion.Grade: C- (D if you are not a Rocky fan)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a Bust..., and a disgrace to the "Rocky" series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I like to start out that the acting was pretty good, especially Sylvester Stallone, who is of course: "Rocky". The big problem with this movie is that it was written and directed by some one other than Sylvester Stallone. In all the Rocky movies Stallone was the writer, and besides the first Rocky and The fifth Rocky, Stallone was also the director. What my point is, is that this random dude, that both Wrote and directed this movie, made the movie "Creed", with his own style and junk that has never been in any of the 'Rocky" movies, and the story was very poorly written, as well as the whole flow to it. I really hated the sensuality in it, as well as the reasons why Adonis Creed became a full time boxer. The movie "Rocky" had so much more innocents and class and just the story all in all , just made so much more sense. Most importantly I felt no "Motivation" to "Creed" as a pose to "Rocky", because the story of "Rocky" just felt so real and innocent and full of purpose, which is complete opposite in the movie "Creed". In the movie "Rocky" you felt the motivation. Overall, to basically summarize everything, this movie had no class nor respect, for the previews movies, and the writing was so lame and so empty. Pretty much "Creed" was made for only one purpose... Money, cause the most of the stuff in this movie was a complete fail. The Creator of this movie knew that people would come to watch it,because of how great the "Rocky" series were, but like i said before, this movie was a complete bust, with only one intention, to put Rocky's name in this terrible film just to make money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much More Than Just a Boxing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps and is trained by Rocky Balboa himself. More than boxing, this movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and Rocky and how they both support each other when they most need it. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. He is so energetic in the boxing scenes and he is even better when his character is being developed. Now we come to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky. In his signature role, he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his best performance in his career as an actor. He honestly deserves an Oscar for this part. He brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions and still has the same charm from the old Rocky movies. Creed perfectly mixes elements from past Rocky movies, especially the first, with modern culture. The amazing Rocky score is complemented by modern styles. Creed's story is told just like Rocky's and it is so beautiful to watch. The cinematography is also visually pleasing. Coogler captured the look of Philadelphia extremely well. The boxing scenes are excellent. There is a fight that is done completely in one take and I have no idea how they did it. It was amazing. This movie is a drama that tugs at your heart a lot, but at times it still manages to be quite funny as well. I love Creed as a film. Its characters are so well realized and acted, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the boxing is glorious. Creed is definitely one of the best films of 2015. Creed gets an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Got One Rock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like it's counterpart, even this 7th installment to the franchise has proved the fact that the true story of the universe has just begun. Creed just like the original movie of the series has a strict focus on the characters, their struggles and eventual triumph, with only a role switch with the son of "The Apollo Creed " . This is one of the only few movies I loved watching this year, and I am pretty much thankful I did. In this review I shall justify the reason as to why this movie has received a rating as high as a 9/10.1)Story :- The basic story is backed by a pretty good script and an engaging narrative that puts Adonis Johnson / Creed , son of Apollo creed in the centre of the fight this time. But unlike his father's story , this man is forced to battle his unfulfilled passion for fighting , unjustified emotions that cross him and a blockade that brands him as a man born from someone else's legacy. The story technically puts Adonis on the radar, while the people around believe him to be a man whose fame comes by his father's legacy. This is a story of how a man, with a will to create a mark in history for himself, steps into the ring, not only fighting the fight , but battling his priorities. The story sometimes is vague reminder of the first rocky, but the distinctive performances from both actors see to it that this movie rises beyond those insignificant questions. 2)Casting And Characters:- The casting and characterization of this cast is what makes this movie splendid. Though the script is more or less that of a generic boxing movie seen a million times before , it is the distinctive performances by the lead Michael B Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. This is one of those movies that solely concentrates it's screen time on only those characters that require screen space to ideologically progress the story. While the movie consists of other members like Bianca the love interest and Mary Creed , Adonis's mother , all these plot devices are only meant to build the tension during the final fight and are completely disposable , since they add little to nothing to the actual plot to be significant . But what is evident is that director Ryan Coogler, has done is absolute best to pull the best out of every cast member who was a part of this movie. But when all is done and said, I cannot be absolutely fair while I express my love for the man who started it all , and the man who almost overshadowed Creed's performance in this movie , The Rocky Balboa a.k.a Sylvester Stallone. This man has proved the fact with this movie that he is not just the broody, rough and tough man who does action movies but is an actor who has the potential to ACT. That's right, Sylvester Stallone after a million fails has proved that he is no more expendable. His performance swelled my eyes with tears and without spoiling anything, Ryan Coogler's decision to modify the characters life in the way he did so , was not just best for the plot , but best for the ultimately produced definitive performances too.3)Direction :- When directing a movie for a franchise that has spanned for many generations it is a risky move for us audience when we witness a new chapter. The movie could either be a project made as a nostalgic cash grab or a passion project that respects it's previous entries but becomes different and distinct at the same time. And just like the Creed in the movie, Ryan Coogler has proved that this movie is not just made as a product of Rocky's legacy but a project that has the ability to stand on one's own foot to essentially act as a reinvigoration of what Rocky was originally imagined to be. Coogler has managed to build a completely new atmosphere for this franchise that gives a sense of difference and change but at the same time , affixes us to the city of Philadelphia that we have known and loved since the original Rocky with the perfectly cued original soundtracks that assures us that we are actually connected to the world we always loved. It is evident that the style of direction that Coogler used for this movie is something completely different from the previous Rocky movies. This one goes in the line of other dark boxing movies such as Warrior where colours of the world around are dumbed down to create this dark and gloomy environment and everything in the frame of perspective is saturated with detail to create an exact and realistic picture of the sport of boxing in the best way possible . What I was let down by , slightly , was Coogler's quick jump takes and cut-shots during the final fight , that actually put me out of the intensity that the shot had to have. Overall, Coogler's direction is brilliant in many ways and it was his vision that was desperately needed to create , progress and continue the now 6 movie franchise. If you have already watched the movie, the final scene of Rocky climbing the stairs followed by a focus shot of the city from the height explains exactly why I praise his direction so much.On a whole it was an absolutely unexpected journey filled with the excitement, vigor and energy that every Rocky movie had. If you are a person who would step in a theatre or watch this movie just for the fights, let me warn you right away and tell you that you will be disappointed. This movie is a directorial and character driven drama whose ultimate underline of boxing gives the much needed progressive element for the plot. And is definitely one of the best movies of 2015.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crud may refer to:Waste, dirt, feces, or something of poor quality.^^^ That right there is what Creed is. A massive pile of waste, dirt and feces.Lets start with the pathetically contrived opening fight. Could they have made it any more trite and pathetic. It was like watching a drama class over act and fail miserably.Little hard done by black boy gets taken in by his step-mom (or whoever she was, who give a $hit) and lives a life of luxury in what looked like the equivalent of the white house in size and surprise surprise, turns out to be a spoilt brat. Why in the hell would i give a flying toss about this over privileged penile head at all????? Congratulations on making me hate the character in a matter of minutes. From there on in, I didn't give a flying toss about this loser. He is conceited and arrogant and offers up his prized car if anyone can beat him in a sparring match, and gets floored. Lol. What a loser.How/why would anyone care about this guy? i get that he was supposed to be a bit of a big head like his father but you don't make him totally unlikeable. What else happens in this dud of a movie...lets see...a contrived, pointless, irritating love interest, which was a major ball ache and snooze fest. God awful dialogue that made me howl with laughter. Awful camera work. Don't even get me started on the Scouser boxer...ha ha. Worst acting in the world.By the time the Liverpudlians manager came to talk to Rocky and penile head Creed about fighting, i turned the abomination off. A complete waste of everyones time.The joke about taking a picture of the training routine and putting it on the 'cloud' was pathetic, rocky not being able to spell Shadow...I find Michael B. Jordan to be a very unlikeable person as well. I also think he's a sub par actor. How many times does he have to pout throughout the film? It looks like there's something wrong with his chin, and I just got irritated looking at his smug face constantly. The guy is a massive bore.Creed is a joke. shame on you Stallone for entertaining this bull$hit film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potential Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have watched the original Rocky and think it is a near classic, then Creed is close. Maybe not a classic, because only time will tell. But it is close in terms of look and feel. There are scenes, tempo, performances, music, and of course the setting (Philadelphia) which harken back to the award winning 1976 film. This is not a comparison piece, but Creed is what the earlier release this year of Southpaw could have been; a gritty, modern day boxing film.Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station), plays the titular character (using the name Donnie Johnson) who yearns to exorcise his demons/ follow his dreams in the boxing ring. Without giving anything away, he's the son of the late, great Apollo Creed and he sets out to find any trainer willing to take him on. He can fight, but he's raw and needs refinement if he's going to be taken seriously.His search lands him in his father's old Philly stomping ground, where he pester's one Rocky Balboa (Stallone) into training him. He pulls every angle to get Rocky to help him since his pop and Rocky were combatants and close friends before he died. Once Rocky begrudgingly gives in, things begin to coalesce. Stallone is excellent as the "Mickey"-esque Balboa. Although he didn't write the screenplay for Creed, he is one of the producers and his presence is felt. The dynamic between his character and Creed is perfect. The right combination of old school and new school. One scene is indicative when Creed takes a picture on his phone of Rocky's workout routine then tells him it's "in the cloud" to Rocky's bewilderment.In Creed, director and writer Ryan Cogler is reunited with Jordan. As Creed, Jordan's performance is on part with Stallone's. He imbues his character with just the right amount of bravado, not cockiness, just confidence, hunger, and drive. He also trained and bulked up for the role. But he's not all fierce competitor, he has funny, sensitive sides as well. Cogler's team decided Creed should have a love interest. The relationship he forges with a local neo- soul artist played by Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) could have been syrupy, but thankfully it doesn't overshadow the main theme or feel forced. Frankly, some of the scenes with Thompson and Jordan are very good and so is their chemistry.Creed is an excellent example of mixing newcomers with established names on both sides of the camera and having the end result come out perfect. The crew and cast turn in great work. Cogler had the fortune and skill to work with people who know what it takes to put together a film that would appeal to critics and audiences alike. There were a couple scenes that are "wow" moments, not just fight scenes, which are are amazing, but little scenes that are set up, shot (by Maryse Alberti) and acted that will have a lasting effect on the viewer. Maybe classic isn't a stretch.- See more at: http://www.mediumraretv.org/review/creed/#sthash.l3vjP0Ca.dpuf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What this movie is not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After looking at the ratings, I was curious to know, why this movie was not nominated at the Golden Globes, Was it because of the tough competition? The answer is No. This movie is definitely not a top 250 material. Secondly, the movie is full of clichés, from starting to End. You watch, each and every element, unfold, just like all Sports movies. Knowing what will happen Next. The movie lacked an angle, playing on an angle about being Creed's Blood is not that catchy. The movie had some really sloppy contrived moments, specially When Creed finds the hospital brochure in Rocky's jacket and finds out that Rocky has Cancer. Now, why would Creed check Rocky's jacket. The whole scene looks contrived The moment when Creed runs and Bikers move around him and Rocky looks at him from the top and everyone is cheering for their favorite boy Creed, that is too old school and not something you expect from a great movie. The movie worked well in bits and pieces. The point with Rocky was that his opponents had a character, They did try to build Creed's opponent's story, but it was not well executed. Too many scenes featuring Creed and Bianca.. But Creed had its moments, Yes, Rocky looked like a pro,the way he dealt with situations, the way he was analyzing the moves of the opponent, he makes you feel that this is the same Rocky, I had cheered for in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we saw the review rating for this movie, which was very high, on On Demand, we thought we were in for a treat. It was incredibly boring and a waste of time. We sat through most of it hoping and thinking it would get better. It didn't and we lost all hope. Very little character development so that you didn't care about any of them. Sylvester Stallone seemed to have difficulty staying in character and he sometimes looked like Rock Hudson in a creepy way. Didn't believe the love relationship between Creed Jr and his neighbor; no chemistry there at all. Lastly, even though it is indicated that this review may contain spoilers, which is described as "A spoiler is usually defined as a remark or piece of information which reveals important plot elements (for example the ending or a major plot twist), thus 'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film.", I doubt there is anything that could spoil this movie....it is that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a boxing movie Creed packs a heavyweight punch.Sylvester Stallone (as the film's producer) has covered a lot of miles with his Rocky legend, most recently with his 2006 Rocky Balboa. As such I had thought there was little milk left in the cash cow, but "Creed" proves me wrong. This time, with Stallone's advancing years, he wisely doesn't stretch credibility by having Rocky Balboa as the center of the pugilism, but hands the baton to young contender Adonis ("Donnie") Creed (Michael B Jordan). Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Rocky's protagonist and later close friend in the first four Rocky films.Donnie is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks with a big chip on his shoulder and a reputation for finding trouble with his fists. Brought back from the brink by Apollo's wife (a touching performance by Phylicia Rashad) Donnie can't escape his family legacy and seeks Balboa's help to make it in the ring, using his own adopted name. Balboa's help leads to a number of 'traditionally' brutal Rocky-style encounters in the ring. I must admit I don't normally 'go' for boxing films like this, but this is extremely well done. All of the boxing training is gritty and believable and the actual bouts, particularly the classic finale, is suitably thrilling and a technical masterpiece of camera-work (hats off to cinematographer Maryse Alberti, who also filmed "The Wrestler" so is no stranger to the ring). A real surprise is just how good Stallone is in the role. There are scenes where Stallone really has to act ? particularly an emotional locker-room scene when Rocky faces up to his own personal crisis ? and any jokes about Sylvester "Expendables" Stallone's acting abilities are forgotten. Michael B Jordan is also a great find and a name to watch. He has to cover a wide range during the film and succeeds admirably.Tessa Thompson, impressive in last year's "Selma", makes a similarly positive impression here playing the love interest in the form of songstress Bianca, with a difficult future ahead of her."Creed" is a love letter to the old Rocky films, and ? with this quality, and likely success ? the start of a whole new generation of films seems probable. The respect it shows to the originals is characterized by a moving tribute to the classic 'Philadelphia steps' scene that brings a genuine lump to the throat. That being said, the film is a lot more 'street' for a new generation, with a soundtrack (by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson) that mixes rap and hip-hop with more classic orchestral elements. Without outright plagiarism of Bill Conti's classic score, Göransson subtly weaves in some of Conti's themes, notably Adrian's theme, as well as coming up with his own "Fly Now"- equivalent musical high-point.Impressive direction is by Ryan Cooglar in only his second feature film (after Fruitvale Station, also with Michael B Jordan). Cooglar also wrote the story and co-wrote the script. Without any spoilers, the story is delightfully 'un-Hollywood" by being unpredictable in where it goes. However, an area for criticism is that it took a few 'easy' short-cuts in places: a particular 'change of heart' in the film is way to glib and quick.Finally, i would love to watch this film in a cinema in Liverpool, when the "hallowed turf" for a bout is revealed as being Everton's ground, Goodison Park?.! Generations of Liverpool FC fans will be turning in their graves and I predict that cinemas in the city could become scenes of the worst hand to hand combat since the finale of Kingsman!

		<fullReview>This is not actually a movie rather than a Jordan shoes and chemotherapy 2 hour commercial.I turned off the film the moment I saw Rocky training Jordan while doing chemotherapy. Who writes this crap anyways. Who's idea was it to give Rocky cancer ? Maybe in the next film Rocky dies, goes to Hell and trains Apollo Creed to fight the Devil. What a load of crap.Everybody at one point made fun of the Rocky saga because one day we would see Rocky dying of old age but still fighting in the ring. Stallone actually made a Rocky film out of this joke. This is really weird.What's next ? Adrian The Rocky Chronicles ?The Rocky saga has been milked to it's last breath with this one.Appolo's abandoned kid with social behavior problems, a deaf girlfriend who is a singer, Rocky has cancer, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey, Appolo, Appolo's wife are all dead. Everybody is dead but yet Sly filmed another Rocky movie and had a director who has never directed a film before.Give me a break man, it is a failed attempt to do a sports drama movie all the way to the grave. Stallone did an excellent drama job with the first movies and no one was dead or dying.I have only one message to Mr.Stallone. Let the Rocky saga be, man. Just let it go. You don't need the money and we don't need a Rocky movie inspired by a school joke from 1985.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better with age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film really belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar nominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman both aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson. It's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted Rocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.But between that there have been several Rocky films over the years as Sly has developed more facets to the fighting Mr. Balboa of Philadelphia than I'm sure he even thought of when he debuted Rocky. It all really comes together with Creed.But as for the story it seems that back when Apollo Creed was killed in that fight with that Russian steroid machine Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV he had a dalliance that resulted in a post mortem birth of an illegitimate son who grew up to be Michael B. Jordan, character name of Adonis Johnson. Apollo's widow Phyllis Rashad took him out of foster care as his natural mother had died and raised him.Jordan has an interesting dichotomy to deal with. He's his father's son and wants to make it in the fight game, but on his own as Adonis Johnson. He seeks his father's old friend and rival Rocky Balboa as a mentor and Rocky trains him for a title shot at the light heavyweight championship. Rocky Balboa is not the most articulate movie hero ever developed, but he sure imparts a lot of wisdom to Jordan. Those scenes with Jordan are what got Sly Stallone that second Oscar nomination. Also Rocky has some personal crises of his own to deal with. These guys are of incalculable help to each other.I really loved this film and how Stallone developed Rocky to this point. Like fine wine, Rocky gets better with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Re-telling Of The Story Of Rocky I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone together with Tessa Thompson star in this film which could be categorized as both a film update and sequel of the Rocky franchise entitled Creed.It tells the story of Adonis "Donnie" Johnson,who happens to be an illegitimate child of Rocky's opponent in the first two films Apollo Creed from an extra-marital affair.It provides us the details of his life from walking away from his high-paying securities job and rich life and seeks Rocky Balboa in Philadelphia in order to follow the footsteps of his father to pursue a career in boxing.Director Ryan Coogler co-wrote the screenplay which was based from the characters of Stallone's original story in the 1976 classic Rocky. No question that Rocky fans will recognize that story of Adonis has similarities from the first film.That includes the story of an underdog who isn't expected to do well inside the ring, the whole- hearted training given by Adonis in boxing, and his attitude towards life as to never give up no matter what circumstances they encounter.It was also nice to see the seventy year old Rocky himself learn from it after learning that he has cancer.He was ready to die to join the people that are close to him who already passed away such as Mickey,Paulie and his wife Adrian.But in the end,he had to re-learn values that made him a famous and endearing character to movie fans.Finally,we also get to see the events happen in Philadelphia and revisit memorable places when Rocky was to face Apollo decades ago such as Philadelphia Museum of Art and many others.Familiar themes were tackled and places were revisited.Also,the events that took place including the final bout wherein Adonis lost the fight via split decision was definitely far from surprising as viewers probably have expected the same ending of the first film when Rocky did lose the same way to Apollo.In the end,Creed was effective in a modern update of the classic first film.It is also worthy to mention that Stallone finally got an Oscar nomination just like in the first film instead of another Razzie which he normally gets every year for a surprising great performance of an old Rocky. I felt that the film was basically a modern re-telling of the story of Rocky I.If that was Creed's objective,then it has truly succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love letter to the Rocky series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By my own admission, I've never been a huge fan of the Rocky franchise. It took me years to watch Rocky and though I recognise it as a well crafted film, I was unable to fall in love with it like so many others have. Regardless of this, I found myself looking forward to Creed and hoping that, despite my disconnection from the Rocky franchise, it would stand on it's own as an entertaining film, and I'm pleased to say that not only was it able to do that, it also made me want to watch the previous entries which I originally had very little interest in.Rocky was so successful because it existed as not just a film about an underdog, but because it forged an emotional connection between audiences and it's central character, Rocky Balboa. One of the people that felt this connection was young director Ryan Coogler, previously known for his work on Fruitvale Station which also stars Michael B. Jordan. It's Coogler's love for the franchise that led him to write the screenplay for Creed and convince Sylvester Stallone that this was a film which had to be made in order to continue the legacy of Rocky, bringing it to a new generation of fans. Thank god he did, because Coogler has created a film that pays respect to what has come before it, as well as moving the story forward, and the amount of love and care that went in to crafting it is recognisable in every scene.In order to tell this story properly, however, Coogler had to create a character that could stand alongside Rocky and forge an emotional connection with fans both old and new. Donnie is the underdog for a new generation, full of rage and pent up frustration when we first meet him as a child in 1998, two traits which have stayed with him as he grows older. The underdog aspect of his character is nothing we haven't seen before, yet he is so well realised as a man aspiring to be like his father, and so well portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, that it's much more effective than many other failed attempts to create a character such as this. His drive and motivation are extremely justifiable, as is his reasoning that he has to make a name for himself without relying on his father's legacy. The latter is an interesting dynamic within the film as it adds further depth to the character, showcasing the pride he has in his own abilities, while also hinting at the anger and grief he still feels due to the fact he never met Apollo Creed before his death at the hands of Ivan Drago. The relationships he shares with Rocky and aspiring singer/songwriter Bianca (Tessa Thompson) lead him to come to terms with his father's death, enabling him to move on from his anger and in turn providing a satisfying character arc. These relationships also show that pride alone is not enough, and despite his reluctance to use his father's name, Donnie realises that he cannot make it on his own. Enter the former champion and friend of Apollo, Rocky Balboa.Sylvester Stallone's career has found it's legs again over the past few years thanks to the relatively successful, yet extremely disappointing, Expendables franchise. In Creed, however, Stallone proves that he can still act without relying upon a bunch of 80s nostalgia, and his performance may very well be the best of his career. One of Hollywood's hard men, Stallone shows a different side to himself here, delicate and world weary after seeing all of his friends and loved ones pass away. One scene in particular deals with this brilliantly, pulling at the audience's heartstrings as Stallone delivers a series of lines which highlight his grief. He also has some of the funniest dialogue in the film, his world weariness and age coming across as he tries to understand a world which features technology such as the Cloud. Recently nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Stallone is undoubtedly the best part of Creed and perhaps does the most to ensure the film doesn't become just another title in the long list of boxing movies.As well as great characters, the boxing scenes in Creed are also extremely enjoyable to watch. Coogler opts to use long takes which show every aspect of the fights, including the brutal hits Donnie both receives and dishes out on multiple occasions. The final showdown with 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (played by real life British boxer Tony Bellew) is at times painful to watch as the two boxers exchange blows over the course of the fight, dripping blood and sweat onto the floor of the ring as they do so. There's no moments which are quite as gruesome as those seen in last years Southpaw, yet the scenes which do involve boxing are far more effective than any in recent memory, largely due to the connection we have towards Donnie and his trainer.There are flaws to be found, mostly because of the parallels between the film and Rocky, but it's important to realise that this is not only a continuation of the franchise, but also a love letter to it. Coogler and his cast have managed to create a boxing film which will appeal to audiences both old and new, as well as fans of the sport and those that have very little interest in it. In a world that is saturated by remakes, reboots, and sequels, it's refreshing to say that Creed manages to stand on it's own as a great piece of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, solid, but by the book inside and out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed (2015)I went into this expecting too much, for sure, but if you do the same, you'll still be happy to see a solid boxing movie. The clichés are huge, of course, on purpose, including lots of mentions (and movie clips) of the earlier Rocky movies. In that sense, this is a movie for people who loved the original (and to some extent the earlier sequels). It's a feelgood followup without a completely predictable ending. As the son of Apollo Creed (remember him?) turns to boxing instead of a lucrative business career (really?) we have an echo of that first Italian Stallion rising up from nowhere to challenge the best of his times.With no disrespect to the leading actor, Michael B. Jordan, the character lacks the quirky depth and pathos of the original slightly dumb-seeming but ultra sweet role that Stallone created (he wrote it) in "Rocky." And so Jordan, the ex-banker, has none of the rising from the depths of poverty and loneliness that the original Rocky had. They try to give him some backstory with lots of fighting as a kid, but it's just story, not emotional depth.And so the rest of the movie follows suit. We like the guy (Adonis Creed) and want him to win. But we like even more Stallone himself, who ends up being once again the start of the movie?and with a large role. He's officially a supporting actor, but he's in it top to bottom and with real depth to his character.Some of what keeps this being a good solid but unexceptional boxing story is the writing (Ryan Coogler) and the directing (Ryan Coogler). The plot and the technicals of directing are all straight from the book?predictable, but professional. The fight scenes themselves are among the best of the movie? emotionally and physically convincing. And watch Stallone all along, who is pretty terrific. Yeah, you might want all these clichés, but heads up?they aren't enough for a truly great movie, which this is sometimes promoted to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Has Little But Nostalgia Going For It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boxers over the years have had a notoriously hard time figuring out when it's time to hang up the gloves and quit. They keep coming back, and it gets to the point of being pathetic as you watch once magnificent fighters fade away into shadows of what they were. Think Muhammad Ali. Or Larry Holmes. Or Sugar Ray Leonard. Or Evander Holyfield. All once great fighters who just couldn't let it go. Sylvester Stallone is, of course, an actor and not a boxer. But his most iconic role is Rocky Balboa - a boxer. And as I watched this movie (actually not much more than a few minutes into it) I started to think that Stallone was a little bit like Ali or Holmes or Leonard or Holyfield. He should have just let Rocky go. I rather liked "Rocky Balboa" - what I thought would have been the last film in the series. I thought it was a decent film, and a good way of tying things up. But almost 10 years later, Stallone had to do it again. And the result was Ali-like, or Leonard-like. Etc., etc.The great thing about the Rocky movies was that you couldn't help but root for Rocky. Whether the movie was good or bad (and the series had both) you always rooted for Rocky. He was everyone's ultimate fantasy - the down and out guy with no prospects who gets to live his dream and makes good at it. But in "Creed" you don't get that. I didn't much care for Adonis Creed - Apollo's son (in a convoluted sort of way that I really didn't understand, probably because I just didn't care enough to keep it straight in my head.) The character didn't resonate with me. Win. Lose. I didn't care. What I couldn't figure out was why Rocky bothered with him. The basic story is that Adonis makes good after a troubled childhood, apparently has a pretty good job that he suddenly quits to become a fighter. (And who, exactly was Phylicia Rashad - who played Apollo's widow - to him anyway? And why did she care all that much?) He searches out Rocky, convinces Rocky to train him - and then everything comes pretty easy for him actually. But the character just didn't resonate with me; I had no feelings for him whatsoever. When you mix that in with a story that seemed to be lacking in direction or flow you end up with a movie that just bores you. And that's what happened to me. I struggled through it (I admit I may have lost the battle and nodded off for 5 or 10 minutes about halfway through, but I can't imagine I missed anything of vital importance) but it wasn't an enjoyable experience.I know there was a bit of Oscar controversy. Stallone got nominated for Best Supporting Actor. And, in this year when charges of racism were levelled at the Academy, people wanted to know why, if Stallone got nominated, Michael B. Jordan didn't get a Best Actor nomination. Truthfully? Neither should have been nominated, nor should the movie have been, although I heard some folk speculate that it might get a Best Picture nomination - which it didn't. The movie just wasn't that good. The performances weren't that good. Stallone can play Rocky. We know that. And he plays Rocky well. But he's done it so often that nothing here would have stretched him at all. Perhaps more should have been done with Rocky's battle with cancer - but that was never really developed very much. Stallone's nomination was about honouring Stallone, and not about honouring his performance in this particular movie. And Jordan just didn't have whatever it takes to draw me onside with him. Best Actor? Even just a nomination? I don't think so.I will admit that this movie has nostalgia going for it. Lots and lots of nostalgia. It's as if the producers (and there's too many of them to list!) realized that neither the story nor the characters would be a draw, so they went with nostalgia. "Creed" pays homage to various aspects of previous "Rocky" movies. Adonis is a sort of Rocky-type character. (Please promise me that they're not going to start a series of Creed movies. PLEASE!) Rocky visits the graves of Paulie and Adrian. He gives Adonis the Adrian speech from "Rocky III" - "you have to do this for you!" There's Mickey's gym, and Rocky comes across a bit like Mickey - having Adonis chase chickens around to build up speed. There's lots of nostalgia. But there's not much more worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but Stallone isn't.There are a number of serious reasons to catch this film if you can: * it's a solid production. Nice writing, acting, direction. Starts slow and builds. Not every great film has to start with a car chase (FF) or a building imploding (Bond).* it's a feel good film, and they don't make those any more. The script makes clear, this is as much about capital-L LIFE as boxing. Not a boxing movie. But it is not "not" a boxing movie --- see? * props to writer/director Coogler. A labor of love and it shows.* a great opportunity to spend time with a legend, and here I mean Stallone not Rocky. This guy literally does not know the meaning of the word "quit." When everyone in town turned down the Rocky I script, he found backers anyway. When some of the Rockies turned out to be bombs, he just kept going. When everyone figured he was down for the count, he started a B-movie franchise called the Expendables. And when he woke up one morning and realized that all the other franchises had imploded, he turned his B-movie franchise into an A-movie franchise, and no one even noticed.A holiday treat that may surprise everyone and stand the test of time. Like Stallone himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Johnson ? Fruitvale Station) is an angry young man that quits his comfortable West Coast life with a top finance management job, gated mansions and classic cars to follow his passion and dreams in the footsteps of legends. Showing how people progress within the American Dream, with champ Apollo Creed fighting himself to glory leaving a financial security and leaving no need for his children to follow him in the ring where death is at risk. But how some times you just got to follow your heart, to be independent, and build your own strong bonds. As in all Rocky films director and writer Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) and producer Sylvester "Sly" Stallone showcase the everyday struggle in life where everyone has their own challengers and where everyday is a fight. In this tribute to the streets of Philly with the score by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson who explored the city's rich music scene together with Tessa Thompson to create nine original songs for this motion picture, as well as the famous Philly steaks, dirt bikes, icon Kobe Bryant and the classic Rocky films with story lines, characters and places like Mickey's Gym, the stairs, they show awareness to these issues and health issues such as cancer and hearing problems. Meet the seducing Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who Donnie meets after moving to area of the famous Rocky Balboa to find the man who once beat his father and shortly after disappeared from the family and scene. With a tight knitted team Adonis "Donnie" Johnson-Creed advances quick and lands a dream fight in Liverpool, England, to make show everyone he is not a mistake. The film is pretty predictable like all Rocky films and lacks the build up and excitement the previous first four films achieved. The beginning is pretty fresh and leads you to think it would be more fight and grit than just the drama that takes place. It does follow in the footsteps of Rocky in a lot of ways, and you do miss legendary characters Paulie and Adrian without anyone reaching out to grab their place but it sure has set-up for a new Rocky legacy with the new tag-team Creed and Balboa in many sequels to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost 40 years with Rocky and Rambo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a 50+ man I've got that heavy feeling in my chest when looking at past, it's nice, warm, precious and definitively gone moments, and past loved ones.Although life is good with adult mans knowledge and experience, the past and letting go seems sometimes more tempting than fighting and going forward with fading health in a changing world, which you don't fully understand.It felt good to see Rocky going through something alike. I've grown old with Rockys and Rambos, and it's great that these sagas are dealing with the same principle questions that every one of us does.Thanks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formuliac Feel Good Urban Fairytale But Nothing More Than That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look stop me if you heard this before but Once upon a time a poor downtrodden lad from the wrong side of the tracks finds a purpose in life and rescues himself from a dead end life and finds wealth and happiness from the fruits of his efforts Sounds like every story ever written doesn't it and the only stand out is that it's yet another movie in the ROCKY franchise . To be fair the Italian stallion isn't really the focus of the story and the story revolves around the son of the late Apollo Creed , a son has it happens he didn't know he had and a son no one else in the universe knew he had apart from the producers of this movie . Did someone say contrived ? How about another word beginning with C - cynical ? Yes that's the word we're looking for . Cynical But this isn't a film for cynics and it helps if you don't view this film through cynical eyes because like the original ROCKY from 40 years ago . It certainly tries to be feel good and might just succeed on that account if you're in the mood . Director Ryan Coogler does cast well with up and comer Michael B Jordan in the title role with real life boxers such as Ward and Bellew as pugilists and it's probably the only film you'll see where the climax takes place at Goodison Park in Liverpool . No doubt the people who enjoyed the previous films in the ROCKY series will enjoy this one but you've seen it all before many times even down to having the bad guys speak with British accents</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone Should Have Won The Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Sly movie in order, I come to Creed.Plot In A Paragraph: Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed.Long rumoured, Sly publicly turned this movie down on more than one occasion. And I was in the camp that was glad he did. I didn't want anything ruining the ending to Rocky Balboa, which for this Zoner was perfect. However a few flops at the domestic box office later, and it's back to Rocky. And it is the smartest decision he made in years, winning the Golden Globe and taking him all the way to the Oscars. (I still say he should have won) Whilst I enjoyed Creed immensely, I can see both sides of the argument regarding this movie. I'll get what I didn't like out of the way first. Whilst I loved the nods and references, I thought it literally borrowed TOO heavily from the first movie from me (Just a few....The champs opponent breaking something prior to the fight, and the Champ needing an opponent quick, and said opponent is chosen because of his name. The fighters needing separating at the end of the second round, A 14th round knock down with the champ turning his back to celebrate as the hero gets up, the result of the fight) It undid all the Rocky/Robert relationship restored by the end of Balboa. How did the vultures of the gutter press, not pick up on how sick Rocky was looking?? And did Robert not see any pics of his Dad in the papers or on TV, and think "He's not looking too well, I'll give him a call" I didn't relate to Adonis (nobody's fault) but when Rocky wasn't on screen, especially early on, I wasn't that interested, and was tempted to reach for the remote, to run it forward to the next time Rocky was featured. As someone who has lost close (TOO many) family members and loved ones to Cancer, and been with them all the way through it, the scenes of Rocky receiving his treatment, struggling to the toilet and needing to be tucked in, struck me far TOO close to home as I thought they may. Tony Bellew was intimidating enough, but thought his physique lacked, and he almost looked fat next to Jordan.Now on to the good.Sly is fantastic, and is totally worthy of his Golden Globe win and Oscar Nomination!! It's defiantly an Oscar worthy, so for him not to win, was guttering!! He was the best thing in the movie, and when he wasn't on screen, I found myself thinking "When is Rocky coming back in to it" Although I think his Balboa performance, was better (the "It wasn't supposed to be like this Paulie" scene in the meat house and the "It ain't about how hard you hit" Speech come to mind) and it could be argued Copland is too!! I thought all the cast were good, especially Jordan, and I really liked Rashad, even if she was under used!! (I thought it would be her at the hotel room door, the night before the fight, meaning Rocky finally called her) I loved it when Gonna Fly Now kicked in during the start of the final round.I know it's not to everyone's taste, but I enjoyed the score, and all the fight scenes were well shot too!! Though I'm not quite sure how it was a split decision. He seemed well beat to me. The scenes that I cried at 1 When Rocky got the news 2 "Put everything that was good in my life in a bowl" 3 seeing Rocky struggle during the training montage 4 "You're a Creed and I love you kid" and the Rocky music kicked in 5 seeing Rocky struggling up the steps. It was nice to see Sly playing Rocky again, and it is a very touching movie that reduced me to tears more then once. It's a well made, entertaining movie, and I do enjoy it. But I don't feel the need to revisit this movie that often. I think my ten your old son summed it up best. When I suggested watching this, he questioned why I wanted to watch it, so I asked why not?? And he replied "If I want to watch a Rocky movie, I'll watch one of the real ones"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, as a huge Rocky fan, I feared I was going to hate this film. With Rocky no longer the central character and certainly no longer fighting I thought the film would be a buddy movie full of clichés from previous Rocky films. Fortunately those fears were unfounded and whilst the film could be said to follow the same Rocky formula, it could easily stand on its own if you knew nothing of the previous movies. Stallone is great and Michael B Jordan is proving himself an excellent actor. With talk of Creed 2 and even Creed 3 in the pipeline it shows that most people thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It also has a kicking soundtrack. Be sure to check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not titled Creed - it's YouTube. That's it. A guy watching YouTube. Unbelievable. It is as full of clich?, as I have ever seen in a quite some time. Where's the seriousness ? Doing another movie on the Rocky Series, a story that is worthless, and of course, poor acting, empty dialogue, clich? and zero effort. I can't believe the hype this gets, of course the younger generation totally buys it, but for the press, the movie columns to have the lack of integrity to praise a movie built on laziness and cllichés, is an embarrassment. Good thing this website shares a section for the people's appreciation. And guess what ? The Stallone clan who by the way, employs Mel Gibson (finally banned from Hollywood), has the nerves to call out the Academy jury urging, ordering for an Academy award is this a joke ? Great sense and posture of modesty, do I have to remind Richard Burton never won any award ? Should we even dare compare both filmographies ? Don't think so.The moment Stallone said "what are you like a cousin or something" and the answer "he's my faaaaaaaaaaaaaather" - I said this is going to be hard to digest. A stupid empty "love story", just because they had to insert it and boy they did reach. All it was, was promotion for YouTube. The fights were terrible. That is NOT boxing. Gosh, all you have to do is copy a fight and that can't be hard there are ton on YouTube, a site that the writers certainly know very well.There has to be a sense of discipline, we need to stop approving clich? and poor scripts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, forgettable, uninspired and unnecessary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need for a long review on this one.The acting was good for the most part all around. Thats about the only good part of the movie though.The music just doesn't fit a "rocky" movie. Sure it's a young modern fighter who is black and from LA, so maybe when a song plays we're supposedly listening to his headphones. Seems a little too cliché, that pretty much every song is hiphop or rap. I like rap, but it doesn't pump me up all that much. Not too mention unless you know the songs, they don't sound much different from each other in the clips they play. A balance would have been good, instead its mostly just loud rapping which sorta punches you out of the movie. But then again, the story is so incredibly predictable and forgettable that perhaps a gust of wind would take you out and a punch isn't necessary.The story is exactly what you think it is. Every scene will play out exactly how you think it will. When you're thinking "oh.. the big downfall is gonna be any minute now" it is. Then when you think, "the big upswing is coming any min now" it is. Whenever something is leading up to something you think will happen, you start thinking "tell me they didn't actually get this predictably cheesy" they did.The training was boring. Rocky training scenes were always the best part of the movie, these ones were completely boring. The fights.. ugh. I loved Rocky for the fights looking real, little to no blurry, echoey, slomo, "deep thoughts" style scenes mid fight. Was always action, looked like a real fight. The main fight here looked like a joke. Completely takes you out of the fight and the emotion. No one ever really looks like they're in much danger. No strategy or turning points are ever present. It was boring in that there wasn't much sway back and forth which can be realistic in pro boxing. But for a movie, the fight should be fun, engaging and exciting. There was nothing but montage-like, flashy, effect ridden montage of fight clips with an obviously green screened backdrop.You really don't care who wins by the end of the second round and the last minute of the fight is probably the worst acting/directing of an actor I've ever seen in my life. I'm assuming that wasn't Michael's decision but it looked STUPID. Horrible direction and choreography. The main opponent doesn't feel or seem like a "boxer" at all.Story is far-fetched and extremely predictable, not just the movie but the writing as well. Oh and I almost forgot there's a love interest in this one for the star... I almost forgot because it adds nothing and it's hollow.I didn't expect much from this since it's technically a revival and I know how those usually go. But I rather liked Rocky Balboa from 2006 for being actually entertaining and I thought I was going to be let down. This one delivered on the impending prediction of disappointment in that it wasn't really even entertaining.Good: - acting - sceneryBad: - story - music - choreography - direction - characters (other than Adonis and Rocky)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake of Rocky 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie isn't that bad, but its basically just a remake of the previous Rocky movies, particularly Rocky 1. Its better than the awful rocky 5, but you are better off watching the original Rocky 1 another time instead of seeing this one. The story is the same, but the original Rocky has a lot more charm. Stallone can play Rocky in his sleep, and Jordan does a decent job as the new "Rocky". However the chemistry between the lead characters isn't that great. I found it hard to believe their quickly formed friendship. The other characters don't get much screen time and are mostly unnecessary for the story. The relationship between Creed and his love interest Bianca is even more unbelievable than the friendship with Rocky. In this movie Rocky is a tired old man that has no will to live anymore. Considering his greatest quality was never giving up its not exactly "in character" for Rocky. It just feels like they had to make Rocky more pathetic as a part of rebooting the franchise with Creed as the main character as they finally realized Stallone is too old to fight. I think i'd prefer it if they just made a standalone boxing movie without trying to reboot Rocky without Rocky(Stallone).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to go see this movie because it got such high ratings. I wasn't far into the movie when I realized I'd probably wasted my time and money. I began to feel like walking out, which I haven't done in a long time, but I stayed just to see how much worse it could get. Everything seemed to play out just about as I expected, with a cliché here, and a bit of formula there. I saw nothing original or memorable about the movie, except for how painful it was to sit through the whole thing. I won't even risk saying anything that even resembles a spoiler, except to say to go ahead and use a bit of intuition after watching for 10-15 minutes to guess how it'll play out. If you're a thinking person's movie viewer you'll probably be mostly correct, bored out of your mind, and you'll also wonder why this movie got such high praise. I'm tempted to think it's a conspiracy... are there that many dullards out there?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just another glorification for competition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just the thing that is rotten with the so called "American way of Life". You could forgive the very first Rocky-film, because, although it was about competition, it was also about a Young man with abysmal prospects in Life grabbing the one chance he had for a better Life. That film did not necessarily glorify competition. You could even say that it was critical of a society, who gives a man no other option to better himself than to send Another man to kingdom come.After so many Rocky-films now past, there is now so such excuse. It's all about knocking out the other guy even if the score in the end may read differently.Jesus Words "Love each other" has nothing to do with the American society, which I prefer to call "the swingy", since it produces swines and not human beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic black lad tries boxing on a whim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin I must say that Rocky is my favourite movie of all time. What made Rocky so gripping is the fact that the protagonist was a classic underdog striving to reach his potential and stand up to his critics and those who set out to humiliate him. It's a film about determination, passion and persistence and we get to follow him on this tough journey.Creed, on the other hand, is a story of a generic black lad who takes up boxing on a whim because his dad was a boxer. Unlike his father who radiates charisma, Adonis Creed has a distinct lack of a personality and just fits into the stereotype for two dimensional black male protagonists. In fact, I would say he's the most two dimensional character since Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace.Of course, the Hollywood template requires a love subplot, so throw in generic black girl. We also have Rocky making a token return. To his credit, Stallone has a couple of emotional scenes and plays them very well, but the subplot seemed somewhat rushed and undeveloped...like the rest of this movie.I just couldn't get behind Creed. I didn't feel his motive for boxing; I didn't feel any emotion behind his performance or see any real heart or passion. It's like he gets his opportunities handed to him and just comes across as an advantaged kid.For me, the most interesting character in this movie was the champion, Ricky Conlan. He is cocky, brash and intimidating and Tony Bellew plays the role in a convincing way. In fact, he's very reminiscent of Apollo Creed in the first two Rocky films and his characteristics would've made for a much more interesting Adonis Creed in my opinion, as an anti-hero protagonist. Unfortunately "Pretty Ricky" gets limited screen time and doesn't get the build up he deserves. As a result, there is no rivalry between the two boxers and no real sense of adversity. I soon found myself backing Conlan and hoping for him to teach Creed some humility. Maybe I am being harsh on this movie because I'm comparing it to Rocky, but this is clearly a rehash of the original classic, so a comparison is inevitable. And on the whole it falls drastically short, lacking all the main traits that made the original movie so successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky, updated to the 21st century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting this to even be good, never mind as good as it is. Rocky is one of my favourite films, and this is pretty much what Rocky would have been if it had been made today, but probably better than what Rocky made today would have been if I am honest.It is not quite as good as the original, nothing ever will be, but damn. Jordan can act, Stallone is getting as close to acting as he can. You can sympathise with the characters and their motives. The film is just about long enough. The fight is as great as silly but watchable as any of the rocky fights. The fighters look more authentic than they did in the originals (which is because some of them really are boxers). Its just great.I am glad I finally watched this.The only problem really is that there are some things which in this age of social justice you cant really tell if it is just random, or if it is trying to be "meaningful". For example Creed's walk to the ring for the main fight of the film sees him basically walking through a sea of 100k jeering white people, the only non whites in the arena seeming to be Creed's friends and ring crew.But it is entirely possible that this is simply reading into something that isn't there. And there may well have been "social justice" type subthemes in the original films that I just don't get because of the age and geographical differences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film about boxing CREED manages to stay toward the top of the list. The story seems simple at first - The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed ? but in addition to playing on the old Stallone ROCKY movies it introduces some solid ideas about genetic inheritance, goals, family, and fulfillment. Directed and written (with Aaron Covington and Sylvester Stallone) by Ryan Coogler, the film manages to capture the language and atmosphere of the boxing set and while keeping the film grounded in reality and honest emotions.Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Johnson) lost his mother when he was young and would get into constant trouble and end up in foster care or juvenile detention. One day a woman (Phylicia Rashad) goes to see him and tells him that her late husband is his father - boxing great, Apollo Creed. She would take him in and educate him but he feels the need to be a boxer like his father. So he moves to Philadelphia and approaches Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and asks Rocky to train him. Rocky tries to talk him out of it but it's something he needs to do. Eventually Rocky offers to train him and when he beats a great boxer and his connection to Apollo is revealed, he is offered a chance to fight a world champion and all he needs to do is take the name Creed. The resolution of the film is very tender and to share those facts would be spoilers.The cast is uniformly fine ? both Johnson and Stallone offer first-rate performances, as do Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Ritchie Coaster, among others. This is a film that is more than just about boxing and that is what makes is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd give this a 5.5 if I could but am feeling generous. I expected big things from the movie, and was very disappointed. After the first 30 minutes I was wondering when the plot was going to go somewhere or if I should just give up on the film. I stuck it out but it didn't get much better.Stallone and Jordan do a good acting job, but it's not enough to save a dragged out, pretty predictable story. The love interest doesn't come across strong - she is no Adrian.The build-up to the final fight is just typical boxing movie - see some drills, but nothing unique in the training scenes - just some rehashes of Rocky drills and no catchy events.After writing this review, I should probably rate it even lower!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of in the Rocky franchise since the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the seventh instalment in the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. Adonis Creed is spectacularly played by the perfectly cast Michael B. Jordan in what may be his best role and performance to date. The movie once again features Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa - Stallone's performance is surprisingly effective; he embodies the character perfectly after Rocky Balboa in 2006, ten years ago. His acting in this movie is far better than you might expect from him at this stage, but you will be pleasantly surprised - he won Best Supporting Acting at the Golden Globes for a reason. Tessa Thompson plays Bianca, Adonis' love interest, who gives a deceptively complex character that adds something great to the movie. What the movie gives for the first half is familiar fare for these movies - displaying the well earned nostalgia that these movies have earned - but at the same time director Ryan Coogler manages to revivify the series, and through his strong and clearly talented directing makes the movie stand alone as a genuinely strong dramatic piece. For long time fans of the series, this movie will be particularly emotionally potent, but even to new time fans this is will still be a strong movie. Cinematographer Maryse Alberti does a great job shooting the movie and in his own right adds something excellent to the movie (an almost five minute boxing scene which is all shot in one take is particularly mesmerising).In conclusion, Creed is an excellent movie - the best since the 1976 original, which can, in a large part, be put down to Ryan Coogler's fantastic directing. The characters are very strong, in particular Michael B. Jordan's, and the acting also great. It does justice to the previous movies while at the same time trying something new and effective.</fullReview>

The final fight represents freedom from this high pressure.It is understandable that day per day is brief because it's a story. If it isn't that way, it would be a report or documentary. The magic begins from here. Know what is hell and get the heart on fire to take it. "Take and keep moving forward".There are other sequels of Rocky which should nominate Sly for an award. However, appreciate to Academy Awards.Perhaps, this spin-off deserves the same mention of an original story. Sometimes results depends on working and not in their origins.</fullReview>

It's so obvious that this take was done so many times, that the kids already know what to do so they do it automatically. The guy playing the officer just says his lines, without even noticing that it's not relevant anymore. After that, the officer just stands without doing anything - because he didn't receive any other lines or instructions from the director.Continuing the shot, the camera goes to the next room. It's supposed to be a fight in progress (that's why the alarm was sound), but the actors are just waiting for the camera guy to enter the room and only then start the fight.My god, what a sloppy direction. And it's only the FIRST shot of the movie!This movie just goes on and on. It's way too long, too predictable, too "by the book". You really need to be a Rocky fan to enjoy watching the same movie you've seen so many times before. You'll forget this movie 10 minutes after watching it.Stallone and the lead actor are OK in their role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed when Stallone didn't win the Oscar this year, but after finally seeing Creed, the reason was clear. There just were not enough scenes with Rocky where he could really act. The story was there, but there was too much time spent on Creed's girlfriend. Really, who really cares about her story. They tried to recreate similar interest like with Adrian/Rocky but it falls flat. She's a singer, but that brings up the whole music of the film. Music falls flat - you won't hear more than one note from any of the Rocky films. the new music just sucked.There is a twist, makes you think of Burgess Meredith, but in the end I really wished the story had concentrated more on Rocky, and on the Rocky/Creed relationship. It's too bad, because this was probably Stallone's only last shot at an Oscar. The ending is predictable, but you will smile. This should be in for Rocky, but heh, you never know. Enjoy.</fullReview>

This is more or less what it is though, albeit that the film does it well. The formula is played out as you expect as we have a journey which is both physical and emotional, with plenty of montage moments, and of course the traditional big fight at the end. In doing this the film is nicely judged to play on the emotions not only for the film but also for the previous ones. The writing is unsurprising throughout, but it benefits from a good cast ? in particular a very fine lead from Jordan, who is likable and engaging.Those wringing their hands over him not being nominated for best actor perhaps are mistaking charisma for acting ? he has both but it is not a brilliant performance, although he has some in his past and probably many ahead of him. Stallone plays the nostalgia and sentiment well, adding to the charisma, while Thompson is sparky and fun albeit in a hugely familiar role for this type of film. Mostly the film rides the clichés well, making the film work thanks to the stars involved. The writing limits it, with scenes mostly spelt out for the viewer, but it hangs together well. The boxing action is mostly good, with the single tracking shot bout being the most engaging. The finale is solid but is a little lacking in thrills, even if it does do the job well enough for the level which the film is mostly pitched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your legacy is more than a name.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this is the second best Rocky movie out there. I mean I know It's really more of an Adonnis movie, but you get my drift. To start, the casting of Michael B Jordan as the son of Apollo Is perfectly done, I honestly couldn't picture anyone else taking the mantle. Stallone carries on from Balboa being brilliant on screen, even earning an Oscar nod, also hold up. I have to say I think the whole premise of Rocky being completely and utterly vulnerable for the first time due to cancer in this movie is the perfect way to take the character. Here is a man who has long reigned as a somewhat king of the world type figure, at the end of his time, but before he goes he passes the torch to a new champion. Amazing, just amazing. Mind you ... my only gripe with this movie is that unlike in the previous Rocky movies, I saw next to no importance of the antagonist in this movie. But other than that Creed is a brilliant way at breathing new life into the Rocky franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retro, minimalistic pugilistic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boxing stories can be told in a retro style. In fact many are, such as "Cinderella Man" and "Southpaw". What happens in the ring, if capably presented, renders contemporary Hollywood fast-paced, visual-image-heavy narrative unnecessary for generating excitement. Telling the story in the good old-fashioned way is just fine. But minimalistic is something else.The titular name should be familiar to "Rocky" fans. This movie, however, is not on a spin-off of Rocky's rival and eventually friend Apollo Creed (whom some claims to have been modelled after Ali), but about someone who initially deliberately avoids association with the world-renounced name. Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is his out-of-wedlock son and, despite being rescued from deprivation by Creed's widow and brought up in affluence, understandably wants to make it on his own. As plot line requires, the secret finally leaks and Johnson enters the climatic fight as a Creed.Those who have seen "Southpaw" will remember Forest Whitaker's powerful performance as the protagonist's (an excellent Jake Gyllenhaal) trainer. Trainer-fighter relationship features just as importantly in "Creed". Without duly undermining Sylvester Stallone, he is not quite in the same acting league as Whitaker?well, not until Rocky becomes young Creed's trainer. Stallone won Golden Globe for best supporting actor, and got a shot at Oscar which, unfortunately for him, had an exceptionally strong field (Mark Rylance eventually came out on top, deservedly, with "Bridge of Spies"). Still, Stallone put in a good fight (no pun intended) with the uncharacteristic minimalistic performance denoted in my summary line. Michael Jordan (Bakari, not Jeffrey) shuns his silly persona in the "Fantastic Four" reboot and puts in a wonderful performance, also minimalistic. Playing the protagonist's singer girlfriend, Tessa Thompson is simply endearing.Circling back to my summary line, watching "Creed" feels like savoring a favorite meal that mother used to make: simple pleasure, including the blood and sweat in the exciting bouts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky is back!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the seventh movie in this franchise, which started way back in nineteen seventy six and has seen ups ( Rocky 1, 2 and Rocky Balboa), just enjoyable ( Rocky 3 and 4 ) and downfalls (Rocky 5). And Creed is in my opinion the best since the first and is my personal favorite. In short Creed is awesome and I was amazed that Stallone really this time acted, for real in constant wit what we have seen from him in resent years, for instance the Expentables series.So this film follows Adonis Creed, who as the name reveal is Apollo Creed's son and he wants to become a boxer like his late father, but here is the nice part : He wants to be famous by his own and not by his surname!! So he asks Mr Balboa of training and advises. One bonus fact is that is depicted as a fun of the Rocky lore, like we are, which shows that the writers wanted him be rel eatable and not be a puss over like with Jurassic World. Now the secondary characters like Creed's mother are human in their reactions ,but have their time to make a joke which after you see the flick, you will remember it.The training and fighting scenes were expertly choreographed and Micheal B. Jordan looked the part . But the person who stole the show in the flick was Rocky himself ,who now is more a father-mentor figure that the lead and this fitted him ,because lets be real ,Stallone you can not be a lead in a sport-action flick in your late sixties! If this is the end of the Rocky saga or the beginning of the Creed, is as yet ( June 2016) unknown. In any case is a strong intro to the story line of this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid continuation of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did like the previous entry of this series ("Rocky Balboa"), though I did think that Sylvester Stallone had taken the series as far as it could go. But in this entry, thanks in part to new director and co- writer Ryan Coogler, we get some freshness and a new angle to look at. And the end results are pretty well done. Yes, there are some predictable elements in the movie that you'll be able to guess will happen a scene or two before they unfold. But as familiar as some parts of the movie may be, the movie at all times remains competently written and directed; each moments does play out in a convincing manner that you'll believe could happen in real life. The acting is solid by all the participants, particularly Michael B. Jordan and Stallone. The only real problem I had with the movie is that it does play out a little too long and stretched out - some slight tightening would have helped things. But even with that nitpick, the movie is still well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is the illegitimate son of boxing champ Apollo Creed. He was born after his father's death in the ring and spent his childhood in juvenile detention until rescued by Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad). He fights in Mexico and quits his office job in favor of boxing. Mary opposes it and he's prevented from training. He seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) in Philly to train him. He falls for downstairs neighbor Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Champ 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan injures his opponent during a media event and takes on the newcomer for the money.This is going back to the original. Adonis is the new Rocky. He's got the inner fire. He's got the sweet romance. I am glad that Rocky finally puts up his gloves for good. This gets back to its roots with a well-written story and compelling characters. There is a big fight midway in the movie that is one continuous shot. It reminds the audience of how new the original was with its fighting sequences. The sequence is a master work and beautiful to behold. This is a good rejuvenation and a new jolt to an old franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great extension of a brilliant franchise! 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I really thought it was a joke, when I heard that they making a movie about Apollo Creeds son but now that I have finally watched it, I actually really enjoyed it. Maybe because Sly didn't direct it! All of the Rocky movies, up to 4, have been great and this movie should have been the 5th in the franchise. Michael B. Jordan plays Adonis Johnson, who is Apollo Creed's son, and he has the same fire and love for boxing as his father. After a troubled childhood, Apollo's widow, Mary Ann Creed (Phylicia Rashad) decides to adopt Adonis, even though she isn't his mother, and he takes on a desk job to please Mary but his heart is devoted to boxing. He then decides to quit his job and go into boxing full time, against Mary Ann's wishes, and he moves to Philadelphia to pursue his career. As he wants to become successful without using his father's name, he begins his journey under the name of Johnson and he seeks out Rocky to train him. After a couple of successful bouts, he gets the opportunity to fight for a belt, so they have to dig hard to prepare for the fight. I don't want to spoil the movie too much for people who haven't watched it, so I won't go into depth about the other elements which made the movie so good. Jordan plays Creeds son extremely well and I liked the chemistry between Adonis and Stallone, who also put in a great performance. The fighting scenes were choreographed extremely well and the whole atmosphere surrounding the fights, seemed real. I was pumped up after watching the film, like when I watched the old Rocky movies, so I have to commend the director for doing this great franchise justice. Its still sad to see Rocky down in the dumps, after having such a successful boxing career but it's good to see that he still has the ability to train a boxer and teach him some wisdom, even though he still has some of his dim witted ways. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I can't wait to see a sequel. Great!Round-Up: After the awful Fantastic Four remake, which also starred Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, it's good to see him put that firmly behind him, and put in a top performance in this movie. At 29 years old, he certainly has the screen charisma to become a big star and he was the perfect choice to play Apollo Creeds son, because Apollo certainly was a charismatic character. I still would have liked to have seen Adonis reunite with his mother, and to see what he had planned to do with his boxing career but that's just me being picky. This movie was written and directed by Ryan Cooglar, who brought you Fruitvale Station, which also starred Michael B. Jordan. I have to give props to the director, for taking on such a massive franchise, and casting the creator. He definitely brought the best out of all of the actors and the various boxers also seemed professional and the punches looked real. I was a bit skeptical when I saw the length of the film but it really needed to be that long, because you get an in depth look into all of the characters. Anyway, is a well put together movie which deserved the profit at the box office.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $174millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their sport/dramas starring Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Phyllicia Rashad, Ritchie Coaster and Wood Harris. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rocky Renaissance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably the best Rocky movie ever made.I'm fairly certain they're making a sequel to this, but they don't have to. It brilliantly and properly does what the last couple Rocky movies have been trying and failing to do: wrap up Rocky's character. And in doing so, it includes elements from all the movies in the franchise without feeling fanservicey. It completes the cycle started in the first movie way back in 1976, 40 years from time of writing.This movie is about Apollo's son, Adonis Creed (best name in the world, BTW), hence the title. But what's really clever is this is not just one of those cases where they picked the title because it was the first proper-sounding thing that comes to mind, like how about half or more of all biopics are titled after the first or last name of the protagonist. The Creed name is a major theme of the movie. What does it mean? How much does it belong to Adonis, who never met his father? Should he stick tightly to it, or should he form his own legacy? Adonis is the product of an affair Apollo had. His mother died early, and he bounced around group homes and juvie, gaining a reputation as a very pugnacious individual. Out of the kindness in her heart, Apollo's widow tracked him down and raised him as her own. He grew up in Apollo's grand mansion, and he got a good education and a good desk job. But fighting is in his blood. He quits his desk job and leaves home, much to the dismay of Apollo's widow.It's a writing to challenge to establish why someone like Adonis would walk away from the life he has to pursue fighting, but this film nails it perfectly, with some good help from Michael B. Jordan's acting. It doesn't labor on the issue, but it makes sure you get what's at play here.Adonis goes to Philadelphia to train with Rocky Balboa. It's nice to see how him and Apollo have passed into boxing legend status. Rocky's III and IV got really campy and over-the-top, but this film really makes it feel like the plots of those films actually happened. It's a nice little thing that retroactively improves some of the other films in the franchise, and it's a good piece of world-building.Rocky doesn't want to train Adonis at first, but he wins him over. It soon becomes clear that Rocky has a character arc of his own in this film. He starts off depressed, and you understand why. All the people he's cared about- Micky, Apollo, Adrian, Paulie- they're all dead now, and he's just drifting along, waiting for his turn to die. When he gets cancer, he decides to let it kill him. But Adonis won't stand for it. The two of them help each other learn how to fight. The Rocky/Adonis scenes are the best in the movie. They're packed with so much emotion and feeling. These characters are both good people, but they help each other become better and overcome their flaws. It's really beautiful.Actually, the relationships are probably the best thing about this movie. Every one of them seems real and genuine. This film has a glorious emotional core. I gave Edge of Tomorrow a five out of five, and I stand by that, but it was missing something. When I watched this movie, I realized it was that emotional core. Special attention goes to the relationship between Adonis and Bianca. The Rocky and Adrian relationship is famous, but this blows by it in so many ways. I love this two as a couple. Their relationship is natural and sweet and complex, and it doesn't have to resort to clichés. These two have such chemistry. I could literally see these two characters falling in love even if we didn't need a romance on the side. If they do make a sequel, I'm excited to see what happens to them in the future.And yeah, Sly got robbed at the Oscars, but so did Ryan Coogler. This guy should have gotten an directing nom. He's got great instincts, and he knows exactly what do to maximize the potency of a scene. The fighting scenes are masterful, and so is the scene where he's training as the community rides behind him, and so is the last scene of the film. The man is the real deal. He's one of the best young directors in the business, and he is arguably the best African-American director ever. I really want to see Black Panther now.This film is a work of prime artistry. The original Rocky won Best Picture. This is a better movie than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies of 2015. One of the best Rocky movies. One heck of a movie that will keep you watching until the credits are over. This movie is more of a showcase of what a great director and excellent actors can do. This movie is all about Michael B. Jordan. Jordan pretty much crossed over into starhood thanks to this masterful film. There a moments where you can see Jordan becoming the Creed from the first few Rocky movies. A lot of people complain about this movie being a ripoff or remake of the first Rocky movie and to those people I say, close but no cigar. This is very much its own movie. Only the ending of the final fight and Creed's character getting the major title fight mirror the original movie in some ways. This is very much its own animal and a movie that stays with you. Sylvester Stallone is great in this movie but a little overrated. I didn't think he deserved to win any awards for his performance. He was great in the role but he's no Mickey, how can he be? The real star of the movie is the director, Ryan Coogler. He has an eye and uses it well. I'm more than happy that he will be director Black Panther. Hollywood needs to stop getting this stupid directors who know the right people and they need to get directors with real talent like the director of this masterpiece. Over and out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the champ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During its 40 year history, the 'Rocky' franchise has certainly had an interesting evolutionary curve. The first two, though ultimately uplifting, were sort of gritty and gray. The next two were slick and flashy. In both instances they were a mirror of the times they were made in. The fifth one tried (rather unsuccessfully) to bring things back around to the original before 'Rocky Balboa' did just that and sent things out on a high note. But then someone got the idea to go back into that world and see if there was anything else left to mine. To my complete surprise there was.'Creed' is, in many ways, 'Rocky' remade. It's almost the original film beat for beat. What makes it different, however, are the characters that occupy the story. Adonis Creed is not Rocky Balboa. He's also not Apollo Creed. He's a unique character whose journey is much different despite going down many of the same roads. Michael B. Jordan really impressed me here. He felt totally authentic and took a character who in less capable hands might not have been able to make the movie his own. That's because he was not only alongside a character that so many of us love, but he had to compete against a powerhouse performance from Sylvester Stallone. That Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination were certainly well deserved. Think there was nothing fresh for him to do this seventh time around? Think again. Stallone gives the best performance of his career, and though Jordan's Adonis Creed more than shines, Rocky is the soul of the movie. I was also captivated by Tessa Thompson, who has such excellent chemistry with Jordan and carves out her own niche in the story.Writer/Director Ryan Coogler is a real talent. Like most great storytellers, he takes classic tales and makes them feel new again. Creed may not offer many surprises, but the new characters and their journey still feel fresh here. It may not quite be in the same stratosphere as the original ,Rocky,, but it's more than worthy to wear that championship belt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, Warmed Over Sentiment in an Obvious, Paint by Numbers Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most damning evidence that Hollywood dismisses films predominantly featuring minorities is not that "Creed" was mostly overlooked at the 2015 Academy Awards but that it was one of the only examples of minority films made that year that people could dig up to make their point. If "Creed" is the best they could do, then there really is a problem in Hollywood, but the problem isn't that the Academy doesn't nominate black artists -- it's that there aren't enough good movies made by black artists to nominate."Creed" is one of the most pedestrian, obvious, and dull movies I've seen in a long time. Not a single thing about it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar, though ironically Sylvester Stallone, who was nominated and drew the ire of Oscars So White protesters for the Academy's gall in giving the film's sole nomination to the only white person in it, is the best thing about it. The film is so by the numbers that I only half-way paid attention to it starting at the half-way point and still called the maudlin ending from a mile away. You don't spend 2 hours shoving a "will he or won't he live up to the legacy of his father" story down our throats unless you intend for the film to answer that question with a resounding "yes" in its last moments.To be fair, I was never really that into the Rocky movies, so maybe I just wasn't the target audience. But I do remember the first "Rocky" enough to know that its underdog story, while still pushing all the requisite emotional buttons, felt genuinely inspiring, while "Creed" feels like warmed over sentiment sprinkled with a dusting of nostalgia for the Rocky series.Needless to say, not exactly a knockout.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures the spirit of the original while staying contemporary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make a film in the dramatic spirit of the first 2 "Rocky" movies (before the character drifted into superhero territory) but to make it still a contemporary film is a neat trick and the work pulls it off nicely. Since the late 1970's boxing has drifted out of the main stream and again become a niche sport (without Google-ing whose the current top contender for the heavyweight crown? Or for that matter whose the current heavyweight champion?). The film reflects the new reality with Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Creed working the Mexican boxing circuit and holding down a job before leaving to find roots beyond those provided by his father's true wife. While Jordan looks little like Carl Weathers and his dower serious mien tracks not at all with Weathers' portrayal of the elder creed as a charismatic showman who dances with the late James Brown, he physical command of the sport makes for a solid if not compelling leading man outing. Award shows have already given kudos to Stallone for committing to a now humbled, hampered Rock Balboa. The somewhat tacked on final scene of him leaning on Jordan's character to make it to the top of the Philadelphia Museum of Art steps to see the statue of himself that institution longs to rid itself of makes for one of the most compelling in the film. The film itself does well with exploring themes of fatherhood, defiance vs. resignation and identity but less well with actual plot which follows the Rocky formula like an 8 year old following a Martha Stewart recipe. In short, an entertaining film in it's own right and a nice addition to the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thirty years after Apollo Creed died in the ring his son Adonis Creek makes his mark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this movie at home on DVD from my local public library. Basic rental DVD, movie only, no extras. My wife only watched the first 1/3 of it, she isn't much into boxing movies.It was 30 years earlier, in 1985's Rocky IV, that Apollo Creed died in the ring at the fists of a Russian fighter. Now in 2015 that is a distant memory for Rocky Balboa (Stallone) as he is enjoying retirement in Philadelphia.The movie actually starts some 20 years earlier, we see a boy named Adonis frequently getting in trouble at school, almost always fighting and getting the best of larger boys. It seems he was born to fight. We soon figure out Adonis, often called Don, is the out-of-wedlock child of Apollo Creed, born right after his dad died so he never got to meet him. But Creed's wife, Phylicia Rashad as Mary Anne Creed, takes in the boy and raises him. When the story cuts again to present time we see Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson (Creed will come later) fighting in Mexico most weekends, winning all his fights and earning some extra money. But weekdays he has a white collar office job in San Diego, and in fact is being promoted. But he quits instead, he wants to give his fighting career full attention.He travels to Philadelphia and looks up Rocky. He talks Rocky into not only training him but also let him live with him. Naturally a love interest must enter, it is pretty Tessa Thompson as budding singer Bianca.The movie could have become very trite and syrupy but it doesn't. It presents a plausible fictional story and we see Rocky training a young man who becomes almost family to him, and caring about him like his own son.Training is rushed to take advantage of a quick title fight before the fighter has to go off to jail for assault. That part is played by real British champion fighter Tony Bellew as 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan.Overall a very good movie.SPOILERS for my own recollection - The title fight is held, no one gave Adonis much of a chance to even go beyond 2 or 3 rounds, but he fights bravely and even knocks the champ down, almost for a ten-count. But in the end Adonis loses the fight by a split decision and the champ whispers in his ear that he is the future of their division.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughts on Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If he dies, he dies," says Ivan Drago coldly after watching an unconscious, mercilessly beaten Apollo Creed lying in the arms of rival and best friend Rocky Balboa. It was that day thirty years ago in 1985 that we saw former heavyweight champ Apollo Creed fight his final bout before being called home. In the eyes of many, that was the last time we would ever hear about the boxing legend. Then came a young, hungry raw talent carrying the name of a Greek God and the blood of the late Apollo. Enter Adonis Creed, portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in his second lead film role and known by many as 16-year-old drug dealer "Wallace," from hit HBO drama, The Wire. Along with a cast of veterans such as Sylvester Stallone and Phylicia Rashad, professional boxers Tony Bellew and Andre Ward, and Tessa Thompson, Jordan still manages to shine in the lead role as Apollo's illegitimate son. It all starts with the first name matching Jordan's noticeably ripped physique. A tribute to the discipline he shows in his craft for bringing fictitious characters to life much the same as he did when he was Vince Howard on Friday Night Lights.Aside from Jordan's quality portrayal, the film scores well by giving a sense of reality and legitimate human emotion to it. When Adonis decides to turn down a promotion at a very steady job at a securities firm to pursue boxing full time, the decision is met with much scrutiny by his boss and current legal guardian, Mary Anne Creed, Apollo's widow who agreed to take Adonis in 17 years earlier. As the audience, we can feel her pain as we recall Apollo's death and hear her speak about the tough nights where she had to walk him up the stairs or bathe him because he was too battered and bruised to do it himself. Against her wishes, Adonis moves from Los Angeles to Philadelphia in search of Rocky to receive formal training. We're hit with reality once again as Adonis attempts to step out of his late father's shadow by taking on his late mother's last name, Johnson. At one point, Rocky suggests if Apollo were alive today, he would attempt to talk his son out of taking on the life of a fighter. This parallels how the legendary Michael Jordan has been vocal about not exactly wanting his kids to play basketball because of the scrutiny they will face as a result of his legacy. Like most kids, they played anyway, and so does Adonis. While carrying the Johnson name works for a short amount of time, it isn't long before a jealous trainer in the Philly gym does some checking and finds out who Adonis really is. When he brings this Rocky's attention, Rocky pleads with him for confidentiality that we all know won't last long. When word finally gets out, and Adonis's love interest, Bianca discovers the full truth, she has mixed emotions. We also get an ESPN connection as we see PTI co-hosts Michael Wilbon and Tony Kornheiser discuss Apollo as if he were a real athlete. Adonis is confronted with the name issue once again when the trainer for current champion "Pretty" Ricky Conlan requests a fight but demands that Adonis go by Adonis "Hollywood" Creed for better promotion. Adonis is hesitant at first but eventually gives in after the love and motivation from Bianca convinces him that he has earned the right to use the name and shouldn't be as concerned about being in someone else's shadow. Once he comes to grips with the fact he cannot escape his father's legacy, we see a mentally renewed Adonis. One who is ready to live out his dream. One who is ready to take on whatever challenges come his way both in and outside the ring. We get to witness the final transformation of a young raw talent to a professional fighter ready for the big time. Perhaps the most admirable trait of Adonis is the willingness to trade in the big bucks and secure job in order to pursue what's in his heart. Something so many people, especially Americans, want to do but either aren't able to because of circumstances or lack the courage to go forth in their journey. He represents someone who understands that no matter how much money you make, it is all temporary and getting spent eventually. But something that gives you a passionate feeling and stirs your soul, that's way more valuable than money. We also admire him for having the humility to recognize the need for formal training. While his raw talent is undeniable, he is humble and smart enough to realize talent alone won't take him as far as he wants to go in the boxing world. For pursuing his dream and remaining humble, Adonis becomes an on screen hero who both inspires and teaches us at the same time. We are inspired to pursue our passions with all our hearts, and we are taught to never give up. Impossible is merely a state of mind. While the Rocky series has always been inspirational dating back to its original film in 1976, I must say Creed takes the cake as the best one. And for being the seventh one in line, that says quite a bit about this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not end the round</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were doubts about this movie, but it turned out to be a sure hit. It was a great way to continue the Rocky story, but also start a new phase that could carry on for years to come. It is ironic that this story of Creed began where Rocky began in the original.It was different to see Rocky coach rather than fight. But in a way he was still fighting. But it was not physically it was instead for self and legacy.Creed was a troubled child growing up. He was always getting himself into fights with everyone he came across. He was his father's son. The fight was in him, and he just needed the proper guidance to learn how to control it. So as Rocky was helping Creed train to fight, Creed was helping Rocky keep his name alive. The majority of the movie was revolved around the character development of Creed. But it was well needed if this story is going to continue with sequels.Although Creed was robbed of his fight, he sure did show everyone what he was made of. Everyone thought that he was a fake Creed and they thought that he could not live up to the level of gratitude that his father Apollo Creed had reached in the ring.It was good to see this movie end where Rocky began his journey. It was an excellent way to pass the torch on and keep the legacy going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing story turns the life of a young man from from nowhere to an adventure thanks to the help of an old friend of his father and blood of boxing running through his veins.Nicolas Stern the executive producer and one of the many producers this movie had. All the producers did a great job with this movie which was released on January 19,2015 in Liverpool and November 25, 2015 in the U.S. In this story a young man named Adonis has been getting in fights all his life, but he actually gets a chance to make it worth something when he finds himself a mentor that will help him become great.The setting of this story is mainly around boxing gyms and Adonis being around his mentor. This is effective because Adonis grows and connects with both practicing and becoming better and his mentor and because of that Adonis is able to have someone he can trust both training him and on his corner of the ring.The creators of this movie wanted to show us that no matter how many challenges this young boxer came across and no matter how many times he got hit in the ring; he never gave up. He always kept pushing, kept getting up, and kept punching back. All that is what really matters when Adonis faces his greatest challenge.This is one of the best movies I have seen and it will be one of the most memorable. This is a movie that I would absolutely recommend everyone to watch.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creed. Is the first Stallone Rocky movie to not be written or directed by Stallone. Creed carries the spirit of Stallone's Rocky. and the Vision of Creed's writers and its director. And Creed has a powerful vision. Adonis Johnson is the son of Apollo Creed. Apollo had a affair that resulted in Adonis. Adonis has never met his father . Having been born after the events in Rocky 4. and after his mother dies Adonis is the victim of the system. until Apollo's wife tracks him down. And brings him in. She raises him to be a Creed. And Adonis like his father has the burning desire to be a fighter. He seeks out the man that beat his father for the Heavyweight Championship all those years ago. Rocky Balboa is older.maybe wiser. His friends and family are all gone. but when Adonis shows up on Rocky's doorstep asking for Rocky to train him. It's the first steps of a journey that'll take them to life death and redemption and love. Rocky and Adonis form a family. Adonis calls Rocky Uncle. because after all is said and done. Rocky and Adonis have no one else but each other. And their love for one another is going to see them thru some harsh challenges.A powerful story given life by incredible acting. Creed isn't another Rocky movie. It stands on its own and needs to be its own franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was such an emotional revival!! I loved all the other Rockys. Silvester Stallone is such a big, great actor, despite the passage of years. Michael Jordan has a spectacular performance through out the movie. I like the Rocky- Adonis duo, such a great relationship, family like. The movie was emotional , it brought me to tears at times. It had a lot of passages from previous Rockys, which was kinda nice. Also the Appollo scenes are there too. The fights were perfect length, not to much blood, not too intense. The ending was pretty perfect and also the pace of the movie was good. I loved that it lasted 2 hours and kept me on the edge of my seat all along. It's worth seeing !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Coogler's Creed feels more like a reboot, as good as can be, of original Rocky than like the next part in the Rocky series. Creed builds on Rocky movies' blueprint, adding emotional depth and family drama to the mix. Creed is more of a family drama than a sports drama. Emotional layers are slowly and expertly unraveled and emotional gravity reaches its zenith when Adonis Creed confides to Rocky, in the last fight, that he wants to prove to the world that he is not a mistake. Still Creed doesn't fail to pack a punch in its realistic, intense and close-up shot boxing and training sequences, during which I felt my adrenaline rush frequently. Character's depth and acting is uniformly excellent, except for Bianka's, whose role though necessary felt forced. Adonis Creed's and Rocky Balboa's relationship is as central to the plot as is Creed's journey to make his own legacy. Creed has enough flesh to make its own legacy, while it has enough references to pay homage to the Rocky series. I strongly recommend Creed to drama, sports or otherwise, lovers. To others, watch it if you have nothing else to catch on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to form for a one time champion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Rocky Balboa himself, fighting against the odds to achieve the ultimate glory, Creed, the movie that no one but the most die-hard of Rocky and Stallone fans wanted, became one of last year's feel good hits, commercially and critically and even became an Oscar nominee in concerns to industry veteran Sylvester Stallone's considered and effective supporting turn.The success of Creed came as a surprise to even the most optimistic of movie lovers and while Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler keeps his film firmly planted in the boxing movie 101 handbook, he and his team do enough with the formula to give Creed a different flavour, from it's intense in your face boxing matches, its often witty and smart script and a finale that thankfully doesn't feel over drenched in schmaltz ridden life lessons or unbelievable feats.It was a wise move for Creed's behind the scenes team to nab Coogler for the directional job, his a promising young director that has in the space of Fruitvale Station and now Creed, developed himself into a director to watch with his keen eye and deft hand with emotion a feature of his work and it's understandable as to why Marvel have signed him up to helm their Black Panther venture.Coogler's success with both Fruitvale and Creed also stem from his working collaboration with actor Michael B. Jordan, who seemingly shuns his terrible turn and experience in the Fantastic Four to deliver a great turn here as Apollo Creed's very own son Adonis. Jordan looks the part (after an 11 month training regime) and does a fine job with his emotional scenes and it was never going to be an easy task for someone to shun The Italian Stallion to a supporting role but Jordan is the focus of this film and doesn't let it down even with Stallone on almost career best form.While his never been one to leave things where they should be, the should've stopped examples of the Rambo franchise and The Expendable's clear examples of this, Stallone was talked into appearing once more as his most beloved creation and he would be mightily glad he came back for another round.Displaying nuance as an actor and letting Jordan take lead, Stallone is effective and likable once more and it's the best incarnation of Rocky Balboa we've seen since the original. Taking on the Micky role of the first film, Stallone doesn't exactly push himself but it's great to see him finally deliver a turn once more that shows he can in fact act.Creed in many ways is what it is, a boxing movie we've seen numerous times before but it's delivered in a fashion that elevates the material above what it is, even though it's by no means an outright knock out. Coogler and his actors have worked together to give us a feel good sporting film and against all the odds, leave us wanting more from the Rocky universe, which 12 months ago would've seemed like a near impossibility.3 ? privacy invading tortoises out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky 2.0: The Jawn Strikes Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Rocky is a story about a down and out Joe Everyman who's given a great opportunity because of his nickname and gives it everything he's got to better his life with the help of an old trainer. Creed is a story about a wealthy young man who's been given everything in life but is only interested in fighting and is given a great opportunity because of his father's name and gives it everything he's got with the help of an old trainer even though he's been trying to make a name for himself. It's not quite a rehash of Rocky, more like a mishmash of a few of the Rocky films with a dash of unpleasantness in the main character.Adonis Jawnson loves to fight. He loves it so much it lands him in juvey, when a wealthy woman shows up and offers to take him in. The woman is the widow of his biological father, the great Apollo Creed. Fast forward a whole bunch of years and all is not well... Adonis doesn't care for the good life or job. He wants to fight. He travels to Mexico to do so. He's an alright boxer but he's arrogant and sloppy, as is evident when he accepts the challenge to spar with a top ranked professional and loses badly. Embarrassed and car-less, he gives up his job and moves to Philly to seek out Rocky, who has long since retired from the business and is now running a restaurant. Rocko is initially hesitant but eventually takes the gig and away we go with the training.When he's not training or flying off the handle and assaulting people, Adonis spends his free time letting his deaf neighbor (and eventual love interest) know that her music is too loud, for which she apologizes but then resumes with the volume unchanged. He later catches her weirdly uncomfortable show at a local club and they go out to get a bite eat. I think he ordered a jawn and she had the jawn, but I can't be sure anymore. I assume they paid their jawn and went home to jawn after, but I was too busy searching on my phone as to what Jawn meant.After Adonis gets a few professional bouts under his belt, a future prison inmate (and current champion), takes notice of the Creed name and sees dollar signs for his final fight, but the catch is Adonis has to legally change his last name to Creed. Adonis is reluctant because blah blah blah, but eventually agrees and yadda yadda yadda, skip past the weird dirt bike and four wheeler wheelie scene and the championship fight to the end of the movie, and there's some gibberish about "I hope my dad is proud" even though he didn't really seem to care about Apollo all that much to begin with. That's just the feeling I got anyway, but I might have still been trying to figure out what Jawn was by this point.I have to say I'm pretty surprised about the high ratings and overwhelmingly positive reviews. I heard about the reception well in advance so maybe I just expected too much, but I was quite disappointed. Stallone was fine as Rocky but Creed (the movie and the character) lacks the heart of the original, and Adonis just isn't a likable character. He's rude, arrogant, and violent. He's pretty much the exact opposite of Rocky, and would have been far better suited for the collection job for the loan shark that Rocky tried to do in the first movie but failed at miserably at because he never wanted to hurt anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky's second turn at training fairs better than his first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time Rocky trained was in "Rocky V" (1990) when he trained the young and hungry Tommy Gunn. Who eventually turned against his mentor and the two had an infamous street fight in the streets of Philadelphia. Now unlike most Rocky fans who despised that film and considered it the worst of the franchise. Me on the other hand liked the film just as much as the former entries in the series. I don't know what it is about it, but it just holds a certain place in my heart.Enough about the past though. Here we are 2015 and Stallone is yet again reprising his role as Rocky Balboa in this spin-off movie "Creed", and as always he's great. I really enjoyed the moments where Stallone branched out into comedy for the character of Rocky. Not that we've never seen the comedic side of Rocky before, but we've never quite seen him like this. Don't worry Stallone hasn't forgotten what's made Rocky such a lovable and compelling character, and this movie is proof of that. Although, this time around Rocky is fighting something far worse than anything he's ever faced. Cancer. Now, that's enough about Rocky I haven't even spoken a word about the film's main character Adonis Johnson played wonderfully by Michael B. Jordan who seems to have great chemistry with Sylvester Stallone, and that's evident on screen. I enjoyed seeing these two together whether it was training or poking fun at one another. For never hearing of Michael B. Jordan before he blew me away with his performance, and was simply a delight to watch. His love interest with Bianca played by Tessa Thompson was more interesting to me than Rocky and Adrian's in the first Rocky, but theirs grew on me as the movies went along. So it'll be interesting to see where these two will end up in Creed 2.There's not a lot to complain about here, but I do have one or two complaints. My first is more a nitpick in that I didn't like how Paulie was killed off in this movie, but I understand knowing how old Burt Young is. Second, unlike the Rocky movies where I was emotionally ready for the fights about to take place. In "Creed" not so much and I think it really has to do with one of my favourite inspirational songs from the Rocky series "Gonna Fly Now" absent from the final training sequence before the big fight. I understand this is a spin-off of Rocky, but I had just wished they would've kept that Rocky tradition. The heavy use of rap music in this movie seems like an obvious attempt at attracting young audiences to this old but continuing movie franchise. Me being a fan of rap didn't mind that I just found it to be less effective at times. When I compare this spin-off to the Rocky series this movie is one of my least favourite, but as a standalone it's a good next chapter in the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone's comeback as an aging mentor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky Balboa is back and this time as old as the hills and the owner of a restaurant in Philadelphia. Rocky's opponent Creed is long gone but his illegitimate child Adonis Creed lives. He decides to become a boxer like his father and looks up Rocky in Philadelphia and asks him to become his personal trainer. Creed is the first time Rocky is back on the big screen since 2006 and makes it the seventh film in the series.Boxing movies is often very much the same when it comes to the story and I personally think it needs something else besides the boxing to really raise these films above normal. Like a dramatic problem behind the sport. Creed succeeds in doing this. We really feel for the son of Creed and understand why he does what he does, because the main focus is the drama behind the sport. In the end it doesn't really matter whether he wins or not because the personal revenge is more important than the sport itself. The decision not to let Rocky box but become a trainer, is good and should perhaps have been made in the last film 10 years ago. Sylvester Stallone has probably not portrayed Rocky this good since the first film in 1976.Judging from the length of Creed, it certainly follows today's trend in length with its 2 hours and 13 minutes that actually makes it the longest Rocky film to date. Despite its length, the story goes on and is fairly exciting all the way through. It is a classic setup that still works, mostly because they polished and remade Stallone's Rocky into an aging mentor. I think that is the main reason why this film works so well. It is a personal revenge for the film series and also for Stallone who actually won a Golden Globe and received an Oscar nomination for his role.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed : Rocky's Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a drama movie about the legacy of Apollo Creed, directed by Ryan Coogler, with an incredible cast with Sylvester Stallone, Michael B.Jordan and Tessa Thompson, and this movie was released in October 2015, in the USA.What about the plot ? It's a story about the son of Apollo Creed, the famous boxer who died during a box fighting. Then when his son grew up, his son decided to meet Rocky Balboa, an old friend of his father, a famous boxer too, to teach him how to fight and then he could honor his late father.Michael B. Jordan is very talented at his way to acting as Adonis Johnson, the plot was based on a difficult childhood, and a sinuous love story, we really enjoyed the score of his movie too, who was all around US RAP, and also the story becomes very gripping with the acting of Michael B. Jordan and the unforgettable Sylvester Stallone.For the audience, this movie was totally unexpected, and they qualified this movie by a "must-see".In my opinion, i really enjoyed the end, because it means that you must never give up in your life !That movie is like a life lesson for the youth and we totally recommend you to watch this amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adonis is the son of a ex-boxer and he wants to take the same path as his father so he trains to become the new champion. For this he seeks help to Rocky Balboa, his father rival in the past. His trainer soon has health problems because of his age and this may be an issue in his preparation. Also another distraction appears when he begins a relation with her neighbor, Bianca. Adonis won't let anyone or anything in his way and wants to make his late father proud of him. He is ready for the biggest night and match in his life when he is face to face with the current champ Ricky Conlan. But will he manage to defeat him?Usually I do not like box or movies about this sport, but this truly was a pleasure to watch because in two hours you see only 30 minutes of box and doesn't have too much violence in it. The actors did a very good job and wasn't an easy one. What I learned from this one was that in boxing, if you want to win you do not have to throw punch after punch but you also need a strategy, and a film in witch I found out about something interesting is a delight for me.It has been a while since I rate 7 a movie but this one deserves it for the emotions you feel along with the actors.

		<shortDescription>Rocky robbed on Oscar night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky was the first film I ever watched on VHS as a child. I remember my brother bringing home the huge video recorder and us all sat round the TV waiting for the film to start. Pure movie magic. 40 years on the magic is recreated but with a new direction for the franchise to the head in.A young boxer named Adonis Johnson comes knocking on Rocky's door. It soon becomes apparent that the young man is actually the son of Apollo Creed. Rocky's rival turned best friend. Played by Michael B Jordan he soon forms a bond with the old champion and Rocky agrees to train the young prospect. The storyline may sound familiar if you've seen the abysmal Rocky V.Unlike that particular film this movie has real heart and under the guidance of young director Ryan Coogler all cast members bring out superb performances. Stallone in particular is superb. The scene in the locker room really does bring a lump to your throat. Over the years he has almost become the character and plays him with such conviction. Sylvester Stallone missed out on an Oscar for his performance for the first Rocky and recently was robbed for reprising his most famous role. His performance in this film is really that good. This time playing an older more fragile version of the famous character. Lets not forget that this is a Rocky film just reinvented for the new generation. So it has all the key Rocky moments you want and expect. It may not be as good as the original film but it is a superb entry into the expanding universe of the Rocky franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not blown out of the water but a good startup spin off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the years Sylvester Stallone as an actor has gone through multiple changes. He's played action leads, comedic characters and dramatic roles. His fans love the nostalgia he holds for the era he was most popular in and his ability to be charming in the cheesiest of fashions has proved to be a strong point for him. But of these characters, the role he has given the most human and likable performance to belongs to Rocky Balboa in his film debut in the hit sports drama Rocky (1976). As stated by Stallone in several interviews, the way Rocky was written for each film had events that paralleled that of Stallone's own life. Now although not every Rocky sequel is equal to each other, Stallone has created quite the legacy for the character. Of this series, there was one other character who deserved that recognition and that was Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers in the first four films. After the tragic death of Creed in Rocky IV (1985), the idea of carrying on the underrated name seemed unlikely. That is until director Ryan Coogler thought of it.Before this popular spin-off of the Rocky series came to a reality, Ryan Coogler was only known for making one other theatrically released film. That film was Fruitvale Station (2013), a biopic surrounding a controversial public dispute gone wrong between a civilian and a police officer. Starring in that film was then up and coming actor Michael B. Jordan, who had worked in films before but none of such magnitude. For both men and for what they had to work with in resources, the movie had quite a moving story and there was very little that wasn't effective on the viewer. After receiving the notoriety that was needed, Coogler pursued and persuaded Sylvester Stallone that the story of the Creed name was not finished. Written by Coogler and Aaron Covington (in his first writing credit), create a solid story that will bring in new and old fans alike to see what there is to continue in Apollo's footsteps. Joining Coogler once more is Michael B. Jordan as Apollo's unborn son named Adonis Johnson when he died.Wanting to initially get away from his father's shadow, Adonis fights for himself but soon contacts an aging Rocky (Stallone) once he realizes he needs a professional at his side. As the two work together, they form a bond and Adonis begins to learn that maybe his last name means more to him than his thinks. While training Adonis also meets Bianca (Tessa Thompson), an upcoming musical performer who has her own set of goals. After some time, they too catch feelings for each other. These three characters alone do most of the heavy lifting and it is very praiseworthy. All three have wonderful chemistry with each other in their own ways and the audience will feel very close to them. Phylicia Rashad also plays Adonis' mother who does share important developmental scenes for her son. But of all the other characters, they don't have much input, which is okay for this installment. Initially, Rocky has some friction between another trainer Pete Sporino (Ritchie Coaster) and his son, but after one bout they didn't linger around.Instead, Rocky and Adonis are contacted by Tommy Holiday (Graham McTavish) who represents 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) to fight, but only under the name of Creed. The reason why they're contacted is that Conlan needs another fight to keep him from losing income after his temper gets him into trouble. With out Conlan being written this way, as of right now, he wouldn't have had any other reason to fight. So with this, the subplots aren't as focused as the character development. The only other noticeable thing is that the script has excellent continuity except for one character and that's Duke played by the amazing Tony Burton. Audiences will be kept up to date on every other character except Duke and he was the one who had been through it all! They have Wood Harris play a character named Tony 'Little Duke' Burton but that doesn't explain what happened to Duke senior. Of all people, come on guys. In spite of this though, both screenwriters provide a ton of respect for all the older films and events that took place before it.Providing the camera-work to this boxing drama was Maryse Alberti. Before this megahit, Alberti had other experience as the cinematographer to multiple documentaries, TV movies and other well-known films like Tape (2001), The Wrestler (2008) and The Visit (2015). The film that would probably have the most benefit to this spin-off would be The Wrestler (2008) considering the setting. For the boxing matches, the energy is definitely there and there are a number of long uncut scenes that will keep the viewers watching. This helps the fights feel more authentic rather than using quick edits. Scoring the music is another Ryan Coogler collaborator and that goes to Ludwig Göransson. Göransson who although produced a minimal score to Fruitvale Station (2013), goes all out here. While preserving Rocky's theme, he also creates a headstrong new theme for Adonis Creed and it is a catchy one. He also uses synths in some cases to give the music a more soulful feel, which also coincides with Tessa Thompson's music. It is actually very relaxing.Script wise, it is meticulous in its effort to keep strong continuity but it forgets all about Tony Burton's role and it subplots based on the fighters other than Adonis don't have the strongest focus. Yet among this, Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson all play very likable characters with great on screen chemistry. The boxing matches are well shot and choreographed, and the musical score is a soothing mix of soul/R&amp;B and orchestral progressions.</fullReview>

This movie disclosed something else: growing old and becoming a veteran can give you awards regardless the quality of the movies you have made.What's more, Stalone seems to confuse real world with the artificial - movie reality, he probably even thinks that Rocky really exists!

		<fullReview>Everyone loves to root for the underdog - it's the pillar of the sports movie genre. But what about when the 'underdog' has all kinds of privileges, resources, connections, lineage, and is only in the situation he's in out of pride and having a chip on his shoulder? It might sound obnoxious and repellant, but this subtle tweaking of the formula is actually what makes Creed interesting, and stand apart from the glut of recent boxing movies (which fall into roughly two categories: those that do and don't have Sylvester Stallone). But director Ryan Coogler is savvy about how to play a sports flick in the shadow of precedents, boldly aligning with and distinguishing from the Rocky franchise, and crafting both a powerful exploration of obsession and legacy and an infectiously rousing and fun punch-up in its own right. Masculine melodrama is so mired in the sports genre that the prospect of another dose might feel akin to getting walloped in the face by Rocky, but Jordan's Adonis ("Donnie") Creed sparks interest by being, in many ways, the fundamental outsider for a genre normally inhabited by the downtrodden working class. After an opening teaser of Donnie scrapping in an orphanage as a fiery-eyed child, he's adopted and taken in by the wife of the deceased Apollo Creed, who enshrouds him with his legacy. This Creed is brought up in an imposingly cavernous mansion, his battle garb being an immaculately fitting shirt and tie, ensconced with praise for his work ethic and recent promotion (see? there's thematic resonance to that name). Yet, the hollowness in Jordan's eyes practically rings with the tinny reverb of an arena bell, indicating voluminous depths of dissatisfaction and unresolved personal demons, foreshadowing his inevitable jaunt to Philadelphia, and reluctant following of the footsteps of his father. Donnie often remarks that he's been fighting his whole life, but Coogler's work is deft enough to show that he's not just referring to covert amateur scraps and orphanage brawls. He fights because it's the only way for him to reconcile his own deep-rooted issues of anger, abandonment, resentment and fighting to differentiate from Creed Senior. In short: he doesn't fight because he HAS to, but he does fight because he must. As a sports movie, Creed hits all the soaring, inspirational euphoric emotional beats, but its character study is just as fun and fascinating. It's a classicist at heart plot-wise, with thereby few surprises and its fair share of clichés to prop itself up with, but Coogler aces them all with breezy, steely confidence. That said, a one-two punch of emotional heft and immaculate technical work certainly helps elevate it against the competition. Ludwig Göransson, filtering Bill Conti through Ennio Morricone, finds the perfect pump-up leitmotif for Adonis, while Maryse Alberti's excellently empathetic camera-work actively mirrors the mood of each scene: starkly desolate in the Creed mansion, jittery with nerves in Donnie's first fight, and soaring in the requisite Rocky 360 degree hero shot, bellowing, circled by triumphant bikers, in a scene so indulgently awesome you'll cheer through the buckets of fromage. And then there are the fights themselves: blindingly paced, bloody and scrappy, all building to the final 'boss battle' against 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (real life heavyweight champ Tony Bellew, who chirps so well you forget he's not an actor), so electrifying it'll get the juices and tears flowing for even the staunchest sports skeptics. And, in the blue corner: Michael B. Jordan is a firebrand, ferociously commanding attention and further substantiating his reputation as one of the most promising actors of his generation. If comparisons to Raging Bull feel more natural than Rocky, it's largely thanks to the volcanic power of Jordan's performance, and his ferociously raw, vulnerable, ballsy work making Creed Jr. a living, breathing, doubting, character rather than heroic composite. In spite of his deliberate, nuanced contradictions, he's impossible not to root for. Sylvester Stallone, transitioning seamlessly for star to mentor in reprising his most beloved role, mines new emotional depth amidst the mumbling as Rocky Balboa, including moments of disarming humour, and his own subplot of vulnerability where he is courageous enough to take Rocky's macho posturing to task. Tessa Thompson is flat-out delightful, skillfully imbuing her Bianca with so much effervescent energy and self- respecting firmness that she never enters the domain of stock romantic prop; instead, her courting scenes with Jordan bubble with a surprisingly endearing lightness and tenderness. Finally, the Hobbit (but we won't hold that against him)'s Graham McTavish is good and snarly as Conlan's trainer, excellently trading death stares with Sly Stallone.Like its titular lead, Creed is unapologetically a product of its populist circumstances and lineage. It's also a classic case of perilously familiar territory being infused with such adept technical precision and emotional fortitude that it's impossible not to be sucked in and raucously engaged. Thanks largely to superb, confident work by Coogler and Jordan, Creed hits fast and hard, and is tons of earnest (albeit heavy on the cheese) fun, even for those utterly alienated by boxing. Just wait for the steps, and try to tell me it's not worth the trudge. -8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Knockout (Almost)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 4)This film is highly recommended.In brief: A crowd-pleaser that carries its own weight due to some fine acting and direction.GRADE: B+Since The Champ appeared in the 1930's, the genre of boxing film has been an on-going cliché of sorts, the downtrodden overcoming the many hardships placed in his way. Always slow- motion shots abound...plus, training montages...the hand-held circular camera-work at ringside...leading up to the final bout! Even reviews of these sporting films become tiresome and unoriginal..."A real knockout!"..."Down for the count!"..."It pulls no punches!"..."Throw in the towel!" ( I will try and spare you these puns, although I cannot promise that I will succeed.)A select few overcome the familiarities of the genre and achieve greatness like Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby. Some creating memorable moments like The Fighter, Requiem for a Heavyweight, Fat City, and the original Rocky. Others fail miserably like Grudge Match (a Stallone dud) and Against the Ropes, but most follow the winning formula with a high degree of entertainment. Creed is an exception to the rule when rating tales of pugilists. It works very well and avoids most of the clichés (but not all) due to some fine acting and sharp direction, even if the script is featherweight, routine and totally predictable.Donny Johnson, a.k.a. Adonis Creed, feels the need to follow in his lost father's footsteps, enlisting the help of former champ, Rocky Balboa as his trainer. That's the simple premise of the film in which director / writer Ryan Coogler wisely concentrates on the human drama more than the blood sport, although his fight sequences are quite brutal. His direction is solid, except for a clumsy inspiration uplift scene involving bikers fans and his over-reliance upon the Rocky source, complete with musical cues and nostalgic images. He stages the boxing sequences most effectively and builds a nice chemistry between his actors.Michael B. Jordan is a revelation in the role as Apollo Creed's illegitimate son. He shows the inner conflict and rage within the man, delivering a powerful performance. Sylvester Stallone redeems himself with a restrained and understated portrayal of his famous screen icon, successfully erasing the memory of his recent film work as an aging action star. Tessa Thompson makes a vivid impression playing Bianca, Adonis' love interest.All in all, Creed surprisingly packs an emotional wallop (sorry!), thanks to the fancy footwork (oops, once again) of Mr. Coogler and company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CREED is the new ROCKY.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I was looking for the 7th film in the 'Rocky' series, so this spin off was totally unexpected. But it is the right thing since the Rocky Balboa is getting old. Besides, in this reboot era, keeping franchise alive and leaping into the next generation was a very smart move. By doing this, they're keeping the original series fans with them to back it. I hope this will only get going like the Bond movies, since the young star, Jordan has another 30+ year potential to continue the 'Rocky' legacy by delivering some hits in his belt.I don't know how they have done it, just kept everything so simple yet delivered a successful movie. The director of 'Fruitvale Station' and its actor Jordan's second successive run. I wish the combo return for the third time for another grand scale flick. Of course Stallone's presence made a big difference, but the way his character was portrayed, I feel the next film will get more emotional, especially between Rocky and Adonis like Rocky and Micky. And I'm also hoping for a bit better romantic tale on the side.I grew up watching 'Rocky' movies, so I wanted badly it to be at least a decent, but it is a fantastic flick and I definitely suggest for those people like me. The youngsters as well can taste the new beginning in the Rocky legacy. CREED is the new ROCKY. The blueprint for the screenplay was exactly same as the original movies, even the music was very comparable yet everything was updated to the current timeline. Now I'm looking for a follow-up in the next 3 years.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid - but different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge Rocky fan, this latest installment just missed the mark for me a bit. The fact that this was the first entry in the Rocky franchise not penned by Stallone was apparent. Part of what made the first couple Rocky movies for me (namely the first 2) was the dialogue written and performed by the characters. Sure, they got pretty campy in the later entries and ended up nearly being a parody of itself by the end in Rocky 5, but there's no denying the dialogue. This film was grittier and much better than the 4 and 5, but paled greatly to the first two. To this day when watching 1 or 2, after seeing them for the umpteenth time, I still find myself rooting for the Rock and feeling inspired. I just didn't get that vibe with Creed. All-in-all, it's much better than 3,4 and of course 5, but it's no where no 1 or 2. If you don't compare it to the original franchise and judge it as a stand-alone boxing movie - it's average at best. Southpaw and Cinderella Man beat Creed by a unanimous decision.</fullReview>

They made Philly look plane and no color and with buildings looking trashed and with trees looking like they went threw winter. I just hated that. The plot is OK though. Also I hated why they had to make Rocky die so early, I loved the rocky franchise and I know it has to end, but can they make his death a bit more reasonable. Like what were they thinking, making Rocky die because of cancer, that he doesn't want to cure.I want to refuse this is the last movie, but I want it to end because every time I see Rocky, he looks like he went threw hell. i'm just not happy of Philly and the people who walk in it, if they make a another movie make sure the background has more color and the people look more better then the Hood.

		<shortDescription>The Best Film in the Rocky Franchise Since Rocky (1976)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, the son of the famous Apollo Creed. Adonis loves to fight, but feels that he's not good enough to take on the professionals. Upon coming to this conclusion, he quits his office job and moves to Philadelphia, seeking out the help of the former boxing champion, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), who has retired and now lives a peaceful life owning a small diner called "Adrian's."To start, I personally think this is the best film in the Rocky franchise since the first Rocky (1976). Yes, 2 ,3, and even 4 were pretty good, but this film just packs a punch that brings Rocky Balboa and his life to this generation, basically doing what Rocky Balboa (2006) tried, but failed. Michael B. Jordan owns the role of Adonis Creed, and shows that his role in Fantastic Four (2015) was just a one time flunk. This movie was great.Sly Stallone playing Rocky needs no words. Stallone doesn't play Rocky Balboa, he IS Rocky Balboa. He has appeared in other films, but he'll always be Rocky to me and most others. Tessa Thompson as Bianca, Adonis' love interest, is great. I hope to see her in any possible sequels, or any other film in general.The choreography during the boxing scenes is also very noteworthy. Just like the first Rocky, it felt as if I were at the fight as it was going down. This also is due to the directing of the action. The directing is very clean, and there's not too many cuts. Many wide shots were used to encapsulate the entire ring, rather than just getting Adonis, or just his opponent. The audience feels involved in the fight, as if you're a fly in the boxing stadium.The only problem I found in this film is a very small one, but it prevents this film from being perfect. The issue was the final fight, between Adonis and Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), the reigning champion. This fight, while well choreographed and acted, wasn't as intense as another fight that had taken place earlier in the film. The fight wasn't bad; far from it. However, it didn't enthrall me like I wanted it to.Overall, Creed was an amazing film. I recommend it to anyone who likes the feeling of not being able to stop smiling after watching a movie. I'm going to give Creed an A, or a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Life to the Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the Rocky of this generation. It is sensational with great performances and amazing direction and cinematography. Seeing some of the original Rocky movies will give you good context for this film, though not the entire series is great.Creed, on the other hand, is a compelling continuation of the Balboa universe with new energy. A conflicted Adonis who would fight in his youth before realizing his father was the famous Apollo Creed seems a wreck when he becomes an adult, traveling to Mexico repeatedly in order to make extra money fighting every now and then. He becomes arrogant and angry when people from Apollo's gym will not train him and learns a lesson that being a great fighter comes more from nurture than nature.Even though Adonis is privileged to be living with his late father's wife, he makes the decision to abandon that life which lacks excitement to find Rocky Balboa in Philadelphia. He figures he can receive training from Rocky since he was Apollo's friend, and with a little effort he's right.What's great about this film is the conflicted Adonis played the up and coming Michael B Jordan, from great stuff like The Wire and Fruitvale Station. He plays the son of Creed, but he is more than that. This very notion is what makes him such a conflicted character - throughout the film he is struggling over his need to become his father as well as his need to create his own legacy simultaneously. He has too much pride to take up his father's name in the ring specifically because it will make the public have high expectations for him.In the film, Adonis' relationship with Rocky proves to be a great cinematic relationship not just within the Balboa universe, but a great relationship in cinema in general. The two of them redefine what it means to be family and this relationship is made that more convincing due to the great strength of both of these actors (Jordan and Stallone). Jordan got snubbed of an Oscar nomination.The most brilliant scene in the movie is when Adonis fights his 16th fight. Pay attention because the entire scene is done in one amazing long take with such complex camera movement and direction, and man, does it feel perfect.The biggest flaw of the film is that it seems to steal plot points from Rocky. It is not an identical film, but the main beats are very similar. But looking at 2015 as a whole, this is definitely one of the better films.3.5/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky is a landmark film. A great. The series slowly declined, trading gritty characters and dialogue for hollow blockbuster shenanigans. The films in the series gradually got worse, culminating in V which was basically pants. Rocky Balboa saw a return to form in my opinion. Once again putting character and setting for spectacle. I was hoping that Creed would do the same. To follow the rejuvenation that took place with Balboa.Sadly not. In my opinion this sits midway between the two. It dips into the world of believable characterisation and plot but ultimately keeps the Hollywood schmaltz in spades. I deliberately read nothing about this film before seeing it but could have predicted it anyway. As it rolled out on screen everything was predictable and a tad bland. And the main protagonist, Creed, had none of the natural charm and charisma of Rocky. There are occasional sparks of chemistry between Balboa and Creed but nothing to write home about, and nothing to keep you interested for the duration of the film. Toward the end I wasn't particularly rooting for or against Creed. I just wanted the proceedings to draw to a close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood and heart of a legacy, so passionately willed to the new era, it's breathtaking and beautifully heartfelt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky is an ageless underdog story told in simple yet approachable way, the best thing about it is it's also true story about Stallone. Creed taps into the legacy of the franchise while also presenting new blood, a sort of passing of the torch by Sylvester Stallone. This is drama in its purest form and with the inclusion of spine tingling nostalgia, there's no way audience wouldn't get emotionally pumped when the young Creed trades blow while familiar soundtrack roars in the background.This is the story of the son of Apollo Creed, Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) who is trained by Rocky (Sylvester Stallone). It's one the best mentor-student relationships on silver screen, which feels amazingly genuine and perhaps the best acting Stallone has given in a while. It will resonate to audience, old and young, infectiously inspiring in every sense.Fighting is the most elementary form of drama, you have the protagonist and antagonist as they square off with their fists. Nothing can be simpler, yet the presentation of Creed takes advantage of the depth of Rocky's franchise then adds a crafty visual to display the struggle of the characters, both in ring and real life.Cinematography is pleasantly brilliant, there are moments when the fights are done so viscerally gorgeous or in one prolonged shot that it's nearly impossible not to be invested in them. The view of Philly, so familiar with fans is shown with care, it is a homage to the enduring tale as well as an authentic effort to pass it to new generation.It's been a long time, perhaps since Hugo, that a movie is delivered with such love. Creed is a presentation of utmost care for the namesake, respect for its sport origin and visual of brutal elegance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Creed" (2015) is everything a one could hope from "Rocky" movie and more, much more. It tells a story of a new face as well as continuation of our below boxer from Philadelphia. Acting was very good by all involved - leads Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone are above good - they are great in this picture, with Sylvester Stallone absolutely deserving Golden Glob nomination - it's going to be hard to get Oscar node, but lets hope on this one, this is by far the best Sylvester Stallone's performance since "Cop Land" and very first "Rocky" movie. But he is just a supporting character in this movie. The new star is Adonis "Creed" Johnson. Hope to see future movies with him. Overall, "Creed" is a great movie. It has great acting, amazing direction (one boxing scene is done in one-shot take - never seen that before). Directing is actually on the same level as acting - Ryan Coogler does a magnificent job in every scene - it looks and feels real, not just another sequel or spin-off, it is a real life on the screen. Boxing scenes are all (and there aren't many of them in the movie) great - last one (and you know there will be the last one "good guy" vs. "bad one") is not predictable (which actually is a bit, but that is not a complain to "Creed"), very plausible and realistic. Can't recommend this movie higher - "Creed" is simply a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I wrote my review of "Rocky Balboa", I premised an idea that might have been used for an eventual 'Rocky VII' movie. I didn't get it all right, as the character Marie and Rocky Balboa Jr. weren't brought over from that story. But the part I got right had to do with exploring Rocky's growing older, and as this picture goes on to reveal, how he chooses to deal with an illness that will eventually level the former champ.As I watched the movie, most of my attention was trained on Stallone, his speech and mannerisms and how he's remained true to the character of Rocky Balboa. There was a particular scene that I'm sure impacted Stallone on a personal level. As Adonis viewed personal mementos of Rocky's life, there was a framed picture of Stallone (as Rocky) with his own real life son Sage who passed away in 2012. I viewed that scene with incredible poignancy and wondered how Stallone must have felt doing it.In fact the entire film seems to symbolize the passing of an era. Rocky visits the cemetery to be close to his departed wife Adrian and brother-in-law Paulie. Rocky certainly looks older, worn, even haggard, with a sense of tired exhaustion when faced with the prospect of taking on a new protégé. I had to check Stallone's age and learned that he's just shy of seventy. You have to wonder where all the years have gone since 1976's "Rocky". I'll say this, as an actor he's unselfish here admitting that he lost the 'third fight' to Apollo Creed. I'm sure there are any number of actors who wouldn't make that concession as part of the script, even thought it's a fictional story.As for Michael B. Jordan, I thought he acquitted himself well as the upstart new light heavyweight contender. About the only problem I had with the story was that there was no sense of history to his boxing career. By the time of the big title match against Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), he was introduced to the Liverpool crowd with a record of 16-0, with only a single prior match in the picture to show for it. So this viewer didn't have a sense of his being ready for the bout, even if he was trained by one of the best.So as I write this, "Creed" rates an 8.7 on IMDb after just over a week in release, from almost eleven thousand voters. "Rocky" the original comes in at 8.1. Is "Creed" a better picture? I don't think so, which is why I feel modern day movies have an unfair advantage in the IMDb rating system. But go see the movie and judge for yourself, and see if you don't come away with a split decision.</fullReview>

I mean.. really? Why do they have to have boring love stories in a fighter movie? Stallone is boring and completely uninteresting. Adonis and his girlfriend are boring. Even the few fighting scenes there are - are boring. The focus of this film is totally wrong - a fighting movie that focuses on a love story instead of training and fighting.Hence this movie has absolutely no value whatsoever.

		<fullReview>I went into Creed with some excitement. Despite never actually seeing the other Rocky movies, I was excited to see this one. Unfortunately, I found little substance in this film. Creed's plot is just like any other sports movie plot. Someone wants to become a big sports star and that's it. There's nothing wrong with that, considering there's not much else you can do about a movie like this. The characters in the movie aren't horrible, but they aren't great either. Some of them feel a little cliché, but Rocky Balboa specifically really bothered me. He was such an idiot. His choice for a major problem in his life is dumb, his reasoning is even worse, and the outcome is extremely predictable. Other characters did things that were just totally out of character. While characters like Ricky Conlan were built up as someone that you could easily hate, he ultimately destroyed that image of himself. Having actually felt something towards this character, I was immensely disappointed when he suddenly acted so out of character. And again, it was pretty predictable that he would do that. I just hoped that he wouldn't. Speaking of predictable, that's what this thing is. It's a formula we've all seen before, and its no fun to watch. It's actually rather boring right from the get-go. Formulas aren't always bad, but this movie was so boring and predictable that I couldn't help but notice it. It was right in my face for the whole thing. My biggest problem of all, however, was the romance. If the romance wasn't in it, the movie would have been average. But it was there, and it ruined the whole thing. It was so unbelievably poorly done. There was almost zero development of the love interest, nor was there any of their relationship. It just happened with barely any explanation. Maybe I missed the progression of time, but nevertheless there wasn't nearly enough time spent with the love interest. She ended up coming off as a forced-in character, simply existing because people expect romance to be in movies nowadays. Some of the fights were interesting to watch, but the progression from no-name boxer to one of the biggest in the world was too quick. And not just that the progression of time was poorly shown, but that it just happened too quickly. Barely any of Don's fights are shown, and he fights almost none of them once he starts training under Rocky. Barely anything happened in this movie, yet it manages to pull off a 133 minute run time somehow. Overall Creed it mediocre. It's predictable, boring, rushed, and poorly developed in pretty much every aspect of the movie. There wasn't nearly enough focus on anything, so I felt zero connection to any part of it. The only decent parts were the fights, but it's not like I've never seen fake boxing before, plus I already knew the outcome, so I was never tense or excited about them. In the end I would not recommend Creed, considering there's absolutely nothing special about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spin-off of the Rocky franchise (or seventh film in the series, since Sylvester Stallone reprises his role in this one) has Apollo Creed's son Adonis "Donnie" Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) turning to Rocky Balboa for training. Basically what we have here is the same old Rocky formula, updated for today with a few cosmetic changes. The biggest thing working against this is the familiarity, but I admit that might only factor in with those who are fans of the previous films. Had Stallone not revisited Rocky a decade ago, this would be much more impactful for me. As it is, there is this feeling that they're going back to the well again in an attempt to revive the franchise with young blood. Nothing wrong with that but it does make the movie less effective and hard to see as anything other than another sequel.Michael B. Jordan continues to be unimpressive to me, particularly with emotional scenes. He isn't bad just not worthy of the constant praise I see for this young man, heralding him as one of the next big stars. Sylvester Stallone easily steals the film in his signature role. It's no surprise that most of the acting props for the film seem to be going his way. Nothing in this really stretches his abilities but he does what he does well. Tessa Thompson is the film's other standout as Jordan's love interest. She's lovely and gives a subtle, relatable performance. Jordan could learn a thing or two from his co-star while he's busy glowering all the time.The climactic fight is not terribly exciting (a cardinal sin for a boxing film) and the villain is forgettable. I appreciate they gave him his own story to make us care more going into the fight but the guy playing him is neither charismatic nor particularly interesting. As with the last two Rocky films, they went with a real boxer as the antagonist and, while this may make them better suited for the fight scenes, it doesn't do much for the film overall as they bring nothing to the table a good stuntman can't bring. Get an actor for the villain next time, please. Preferably one who looks like he's seen the inside of a gym as this guy looked pathetic.If you're a Rocky fan, you'll likely enjoy it as it carries the formula well and does credit to the previous films. It's nothing really new past the surface changes but that isn't always a deal-breaker. If you're someone who has never seen a Rocky movie (particularly the first or last), then you'll probably find this a far more impressive achievement than it really is. It's a good crowd-pleaser of a movie but nothing more substantial than that.</fullReview>

The heart and soul of a fighter!!! This time I saw a different actor in Stallone. He brought the character a whole new tone. He actually deserves an award!!! He has proved himself to be on the list as a nominee!!! I could not believe this was Sly! He has my vote. Jordan was also outstanding. His performance was flawless! Jordan will not disappoint you in any way. "Creed" was an inspirational moving story. Academy take notice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creed (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Character study of Adonis Johnson who we meet as a troubled child. After fighting through the streets and child care services he learns that he's the son of former heavyweight champ Apollo Creed. Mary Anne Creed takes the young kid in and as an adult he decides to take up boxing. Soon Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) wants to make that his career and he seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who he hopes will train him.I remember watching ROCKY V in the theater and remembering what a disaster that film was and how the entire franchise had finally put itself in the ground. Years later Stallone was bringing his famous roles back and it turned out that ROCKY BALBOA was a masterpiece that perfectly get the series back on track. CREED, from director and co-writer Ryan Coogler isn't quite as good as that film but when you consider this is the seventh movie in the series you can't help but be amazed at what they were able to do here.As I said in my review of SOUTHPAW, the boxing genre really hasn't changed any since the 1940s and each decade gave us new boxing movies dealing with the same stories. There's always a troubled character and there's always the end result of trying to get redemption. It's easy to see why actors, writers and directors want to take their turn at the boxing genre and Coogler and Jordan, who previously worked together on the wonderful FRUITVALE STATION, both show the mainstream what they're able to do.The story does feature the same redemption and character developments of previous boxing movies but it was a smart idea connecting this to the Rocky Balboa series. For starters, everyone knows them characters and by knowing them you can bring a little more emotion to them and you're already connected with them. The screenplay is smart enough to make this film fit in with what came before it but it's also smart enough to really wrap a great idea behind this Creed character. Someone trying to make a name for themselves and someone trying not to use a name for fame is something that can connect with the viewer.The film so well-written as this one also means that the terrific cast can dig into their roles. Jordan once again turns in an excellent performance and I really liked that his character really was a good guy who just makes some stupid decisions. A lot of times we see bad characters trying to do good but I loved the nice quality that Jordan brought to the role. Stallone gives one of the greatest performances of his career and once again manages to prove that he's a terrific actor and doesn't need a machine gun in his hands. He has some incredibly touching scenes here that her perfectly nails. Tessa Thompson is also very good in her supporting role as the love interest.The film features some great music and the cinematography is also extremely good. There have been so many boxing movies that it's hard to film a fight scene in new ways but I thought the scenes here were quite effective. CREED certainly reaches for your heart and hits all the right movies. It'll be interesting where the series goes from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When was the last time you cheered at the movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is that movie, taking the franchise full circle with this brilliant instalment. As a lifelong fan of the Rocky franchise I had of course been anticipating this movie, but what I hadn't counted on was that it would be such a good movie. I mean I knew I'd enjoy it but even the non Rocky fans I saw this with thought it was great. Creed captures what was so brilliant about that first film; the downtrodden characters, the love story, the city of Philadelphia and oh yeah a fight for a championship that is really all about character not about a belt.Sylvester Stallone is heartbreaking and exceptional in this, easily giving one of his career best performances and his chemistry with Michael B. Jordan is pretty special too. These two worked so well together. The story was engrossing and well thought out, funny at times, sad, exhilarating and brought me to tears more than once. It also pays respect to the Rocky series as a whole while taking it into a new generation with the wonderful Michael B. Jordan.During the final fight when that original theme music started up the audience started cheering and applauding. I can't remember the last movie I went to when the audience was so involved. 11/30/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People want creeds to live by, stories on right living, how to strive and what for. Boxing movies are some of the simplest (romance films are another kind); they teach dogged effort, perseverance, pulling yourself back up again. But it is almost always at the expense of softer realizations about the intangible things that make life tough; uncertainty, ego, pride, desire, these are left untouched. So it is here. Same old. The hero finds himself down and out, strives to pick himself up, does, goes up on the ring where he beats impossible odds. But what for? Has the boy got even an inkling about why he bashes himself to be worthy to a name, an image he clings to? We are roused up from our seats, if we are, but will go back home to lives that are never as clear cut as this. You don't have to listen to me, watch this and see what's left of it in you the next day. It's what happens when certainties are superficial, they don't grow roots in life we know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So before you read any further, the movie itself, storyline, acting, casting choices, are all solid. This is by no means a bad movie but what truly handicaps it is that it follows almost the same plot line as the original Rocky with very little deviation from that story. These movies are so overdone I have a hard time seeing who they appeal to outside of die-hard Rocky fans (or kids who have never seen the original).I was really hoping they would change up the ending and maybe have him knock the guy out instead of having another split decision in the opponent's favour. I guess we wait and see if they make another where they have Conlon get out of prison, book a rematch with Creed, and then have Creed beat him in that fight.All in all, a 6/10, losing about a point mainly for lack of originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised at parts, but disappointed at others."Was it interesting?" Mostly. The acting was the best part. The cinematography was great as well. The romance was much more believable than what I would expect. 2 out of 3."Was it memorable?" Not much. I liked how they incorporated the past movies, but this movie didn't really add much compared to them. 1 out of 3."Was it entertaining?" Not really. The fights were good, modernized but still fitting for a "Rocky" movie. The main problem with the movie is the story. The main title character has little drama, with a lot of attention on Rocky. There is not much sacrificed or on the line. 1 out of 3.Starting with 1 (because), 1+2+1+1=5 A disappointing and weak modernization and revitalization of a dying or even dead franchise. Perhaps I was expecting too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm usually very generous when speaking of movies, and am ready to watch any movie. The problem with Creed was, it relied too heavily on the Rocky's story. The movie is almost proportionately split between the two characters and does not go two minutes without mentioning the old history. There was no character build in this movie like there was with Rocky. If you want a independent movie which resembles this one, watch The Fighter with Mark Wahlberg. It is literally the same movie which has a family legacy, a woman involved, and is centered around boxing. I just don't see this movie having any success without people loving Balboa(Stallone) or Creed(Weathers).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into Creed, I was expecting Rocky, and that's not what audiences should expect. It's not Rocky. Sylvester Stallone isn't our hero anymore. It's Michael B. Jordan, or should I say, Adonis Creed. While I was watching this, I was reminded of the first Rocky and all the obstacles Sylvester Stallone's character had to overcome, and it's a testament to that universal motto of 'going in one more round'. Creed is a good movie, but it's no Rocky. Adonis isn't a street kid. Boxing isn't his only option. There's no Adrian, no Paulie, or any eye of the tiger. However, there is a Mick in Rocky. Glimpses of the old Rocky Balboa. His heart, his knowledge, but most importantly, his wisdom. Don't go into Creed expecting to see Rocky, because you won't. This is a new vehicle. Its story has flaws, and that's understandable, but there was something else that bothered me about this movie. It needed more heart. Maybe a training montage, or an inspirational quote, or even a visit to father would've sufficed. Instead, I saw a lot flash and excess. And that's fine, I guess I just expected more of a 'champion' picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had such good critics reviews that I thought it might be worth the extra shot for a movie which lingers on the same theme and same idea but maybe did the job nicely with modern technology.All expectations laid waste when I saw this movie. A comparison to Rocky was obvious. Since it was catching on the same theme, it was expected to at least show that much prowess, neatness and even tensile strength in story. What it turned out was a fluff which had interesting direction. The first quarter of the movie was giving it good direction. It had some new-ness of what you might expect from a movie in 2015, but kept the same base elements which made Rocky a hit back then.But then it seemed to lost it. Whether to focus on training or to focus on the mind games about being a boxer with some history - the story sort of stayed in this dilemma and never took off to a direction. The fight also was not very interesting as compared to its paternal genre. All in all, I do not think this is good enough to be in the same 'Creed' as a 'Rocky' before! Hence the 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is depressing. Rocky now as a coach battling cancer just does not work. This is not a Rocky film. The last Rocky film Rocky Balboa was truly the end of the series. This film about Creed's son is just not Rocky. Frankly the original Apollo Creed was never meant to be a series long main figure. His story was never the interesting one. So I am very disappointed. the media hype is way overblown and helping in the early ratings. But ultimately it is depressing to see the series take this turn. Even the story from the last Rocky which was Rocky Balboa might have been more interesting to have followed up on. Stallone did not write this and that shows. Ultimately, is Creed as captivating as a character as rocky. Not at all. if anything, this should be considered a new series called Creed. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I have not seen any of the previous Rocky films before this so I am judging this as a film on it own merits as every film should be judged in this way. That being said Creed is one exceptional film. I mean it really is. This film wins on all accounts. Ryan Coogler was the right person to make this film a reality with exceptional acting and a emotionally compelling story to go along with it. This film wins on all fronts. Micheal B Jordan is a excellent new edition to this world and gives this story so much heart in his overall performance making a big comeback after the failure of Fantastic Four proving that he is a phenomenal actor overall and is rightfully deserving of a Oscar win at some point in his career. Sylvester Stallone also makes a strong return to the franchise making the story all the much more memorable. I really loved him in this role as he took it with all the force he had and he undoubtedly won for me, and is deserving of so much love for what he managed to do in this role as well. Overall this is a powerful film and is a welcome home for all Rocky fans, and is just a good legitimate movie as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do we need to see a reasonably made rehash of the same successful formula, shot with a different camera at a different time which does not take the saga into newer territories nor ever takes risks with the material? This is a ho-hum plod through another reboot where the character's motivations are all muddled, the romance is all tacked on and unnecessary and the plot is mm thick, it never delves deeper into its suggested material, doesn't explore any angles or takes any chances. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the mildly interesting interaction between Stallone and Creed.A good example is Tom Hardy's Warrior, which explores so much emotions and gives an emotional wallop, all of which is missing from this latest retake from Ryan Coogler.This movie is a bore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like this film and I love the Rocky films. It was a boring retread of material we've seen done better in previous Rocky films.I didn't understand the lead character's motivation for boxing, the dialogue felt forced and incongruous and the film was baggy and overly long. The love interest felt tacked on, unnecessary and implausible.Good things about it were the improved quality of the boxing over the original Rocky films, the cinematography was good and it's a very well-made film. Sly put in a solid performance with what he was given.Tony Bellow/Ricky Conlan was by far the best thing in it, but he didn't have nearly enough screen time (after 5 seconds near the beginning he doesn't show up until almost an hour later for a minute-long scene) so it didn't really feel like a rivalry or adversity for our protagonist to overcome. In fact, I was rooting for Ricky throughout the finale. Also, the first round of boxing in the finale was great, but from the second round on it was a punch-for-punch remake of the original Rocky.After 90 minutes, I was thoroughly bored and waiting for the film to end. I'm baffled by the acclaim this movie is receiving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe Creed has so much praise, did I watch the same film? Firstly, I thought Ryan Coogler did an excellent job with Fruitvale Station and that's the reason I wanted to see Creed, not because I'm a fan of Rocky, which I'm not. I did expect this to be enjoyable though and I expected it to be easy to follow without having seen the originals but the film didn't suck me in at all and instead I was questioning everything because I wasn't engaged. Why does Rocky, a famous ex-boxer, live in a terrible house? It's never explained why a former champion boxer has decided to live a meagre lifestyle and what happened to all his wealth (if this was shown in Rocky III then it would perhaps have been nice to allude to it here). I also didn't understand why Adonis, whose mother is incredibly wealthy, chooses to drive a van around and quits a good job to go and fight. Yes, he loves fighting, but why does he love fighting? We don't get a real feel for any of the characters before suddenly Adonis is moving in with Rocky who inexplicably is perfectly happy to have him and his girlfriend sleeping on his couch when they both have their own apartments. Normally I would be fine connecting the dots and just going with it but it was so boring I couldn't help but notice the sheer amount of stupidity in the script that we're supposed to believe for no reason. The fight sequences are quite well done, the film is well photographed and the actors do a fine job but the script is awful in my opinion; flat characters, trite dialogue and inexplicable plot developments would be fine in an otherwise entertaining comedy or horror film but not in a drama like this. I walked out just under two thirds of the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing inherently interesting at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd rather not spend 120 minutes watching a film that is seriously step-by-step a copy of so many others before it. There's absolutely nothing interesting about it with any of the characters aside from Rocky, and that's because we already have that connection with him (I only watched the original before seeing this, and thought that was mostly an entertaining, engaging, heartfelt film). Nothing in the story is original, nothing in any of the supporting characters is original or interesting (I can't tell you how much I hate the "let's make the opponent boxer a real jerk" cliché). Nothing in any of the shots is interesting or original, nothing in the story is surprising. It's exactly the kind of film audiences will continue to eat up until the end of time and there will be thousands more like it. No, it's not offensive or bad, but I don't think that's enough. It's exactly the kind of boxing/sports film I always think of in my head when I say I'm not huge on boxing/sports films because they don't add anything new. Michael B. Jordan, god bless him, but he just can't elevate such an inherently uninteresting character. There's nothing there to do. Sylvester Stallone is by far the best thing about it, he has such a nice warmth and presence . I would not begrudge a nomination at all, but it isn't an amazing performance by any means.</fullReview>

It's the same all the way down to him losing on points to the champ who has never been the distance before.The acting in my opinion is pretty weak across the board, is it really worthy of an Oscar nomination to look pouty through most of the film and have no on screen chemistry with the love interest? The only interesting plot line for me was the way Rocky had given up on everything, although this does not follow on from Rocky Balboa where he has patched up with his son, and it is not really obvious why Rocky decides to befriend and train the young Creed, although the two together do provide some the films best moments.All in all a load of over-hyped rubbish that left me feeling nothing at all.

		<shortDescription>Coming from a person that thinks "Network" and "All President's Men" got robbed when "Rocky" won the Best Picture award, I have to admit I really really liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies like "Rush" or maybe "Moneyball" - one of those well-made movies about antiheroic but somehow very likable sportsmen that usually don't get a serious critical acclaim and don't get much out of Globes or Guilds or Oscars, but are widely recognized and praised by broad audiences. "Creed" is also one of those movies.Without spoiling anything, I'll just shortly say that this movie really resembles Rocky in it's honesty, charm and brutality with which it depicts the struggles the main characters are having. Beware, if you're expecting this movie to be just "Rocky 839127...", just a movie where the guy is challenged, he trains, fights and wins, you'll get muuuch more than you'll come for. The pain all the "Creed" characters are going through are realistic, they're everyday struggles people that you and I know are facing. They're not in battle with half of the USSR, they're in the battle with their pride, heritage, health, legacy and age. You'll also get to see one of the best supporting actor performances of the year and arguably the best Stallone performance since Rocky (if not ever).If you're not into serious dramas like "Spotlight", "Room" or "Steve Jobs" but still like to watch a well made movie, go watch "Creed". Honestly, it might not be on the level of "Martian", but it's the hell way above some awful stuff people pay to watch these days (like "Hunger Games", "Maze Runner" or, god forbid, the newest attempt of "Terminator").Movie Rating: 8.1My "Best Movies of 2015" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls031061874/My "Best Movies Ever Made" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls072746304/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still have a gamut of emotions watching Rocky 1,2,3 and 4 but this one left me wondering why it was so highly rated. I was not moved emotionally at all. The dialogue felt awkward and misplaced at times and forced at others. The first four movies were so well done that it seems like those things really happened. It is forever printed on my memory. I still sing songs from those Rocky movies all these years later. I am already forgetting much of this movie and I saw it last week. I can't even remember a single song from it. It really is that bad. I never thought it would be possible to make a "Rocky" movie worse than Rocky 5 but this one was worse. There were a few things that could have made it much better. Perhaps the relationship with young Creed's mom could have been played out more and the relationship she had with his father capitalized on. Perhaps some flashbacks of Apollo, Rocky, Adrian and Paulie could have been used. This, as others are saying, seems to be an attempt to remake the original Rocky movie with different characters and more of an African American slant. Without giving anything away, they try to imitate the scene where Rocky runs through Philly with a big crowd running behind him in support and it turns out extremely cheesy to say the least. As a huge rocky fan I was hoping for a great movie. It was not a terrible movie but a huge let down and nothing compared to the first four Rocky movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*contains spoilers* I'd rank it lower but somehow, I found myself trudging through this nightmare of a Rocky movie through sheer force of will. This movie, is terrible. It is not written really well at all - the introduction of a character as "Apollo Creed's son" who is driven towards boxing but initially gets smacked around (because he's knocked out by one of the champions in the Delphi Gymnasium, the same gymnasium where Apollo had trained) and so he's gone to Rocky Balboa to get training. In itself, the story is supposed to be bearable (We had it already in Rocky V, the 1990 Rocky movie with the upstart who is beaten by Rocky in the climax), but dear, merciful, Lord... this movie runs like War-Room.Rocky, was never War-Room. This movie, treats its audience like they've never seen Rocky at all, and are completely dumb as Trump voting Yanks. This movie, is the reality TV equivalent of a slap in the face of Rocky fans. Especially when there's ACTUAL HBO SPORTS ADS IN THE GOD DAMN MOVIE.EVEN the fight, is mediocre at best. The training montage is disappointing, horrendously so. And the worst part, they're trying to make a character for "Creed", as a lame excuse to continue the "Rocky" tradition and story, but are in essence insulting Apollo Creed.(sigh) bottom line, if you consider yourself a really true die hard Rocky fan, then watch it. But if you're sane, Watch "Angel" by Tahir Shah instead. That song is better... way better than this... yeah. Pathetic Creed, full of acting trappings which makes him a shallow construct, and the worst part is that everyone dumbs down for this pathetic Creed character. A shitty protagonist, and a very dumb and disappointing story.You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love rocky, then you probably rated this with more than eight out of ten. I didn't but I still gave it a seven. It was an intense movie. I did not buy the fact that this guy was doing amazing in a company and he just gave it all up to become a boxer cause it was in his gut to do so... I just don't think it's realistic! But he did, and then he went into the strange boxing world of Philly, back to his roots, to find himself. And then he finds a girl that just like Adrian had some kind of serious health problem. Why? Was that really necessary? Boxing wise the movie had everything the average fan would like to see. I don't know how close to the reality it was but for me it was close enough. Liked the occasional joke here and there and I have to say that Stalone was born for this part. For all his parts in Rocky and Creed. Nothing more. But for those roles he was the best there could ever be. The lymphoma twist was OK but again it was not explored as much as it could have been so it remained fairly superficial apart from some powerful scenes in the house where he is being carried to the toilet to vomit. The fight in the end was as expected as the end in a Disney story, but still it was intense. A bit far fetched again, but this is the trademark of the series so I was fine. Could have been a lot better than it was, but it was pretty decent still. Not a chance for an Oscar Sylvester, sorry, no matter how heart breaking it is to see you come back with this movie, 35 or something years after the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest tribute to a great legacy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 'Creed', you have the emergence of a new 'Rocky' franchise, with a new look and a fresh face. The film is based on Apollo Creed's illegitimate love child who re-surfaces in Philadelphia, searching for his late father's nemesis; Rocky Balboa. Michael B Jordan is brilliant and the light of this movie as he portrays 'Adonis Johnson', the son of a boxing legend who wants to cement his own legacy. Of course Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky Balboa but at times seemed abit bored reprising his old role once again. Michael Jordan takes the show for me, he is full of fire as well as being emotional bringing the characteristics of his charismatic father into the ring as well as the toughness of his famous trainer. The story itself is predictable and follows the original Rocky almost blow by blow but this film doesn't intend to bring anything new but instead felt like it was paying tribute to one of the greatest movie franchises in cinema history. No doubt as with the recent 'Terminator' re-boot and the new 'Star Wars' episode, this is the beginning of something new but the creators of the 'Creed' legacy need to be mindful that something new is required to keep any follow up movies interesting and worth watching otherwise the 'Rocky' angle will also wear thin and even the hardcore fans will switch off. @zulfmanauthor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Rocky Sequel/Spin-Off!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Tony Bellew and Phylicia Rashad star in this 2015 drama sequel. This is also a spin-off where we meet young boxer, Adonis Johnson (Jordan) who wants to become a respected fighter. He tries getting out of his father, Apollo Creed's (Carl Weathers) shadow and soon, he seeks help from retired fighter &amp; Apollo's friend, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) to help train him. Rocky decides to take him under his wing and helps him not only to become a great fighter, but gain self-confidence. Thompson plays singer, Bianca who Adonis finds romance with, Bellew plays boxing champ, Ricky Conlan who Adonis agrees to fight and Rashad (The Cosby Show) plays Apollo's wife, Mary Anne. This is a good film, Stallone is great as usual and Jordan also gives an exceptional performance. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent flick and top notch Stallone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up in the seventies and eighties, yes, you know that I have seen the classic Rocky (1976), the start of the career of Stallone. From there on the Rocky franchise was started but once we entered number 5 it was downhill with the franchise and also a bit of downhill with Stallone's career. But Stallone was friendly guy and everybody had big thumbs up for him.So it was time to bring him back as Rocky but being too old so the script was about the Creed, the boxer Rocky faced in part 1.What an excellent flick this is, this is in fact a bit of the same of Rocky but it all works out fine and Stallone gives the best and it shows. Clocking in over 90 minute it never bored me for one minute. Sadly Stallone missed the Oscar for his role, should have won it. A perfect entry in the Rocky franchise.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other great reboot of 2015!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unexpected and almost as pleasing as Star Wars: Rocky was also back in 2015!It was good to go back into this universe: setting up a new generation is done smartly: using Creed as a main character allowed for a richer playground, a richer set of elements to toy with and a way to build relationships in a deeper manner that would have been the case with using "simply" Rocky's son. Michael B Jordan is good, still some progress to do (some scenes are a little cliché due to his acting perhaps?) but Stallone is a real nice surprise. He's quiet, wise and yet inspirational and true to the modest roots of the character. A familiar plot actually works. You go along the training and fight scenes with a similar smile on your face as you did in the 80s watching Rocky fight Appolo, Mister T etc. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed was a solid film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is, essentially, black Rocky. That's it. Granted, Adonis (Michael B Jordan) has a different background, changing up a bit. However, as soon as that sucka gets to Philly, the old Rockyisms we all know and tolerate get in the mix. There is a girl, there is a mentor, there is an overwhelming obstacle, there are hardships, there are gyms, there is a dramatic speech and you're goddamn right there's a training montage. However, I have no problem with this. It's a Rocky film, I know and love the gist of these films, except for Rocky V (Tommy Gunn? Are you actually kidding me? (Yes, I know I've made this point before (I am also aware of the double, now triple, bracketing (That's just how I roll (suckas))))) that film can just die.The aforementioned Michael B Jordan has gone right up in my estimation. In 4tastic Fant, he was dull, unlikable and a dong mongrel if I ever saw one. On the other hand, in Creed, he was driven, relatable and, most of all, likable. Remind you of another boxer from years ago? Rocky, I was alluding to Rocky, for those who are idiots. Plus, extreme hunkability.Hunk Alert Steamy. Rocky approves.Supporting him, Sylvester Stallone plays Rocky, who is basically Mickey, Rocky's old trainer, but nice. I didn't like Mickey, he was mean. Retaining his charm from the previous Rocky films, Stallone couples this with the "wise old man" mechanic. Though interesting at times, the film really tries to hammer home that Rocky is old. To me, it seemed like every two minutes there was a reference to Rocky being old, whether he's at a graveyard or someone saying "Long time no see" or LITERALLY calling him an old man, like that isn't a given. We get it, Stallone's almost 70; he's old. Despite this, Stallone does give an admirable performance. Considering some of the competition though, it doesn't look like an Oscar. Not to me anyway.I can't think of a reasonable link to talking about the cinematography, so I guess I'll just start now.The cinematography was surprisingly good and noticeable. During the fights, especially, the camera-work is particularly atmospheric and, when meaty fist meetys face, it can be quite disorientating, even. When Creed ain't kickin' ass or takin' names, the cinematography is still pretty good. That's it, no joke, no elaboration of any kind, just good.So we know it's a treat for the eyes (Rocky approves), but how about the ears, eh? Like the cinematography, the sound was surprisingly notable. During the fights, again when meaty fist meetys face, the sound is extremely noticeable, like you'd think. Crunch, crunch, snap, snap ? I think that describes it aptly. Additionally, the surround sound was also used exceptionally well. For example, while I was sat in my lovely back row seat, I noticed a guy a few rows down from me with his feet on the seat in front of him. During the film, Rocky and Creed were in the gym and one of trainers in the background was shouting at someone about his footwork; "You! At the back! Move your feet!" Needless to say, the guy put his feet down and the rest of us were looking around for the guy who shouted. Now I feel like an idiot because I am one.On the other hand, the soundtrack was fifty shades of wrong, just bad, terrible, awful and suckening. They obviously tried to mix the classic Rocky theme tune with elements of "urban" music because he's black and we're all dirty racists. However, somehow, they ended up with the worst bits of both, like being unable to make a funny and slightly surreal analogy about having the worst bits of two different entities. I hate myself so, so much.Finally, the make-up is the standout of any Rocky film and this one is no different. It was truly hard to look at. Michael B Jordan, by the end, looked someone had stuffed some mega marshmallows under his eyelids. You are very welcome for that image.Overall, Creed was a solid film. There were some good performances from Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan, of Fant4forthepriceof2stic Four fame, coupled with great visual effects and sound. This is only let down by the slightly off pacing, questionable story arches and the god awful soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed a good Rocky Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the 7th movie in the Rocky franchise and this time the Italian Stallion is training the son of his former enemy turned best friend, Apollo Creed. Apollo died in Rocky IV during an exhibition match with a steroid-enhanced Soviet monster Ivan Drago. His son, Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), wasn't even born. Today, he wants to follow in his late father's footsteps as a professional boxer. He seeks the help of the man his father fought, the man his father trained, the man who beat his father and the man who beat the Russian who killed his father, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). After some reluctance, Balboa agrees to train and mentor Adonis.Creed has several pieces of all the previous Rocky movies. The son of Apollo's glove man is now running Creed's gym. There's running down the streets of Philadelphia. Adonis has to deal with being the underdog and a much smaller opponent like in Rocky IV. He trains like Rocky did in Rocky I. He deals with adversity with his trainer like in Rocky III. He starts his training in Mickey's old gym in Philly and winds up completing his training in a rougher part of town, also a la Rocky III.Most of Creed is predictable except for three pretty big things, without giving too much away: First, Adonis is the son of Apollo, though not how you might initially think; second, Rocky is given a surprising twist in the movie; and finally, the big final fight. The most impressive part of the movie is Adonis' first professional fight with Rocky in his corner as his trainer. From the moment he walks into the ring, through the entire first round, through the break between rounds, and until the fight is over midway through the second round is all one continues camera shot. To get the action sequences and dialogue just right in one single take was extremely impressive.Creed is a really good continuation of the Rocky franchise. It was an enjoyable modern take on a 40 year classic. It didn't win any Oscars, though Stallone earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination. One could have made an argument for Johnson to be nominated for Best Actor, but this year was all about Leonardo finally getting his trophy anyway. It was worth the money to watch, entertaining, and I'll probably watch it again on TV, but most likely won't be making it to my home collection, so I'm sticking with my 3.0 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adonis "Donnie" Johnson (Jordan) the son of the late Apollo Creed, a former Heavyweight Champion of the World, asks Rocky Balboa (Stallone) to train him. Rocky reluctantly agrees. Later Adonis changes his name to Creed to fight Pretty Rickey Conlan (Tony Bellew) the British Light Heavyweight Champion of the World. Let the games begin. The Academy got it wrong. Sylvester Stallone should have been nominated for the Best Actor Award, not a Supporting Actor Award. He may not have beaten out Leo, but should have been in the same arena as Leo. You want a Best Supporting Actor? Look to Michael B. Jordan as Adonis "Donnie" Creed, who was excellent throughout. Everything in this film is terrific, nothing dragged, was overdone or was drawn out. All the Rocky movies are terrific and so is this one. Many of us also enjoyed this for a small trip down Memory Lane and were not disappointed. All the final fight scenes in all the Rocky movies were spot on, brutal and some believe they were quite real and not a thing of movie magic. (Pretty sure they were all movie magic) All the supporting cast and technicians involved should be very proud of this movie. Notables: Liev Schreiber: Narrator for a while in the beginning; Phylicia Rashad as Mary Anne Creed, : the stepmother of Aldonis; Tessa Thompson as Bianca, the love interest of Adonis; Sports Announcers: Tony Kornheiser, Michael Wilbon, and Hannah Storm as themselves.All in all a terrific movie, thoroughly entertaining and one of the best boxing movies ever. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb and that wasn't all that clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stirring enough to mute the flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the better-than-expected intended closure to the Rocky franchise, Rocky Balboa (2006). series star, writer and occasional director Sylvester Stallone was talked into moving the story forward. Stallone clearly has a lot of love for his characters - his revisiting of John Rambo in 2008 and his homage to the genre that made him a star, The Expendables, clearly confirm this - so whether it was this or the energy and potential of Fruitvale Station (2013) director Ryan Coogler that persuaded him to don the trilby and rubber ball once again is a mystery. Thankfully he did though, as Stallone gives a career best performance as the ageing, sickly icon, despite being relegated to a supporting character.Creed instead focuses on, as the title obviously suggests, the son of former world champion and Rocky Balboa's arch-nemesis-turned- best-friend Apollo Creed. Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) was illegitimate; the product of Apollo's wandering eye, and when we first meet him he's causing a ruckus at an orphanage. Boxing is in his blood, and he's taken in by Apollo's sympathetic widow, who doesn't want to see Adonis suffer the same fate as her ex-husband. Unsatisfied with taking trips to Mexico to fight illegal bouts when he's not working his dull day job, Adonis decides to relocate to Philadelphia, where he plans to convince the one man who rose from nothing to become world champion to train him, Rocky Balboa.Rocky is naturally apprehensive at first, but Adonis' determination and charm eventually convince him, but you get the sense that he secretly longs to be back in the action once again. Rocky essentially takes over Mickey's role, played by Burgess Meredith in previous instalments, as he tries to mould Adonis into a worthy successor to his father. The overbearing similarities to the first Rocky film from 1979 is Creed's major negative - it is essentially the same film only with dirt bikes and better camera-work - but Coogler stamps his own style onto the film too, putting his own spin on familiar scenes. It also treads dangerously close to cliché, as Adonis is offered a title fight after one professional match and courts the lovely R &amp; B singer in the apartment below (Tessa Thompson).Yet Creed is sufficiently stirring enough to mute the flaws, with the boxing scenes captured with style and electricity (one long-take is particularly impressive), and enough genuine emotion on show to engage you with the characters. The relationship between Rocky and the brash Adonis is extremely well-written, with Stallone performing with a subtlety seen in his best work (the original Rocky and Cop Land (1997)), and he was truly robbed of an Oscar here. Only the stoniest of hearts could fail to be moved by the scenes of Rocky at his most physically and emotionally vulnerable, even if you didn't grow up with the original films. While its far from perfect, Creed is a worthy addition to the Rocky universe, with Coogler again demonstrating why he's a director to watch and Jordan proving that even Fantastic Four will not damage his rise to stardom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Young Man Who Harbors a Secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Adonis Johnson" (Michael B. Jordon) is a young man who harbors a secret that has tormented him his entire life. This anger and bitterness has led him into one violent episode after another and because of that he has turned to boxing to vent his rage. Finally, after winning his 15th consecutive fight in Tijuana he decides to focus all of his effort into the sport and tries to gain membership at a local Los Angeles gym. Unfortunately, the word is out on him and he is refused admission. So left with few other opportunities he decides to travel to Philadelphia to ask a favor of the man his father knew only too well?Rocky Balboa. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it definitely had its exciting moments and deserves a place in the "Rocky" legacy. On the other hand, it also had some flaws as well. For example, it follows almost the exact same format as the first "Rocky" movie from start to finish. Likewise, there were a couple of scenes which were simply too obvious to be believed. But having said all of that, this movie was still entertaining in its own right and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legacy Fulfilled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off honestly: 'Rocky' was never my favorite franchise. But I think that's okay, as it's probably not most people's. Despite its importance in pop culture, good acting, good dialogue, and general goodness?well, they were rare, especially as the movies went on. But I guess in the end, the technical quality of such a film never matters. As long as it's enjoyable. The first trailer for 'Creed' gave me chills, just like the one for 'The Force Awakens', and in many respects, this film can be both compared and contrasted well with the latter. What 'Creed' did differently: it relied less on the nostalgia factor than TFA. I think that this helped the film stand out on its own and it was overall a great move. That said, I felt that there were a few things missing. The Rocky theme disappeared completely. I would have thought that since Apollo told Rocky, "Eye of the tiger," that perhaps Rocky should have said the same thing to Adonis. Perhaps that's just me. That said, Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone blew me away, and it's not often that either one of them have done that. I wasn't sure how I liked the Rocky-with-cancer subplot. It hit me sort of like Han's end in that, well?I hated it at first. But in contrast to 'Star Wars 7', it turned out to not be such a terrible move, and it brought out more from Stallone as an actor and helped the film affect the audience greater. I believe that 'Creed' has done justice to the legacy of the 'Rocky' films overall, but all the same I would remain wary of sequels. The ending to this film confirms that it is just as much a reboot as a sequel, the same as 'The Force Awakens' was. If they continue to carbon copy or kill off Rocky or anything rash like that, they'll be going down paths not easily completed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big-budget, studio-produced franchise films don't get any better than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This modern take on the Rocky story is a lot better than I expected. I was never a fan of Sylvester Stallone, and no one would disagree that he eventually drove the Rocky series into a swamp. Rocky (1976) is an excellent and influential film. Its legacy can be seen in the wonderful The Karate Kid (1984), also directed by John G. Avildsen. Rocky II (1979) is good, but largely a repeat of the first. Rocky III (1982) is competent, but commercial, and it showed that the 1980s have arrived. Rocky IV (1985) is all formula and all propaganda. Rocky V (1990) is the worst thing ever (just kidding). And, finally, Rocky Balboa (2006) is flawed but better than expected. So, it's clear that every successive film in the series became worse. But now, because of Creed, the series is back on top. Creed is easily the best in the series since Rocky II. Why is that? Well, it's because the director this time is Ryan Coogler, and Stallone is in a supporting role. Coogler came up with a workable idea for the film - let's make the main character the son of former world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, and let's make Rocky his trainer and mentor. It's an idea that, with Coogler's writing and direction, works surprisingly well. One can say that Creed has the same formula as every Rocky film, but, if the film is this well-made and uplifting, is that a problem? As for Stallone, he delivers one of his best performances ever. In fact, he upstages Michael B. Jordan, who plays Adonis Creed, in just about every scene that they have together. But Jordan isn't a disappointment. He has the good looks for a big budget Hollywood movie. More importantly, he breathes remarkable life into the title role, showing that Adonis is a cocksure, exuberant and loyal character. The only problem with Adonis is his relationship with his love interest Bianca (Tessa Thompson). This relationship is poorly developed and not entirely believable. Still, some of the scenes with Bianca are tender and candid. The fight scenes are, for the most part, exciting. They don't have the same punch as the fight scenes that Avildsen and Stallone filmed in Rocky and Rocky II, but they're well-done and they pay off. One of the problems is that Creed's opponent isn't presented well as someone who's tough and dangerous. Because of this, one doesn't get the feeling that Adonis has to overcome a big challenge. By the way, Coogler and cinematographer Maryse Alberti also did a good job filming in Philadelphia, showing a city in an economic depression. So, in my view, there are a few faults with the script and with characterization. Still, on the whole, Creed works very well. I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

But his shot at the light heavyweight championship is endangered when his mentor is diagnosed with cancer.A refreshing addition to the Rocky anthology, Creed is as much homage to the original as it is an update of the mythos.With knockout performances, kinetic direction, and rapid-fire editing all aiding in its inspirational yet unconventional sports movie trajectory.Conversely, retired ringside cutman can always get seasonal stitch-work with the NHL.

		<fullReview>Why does Apollo Creed's son want to be a thug so desperately? He's got himself a good job at a security company, after all, and lives in a villa in Beverly Hills.Ryan Coogler's "Creed" gives us the answer, of course, but it is also the answer to two related questions that haunt us and the movies we see. Why are Hollywood reboots obsessed with referencing their originals to the point of self denial?; and: Why do actors have to go physical extremes to earn our respect?Michael B. Jordan plays Adonis Johnson, the love child of the late Apollo Creed, who was rival and then friend of boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), the hero of six "Rocky" films. He is as desperate to make his mark as a boxer and rise to his father's level as Ryan Coogler is to match the first "Rocky" film. While he has made a good-looking picture, this is nothing to distinguish him as a great director. You see the father complex in numerous blockbusters these days. Neither "Jurassic World" nor "Terminator: Genisys" could break away from their old spirits, and "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" was so afraid of the nostalgics that it more or less recycled everything which used to be good in the old trilogy. Thinning out already existing concepts is an alarming sign of lack of originality, but for now, fans applaud everything that honors their old favorites, and filmmakers are eager to bow to their idols. The case of "Creed" is most puzzling, because even the recycling part is doomed: In an underdog series, the new hero is everything but an underdog. And this is where our second question will be answered.Adonis decides to go to Philadelphia to be trained by Rocky, and he does not really seek the extraordinary expertise (Rocky is too old for exercise, anyway). It's rather his longing for a "real", gritty, authentic place that drives him, and of course he voluntarily settles down in a shabby quarter. "Voluntarily" is the key word. "Rocky" was so touching because a poor fellow had his chance for glory, worked hard for it, and realized that love meant more to him than winning. For "Creed" to fit into this scheme, intricate measures have to be taken. Making the actual lack of poverty and despair be the reason of desperation sounds as illogical as anything ? yet it seems to resonate with audiences. Aren't we, the Generations Y and Z of the West, safe and well nourished, but also purposeless? Somewhere in us, there is the desire for the "real" thing, and if we don't satisfy it with adventure sports and travelling to exotic places we have to deal with an intermediary form. We want pretty actresses to deform or glamorous stars to go into the wilderness or laid-back actors to grind themselves, even if just for a movie. And we want Adonis to get in touch with filth and roughness, so that, as it were, he himself becomes "authentic". We have internalized that the true heroes are underdogs, but now we first have to be underdogs again to become heroes.Sylvester Stallone's performance shouldn't be left unmentioned. He brings Rocky back to life, but as things are, his character came to the end of his journey in "Rocky Balboa" and now he seems dispensable, ghost-like. "Creed" proves (again) that Sly can act (and that Michael B. Jordan has much going for him), but what else it proves is disconcerting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Rocky since Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed [*****] The best Rocky since Rocky. This film hits all the right notes. Whereas Rocky was a thrilling drama about a fighter, this is more like a drama about an orphan in need of a family, and people who love him. It is pretty amazing that a relatively unknown director pulled this off to be honest. His camera-work in the boxing bouts is different, refreshing. Perhaps less dramatic than the work in Rockies 3 and 4 but more realistic, and more suitable to the tone of the film. What we all figured out about what made Rocky such a winner in his movies, is described here in lines of dialogue. How Rocky took the fight to the superior opponent, putting himself at risk, but with an inner flame to win. Michael B. Jordan is very good and likable, unlike his awful turn in The Fantastic Four - which suggests a director problem there. He actually DOES have a resemblance to the great Apollo Creed, and it is quite chilling to see that in certain expressions and mannerisms of his. The past is being referenced with reverence, as every piece of the city Philadelphia has been soaked in the history of these great fighters, so you feel like revisiting those moments, but it is done with class, subtlety and utmost respect. Creed is being acknowledged as the greatest fighter, not Rocky. Rocky isn't even mentioned much, if you notice by the lack of his name being called out, - people call him "Champ", "Italian Stallion" and other things... Creed calls him "Unc" - to make sure that it is clear to the viewers that this is Creed's movie. It feels more like an offshoot rather than a sequel and - thankfully - a far cry conceptually from the movie where Rocky trains a kid only to have him turn to himself. As for Sly... what can I say, you already know he got a Golden Globe for this, and he really reveals a level of acting that I did not know he had, and a layer to Rocky that we always suspected he had, but it was never explicitly portrayed. The girl is very good too, kind of a black version of Katie Holmes. Overall the director hits bulls eye in all areas. Don't miss. Oh, and it does help to have seen at least Rocky 1 to 4 before....Just in case you haven't</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a movie that inspires you to do something, anything great in life. That amazing feeling when you're still sitting there watching the movie and yet it's making you, in that moment, want to go out and achieve your own greatness. 'Creed' is one of those movies. Admittedly I'm not the biggest fan of the 'Rocky' series. I saw the original perhaps when I was too young to appreciate it, and consequently never saw any of the sequels until this one came along. People often rave about the inspiration this series is capable of giving you though and I fully believe it. I've heard clips of some of the speeches and seen particular scenes and the whole thing is just perfect for anyone needing that extra piece of motivation to get out there and achieve their own dreams.Sylvester Stallone has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards and rightly so. This is only his second nomination for an Oscar for acting, the first being for the same character way back in 1997 in the original 'Rocky'. On that occasion he lost to Peter Finch for his performance in 'Network'. On this occasion however, I suspect he will take home the award. He couldn't have asked for a better script to work with (ironically this is the first film in the 'Rocky' series that he has not written himself). All the story lines and dialogue are set up perfectly for him and he delivers an impassioned performance that only he could have. He gets a rough time now and then for his acting performances, so it's nice to see him get some well deserved accolades as well.'Creed' was not nominated for Best Picture but I wholeheartedly believe it should have been. With the extended number of nominees in the modern ceremony it's almost criminal to not have it there. It's well acted, wonderfully written, emotional, inspiring and compelling. What more could you ask for? Nonetheless people that see it are enjoying the hell out of it and that says a lot too. I'm led to believe there are more sequels to come and to that I say bring them on. I won't be missing any more films in this series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies from 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the best way to start something new. We can feel the power of the old Rocky films. Creed is a great ending of the old movies but also a really good start of a new era. The only one negative point of the movie is, that Apollo is too big legend and Rocky seams a little bit just a local hero however we all know that the Italian stallion was the best ever. (Maybe this is a spoiler, maybe not.) Good point of the movie: 1) Stallone gives maybe the best performance of his career. 2) Michael B. Jordan is really authentic sportsman. Bad point of the movie: 1) Too big hype about Apollo 2) Rocky is not as respected as he should be. 3) the love story, Bianca freaks out because of the name Creed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i think that this film is over-rated and sly didn't deserve the golden globe instead we were all sympathized with Rocky's character and we ignored that the director didn't create a space of liberty to show off his skills as the shots were too quick and there is no clear master scene that you can feel he excelled in this movie. I think the director cared about the technique of the match it was great but he ignored the performance of almost all the actors even the character creed himself.on the other hand we can make excuse for Michael B. Jordan cause he was forced to be in a comparison with sly the huge Rocky but like what i told before that the problem was the director that he cared about every thing except the performance.Its good to revive the masterpieces we inspired before but it put the crew under a great pressure to be on the same level or higher.Sly became more cleverness to switch his type of movies like Expendables and all action movies he did before to make this type and in my opinion that was the only reason to get the golden globe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must For Any Rocky Fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this was first announced I wasn't interested one bit as I couldn't imagine how this could compare to the Rocky franchise. And even after the release I was reluctant to watch.. But after watching it I'm so glad I did! What a superb job they've done creating a new film but retaining balboa's legacy! A modern rocky balboa with all the trademark moments we rocky fans love to see! Only downside to me was Tony Bellow.. Just wasn't convincing (maybe it would have helped if he was in better shape?). But overall a must watch for any Rocky fan.. Will definitely be pre-ordering the bluray and look forward to seeing Creed 2!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of the whole franchise, but Rocky Balboa (2006) hit the right spot and this sixth statement knock me down to watch the previous movies with other eyes.Stallone is at his best in the movie, and deserved the nomination for the Golden Globe. In this film I was able to see the same Rocky that I loved from nine years ago, but now in a fight outside of the ring, where the character shows his real value, and with a backup of the new generation, gritty, messed up, young Adonis Creed, brought to life by the amazing performance of Michael B. Jordan.The directing is pretty awesome. A couple masters through the fights, a great work in the montage of the training and the fights, and shots that capture the intimacy between Unc and Donnie. A very nice work that made the movie different of other sports flicks. It wasn't about the fighter, the legacy, the cancer, the final fight itself. It was subjective in a point that few movies can get.Other thing that really hooked me into it was the make-up. You were able to see a bruise appear just after the punch and the way that they escalated. That f*cked up eye in the final fight was like, "Sh*t, I almost threw up my dinner!". But not only that! The make up on Stallone during the fight with cancer was pretty amazing either. He isn't a young boy anymore, but the make up made him look a couple years older and really sick and so.The story is very good, with a good tone and in no moment appellative in the cancer point. After all it isn't a movie about Rocky, is about Adonis, and they kept in the right way. They didn't made a movie about Rocky the trainer, trying to bring back the hero of the 70's and 80's. He was part of the movie about a new star! And that worked fine!It is a great movie, check it out as soon as possible!</fullReview>

The Movies picks up the pace with protagonist reaching the motives. The Script is tight and nice. Jordan kept the tempo up and honored the legacy with his swag and sincerity. Sylvester voice still brings the life to the show with his subtle variation of mood when he talks about his life while looking at Jordan .

		<shortDescription>Great Spin-Off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got around to seeing this "Rocky" spin off at the local multi-plex over the holidays, and it's a winner! From the collaborators of a great little indie film from a few years ago, "Fruitvale Station", writer/director Ryan Cooglar, and star Michael B. Jordan, take the deceased character of Apollo Creed, and have the illegitimate son- Adonis Creed (Jordan) go to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) for training. There were a lot of great little moments in this movie, which definitely had it's own feel separate from the original set of 5 "Rocky" films released between 1976 and 1990. In fact, I would say this film follows more along the lines of the much more recent 2006 "Rocky Balboa", directed by Stallone himself. I've heard that Sly is passing off the franchise to Cooglar and Jordan, but not sure if there will be another movie in this spin-off line-?? I hope so... Big thumbs up for this one!</fullReview>

Its a beautiful well though out story and screen shots are outstanding from start to finish. Stallone originally turned down the role as was not happy with the story but with the change of direction by Ryan Coogler who also wrote the script Stallone came on board and the rocky brand is reborn is this brilliant addition to the rocky franchise. Rocky after a lot of persuasion trains creeds son with some great fight scenes and a great homage to the original films with nice touches in training and if this the final film in franchise its the perfect ending to the historic boxing underdog. Creed delivers the knockout blow with amazing performances from Michael B Jordan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love and respect the sport of boxing then watch this: Facing Ali (2009).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just google/web-search Facing Ali 2009 dvdrip and download it with any BitTorrent client. Now I must mention that the greatest boxer that ever lived and the one who suffered the hardest hits on his neck and the back of his head to such an extent that part his brainstem was killed and he suffered a form of paralysis that people have falsely claimed that it was Parkinson's disease.I am talking about the legendary Muhammad Ali who revolutionized the sport of boxing into an international extravaganza. The "Fight Of The Century" with Joe Frazier, The "Rumble In The Jungle" with George Foreman and The Thriller In Manila his last match with Frazier.He has taken hits from the hardest punchers Sonny Liston, Sir Henry Cooper, George Chuvalo, Ken Norton, Ron Lyle, Earnie Shavers, Leon Spinks and Larry Holmes who finally ended his career as a boxer.Rocky Balboa is a fictional and fake character created to appeal and prey on people's sympathies. Even Sylvester Stallone admits this in the commentary track of Rocky Balboa, the sixth in the franchise.The film Creed is the Seventh film that continues the story of Rocky Balboa but I think it is a spin-off film that Sylvester Stallone made to honor his friend Carl Weathers who played Apollo Creed in the four Rocky films. Carl is currently 67 years old(as of 2016).The film concerns the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Adonis Creed who goes by the name of Adonis Johnson. He did not know that his father was the great and legendary boxer Apollo Creed. He is told the truth by Apollo's first wife. Adonis is a juvenile delinquent who spends his time in foster homes and youth facilities because his mother passed away at a young age. He often gets into trouble because of his talent for street brawling.When he learns the truth, he decides to pursue the career of a professional boxer. This leads him eventually to encounter the only man that won the World Heavyweight title from his father, Rocky Balboa.Watch the film to see what happens next.Verdict: you watch films like these to see boxing action - and you will not be disappointed. Michael B. Jordan who plays Adonis looks nothing like Carl Weathers in appearance. His acting is okay but not memorable. Actor Wesley Snipes would have done the role perfectly in his younger years. Plus he had the most superb physique and posture.Sylvester Stallone's acting in the film is impressive. He is living the life of a hermit, expecting death at any moment so that he can join with his wife. In the film we also learn that Paulie has passed way, implying that Rocky is more lonely than ever. The encounter with Adonis rekindles some of the passion for boxing and a chance to return the favor that Apollo did for him, when he trained him for the fight against James "Clubber" Lang.Friendship develops between the two. The question is that will Adonis be able to emulate the success of his dad? Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: It is a better film than Rocky Balboa. It succeeds as a good time-pass/casual viewing film. My honest opinion is still that the Rocky franchise should have stopped at part five. Lastly I have to mention this, that I sorely miss Sage Stallone who captivated me with his sincere acting in Rocky V. The father son relationship and pep-talks were priceless to me and still are. R.I.P. Sage Stallone.More boxing movies: The Great White Hope (1970 based on the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson), The Champ (1979), Raging Bull (1980 based on boxer Jake LaMotta's life), Brutal Glory (Video 1989 Based upon the man who invented the corkscrew punch Kid McCoy),Gladiator (1992), The Hurricane (1999 based on Rubin "Hurricane" Carter's life story), Ali(2001 based on Muhammad Ali's life ), Cinderella Man (2005).Thanks for taking the time to read my review.

		<shortDescription>Worthy later sequel in Rocky franchise despite unlikable protagonist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of Ryan Coogler's well-received "Fruitvale Station," I concluded with the following suggestion for the fledgling filmmaker: "The neophyte director has bit off more than he can chew, attempting to dissect a topic infused with racial animus. Next time he would be much better served churning out a less controversial, commercial product." And somehow Mr. Coogler did just that by collaborating with sound designer and fellow screenwriter, Aaron Covington, crafting Creed, a mainstream tribute to and seventh installment in the Sly Stallone Rocky Balboa franchise.Ironically, the weakest part of Creed is its main character, Adonis Creed, the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa's opponent in the first episode. As Coogler and Covington fashion it, Apollo dies before Adonis is born?the young boy passes through the foster care system until he's rescued by Apollo's widow (played by a rather stiff Phyilicia Rashad) who decides to adopt him. Despite being raised in the lap of luxury, Adonis quits his job in finance, and runs off to Mexico where he wins a series of club fights against lesser opponents. Unlike Rocky who must pull himself up by his own bootstraps, Adonis never has to really about financial security. It's not clear whether Adonis still has gobs of money in his checking account when he decides to move to a not so well off neighborhood in Philadelphia but for some reason it's all about proving to himself that he can live up to the family legacy. Nonetheless, Adonis' lack of a rags to riches story turns out to be a non-fatal impediment to caring for the character. Our interest in Adonis however, is seriously undermined by his one-dimensional character flaw: self-hatred. The film's opening scenes establishes that when we see how Adonis the youth has a serious anger management problem. As an adult, we must endure Adonis' continuing chip-on-my-shoulder routine. Can we really care for such a cliché of a character despite his eventual reformation at the hands of a good woman and success in the ring? I think not. Don't blame leading man Michael B. Jordan for injecting little pizazz into the film's protagonist. It's strictly a failure on the part of the films' scenarists who are unable to transfer the charms of a Rocky Balboa to their modern-day counterpart.Despite dropping the ball somewhat in the screen writing department, Coogler still proves himself to be a talented director. Fans of the previous Rocky installments will love how he directs Sylvester Stallone, who plays Rocky, as the retired boxer who agrees to manage Adonis, first out of obligation to Apollo, but later out of respect for the talents of the up-and-coming son. The only sour note is when Rocky finds out he has cancer and agrees to chemotherapy despite all the bad memories of what happened to his beloved Adrian (doctors and their deadly chemotherapy remain sacred cows in Coogler's Weltanschauung).Coogler shines best in the technical aspects of filmmaking. The fight scenes in Creed are expertly choreographed and real-life boxer Tony Bellew steals the show as the malevolent Liverpudlian prizefighter Ricky Conlan, who fights Adonis to a split-decision win in the climactic scene.Tessa Thompson, who was so dynamic in Dear White People, has a lot less to do here as Adonis' love interest, Bianca, playing a singer/songwriter who is slowly losing her hearing. The dark moment of Act 2 involves more of Adonis' ubiquitous anger management problem--he gets into a fight with a musician who has top billing at the club where Bianca is making her debut. Of course all's well that ends well when the cooing couple make up and Adonis goes on to acquit himself nicely in the ring. With Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler created a "calling card" for bigger and better things. Now with Creed, he has proved himself as a "mainstream" director and is sure to get more work in Hollywood. I am impressed by Mr. Coogler's technical talents; as a writer he should avoid the tendency toward melodrama and embrace an all-encompassing verisimilitude.</fullReview>

Secondly, his geriatric trainer Rocky Balboa has risen from his death bed to remain in the picture here through the final fight. Though many critics believe that Sylvester Stallone's dialect always has been somewhat akin to an Italian geezer recovering from a stroke, there are plenty of other old folks maladies left to endanger the Rocky Balboa character, without forcing Mr. Stallone to attempt the Herculean acting height of portraying what would essentially be a stroke victim squared. The erstwhile Rambo actor has attained the Real Life age where bouts with influenza are frequently fatal; "Can Creed cream corny pugs as Rocky fights flu?" sounds like a ready-made tag-line for the next CREED offering. This would give the scriptwriters an opportunity to have Mr. Adonis bellow out "Bianca, Bianca!" at the end of a tussle (which could become as memorable as a Mum-Yelled "Adrian!" by the original Rocky).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On paper the premise for Creed doesn't sound like a good idea, it's a Rocky sequel for god's sake so a passing of the torch seems ludicrous when the previous 6, I repeat 6 films include the name "ROCKY" in them.BUT...Ryan Coogler got it completely right, creating a film that is not only a great Rocky film (and from what I've heard the best sequel), but is also a great film period.I have not seen any of the Rocky sequels (except this of course) but I have seen the 1976 original to which I believe Creed is as good as, maybe even better.The acting is good. Michael B Jordan more than redeems himself after the train wreck of a film that is Fant4Stic, Tessa Thompson is good as well, and I can't believe we may even see Rocky himself, Sylvester Stallone win an Oscar and actually deserve it showing a side of the Italian Stallion that we never thought we would see, in the biggest fight of his life yet, that of cancer.Creed is both art-house and blockbuster, Ryan Coogler brings the edge of your seat action as well as the emotion as he portrays two generations of boxers fighting two very different fights. After having seen this and his debut feature Fruitvale Station, I believe that Ryan Coogler has cemented himself as the next big thing and an excellent filmmaker. And that one take boxing match scene tho, enough said.Creed packs a punch in more ways than one, jabbing, crossing and Hooking you from start to finish. If you are a fan of Rocky films or just want to watch a good film, I highly recommend Creed and praise all those involved in it's making but especially Ryan Coogler who will be one to look out for in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed found a solid and interesting premise to resurrect the Rocky franchise, with a minimum ret-con and a modern sensibility which doesn't alter the spirit of its predecessors. Well, "resurrect" might not be the correct word. Strictly speaking, Creed is more like a spin-off in which the legendary Rocky Balboa limits himself to train a boxer with talent with few experience. Basically, Sylvester Stallone inherits the role played by Burgess Meredith in the original Rocky back in 1976 (in fact, Stallone is the same age in Creed as Meredith was back then... and there's no need to say how much that little coincidence surprised me). However, Rocky makes an influence on every scene, enriching the tale without imposing himself and generally avoiding manifestations of excessive nostalgia. I say "generally" because, among the cons of Creed, I have to mention some forced recreations of some iconic elements in the Rocky saga; for example, that famous race on the streets, and the use of the majestic music we all remember. I'm not saying they are badly used... I simply found them arbitrary nostalgic whims. But well, that complaint didn't affect the emotive and very satisfactory experience offered by Creed. Michael B. Jordan occupies the leading role with credibility and huge charisma (not to mention discipline... I can barely imagine the effort required to shoot a whole fight without any camera cuts), while Stallone carries his age with dignity and doesn't try to hide it; on the opposite, he takes advantage of his age in order to portray Rocky's evolution, always consistent with his nature and the facts established the last time we had seen him in the film Rocky Balboa, without forgetting the small humorous details which enhance his humanity. On the negative side, the romantic sub-plot feels unnecessary. Tessa Thompson brings a good performance and she's undoubtedly attractive, but the connection her character has with the main one feels obligatory and not very natural. And the adversary isn't very well developed either; actor Tony Bellew brings quite a personality to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, the arrogant boxing champion who needs an important fight as a public relations strategy after some legal slips; unfortunately, the movie dedicates him very little time, and the exciting final fight might have had some more impact if we had known the opponent better. On the other hand, I know that the point of Creed doesn't exclusively lie on reaching the "big fight", but also creating a touching relationship between Adonis and Rocky, each one of them filling the holes in the life of the other one on some way. And on that aspect, I found Creed recommended, very entertaining and worthy as a continuation/tangent of a franchise with such many followers. I don't think it's as good as the original Rocky, but I consider it superior to any of the other sequels (specially Rocky III, IV and V). I would like to finish this review with a boxing analogy, but I'm afraid I don't know too much about that sport. Oh, there's one which just came to my mind: Creed is a knockout! Start the count to twelve, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to greatness for the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is another example of a sequel that works as a reboot for a franchise that is losing steam by injecting new energy while remaining respectful of the source material. Creed had all the rights to just be an unnecessary sequel, but it manages to destroy those expectations by delivering a strong story and great performances that pays homage to the Rocky formula while planting the seeds of something new.Good: First off, the performance here all great around the board. Michael B. Jordan continues to display acting chops that makes him a big name in Hollywood for years to come. He is likable and tough while being vulnerable. He displays charm and drive and he makes this character his own. He and Tessa Thompson make their love story interesting without growing too stale. Sylvester Stallone reminds us that he is still an actor by delivering a heartbreaking performance as Rocky Balboa. With all of that said, the true star is Ryan Coogler who makes this all work with a great eye for the scenes that flow well, good pacing, and some great fighting scenes especially one that is all done in one take. The score is also worth noting as it has a mixture of electronic, rap, and classical elements with some portions of the Rocky theme in place. Speaking of the Rocky franchise, this movie does go out to honor the past movies by respecting the timeline and offering references to the movies without ever feeling like fan service or simply there to be referential.Overall, I had a fantastic time with Creed. I cheered and I teared up even when it all feels familiar. The passion and the strength of the performances alone makes this one the best Rocky movie since the original and perhaps one of the best sports movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly and satisfyingly good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone has had a remarkable cinematic career with at its heart two very personal franchises: "Rocky" (now on his seventh outing in "Creed") and later "Rambo" (who managed four expeditions).The first and more successful of the series started way back in 1976 when Stallone - who wrote the script and took the leading role - created the character of the Philadelphia low-grade boxer who managed, against all the odds, to go the distance with world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. In "Rocky II" (1979), after 15 brutal rounds, he defeats Creed and takes the title. In 1982, "Rocky III" sees our hero lose to Mr T before Apollo helps him bounce back. By the time of "Rocky IV" (1985), the franchise had acquired an international dimension as the Cold War is acted out in the ring with Rocky squaring up to the Russian Ivan Drago. Another five years passed before Stallone felt that he had to return to the iconic role when, in "Rocky V", he adopts a young fighter who turns on him. That really should have been it - but, a full 16 years after the previous film, he was back in "Rocky Balbao", finding that he has something "lurking in the basement".Now, after an interval of another nine years, amazingly Rocky is with us yet again in a movie which for the first time is not named after him, for the first time since the original film is not directed by Stallone, and for the first time ever is not written by Stallone. This time Stallone is only in a support role, although he gives a fine performance. This time, we have an African-American version of the franchise, with director and co-writer 29 year old Ryan Coogler, lead actor Michael B Jordan, and lead actress Tessa Thompson all being people of colour - although race as such does not feature in the plot. Instead this is a story of self-esteem, as Adonis 'Donny' Johnson (Jordan), the illegitimate son of Rocky's great friend Apollo Creed, seeks out Rocky to train him in the skills that made his father so successful.In a similar way that "The Force Awakens" retreads the narrative path of "A New Hope" with so many allusions to other films in the "Star Wars" franchise, so "Creed" essentially follows the path of the original "Rocky' movie with constant references to the earlier works in the series. So we have many of the same training techniques and demonstrations of physical prowess (including those one-armed press-ups) and some visceral bouts of boxing. Heck, we even finish up on those 72 steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. But it is all done with great reverence and flourish with excellent cinematography and a strong soundtrack, so it is a surprisingly satisfying return to the ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not quite Rocky, was ever going to be? but it still stands out as a moving, heartfelt instalment to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, much like the force awakens this is a 7th entry (even if this is meant as a spin off) in a legendary franchise that has been going around since the 1970s. And much like Star Wars to say that the Rocky movies was going to be a tough act to follow is a understatement.Yet while it doesn't quite match what the other movies were it still does a pretty good job at standing out on its own. This is a pure next generation spin off which still carries on Rocky's story but this is still far from Rocky VII. The title character acting as the son of Apollo Creed that no one knew off, who is pretty much along with his relationship with Rocky who is still very much a big part of the story the driving force of the film.This could have easily have been the new Rocky V because when I first heard of the idea of this one it still sounded to similar to Rocky and Tommy Gunn in the fifth film. But this is far from the case, the only real similarity is that Rocky is training and mentoring a younger up and coming boxer.If anything it goes to great lengths to stay true to the nature of the original Rocky, has plenty of nostalgic nods to the other movies but does more than enough to stay out on its own. Creed works well as a great main character to root for in his own right, he has some of the same struggles of living in a legendary fathers shadow that could have found with Rocky Jr's in the last two films. But there is more to the character than this, there is a new sense of trying to prove himself before word gets out about his family history. This starts to bring a new sense of relatability to the character even if we couldn't all know what he is going through. But it doesn't quite have heart the other films did in the series. It manages to be just as inspiring as the original, and it is a excellent, well made, well acted sports film that regardless of what people will think of it manages to successfully go in its own direction whilst not diverting too far away from what the fans would hope for in the series. There isn't much that this contributes to the franchise and it might have been best left alone at the end of Rocky Balboa. But it is still worth seeing if you are interested, because even if he is no longer the main focus Rocky is back there is no denying that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I wanted it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with I found the storyline weak and as such it made me think that Creed was made purely to be a money spinner under the Rocky franchise but I am happy to say that the plot thickened after the opening scenes and from then on the film was gripping, heartfelt, funny and tremendously reminiscent of all the Rocky films.There will be some critics that state that Creed has in places; a similar storyline to other Rocky films however, I don't count that as a bad thing as it enabled Creed to have the typical Rocky feel that I desperately wanted to unveil in front of me.Ryan Coogler deserves a pat on the back for his efforts and I advise that you give the film time to begin with and after a few opening scenes the film will develop into everything you wanted it to be if you're a die hard Rocky fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky for a New Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed tells the story of Apollo Creed's son Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) as he strives to make a name for himself in the world of boxing. Adonis Johnson, going by his mother's last name, seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) in hopes that Balboa can train him in the ring and tell him more about his deceased father. In Creed, Michael B. Jordan once again collaborates with one of the great up-and-coming directors, Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station). Fueled by the impeccable performances from Jordan and Stallone and the gripping direction of Coogler, Creed is as much a moving drama as it is an exhilarating sports film; this exceptional combination makes for one the best films of the year and one of the greatest sports films of all time.Creed's story of the veteran training the newcomer appears cliché at first glance, but as the two's relationship progresses, it feels anything but stereotypical. Adonis is not just a punk kid who wants to hit people for sport; he is a layered character. Adonis carries a lot of baggage with him, and he has his own personal issues that drive him towards becoming a great boxer. Rocky is an older version of the same guy everyone knows and loves, but Creed shows a side to him that's both unexpected and emotionally powerful. Rocky's past relationship with Apollo Creed contrasted with Adonis' attempt to distance himself from his father's name makes for an interesting dynamic between the two. Adonis needs Rocky, and Rocky needs Adonis.Both these characters are brought to life by the outstanding performances from Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan. Jordan continues to impress me in every film he's in, and I believe Creed is his best performance yet. Jordan's emotional vulnerability in his role as Adonis, and his physical performance while in the ring, more than justifies a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Sylvester Stallone is equally great in his supporting role. There were some dramatic moments where his performance as Rocky really affected me emotionally, and this is a huge credit to his mature take on the aging character he created almost 40 years ago.There are not many boxing matches throughout the film, which is more than fine. The dramatic parts work so well because of the great performances from Stallone and Jordan. That's not to say the boxing matches themselves aren't great; they are. Under Coogler's direction, every hit feels raw, brutal, and relentless. The action is fluid, and the choreography between the fighters is excellent. There's not an overuse of cuts, so the action is easy to follow. In fact, there's an entire boxing match done in one long take. Another element that adds to the boxing matches is the fact authentic HBO broadcasts and ESPN video clips are used throughout the film. This sounds insignificant, but these small details make this boxing world feel that much more real.Creed even contains a compelling romantic relationship between Adonis and a musician named Bianca (played by Tessa Thompson). The two have great chemistry and feel natural together on screen. There's an element to their relationship that is both beautiful and devastating and results in a very memorable relationship (no spoilers). Creed's score is a combination of modern and classic music, and the score does a great job of generating excitement during the training montages. This movie has it all: brutal and suspenseful boxing matches, a compelling romance and a tear-jerking and uplifting story. Creed is Rocky for a new generation, and I truly believe this film has something for everyone. Each and every one of Creed's 12 rounds are an absolute knockout.Check out my other movie reviews over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com or talk movies with me over at @alexwatson1994</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great boxing movie... One of the best in fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first four Rocky movies were great, fave was part 2 and part 4 had the best fights.. The 15 round match that ended that film was epic in every sense... 5 was okay... Then over 20 yrs later he returned in Rocky Balboa.. Which was a great film... More a drama that led up the the fantastic fight at the end.. Now Creed, when I first heard about it I was like, this ain't gonna work... Creed's son?! Boy was I wrong, the characters of Adonis (the son) and uncle Rocky.. Was mesmerising to watch from the moment they met, right up until the end... Micheal B. Johnson is excellent in this, haven't seem him in many roles but this role he nailed perfectly... And Sly.. U made a Rocky 7 and I thank you for it... He was fantastic as the Legend come Trainer, as Mickey was to him all those years ago. I wont go into the story.. But it's a pretty sweet set up and once u start watching, you're literally gripped right up to the very last fight... Now the fights... U see Southpaw was a great film, more the drama aspect itself.. The actual fight I didn't think we're THAT good.. Not bad or anything but in Creed u feel every punch.. The fight scenes are some of the best you will ever see... Ahh the training, when Rocky starts him off by trying to catch a chicken running around the pen, it brings back fond memories... And lastly someone mentioned the main bad buy wasn't that sinister or something but as a fellow Brit, he nailed that role perfectly to.. I loved how the last fight was set in Liverpool at Goddison Park, home of Everton FC and when the audience starting chanting like it was a football match nice. And the so called Pretty Boy antagonist was very cock sure of himself and had that typically aggressive nature of a Liverpudlian bad boy u could tell he just wanted to end anyone he came across.. His comments to Adonis at the end of their fight was very nice and surprising touch as well.. I'll leave it there guys... This was am all round great Boxing film.. It had a lot of heart but it's Michael B. Johnson and Silvester Stallones performances that really stand out in this movie... Watch the fights also like I said before... Brilliant fight scenes..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal struggle filled with incredible performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the seventh film on the Rocky franchise,directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson the son of Apollo Creed,Sylvester Stallone returning to play Rocky Balboa and Tessa Thompson as Bianca. Creed follows Adonis Johnson,who's father (Apollo Creed) died before he was born.However he loves to box and one day he decides to seek out Rocky Balboa to train him.Rocky sees Apollo in Adonis and agrees to train him,even though he battles a deadly opponent but with Rocky's help he will train and try to make a name for himself not just depend on his father's. This movies,much like Rocky (1976),it's not concentrated on the boxing as much as in the characters.Adonis Johnson is played wonderfully by Michael B. Jordan who is definitely Oscar worthy with this performance.Adonis is trying to prove that he was not just a mistake and show the world that he can fight.He goes through a lot of struggle but with the help of Rocky he will try to overcome his fears and be better at what he does. Sylvester Stallone is magnificent on the iconic role again.He proves that The Expendables it's not all he does and he is worthy of a lot more. One of the first professional fights on the ring that Adonis has it's been made to look as one-shot take and it's brilliant.I really loved that scene and even more than the final battle. I really like the personal struggles that the characters have to go through,the way they overcome them and the dialogue between the two main characters it's really good and sometimes even touching.I was tearing up in a few scenes and the amazing soundtrack coordinating with the lines of the dialogue made for some pretty intense/sad scenes. I really liked Creed,it's certainly one of the best movies of the year and worthy of many awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone For Oscar!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this film was going to be great but it was even much better than i thought Creed packs a great cast that gives it's best Sylvester Stallone shines as Rocky Balboa and Michael B. Jordan is an amazing actor and i'm glad that this movie helped him after the Fantastic Flop. There are moments that the film follows Rocky and other times that it follows Rocky II and it talks about III and IV a lot of times. It also shows a huge respect to the Originals and make history all by itself and most of the time i had tears in my eyes and they couldn't bring a better director than Ryan Coogler who also made Fruitvale Station this is by far one of the most awesome Rocky films since Rocky 4. That scene where Creed runs and people follow him with their motorcycles in order to go see Rocky that was a great scene and the love between Adonis and Rocky is a relationship between Father and Son and one of the best things i loved about the film. And i really hope that Michael B. Jordan also gets a nomination about his performance and yes the film is as great as you all heard. Make sure you see Creed because it Rocks it's a perfect 10 out of 10 and i hope the movie get's an Oscar just like the Original Rocky did. Stallone for Oscar!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Shy of Great -- The Best Rocky Movie Since 1976!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer of this film, I was thrilled. The way Rocky's story is turned inside out and upside down, with the son of his old enemy seeking Rocky's guidance to become champion, really fired my imagination. This was going to be something new!Well, I watched the movie and I loved it. I think Stallone has given his best performance in more than thirty years. If you've ever lost a parent, this movie is really emotional. You see someone you always thought of as strong and all-powerful suddenly needing your help just to get from one room to another. Watching Rocky fall brought tears to my eyes. Watching young Adonis Creed help him stand up made me stand up and cheer as well. It's something we all must face, and we all hope to face it like Rocky. Like the man says, "time takes down everyone sooner or later. Time is undefeated."Stallone works a miracle, taking a character we all know and adding new dimensions as he ages and confronts the end of his days. Now Michael B. Jordan, the young actor who plays Adonis Creed is equally brilliant. I've admired his work ever since he played the doomed young drug runner in the HBO series THE WIRE. But the character of Adonis Creed isn't really as compelling as the character of Rocky Balboa. And I think I know why. When you watch the original ROCKY, what really jumps out at you in the first half hour is not that Rocky is tough, or a great boxer. What jumps out at you is that he's a nice guy in a tough neighborhood who takes abuse from literally everyone. The mob boss, the boss' driver, the lady who runs the pet shop, the kids on the corner, the guy who runs the gym -- Rocky has a place in their world, and it's at the bottom of the pecking order. Like Will Ferrell says in LAND OF THE LOST, they treat him like a toilet!The point being, audiences cheered for Rocky because they had a full sense of the man and his place in the world. But that isn't really true of young Adonis Creed. He has a rich mother who adores him, and a father he's never met, and that's about it. We don't know what his buddies think of him, or the neighborhood he comes from, or who he really is -- other than the son of Apollo Creed. You just can't buy into a hero you don't really know. And that's why this movie, as wonderful as it is, remains just shy of great. But it's still the best Rocky movie since 1976.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sure if Creed or a Rocky remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying This Movie Didn't completely Suck like the rest of Rocky sequels it really had some good factors but the story ain't one of them.So, Creed is About this young ambitious rich dude who wants to be a great boxer by his own without taking advantage of his father name (Apollo creed) which seems a good story but actually it's not, as the movie depended on the original rocky TOO Much that The movie lost its originality. also, the love story unlike Rocky (1976) didn't have a meaning and it felt forced and useless to the story. one last thing before I go to the bright side of the movie MICHAEL B.JORDON SUCKED!on the other hand, the movie had some good factors, Sylvester Stallone Was TERFFIC I am not his biggest Fan,but he played the role Just right, maybe it was a little bit slow and long but still was entertaining.Creed wasn't a bad movie but I expected more and this was a huge let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Wow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a little tough for me to write this review impartially. Sylvester Stallone is a personal hero of mine for a number of reasons and my favourite actor period. So it is safe to say my expectations were through the roof on this one but just seeing him on the big screen scores points. However, even with that, Creed is a fantastic piece of work. The entire Rocky legacy has gone from critical hit to mainstream, to less respected and is now inching its way back...life imitating art so to speak. Creed is a near perfect "reboot." I HATE that new expression that has become so common place. Reboot is just a word for trying to make a franchise better enough that it continues. Creed is almost a blend of a reboot and a remake as it does mirror much of the original classic Rocky film but not enough to make it so obvious that it reeks of being yet another Rocky. If I could call out one flaw to the film it would be that there is too much here for one movie. They really cram a lot of story and a lot of time into one two hour film. Still, it works on an incredibly entertaining level and as another IMDb reviewer pointed out, this is a miraculous ode to fans of Rocky.I have never been sure about Michael B. Jordan. You hear a lot of him being an up and comer but then he was in a dud (Fantastic Four) and he was good in the much talked about Fruitvale Station but that was a sub par movie in my books. I wasn't sure I would be impressed with him in this. Well I was...Jordan delivers. He is tough and real and an underdog that you can invest in and while the pacing of the film is a little off as far as how he rises the ranks and become who he is, his performance is full of emotion and fear and aggression and above all strength. He isn't Rocky and he isn't Stallone but he definitely commands attention. One of the smartest things Creed does is it puts Rocky Balboa secondary to Adonis and it truly does! However, for those of us who are enormous Rocky fans, it is a terrific follow up to his story as well. Best of all, this is Stallone's best performance in decades. I know a lot of people poke fun of him but I think he's an excellent actor and Creed proves that because Rocky is Rocky. He becomes a different person. He carries himself differently, he has a different lingo in his voice, he carries emotion from losing his wife and his best friend and his laid back demeanour. If you watch Stallone become Rocky again...you'll just be floored by his performance. Best of all, he has perfect chemistry with Jordan and they are believable and so good together. Tessa Thompson is...good in her role. I don't want to say anything bad about her because she is good but she is the "must include" romantic interest and she does need to be there but its another thing they have to establish and build and she has her own little back story. I suppose they could expand on her in future instalments but she felt a little "in the way." Phylicia Rashad is perfect (and looks fantastic!) as Mary Anne Creed. The only thing I can say is that I would have loved to have more of her and hopefully she returns for sequels. One thing about the Rocky franchise is they always established the enemy very well. They created a larger than life persona for Rocky to go up against. Creed does that to a lesser extent but nonetheless Tony Bellew is a fantastic nemesis. He is frighteningly huge, they establish his violent temperament and he is great in the ring. Maybe I'm too hooked up the mainstream concept of Rocky and the training montages of yesteryear.This is an example of an enormous fan creating something straight from the heart. Ryan Coogler is now a "one-to-watch" director and for pretty good reason. He definitely has style and vision but most of all...this guy has heart. The Rocky franchise was near and dear to him and something he shared with his Dad and Creed reeks of how much he loves these characters. He lets Rocky shine, he lets Adonis come to life and he makes this an entirely new ballgame. Please, please don't let him go producers! Keep him involved in this newly built Universe. While Creed isn't perfect, it is very nearly...and for what is technically the seventh instalment of a franchise for it to be going back to its roots and truly rebooting properly is a terrific feat. I can't wait to add this to my Stallone collection. This will likely end up on my top ten of 2015 list!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I promise I will not knock you out with a bunch of punnercuts with my review of the latest film installment of the Rocky franchise called "Creed". Yo, I lied. Anyways, "Creed" is a marvelous picture which should round out in my list as one of the top films, if not the top, of 2015. "Creed" stars uprising actor Michael B. Jordan as young boxer Adonis Johnson. Adonis is also the son of Apollo Creed; and I don't have to tell you who Apollo is, unless you are spaced out with the Rocky flicks. Adonis wants to make his own name in boxing so he seeks the training help of the late Apollo's friend &amp; competitor; the one &amp; only Rocky Balboa. Balboa is played by..... really, do I have to tell you who it is? Come on, this is about the eight count of Rocky movies, so we all know it's Sylvester Stallone. Rocky now is an aging Philly restaurant owner who has lost both his wife Adrian and his brother-in-law Paulie. Rocky is first reluctant to train Adonis, but with some soul searching, he changes his mind. Rocky later discovers that he has to put up with another fight, no ring required in this one but it turns out to be his most important fight. "Creed" is proficiently directed by Ryan Coogler. Ryan's hope was not to discredit the Rocky franchise, and his hope came true with his unanimous stellar direction of "Creed". He also put in some inspiring write jabs with fellow scriber Aaron Covington with their heartfelt screenplay of "Creed". Jordan has to be a slam dunk for a Best Actor Oscar nomination with his powerful performance as Adonis. And a Stallone Academy Award nomination playing "Rocky" might just make a comeback to the Oscar ring with what should certainly be a Best Supporting Actor nomination. I also admired the performances of Tessa Thompson as Adonis' love interest and Phylicia Rashad as Creed's adoptive mother. I won't reveal much more of "Creed" because that would give this review a "black eye"; not that it doesn't have a few already. "Creed" is my second favorite of the "Rocky" franchise; still prefer the original by a split decision. So get creedy, and feel the "Creed". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed is the latest worthy entry in Sylvester Stallone's Rocky series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My movie theatre-working friend had wanted to watch this since it premiered two weeks ago so he finally got to see it with me just a couple of hours ago. We both very much liked it-he probably more than me as he was more into the fights as I was just observing the way they were staged and managed to be impressed by them as opposed to cheering like my friend was doing. Michael B. Jordan was impressive as the son of Rocky's late opponent/trainer Apollo Creed shown in flashbacks when played by Carl Weathers. And, yes, Sylvester Stallone is fine as Rocky Balboa-now very much an old man resigned to just running his restaurant and later finding out he's suffering from lymphoma cancer-a disease my friend told me his late father suffered from. As you can tell from that, there are both some exciting fight scenes and good drama abounding in this film. And what's a Rocky movie without some of Bill Conti's score from the original one occasionally playing here? Conti, by the way, was a graduate of LSU which is where both my brother and sister attended with the latter graduating from there. In summary, Creed was a worthy entry in the series created by Stallone.</fullReview>

A love interests with troubles. A once in the life time shot, and a reluctant trainer. Rocky is Micky and Creed is Rocky. The story is about people and personalities. Creed picks up when Stalone is introduced. Stories of ageing the past, and Rocky reaching out for others creates a compelling story. The ending and beginning is just like the original Rocky. The Stalone segment compels new character aspects where Rocky become Micky a former boxer turned trainer! Creed is a strong but no Rocky. Directed well with a good mix of boxing choreioaphy and personal struggles. I give Creed a six, no Rocky but an interesting continuation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky and Apollo's son confront the ghosts in their lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is about coming to terms with your ghosts. We find ourselves by dealing with our past and its formidable shadows. The film itself deals with the shadow of the Rocky series. Adonis Johnson, nee Creed, retraces Rocky Balboa's training methods, fight scenes, ambition and fortuitous championship offer. The huge champion Brit visually recalls Dolph Lundgren's Russian brute Drago in Rocky IV, with the same conversion of the huge audience from hiss to cheer. Creed has the same conclusion the Vietnam War-era first Rocky had: sometimes surviving is more important than winning. America keeps learning that anew.Adonis Johnson doesn't know he's Apollo Creed's son till Apollo's widow comes to take him out of juvenile detention. The kid has the instincts and temper of a fighter, so discovering his father legitimizes him. Mary Ann Creed raises him in her posh Los Angeles home and he grows into a successful finance executive. That career he chucks to follow in his father's footsteps. When he shadow boxes in front of a Youtube fight tape, Adonis slips into Rocky's position to attack his absent father. Adonis takes on his father's brutish profession to find himself, preferring to go by his mother's name Johnson, to make his name on his own. For his big title match Mary Ann sends him Old Glory shorts with Creed on the front waistband and Johnson on the back. In fighting Adonis discovers his identity and defines his relationship to both his parents. Rocky also lives among his ghosts. Wife Adrian exists only as the name of his restaurant and the graveyard site where he goes every day to deposit a rose, talk about his life and read the paper. The young Creed's request he train him revives Rocky's feeling for Apollo and gives him a new life, back at the ring. Rocky initially refuses cancer treatment because it pained and failed Adrian. He feels he has nothing more to live for. But his new protégé revives Rocky's interest in life so they spur each other on to their respective fights. If Rocky's own son fled the Balboa shadow, Apollo's son gives Rocky the successor he never had ? and Adonis the father he never knew.Mary Ann works on a couple of levels of ghost-wrestling. In tracking and adopting her husband's illegitimate son she comes to terms with Apollo's betrayal. She fails to dissuade the gifted boy from pursuing his father's more brutal career ? though if the kid managed hedge funds, that's a debatable point ? but she remains a loving influence on him. On another level, Mary Ann is played by Phylicia Rashad. Her matriarchal screen image began with The Cosby Show, whose father figure has also been redefined by time. This mother redeems the myth of that one.Creed's love interest Bianca provides a variation on that theme: living with the future. She's a rock singer and musician who knows she will lose her hearing. She defines herself by how she handles that ghost of deafness future. She lives her music intensely and prepares for that loss with hearing aids, learning sign language, but mainly by asserting her will and not accepting premature defeat. In her own fight she's going Creed's 12 rounds too and will lose ? but by going the distance, winning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome back Rocky! I have missed you, or at least a 'Rocky' film worth watching. Not since the Italian Stallion's second outing has Rocky Balboa been so believable and authentic. 'Creed' quickly circulated around my eardrums with whispers of an intending release and my first thought was, "oh no, not another one". How far can this story stretch? How much more can Sly honestly show us? It was all becoming a little tiresome as we watched Rocky fumble his way through sequel after diabolical sequel so Stallone could relive past glories and have one more moment in the sun. If there was ever going to be another film in this franchise, Sylvester Stallone was going to have to take a back seat and pass the baton on to someone else so as Rocky could take a fresh direction.'Creed' has demonstrated the importance of allowing others the chance to inject new and innovating ideas into a much loved character. The very impressive Ryan Cooglar is the young Director given the important role of reinvigorating a franchise that had been on life support. He has been wise enough to continue with a simple formulaic story knowing that there is only so much a film like this can achieve. He fits a solid narrative perfectly in its boundaries but with enough room for the story too find an emotion edge and performances from talent that is well above par. Aaron Covington's screenplay provides well balanced dialogue superbly performed by the characters that matter.Michael B. Jordan plays the title role (Creed), Adonis Johnson, who just happens to be the illegitimate son of Rocky's great rival, Apollo Creed. Johnson is a young man that holds a hidden rage and resentment that he can no longer ignore. He is tormented by his famous fathers legacy and seeks out the one man that can train him to fight for the world championship, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Balboa's initial reluctance does not dampen the young Johnson's desire and it isn't long before Rocky is drawn to the son of his great friend. Johnson has the fight of his life become a reality when a deal is made for him to fight the undefeated champion, 'Pretty' Ricky Conlon (Tony Bellew). Adonis is soon humbled by Rocky's untimely illness that threatens to derail any genuine chance that the young challenger might of had.Jordan is the perfect choice as Adonis Johnson. His presence is hard to dislike and gives an easy, natural performance in front of the camera that will see his star quickly rise. Jordan's chemistry with Stallone was always going to make or break the outcome of this film but both actors look comfortable moving around each other as if they had been making movies together for decades. This is Stallone's best performance of his career and just might the tough guy an 'Oscar' for his trouble. Yes it is that good. With a script that demanded a quality showing, Sly gives his heart and soul to a performance that oozed character and filled the cinema with emotion. Rocky looked comfortable taking a step back from the young Adonis confirming that it was the right decision by Stallone to just melt into his signature character without the burden of writing and directing.Tessa Thompson plays Adonis Johnson's love interest, Bianca, and her presence doesn't get in the way of the solid story. Bianca provides a calm voice of reason to a youthful boxer that is boiling under the surface.What we have here is a very good film that can be considered in the same league as the original. With a beautifully shot background of modern day Philadelphia, 'Creed' gives the chance for a new generation to experience the iconic Rocky legend and the motivating themes about rising up to meet the challenge of our greatest rival.....ourselves. Career best performances by Jordan and Stallone adds charm to a film that provides many satisfying moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Creed, back in the Summer, I thought to myself that it was a very impressive trailer and judging by the trailer alone, that the film itself could be fantastic if they did the film right, which judging by the trailers, it looks like they did. This is one case where you had an excellent trailer to a film and the film completely lived up to it's expectations in each and every way. I wouldn't personally consider myself a fan, or very knowledgeable about the Rocky Balboa films. The only film in the series I have seen (up till now) was the original Rocky, which came out in 1976 and won the Oscar for Best Picture for that year. I really enjoyed that film a lot, but I never did seek out any of the sequels until this recent release of Creed. I think one of the reasons I did choose to see Creed, was because it did follow the Rocky films in a sense, but in another way it completely became it's own movie as well. I will explain more as we move along in this review. The film has a gritty and urban setting which the original Rocky did as well and I found it worked well in the original film as does it here as well. It further helps to show the background and environments that the characters come from and what they live and experience on a day to day basis. These are characters who were not handed everything in life, but had to go through difficult times and situations and built themselves out of their environments and the setbacks that they had to deal with to make names for themselves and not only providing themselves with a means of living, but functioning and surviving in a world that proves to be tough even after you have made it. I don't want to give too much away about the characters as not to spoil anything about the film, but I found that giving the film a new perspective and a new hero to follow was a much needed and welcome plot device. Rocky, played here again by Sylvester Stallone, is still here, but this time he takes more of a supporting role and we really get to see Michael B. Jordan, shine here as our new boxer and hero who we root for during the film. Rocky, is still very much an important part to this story and again without giving anything away, we root for Rocky during this film too. Here he plays an older and wiser type of figure who trains and guides along Jordan's character. Stallone here gives what I think personally is the performance of his career. He really downplays the character and plays him very straightforward yet relaxed and the performance feels and plays out so naturally, but there is also a lot of heart, wisdom and backstory to the character that he is fascinating to watch (as is Jordan's character) and yet we love him and respect him for who he is and everything he has accomplished as well. I hope Stallone is nominated for an Oscar for his role here and I would be a very happy man if he even won the award for the performance. It's that subtle yet excellent at the same time. The film's cinematography at times gives it a raw and almost documentary like quality which suits the film well because of the areas of town and the different backgrounds to the characters and the whole urban backdrop to the story which works so well here. This is a film with excellent character study and acting from the entire cast, but it also works well as a sports movie and has intense boxing scenes and yet you are completely drawn into them and rooting for our hero all the same. People say that Mad Max: Fury Road was the comeback series of the year, but I would argue wholeheartedly that Creed, not only reinvents the Rocky films, but it makes one great stand alone film as itself as well. This is the type of film where you root for the characters and end up cheering for them all in the end. Creed has heart, action, entertainment and is one of the most crowd pleasing movies of the year, but also one of the most brilliantly done and I would put it in my top list of best films of the year. A real breakout achievement as a film for Rocky fans and everyone else too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Creed" delivers a knockout punch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is fantastic! I did not expect some of the twists and turns at all...such as Rocky being diagnosed with lymphoma cancer or Paulie dying (on that note, Burt Young, who played Paulie, does not have any screen time). Stallone is always great as Rocky, but Michael B. Jordan really did a great job as Apollo Creed's son, Adonis Johnson-Creed too."Creed" finds Adonis Johnson-Creed, son of the late Apollo Creed, yearning to have the now retired Rocky Balboa act as his trainer for an upcoming boxing match in Liverpool England, where he will face "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, who is a British fighter and current world light heavyweight champion...all of this despite his mother, Mary-Anne (played brilliantly by Phylicia Rashad) advising against this career move (before Adonis was a boxer, he had a job at a local agency, and was even promoted, but quit because the line of work just "wasn't for" him. At first, Rocky is hesitant to agree to Adonis' request, but eventually gives in and even has Adonis move in with him, a place in itself where they train even harder using most, if not all of Rocky's methods and equipment. Beforehand, Adonis meets a singer-songwriter at his apartment named Bianca, who is also his love interest throughout the film. Things with Adonis' training go along as planned, when suddenly, Rocky collapses at the training facility. He is rushed to the hospital and it is revealed that Rocky has a type of lymphoma cancer, that was fortunately caught early enough to the point where it is treatable through chemotherapy. Reluctant to go through with the procedure, Rocky explains to the doctor that his deceased wife, Adrian, had to go through the same procedure and didn't make it. The doctor tells him to at least take the treatment literature and think about it. Adonis ends up stumbling on this literature when he finds it in Rocky's coat pocket and tells him to go through with it before it is too late...telling him that if he (Adonis) can fight, then Rocky can too. Rocky agrees and Adonis even trains beside Rocky as he is in the hospital receiving his chemotherapy. Reluctant to go by the name "Creed" over "Johnson" during his first big match ("Johnson" is his mother's maiden name) Adonis eventually agrees to go by "Creed."Despite his chemotherapy treatment, Rocky presses on with Adonis and they both make it to Liverpool for the big match against Conlan. Before the match, however, Adonis receives a gift from his mother. It is a pair of American flag themed shorts (similar to the design of Rocky and Apollo's boxing shorts) with the names "Creed" and "Johnson" stamped on both sides. It should be noted, however, that Adonis' mother, Mary Anne, actually appears to have more of an estranged relationship with him as, in the beginning of the film, she came across her own son in 1998 when she came back for him after he got into a fight with a couple of minors in juvenile hall. She confessed to him that she was, indeed, his mother and that she was aware that he never actually got to meet or know his father, Apollo, due to the fact that he died before he was actually born. If not a bit nervous, Adonis, otherwise known as "Donnie" Johnson-Creed, steps out onto the ring and goes an incredible 12 rounds with "Pretty" Ricky Conlan. Conlan actually ends up winning the match, but it is Adonis Johnson-Creed who the crowd actually cheers for. After the match, Conlan tells Creed that he is the future of the light heavyweight division. The film ends with a slowed down Rocky Balboa climbing the famous "Rocky" steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art with Adonis. Rocky then jokes that it feels like "they added more steps"...most likely as a nod to his advanced age and his character's chemotherapy treatments. In summary, this film is a great addition to a legendary and well respected series and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the "Rocky" series...and to those that aren't, too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Acted Sports Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A successor to 2006's Rocky Balboa, 'Creed' is A Well-Acted Sports Drama, that works. It's predictable &amp; formulaic, but the superb performances &amp; the drama keeps you engaged, at most times. 'Creed' Synopsis: The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. 'Creed' is basically Rocky with a newer face. This is the beginning of Adonis, with Rocky serving as the legendary mentor. The camaraderie works &amp; so does their comical exchanges. The Boxing Scenes are nicely crafted &amp; leave a solid punch.However, the predictability wears you out. You can guess the entire film from the beginning &amp; hence, there are no surprises here. Also, the emotional manipulation involving Rocky, could've been avoided. Ryan Coogler &amp; Aaron Covington's Screenplay has the spirit of the Rocky series &amp; it engages for the most of it. Only thing, why bog down to predictability all the away? Anyway. Coogler's Directoon is excellent. He's handled the narrative very well. Cinematography &amp; Editing are perfect. Boxing-Scenes are effectively choreographed &amp; executed. Performance-Wise: Stallone is the life and soul of 'Creed'. The legend is in fantastic form, delivering a power-packed performance from start to end. An Oscar might chase him. Michael B. Jordan is top-notch, showing what it takes to be the next big thing. His camaraderie with Stallone is the highpoint of the enterprise. Tessa Thompson is wonderful as the love-interest. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Creed' packs a punch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's not so bad..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freud called it the repetition compulsion and for him it became the major drive, even surpassing the sex drive. It's the reason behind why children enjoy hearing the same tale over and over again , and it's how a story like this, though we know how it's going to evolve, can nonetheless be entertaining. There are no surprises here, but it is very well done which makes the familiar journey all the more enjoyable.Watching the film I am reminded of what a fine actor Sylvester Stallone can be. In the original "Rocky", his performance (and those of his co-stars) were among the best of the later half of the 20th Century. He did it again with his first "Rambo" film, putting in another great performance. As life would have it, they both became franchises, what were unique and compelling characters became caricatures, and in the end we yearned for them to stop because the authenticity was lost in the posturing.The current film does justice to the original, and brings us back to a place where we can contentedly look back and see the cycle come full circle. A great script, fine acting, and a good musical score help make this one to remember. I was a little disappointed in the fighting scenes, which do not do justice to the first 3 Rocky features, but otherwise it's a good film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Creed" is an effective and entertaining passing of the torch for the beloved "Rocky" franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pass the torch. According to thefreedictinoary.com, this oft-used phrase means "relinquish responsibilities, a tradition, practice, or knowledge to another." I can hardly think of a better way to express the significance of the boxing drama "Creed" (PG-13, 2:13). Forty years (almost to the day) from the release of the original "Rocky", Sylvester Stallone appears in his seventh movie as the character of boxer Rocky Balboa. But it's the first time that the character's name doesn't appear in the title, and the first Rocky movie not written by Stallone, although you'd never guess that just by watching it.The film's title comes from the character of Rocky's rival-turned-friend Apollo Creed (played in the first four Rocky movies by Carl Weathers). The title's use of only the last name signifies the symbolic passing of the torch from that character to his son, Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan). Johnson was the name of Adonis' birth mother (now deceased), with whom Apollo had an extra-marital affair shortly before he died in "Rocky IV". Adonis is a Creed by blood and by adoption (having been taken in and raised by Apollo's widow, Mary Anne, played by Phylicia Rash&#x101;d), but when he decides to follow in his father's footsteps, he keeps his mother's name out of a desire to make his own mark in the boxing world.Adonis wants to be known by the name Johnson, but he wants to fight like a Creed. When his adopted mother refuses to support his dream (for fear of him ending up like his father), Adonis moves to Philadelphia to seek out the man who knows the most about his father as a fighter ? the local Philly hero named Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He finds Rocky lonely (having lost his beloved wife and her older brother and Rocky's best friend, Paulie) and still running his restaurant (Adrienne's). Rocky is surprised to meet Apollo's son, but is reluctant to get back into the boxing game. Adonis is determined and starts working out alone, but Rocky soon comes around to the idea of training the young fighter.Getting Adonis ready for actual fights is no easy task. The young man's only experiences in the ring were little more than bar room brawls in Tijuana, Mexico. He won all those fights, but those opponents were not trained fighters and Adonis had no formal training himself. Adonis' trainer can't get into the ring to even spar with Adonis due to Rocky's age and health problems. Then there's the two-sided coin of one of Adonis' fellow apartment house residents, up-and-coming musician, Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Part encouragement and part distraction, Bianca soon comes to play a significant role in Adonis' life.Lastly, the issue of legacy just won't go away. Adonis is both helped and frustrated by his relationship with Rocky (whom he calls "uncle"), while being both haunted and encouraged by the memory of the famous father that he never knew. As Adonis prepares for his first real fight against a well-trained local talent and, later, the English fighter who holds the title (real-life fighters Gabe Rosado and Tony Bellew, respectively), Adonis has to struggle with the idea of using his father's name in order to secure bigger fights and a bigger payday. Meanwhile, as is often the case with teacher-student relationships, Rocky, directly passing the torch to Adonis, learns almost as much from his protégé as the other way around.Apart from the story within the film, we see the real-world torch passing metaphor work as we observe Stallone's role in the franchise that he created noticeably diminishing ? both on screen and behind the scenes. Just as he hands off the main role to rising star Michael B. Jordan, he has handed off writing and directing duties to Ryan Coogler (who Jordan served very well in 2013's "Fruitvale Station"). In less talented hands, this transition could have resulted in the dropping of the torch, but Coogler's updating of Stallone's legacy proves effective and entertaining and should appeal to fans of the original Rocky movies as well as fans of both Coogler and Jordan.Coogler and his co-writer, Aaron Covington (with more than a little help from Stallone's outstanding performance), bring the famous character forward with his personality, his attitudes and even his speech patterns remaining remarkably consistent. Jordan makes an excellent younger-generation boxer and the terrific mix of 1970s and 80s Rocky music with new tunes from modern artists Future, Meek Mill and White Dave effectively bridge the gap between the time-honored and the up-to-date. Although some of the dramatic moments in the film felt soft-pedaled, "Creed" presents a very enjoyable couple of hours in front of the screen and lights the way for a spin-off franchise that may entertain fans of the genre for years to come. Consider the torch passed. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, emotional and uplifting, this 'Rocky' spin off doesn't just bask in the shadow of its predecessors; it stands and triumphs by its own 'Creed'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one expects Sylvester Stallone to step into the ring at this age and deliver a knockout the way he did to his fearsome Russian opponent Ivan Drago in 'Rocky IV' thirty years ago, but rather than make ardent fans endure the possible ignominy of a reboot, 'Creed' finds a way to honour and preserve Stallone's legacy while advancing the series for a new generation of audiences. Though Rocky was thrust into boxing as a means of proving his self- worth, the fundamental conceit of 'Creed' lies in the fact that boxing is in Donnie's blood due to his lineage, which is why after juggling between an office job and black-market prize fights in Tijuana, Donnie decides to quit the former to pursue boxing full- time. That calling brings Donnie from Los Angeles to Philadelphia, where he seeks out his father's one-time fiercest opponent Rocky to be his trainer. This is the first time in close to a decade that we are seeing the Italian stallion (after the sendoff that was 'Rocky Balboa' back in 2006), and the years since have left the former boxing hero alone and weary following the death of his wife Adrian and his best pal Paulie. Yet it isn't any secret that, despite some initial reluctance, Rocky eventually agrees to train Donnie, part out of love for the young man's father and part out of an inextinguishable desire to get back into the game.In the same way, 'Creed' makes no bones about reworking the classic Rocky formula ? like the old Rocky, Donnie is an unproven underdog who finds himself way out of his depth. Indeed, his first live match is with Leo "The Lion" Sporino (played by real-life boxer Gabriel Rosado) ? the #4 ranked light heavyweight in the world, with an impressive 17-0-0 record and 12 wins by knockout ? and his next and last one in the movie is with "Pretty" Ricky Conlan (played by another professional boxer named Anthony Bellew) ? the Lineal Light Heavyweight title holder and undefeated best pound-for-pound boxer in the world, with a record of 36-0-0 and 28 wins by knockout. Right down to the final outcome of the Creed vs Conlan match-up, those who have seen the original will surely recognise some familiar story beats.Even so, Donnie is both a similar as well as a different character from Rocky, the latter of which is beautifully drawn out here in his mental anguish boxing under a nom de guerre versus his father's name, for fear of being called a fraud ? or in the character's own words, "a fake Creed". Donnie's struggle to step out of the shadows of a father that he never knew gives newfound meaning and poignancy to his own classic 'Rocky' moment in front of the mirror, as Rocky tells him to look at his own image which will be the greatest opponent he will ever fight in and out of the ring. Besides the sport, Donnie also finds his bearing with the help of his downstairs neighbour Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a no-nonsense avant-garde musician coping with a degenerative hearing problem that forces her to wear hearing aids. That Donnie gets a love interest isn't so surprising, but his scenes with Bianca are surprisingly affecting, largely because the latter is, in her determination and resolve, very much her own person.True to its title therefore, this is Donnie's story, but that doesn't mean Rocky is no more than a glorified sideshow. Slowly but surely, the film coaxes a moving mentor-mentee relationship between the pair, beginning with Rocky's tough but tender training shown in more than one montage, to their scenes at the dinner table together after Donnie moves in with Rocky, and to the words of encouragement that Rocky speaks to Donnie in between round after punishing round. In particular, that familial bond pays off tremendously with a melodramatic twist midway into the story that makes it as much Donnie's fight from that point on as it is Rocky's. That the relationship between Rocky and Adonis proves so poignant is also in large part due to Michael B. Jordan and Stallone's committed performances. There is equal parts brashness and vulnerability in Jordan's underplaying of the titular character, who during the course of the film comes to terms with his own anger as well as his past. Jordan is nicely complemented by what has to be one of Stallone's most nuanced acting ever, shedding his usual macho image as well as that of the character to play Rocky at his most fragile. No 'Rocky' movie is complete without at least one thrilling fight, and 'Creed' delivers two knockout ones. The first unfolds over the course of one single unbroken take impressively shot by Maryse Alberti (who also shot 'The Wrestler'), with the steadicam circling in and around the boxers who execute their moves and movements with breathtaking precision; and the second, which sees Donnie slip on a familiar pair of star-spangled trunks, is a combination of elegantly choreographed long takes and virtuosic editing, all the way to a rousing finish that manages to weave in Bill Conti's triumphant theme into an already propulsive score from Ludwig Goransson. With such assured and confident direction, it's hard to tell that 'Creed' is only Ryan Coogler's sophomore feature film after the Sundance award-winning favourite 'Fruitvale Station'. It is as promising a transition into big-budget studio filmmaking as can be, not least for the fact that his film is not only compelling in itself but one worthy of standing amidst a rich legacy of six predecessors. As Rocky makes his way up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the closing sequence, there is no doubt that Coogler has deftly bridged the old and the new to create a film that stands not in shadow of its past but one that lives up to its own 'Creed'.</fullReview>

It was inspirational, motivational, thrilling, passionate, and most of all it put a tear in my eyes. The actors are terrific, they made me feel all of they're emotions and burden. A great cast. Sylvester Stallone doesn't know how to age, he nailed this role and he deserves an Oscar for it.I WILL watch this movie again, it proved to be at the top of my list.

		<shortDescription>Ryan Coogler's beautiful love letter to the "Rocky" franchise, as we see the twilight of one star and the rise of another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Coogler shows that the fantastic 'Fruitvale Station' was no fluke with the excellently directed Creed. He captures the original 'Rocky' magic and gives it a modern take by passing the baton to a new generation.In part seven of the "Rocky" franchise, Coogler tells the story of Adonis Creed, the son of Balboa's rival and friend, in his fight to rise from his father's shadow. Rocky returns to the boxing world, but as a mentor to the youngster rather than to fight himself. He's done plenty of it. With already six previous Rocky movies of background story, it is hard to introduce a new character the audience has to care for in the same manner as the esteemed Rocky Balboa. However, Coogler is extremely skilled in taking his time to develop character relationships and making you emotionally invested in their motivations. As he achieved in Fruitvale Station, where you already knows what happens with the main character in the end, but it still hits you like a brick wall.Michael B. Jordan invests himself physically and mentally in the role of Adonis "Donnie" Creed in his excellent second outing with Coogler. He brings the charm and bravado needed to possibly continue this franchise and the passion he brings makes him very likable on screen. His young and brash persona with a shade of Apollo cockiness in the ring is on point in this movie. Tessa Thompson, who plays Jordan's love interest, is also excellent. Coogler successfully writes her as a fleshed out character whose romance with Donnie does not feel rushed. This makes her more than just a plot device and results in great moments where Donnie opens up about his motives. Ultimately, the movie is about Rocky and his legacy, as Sylvester Stallone returns to his iconic role and gives his best performance in 40 years. He knows his character better than anyone and truly goes in depth emotionally in this latest depiction. The corny but well-meant humor is still delivered perfectly, but Stallone is careful in not overacting during the emotional scenes. Here, he shows a Rocky that has fought and lost a lot in his life. He is more subdued and careful with his words, leading to a heartbreaking scene which will most likely land him a well deserved Oscar. What should also be mentioned is the superb camera-work by cinematographer Maryse Alberti, who also did the Wrestler, combined with the excellent fight choreography. It really gives an immersive and realistic feeling all embodied by the jaw-dropping fight halfway into the film. Shot in one single take, it comprised of smooth panning between fighter close-ups, wide shots to observe the thrown punches, and awesome sound effects to make it all an unbelievably satisfying experience.In addition, another underrated aspect is the magnificent score by Ludwig Göransson. It is a great mix between classical instruments joined by loud modern hip hop beats to characterize Adonis. It's all used outstanding to hype up the audience and the sporadic inserts of the famous original soundtrack will definitely give the hardcore Rocky fans goosebumps.Alongside Star Wars: The Force Awakens, this is another seventh installment in a franchise to be revitalized by a fan director. Both achieve a great balance in maintaining the core characteristics of the originals and adding modern aspects to both satisfy old-school fans and attract new ones</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The come-back story that caught everyone off-guard, including the fans...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky saying goodbye to a cheerful crowd in Vegas with Paulie and Robert, and then visiting Adrian's grave with an emotional "Yo Adrian, we did it!" was the perfect ending. And the father- to-son speech provided one of the most inspirational quotes of the 21st Century : "It ain't about how hard you hit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward", and the perfect testimonial quote for Rocky Balboa.So, just when we thought that Sylvester Stallone came full circle with his fetish character, Ryan Coggler, a director not even born when "Rocky IV" came out, pulled him back in the ring. Even the fans, even Sly, were perplex, so imagine those who associate him to mumbling action heroes or the Razzies' eternal punching bag. But I guess "it ain"t over till it's over" and Coggler thought there was more to do with Rocky, and he found a perfect spot to dig into: Apollo Creed, an American icon by himself and not just for the "stars and stripes" short but for his significant part to the Rocky's narrative. So fitting that he'd inspire one of the best of the series? again. The idea of an illegitimate son was very smart: a character totally independent from the previous material yet deeply rooted in it. So the film wasn't (another) sequel, it was a spin-off, a first curiosity-grabbing nuance. And "Creed"'s interest never diminished ever since the talk started. And before Thanksgiving (40 years after the fictional start of the series), something magical happened: the words 'Stallone' and 'Oscar' were mentioned in the same titles, and it wasn't about the 1991 movie, and the 'Awards' referred to hadn't 'Razzie' written before. No one saw that coming. But after the first rave reviews, I was on an edge, nervously following the awards nominations and wins until the Oscar one, a huge victory by itself. And this is a richly deserved nomination, so is the Golden Globe win, definitely not a veteran making his come-back in a year driven by a wave of 70's nostalgia (with "Mad Max: Fury Road" and "Star Wars: The Force Awakens"), this is a rich and heartfelt performance that hits a sensitive chord whether you love the series or not. Even as a fan of Rocky Balboa, I forgot how gentle and sweet he is, beyond the whole underdog appeal. His innocence made him such an enduring and endearing character, sticking to his philosophy of life, no matter how bad the news are, and even the mistakes he makes are forgivable because made out of well-meaning intentions. The one mistake he made was not to stop Apollo during the Drago match, but he respected Apollo's stubbornness. So, when Creed's son insists on having him as a coach, Rocky sees that the boy is hungry. I know I make it sound as if it was a Stallone film (which it is, after all) but the merit goes to Michael B. Jordan who plays Adonis Creed with such confidence that we don't necessarily root for him at the start, he has a sort of cocky arrogance which is the trademark of his father (and the cause of his demise) yet his eyes betray some vulnerability begging to be vented sometime. When he finally lets it out, we understand the pain Creed's illegitimate son went through.This is the irony of living in the shadow of a reputation, same problem for Rocky's son except that Adonis inherited the same gift and passion. His name is both a blessing and a burden, and it's up to him to find the right balance. His goal is honorable: to make a name by himself by earning each cheer without "Creed" playing a part of it, but who's he kidding? Isn't he having Rocky Balboa as a coach? He's a mountain of contradictions, which is the mark of complex and appealing characters. And his partnership with Rocky inevitably reminds of the fatherly friendship between Rocky and Mickey. Coincidentally, Stallone is nominated for playing Mickey's role, and by being nominated a second time for the same character, Stallone joins an 'elite Oscar' club counting such prestigious names as Pacino, Blanchett, Crosby, Newman and O'Toole.Oscar trivia put aside, this proves Rocky doesn't belong to Stallone anymore, his legacy is bigger than that? for 40 years, not a single decade didn't have a "Rocky", it started with the gritty post-Nixon 70's, then the flamboyant Reagan era, the low-key 90's, 2000's and now technological 2010's, with a new generation of actors: Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson. The series has a timeless appeal and always has something to offer, if only, a powerful emotional performance that took everyone off-guard. Whether he wins or loses, Stallone has already gone the distance, embracing, once again, the spirit of his creation. He might have done his share of stinkers, but hey, who can claim to have created a cinematic icon?.As for the film, If not totally flawless, and not deprived from one or two awkward or a little over-stylized moments, the emotionality is intact, And Rocky's spirit is there. And Stallone is as emotional as in "Rocky Balboa'", but in a more restrained and subtle manner, you could tell Sly let himself being directed for the first time, for playing his 'baby' character, and it's truly a new Stallone that shines on screen. Jordan, Thomson and Philycia Rashad, who plays Mary Ann Creed, were so great, I'm looking forward to seeing them in other projects. Should that be "Creed II"? Should they push their luck? Should Sly retire now in a blaze of glory? I sincerely don't know, there are many plot points left unsolved and that can work as a great material for a sequel? but for the moment, let's just appreciate the great achievement "Creed" is, and how it doubled the excitement of the Awards season by including the ultimate underdog actor, Sylvester Stallone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the Rocky series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a little bit for the story to develop, and even Stallone's first scene had me doubting thinking Stallone had lost it. As the movie went on and Stallone became more and more engulfed in his relationship with Adonis the movie grabbed a hold of me.Sly absolutely steals the show in Creed and I will be rooting for him to win the Oscar for best supporting actor. His speeches are so real and heartfelt to me I couldn't help but tear up by watching his performance through the movie. Rocky really portraits the type of person I hope to be in my old age coaching and training the young and talented youth.I give the movie a 9 out of 10 because although Slys performance is a 99 out of 10 the rest of the cast is really just average and pales in comparison to what Stallone left on the table. I do think that Michael B Jordan has a bright future but it is evident he didn't entirely have the life experience to fully take on this role and own it. When Stallone goes full depth into his role the actors in the movie can not go there with him unfortunately. The movie would be even better if Michael could keep up with Stallone on the emotional moments of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I don't think that box movies will get anybody into the theater anymore, like in the 80's, I have to say that this movie did everything right.A mix of Rocky 1 and Rocky 4 with heart and emotions and a good story.I had to swallow deep to not cry and at the end I just wanted to fly to Philadelphia and climb those stairs!The best Rocky movie after Rocky 4 in my opinion.Stallone showed again that he actually can act and I liked all the characters.A solid 10/10 for a Rocky movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect addition to the Rocky legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever we make a purchase we like to get our moneys worth. This is how I judge a film when I got to the theater to view it. At the end as I walk out I ask myself do I feel as though this film lives up to the price of admission. With this film I can definitely say I felt as though I got my moneys worth.Ryan Coogler brings us a masterfully crafted addition to a time honored favorite. Characters were rich and believable. The story was multidimensional, realistic, well thought out, and well executed.This film was everything you would expect from a "Rocky" film.Even if your a new comer to the franchise, this film will definitely make you want to go back and watch the others. Michael Jordan's portrayal of a Creed son was a good fit for his level of acting. Stallone and Jordan relationship on screen was very natural.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We absolutely loved this film!As like Rocky did before him Creed will undoubtedly stand on its own. The film delivered superb cinematography and choreography in the form of one continuous boxing bout.Sylvester Stallone was on true form as a fantastic supporting actor allowing Michael B Jordan to shine through to take the lead. The film delivers a gritty, hard paced drama, yes, in the form of boxing and never lets you down.The boxing gloves have been passed from teacher to student in what we feel is Sylvester Stallone's best performance in years.Can't wait for the next instalment! #film2view rating: 10/10facebook.com/film2view</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly the 2nd Best Rocky film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*mild spoilers only* Just got back from the 60th film I've viewed this year, "Creed". Edited-it into my top 25(#4) just before writing this review.It's hard to ignore the comparisons between "Creed" and "The Force AWakens". Both the 7th film in historic film series. Both returning to their storyline roots, both with gigantic expectations, and both seemingly liked by the masses.I liked THe Force Awakens, but Creed is a superior film. It has the nostalgia without the nostalgia taking away from the individual story. The acting is superb, the boxing scenes amongst the best put to film(Southpaw-7.5 earlier this year also amongst the very best for this).I wouldn't say this is considerably better than Southpaw... it is better, and more importantly, it didn't feel the need to show me every aspect of the story in the trailer.GO see it on the big screen.THe new characters are far better developed than in TFA, and going back to ROcky Balboa, the series was starting to get an edge from the aging Stallone, who's acting chops were really starting to guide this series"Creed" takes that aspect to the next level. Stallone is fantastic. These are characters that we can root for.My only minor complaint is that the film is a little too chopped-up scene-wise in the first 45 minutes, and could have perhaps been served better by slowing down just a bit and dragging some scenes-out. I know it would have lengthened a film that is 2 hrs already, but I think this film would have been perfect at about 2:20, adding just a touch more to some early scenes.The theater was pretty packed, and the crowd seemed VERY pleased with the film. There were a few applause's at the end of the film. There was a louder/bigger applause for TFA, but that's because the 'world of star wars' had disappeared since 1987, and people were happy to have it back, and I saw it on opening night. Plus Star Wars fans are nuts, and even though Creed is a big hit, it will never receive the attention of a film like TFA. Regardless, Creed is CLEARLY the better of the two films, and a notch above the other fine boxing film from 2015, "Southpaw".Stallone is the driving force in this film, but Michael B. Jordan and many of the supporting performances are also strong here. There is a gritty realism to the film. It manages to use the nostalgia without feeling gimmicky. The references and recurrences from earlier ROcky films fit seamlessly into this new fresh story. THe acting and the direction are inspired. Stallone's personal care for this series has shown over the last two films - especially in the more serious scenes. I can't recommend this enough. An absolute shoe-in for the top 10, and possibly the top-5 of 2015. Pure, unadulterated entertainment.84/100 Nipping a 9/10 on the heels. SOmetimes I downgrade films after they soak-in for a while, but that won't be the case here...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A continuation of the Rocky legacy yet a movie that could easily stand alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A continuation of the Rocky legacy yet a movie that could easily stand alone, Creed is excellent, a movie I'd probably put in the top two of the Rocky series. The fight sequences are A-plus, shown largely through tracking shots that puts the audience right in the center of the action, which makes the boxing come off more realistically than ever before in a Rocky film. And while this is essentially a boxing movie, it is more character driven than driven by action, with the three main characters, Adonis, Bianca, and Rocky taking center stage over what is going on in the ring.Michael B. Jordan is terrific as the young Adonis Creed, the illegitimate son of the legendary Apollo Creed, who tries to make a name for himself apart from his famous father. It shows him as a young boy in juvenile lockup, getting into fights with other boys and getting his fair share of bruises, while bruising others. Adonis, it is fair to say, is a born fighter. His downstairs neighbor, Bianca, played by Tessa Thompson, serves as an effective counterpart to Adonis' drive in the ring, as she is trying to make a name for herself as a musician before time runs out. Their willingness to do whatever it takes to do the things that define them also brings them together.Meanwhile, Rocky has tried to live his life largely away from the spotlight, and the ring, since his last fight (in the Rocky Balboa film). But in this movie universe where Rocky is a famous ex-champion, it is hard to stay completely out of the spotlight. And when he decides to train Adonis for the big time, it seems that Adonis cannot escape his famous father. But does he really have to? That this question is explored at all showed that this film did not simply try to cash in on a legacy, but develop it.Not to take anything away from Stallone's achievements in the past movies, but I really feel that one of the strengths of this movie was his ability to cede the center stage to his younger co-stars. It is not all about Rocky anymore, and at this point in his (and Stallone's) career, it shouldn't be. Here, we are given a new character to root for who has his role in the Rocky universe. There are callbacks to previous movies, but even with those callbacks Creed still comes off as fresh.If the Rocky series is about anything, it is about being true to what you are, and for hanging in there, getting back up when life beats you down. In that respect, Creed holds up very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elegant film with humanity, musicality, and a respect for its titular character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you would've told me Ryan Coogler, the director of "Fruitvale Station," would've been to helm the production of "Creed," a "Rocky" spin off that focused on the son of Rocky Balboa's original opponent Apollo Creed, I would've undoubtedly laughed at you. Now here I am writing a review of another Rocky-centered film in 2015 helmed by two of the greatest, yet most unsung talents of the 2010's. "Fruitvale Station" remains one of the most thoughtful and underseen films of this decade, and Coogler and Jordan seem to realize that they will need to throw bigger punches (pun intended) and make more noise in order to get themselves noticed. The result is "Creed," a wonderful throwback to the principles, emotional authenticity, and the layered characters that made the original "Rocky" film so special and so renowned, even to this day.The film revolves around Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate kid of acclaimed fighter Apollo Creed, who died shortly before his father's birth. In and out of foster care for years, and with a few bouts of juvenile detention where he learned to fight, Adonis is finally taken in by Apollo's widow (Phylicia Rash&#x101;d) when Adonis's biological mother winds up dying. Despite her advice, Adonis wants to train to become a fighter like his father, for it's practically all he has known to do his whole life.Living on the cold, unfriendly streets of Philadelphia, Adonis looks towards boxing legend Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) for training tips and pointers as he climbs his way to face "Pretty" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), a talented, but troubled, British light heavyweight champion who has never been knocked down once. A lot of factors play into Adonis's quest for a win, however, including Rocky becoming unexpectedly sick, his alter-ego "Donnie Johnson" being exposed as a cover-up to hide the Creed name, and his infatuation with his neighbor Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a singer who is becoming progressively deaf.Though it's a bit bizarre to make it the primary note of a boxing film, it must be stated how well Coogler and cinematographer Maryse Alberti choreograph the two boxing matches in this film, with the first being the prime cinematic achievement. The first boxing match in "Creed" is conducted in one long take, almost mirroring the kind of coherency and flow of a meticulous dance-number. Pauses and breaks have Coogler's camera rushing over to profile the opposing corners before plunging back into the action accordingly. It is during the boxing scenes that Coogler decides to focus on facial expressions; everything from game faces, to poker faces, to faces with unfathomable injuries when round eight or nine rolls around. The result is a film that flows in its editing (thanks to both Claudia Castello and Michael P. Shawver) with a certain, elegant musicality.Coogler's love for facial expressions is shown throughout the film, however, even during casual scenes, like Adonis and Bianca going on their first date or him and Rocky having a heart-to-heart. Such a focus shows the tender side of Coogler, and in a physically and mentally arduous sport like boxing, human emotions can something get traded for the adrenaline and sheer rush of energy that comes through in the scenes of the actual sport.Thankfully Coogler and Jordan work to make the film deeply predicated off of Creed's person and personality. Both men already took a real-life person who has been shortchanged to the poster-child victim of unnecessary police brutality and showed how every day events in life can shape our personalities in "Fruitvale Station," so it's not particularly surprising to see how the two men made this film with a considerable human angle. Michael B. Jordan gives yet another strong performance, filled with dramatic urgency that has me predicting at least an Oscar nomination for the incredible young star in the next ten years. Perhaps the most surprising performance of the hour, however, comes from the likes of Stallone, who adds a great emotional layer to the story thanks to his natural presence and grace. Stallone comfortably slips back into his Rocky character with ease and a desire to play the character as an aging legend, selflessly helping the son of a rival/friend without a very evident cheeky edge to the material. It's one of Stallone's finest performances in years."Creed" may not be as gritty of as hard to watch as this year's "Southpaw," but it doesn't really need to be. Unlike "Southpaw," which showed the pain-ridden personal side to boxing, "Creed" shows the triumphant side of celebrating a win and training, in addition to the negative side of being dragged down because of something you cannot control - your namesake. During the last fight, I heard emphatic cheers from the audience as if they were watching a UFC fight at the theater and not a Hollywood film. Just like I said about "Southpaw," boxing films are special in the realm of film because, if done right, they almost blur the line of cinema and reality in terms of the way they depict the sport, and often inspire and uproot our richest adrenaline to prompt such heavy reactions. "Creed" deserves its reactions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar material right here!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought that "Creed" would be just a Rocky spin-off, entirely focused on Creed's son, Adonis; or that it would be a "Rocky 5" disaster all over again (with all due respect).However, as a child/adolescent/adult who grew up watching Rocky movies, interpreting them as life lessons - it was a stunning and joyous surprise to realize that "Creed" is far more than a simple spin-off, this is, indeed, a "Rocky 7", this is a true "Rocky's Legacy"! Rocky isn't just that regular secondary/support character, he's actually fighting for his life! And when he almost gave up, Adonis gave him a reason to keep on living. Rocky sees a bit of himself on Adonis, both started with nothing, and both managed to rise to the top!"Rocky Balboa", aka "Rocky 6", was already amazing, since it went back to the original Rocky's roots, with the motto that: "it's not about winning, it's all about going the distance" - but "Creed" managed to go beyond that, at all levels! The acting is outstanding, Stallone is at his prime, Jordan is already a rising star, and the rest of the cast is also great! Ryan Coogler also has his merit, he managed to give the Rocky franchise what it truly deserved - being "Creed" an extremely emotional movie, about friendship, family, perseverance, loyalty, sacrifice, and willpower! I surely hope the Academy gives "Creed" the recognition it deserves!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i got excited when i head about this making movie spin off Rocky Movie based of Creed i love rocky been huge fan of Rocky of all time i love it all time best motivation franchise in history. Creed keeps up story it's spin off but based on another character it's different movie but with story it continues like Rocky 7 but it's not Rocky 7 it's not rocky movie but i was thinking of Rocky Balboa (2007) ended well there's no need for sequel of movie ? i love how movie brings back a lot of memory's in past bringing characters back where are they now in rocky movies on another characters. Michael B. Jordan was great choice of playing creed. it's good they bought back Sylvester Stallone back but in story i never expected to have rocky to have cancer and i expect rocky to be back in ring fighting with someone but i never to expect. Sylvester Stallone was part of movie witch is great to have him in it Plot: since 1998 Adonis "Donnie" Johnson Creed (Michael B Jordan) in prison getting into fights then 10 years later he has gone into heavyweight boxer Champion fighting in Mexico in that scene he won good fight scenes in film. soon he goes to another GYM someone told him he's dad died in ring Apollo Creed in Rocky IV but there was no flashback when Apollo get's killed but there moments about that talked in film. Johnson is bring idiot never think about his dad died on ring when he doesn't have to be like his dad he want's to be like his Dad. but he wants to be Boxer goes all the way Los Angeles track Rocky Balboa find him in restaurant what Rocky Earns talk's about match's and story's in rocky 1 and rest of them about Apollo Creed death. Donnie wants Rocky to train him but Rocky has gone old. he said nah i been threw all that he doesn't want him to get killed but rocky gave him a chance to train him. so rocky made a deal to Donnie to train. to have fight against 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) it's his first movie. creed girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson)was a singer falling in love with Donnie getting long together. half way i didn't like when Rocky is having cancer that's such bad idea it wasn't Stallone idea. Stallone didn't want another rocky movie at all it's the director wanted another one for money. there were moments about rocky son Robert Balboa, moved with his girlfriend in another state never wanted to talk with Rocky i love how story goes it tells events from another rocky movies after Rocky Balboa (2007) followed up Rocky starting to be like Mickey trainer but i crossed my fingers that Rocky Balboa doesn't die in movie in but he doesn't witch is good just let everyone know and training scenes were same as previous rocky movies they were thoughts about the Apollo Creed because it's spin off Creed had good performance in movie since Rocky franchise Sylvester Stallone was a superstar still A good comeback but not best Stallone didn't needed another Rocky Movie but it's good to have 1 Spin Off i was stressed after i saw trailer i thought movie might turned out to be bad. soon everything turned out well, best Rocky franchise 4th rocky noting can beat that movie i love that movie more then any another rocky movies in franchise and this spin off ! 8.10 it's a good movie, the following after rocky balboa (2007), good flashbacks but movie didn't needed to be made no more rocky sequels or creed sequels !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed delivers a solid knockout a great legacy of rocky films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had the pleasure to watch the film at the opening night. The cinema was packed and the film had a lot of hype to live up to. Rocky was an amazing film, and this had to be a solid movie for it to set down with all of the Rocky fans. The movie didn't only live up the hype, but it also deliver a very beautiful KO!!Creed is probably the best boxing movies to have been made in the last 20+ years, Yes, i'm not joking it knockouts all of its competitors in the first round! The story is very compelling and touching. As the audience you become worried and start to cheer for Creed through his struggles and his fights against his own demons, to top it off Stallone's performance as aging and now more human then ever Rocky is just heart melting, and you can not but help to feel so sad and so sorry for him.Acting in the film was great by the entire cast. Stallone had an incredible performance playing Rocky for the seventh time. Probably on par with his performance from the fist Rocky which gave him a nod for the Oscars. Michael B Jordan does an incredible job portraying a young man trying to come to terms with who he really is. All of the cast does a great job!Story: this has to be one of the best Rocky films. The story is very close to original, in terms of being creative and showcasing something new. Adonis is young boxer who felt that he was betrayed by every one, and that he has no family. As young kid he was kicked around foster homes, and ended up in juvenile center until Mary Anne took him in. When he grows up, he wants to prove to the world that he is worthy of his father's name, but doesn't want to use the family name to open all the doors, he calls himself Adonis Johnson. Rocky is now an old and fragile man, who is waiting for Father Time to take him, he no longer has a purpose and you can clearly see it trough Stallone's performance. The two become a real family and give one an other a purpose to live and a purpose to fight again. What else i love about the film, is that how true it was to real boxing. From the line where Rocky says he is to old to do the hand pads, to the main event only happening because of the name and the fall of the other fighter, to the special bout that was put in place with the number 4 seed, and all of the time in between. Creed with its two main fights spread over a 9 month, so around 36 weeks. Southpaw had 5 fights spread over 30-32 weeks. Which one seems like more realistic?There are tons of references to the original Rocky films, which was fantastic to see and hear. To Apollo's older son, to Micky's Gym, Pauli's obsession with dirty magazines, 1 in a million shot to become the champion, the chicken race, the restaurant, the flashback montages, city of Philadelphia and its streets, life quotes by Rocky, rocky theme music remixed for new generation and then the original at the end. going the distance against the champion and losing in a split decision, and probably many more that i can not remember right now.Great film, and great continuation of the Rocky Legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Creed directed by Ryan Coogler is nicely done. Sylvester Stallone as aged Rocky Balboa is excellent. Michael Jordan as Adonis Johnson is pleasant and natural. Johnson's desire to do well in boxing and learn from the best takes him to Rocky. Their evolving relationship is based on respect and Johnson's hunger for father figure. The scenes in hospital are very well directed. Good movie with great acting. Script is natural and has a smooth flow. I enjoyed the 133 minute length movie. Music was good. I am glad Michael Jordan chooses his projects carefully. liked him in the movie Fruitvale station and adored him in Creed. Both movies are directed by Ryan Coogler. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good grief!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky is practically my favorite film, so I felt obliged to buy a ticket soon after Creed's release. The nicest thing I can say about it is that Rocky is still Rocky, and it was nice seeing him again. The fight choreography is also worthy of the series. Additionally, Tessa Thompson adds a little depth as Bianca, and new to the role of Mrs. Creed, Phylicia Rashad of "The Cosby Show" fame is a welcomed presence. That pretty well does it for my positive remarks.Although I personally consider it to be even more overrated than Rocky V is underrated (having always appreciated the latter for many reasons), it would be foolish to dissuade anyone in general from seeing Creed given its sweeping popularity. A popularity that I fail to comprehend. Reading several glowing reviews has done little to illuminate it. The general idea seems to be that Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Johnson is a great character who fascinates and inspires people. I see a conflicted pugilist with none of the pizazz and gift of gab crossed with gravitas that characterized Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed as a Goliath to Rocky Balboa's David. Neither Michael B. Jordan nor Adonis Johnson are the stuff of movie magic in plain English.As I watched Creed, bewildered by its critical acclaim, I could not help but agree with Rocky that he is a dejected remnant of a bygone time. Perfectly understandable, as I derived much more from his stroll through the zoo with Talia Shire's Adrian in Rocky II than from over two hours of this comparatively soulless offering. The original film absorbed me completely with character after character superlatively realized and a palpably gritty atmosphere, whereas Creed did not draw me in much. The Philadelphia location work explains what little atmosphere there is to speak of. Bianca is a fairly interesting character, whose music is integral to her development, so I will leave it at that. Had Rocky been front and center more often, I would likely think more of the film.Insofar as the ring remains a metaphor for the world at large, the indomitable Sylvester Stallone is still punching as a force in the industry. Although I am quite honestly dumbfounded by the degree of praise Creed has received, I am solaced to know that people remain invested in the Rocky Balboa character and that this adds to the staying power of his creator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You gotta hand it to Sylvester Stallone. About fifteen years ago, I figured his career had been left for dead. Somehow with his revision of Rambo, his clout to get studios to make those Expendable movies, and his relentless drive to revitalize an old, punch-drunk boxer, he's gotten into Hollywood's good graces once again. Heck, back in the day I used to quip, "Sly who?"Anyway, unless you've been living on a desert island via the last four decades, you'll know that Creed (my latest review) is indeed the 7th film in the storied, Rocky saga. Everyone in character Rocky Balboa's life, is gone. That includes his spouse Adrian, his brother-in-law Paulie, his trainer Mickey, and his old boxing rival Apollo. But hey, nothing can stop Stallone and company from milking every bit of the Italian Stallion's account till it runs bone dry. That's why he brought in director Ryan Coogler (he did Fruitvale Station) along with his budding movie star, Michael B. Jordan (he was the lead in Fruitvale Station). Translation: This is yet a bland Rocky entry but a mature, valiant effort. It's on par with Rocky Balboa (2006), it's a lot better than Rocky V (I'd hope so), and it has moments that are deeper and more subdued than Rocky IV ("I must break you" ha ha). Somewhere somehow though, I can still hear the late Burgess Meredith saying, "I'm going on a permanent vacation". Rocky being an Irwin Winkler-produced franchise with its obligatory training sequences and its obligatory final fights, should probably just do the same.Containing a film score that feels less compelling this time around (probably because Bill Conti wasn't at the helm) and featuring sound effects inhibiting a hammer slamming into a cookie sheet, Creed delves into Apollo's illegitimate son, Adonis (Michael B. Jordan). Adonis never knew his deceased dad but subconsciously, he always had the need to fight, to punch someone with plenty of lefts and rights. At the beginning of the proceedings, he's a teenager, serving time in a Los Angeles youth facility. When Apollo's actual widow shows up to take him in, Adonis goes with her, finally knowing who his father is and eventually finding out what he wants to do with his life. Cut to 2015 and he's winning fights in Mexico while working at a securities firm on the side. He eventually quits his job, moves to the fighting city of Philadelphia, and seeks out a man who had a long history with his pops. That would be Mr. Rocky Balboa. After some resistance from wanting to train the youthful Adonis, old Rocco caves in knowing that this youngin wants to be the light heavyweight champion of the world. "Baby" Creed in time, wins one big fight and then somehow gets a title shot in Liverpool, England. It's all far-fetched stuff but then again, so is the grizzled adage, "it's only a movie".Now the main asset in Creed, is how its story translates easily from the events in the previous Philadelphia slugger installments. It would make sense that Rocky would now be too old to fight. It would make sense that Rocky still ran a restaurant and was open to training a young buck. It would make sense that Apollo Creed's son would come knocking on Rocky's door salivating for sparring advice. Finally, it would make sense that Rocky would go back to grieve Adrian and Paulie at their respective grave sites (for reasons unknown, the Paulie Pennino character kicks the bucket circa 2012). My biggest misstep involving this flick however, is how the lead troupers (mainly Michael B. Jordan and romantic interest Tessa Thompson) fail to meet the demands of selling Creed's most considerable and most substantial scenes. Basically, they turn it into something that lacks the dramatic heft of the earlier movies and the entertainment value/popcorn feel of Rocky III and Rocky IV. What's left is a slow-burning affair, a vehicle that goes through the motions and renders itself vapid. As the end credits rolled, all I wanted to do was revisit Mr. T's portrayal in 1982, Rocky and Apollo's second Superfight in 1979, and Philly's favorite son hitting the proverbial meat back in 76'. It's all in the (collection addition) DVD set and it comes pretty cheap at Best Buy. My overall rating: 2 and a half stars.Of note: There's been talk about Stallone possibly getting an Academy Award nomination for his work in Creed. I'll admit, he knows the character well and occasionally, has some heartfelt moments. But Oscar? Come on. In all seriousness it seems like a bit of a stretch don't you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 50+ year old guy I'd like to say I enjoyed the plot and writing. But as a 50+ year old guy I'm used to the soundtrack for a Rocky movie containing music that would appeal to all ages. The music quite frankly stunk. It was all hip hop/rap. How about throwing in a song or two for those of us over 40? I found myself suffering through the music at the same time I enjoyed the story and plot. Sylvester Stallone did a really good job. The young man who played Creed was very good as well. The supporting cast was excellent. I'll admit I felt bad when it was discovered that Rocky had cancer and was not going to fight it. Then when he basically told the young Creed that he wasn't family and Creed cried in anger, I actually welled up. Wish there would have been more fight scenes but the fight scenes that were in the movie were done well.</fullReview>

It had many lines, scenes, and plot elements like the first one. But also it was a lot different than the original franchise. It focuses on not only fighting but problems of life. Had really touching moments and action moments. This will likely win an Oscar. I really like how they made this film. Just great production! Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan were awesome in this movie! Really unpredictable and well written out. One of the best stories for a film ever. I suggest a 10+ rating as it is more parental then the other six films. Good for an older family and date night! Definitely a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely go to the movies but went to see this one. 10 out of 10 rating. I can't wait to see it again and can't wait to own the DVD. Seeing the change in Philadelphia since the original Rocky aired was great. The movie made me laugh, cry,feel old and feel excited. Stallone went back to the basics on Creed but also paid tribute to the history of Rocky as well. Having seen the first one as I was just starting out in life, Creed made me think about where I came from and my career. In addition Michael B Jordon does an excellent job as the hungry young fighter on the journey to accept his famous fathers name. He is very believable as a son of Apollo Creed. Great movie to take the family. You won't be disappointed with this one. I hope this movie and its artists are recognized with academy awards. Like · Reply · 5 hrs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed in Great Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director and writer Ryan Coogler's "Creed" is awesome. More than a "sequel" of the "Rocky" movies, Coogler brilliantly reinvents the "Rocky" saga for the hip-hop and cyber versed generation. Coogler with his "Creed" is beholding to heart, love, and the journey of rediscovering our innate greatness?what made the original "Rocky" so special. Michael B. Jordan is powerful and gives a nova-like performance as Adonis ("Donnie), son of the late world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. Coogler and Aaron Covington's screenplay wisely brings back Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, ironically serving as his mentor Mickey (Burgess Meredith) to young upstart Adonis. Stallone embraces the evolution of Rocky?he is amazing. The paradox does not escape us that Rocky's words come from Coogler and Covington, and Stallone generates touching gravitas and vulnerability ? which may earn him a nomination for Supporting Actor. One of the resonant themes is seeded as Adonis finds Rocky back in Philadelphia at his restaurant "Adrianne's" named after his late wife. He wants Rocky to train him as a boxer. Donnie, not yet revealing that he is Apollo's son, asks about his father, "So how did you beat him?" Rocky confesses, "Time takes everybody out. It's undefeated." Rocky is still haunted by Apollo's death in the ring, which he could have stopped. Eventually, Rocky mentors Adonis. "Creed" is an ode to legacy and those we love. In 1998 Mary Anne Creed (strong and compassionate Phylicia Rashad) adopts the troubled teenage Adonis. He is her husband's son from another woman, born after Apollo's death. From orphan bounced from dozens of foster homes, suddenly Adonis is a Creed living in Los Angeles with wealth and privilege. Now 2015, Adonis is fast rising financial manager, who club fights in Tijuana on the side. He is a self taught boxer with punching power and rage. He is a young man asking, "Who am I?" Adonis resigns from his job, and tells his 'Mom" (Rashad) that he wants to become a professional boxer. She tells Adonis how she suffered with Apollo's beating in the ring, and does not want him to follow the same path. Unable to find a gym outside his Mother's influence, Adonis moves to Philadelphia to find his father's best friend to train him?Rocky. Rocky trains Adonis. Rocky has long since left the boxing game. He is all alone. Everyone he loved has passed or moved on. Donnie calls Rocky "Unc", when he eventually means Dad. Adonis finds balance as he falls in love with beautiful musician and singer Bianca (smart and spirited Tessa Thompson), who is also dealing with her own adversity. Jordan displays a gentle and playful side with Thompson. In a funny twist, Bianca outs Adonis for not telling her that his Uncle is Rocky Balboa. As stories collide reigning Light Heavyweight Champion Ricky Conlan (real-life former champion Tony Bellew) has one more fight before serving a prison sentence. His anger costs him a fight with the top contender. Suddenly, he needs to find a legitimate sacrificial opponent. So would that be the son of Apollo Creed? Rocky gets a call and this is all too familiar. Also Adonis and Rocky poignantly deal with mortality. It is life. Time is undefeated. The power of "Creed" sources from the bond and love of Donnie and Rocky. Jordan is authentic in every moment. He is as convincing throwing a left hook or confessing to Rocky what tortures his soul. Stallone is Rocky. He sees the best in people and inspires them to be great. The boxing in "Creed" is amazing. Jordan looks awesome, and he is fighting actual world class boxers on screen. Coogler and cinematographer Maryse Alberti display one shot takes in the ring that are electrifying. Not only do you see the punches, you almost feel them. "Creed" is about legacy and family. As Adonis and Rocky fight for each other we cheer for them and more importantly we cheer for ourselves. Rocky tells Adonis to fight for himself?not anyone else. "Creed" reminds us to discover the power within in one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rocky for a new generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed isn't a modern day remake nor is it a quick Thanksgiving cash grab; it's a Rocky for a new generation. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler with the aid of scribe Aaron Covington, the creative duo, like Adonis, are looking to make a name for themselves, and boy have they ever surprised. Flowing with the hip-hop sounds and urban pride, Creed thrives on contemporary cultural undertones alongside the elderly Italian. The initially dependent Adrian from the first film is replaced by the independent Bianca (Tessa Thomson) opposite to Adonis?sporting a promising music career and intolerance for bullshit. Just as tough, however, is Coogler and Cinematographer Maryse Alberti's grounded rendering of Philly, both in and outside the ring. Lit by the natural flooding of sunlight either in the gym or the street, or intensified with dimly lit tunnels, shots in and leading into the ring are extended for as long as possible. Without a series of cuts, Adonis feels more vulnerable; seeing him walk into the ring, punch, get punched, and punch again all in the same take feels raw and authentic. The accord of Coogler to demand the boxing prowess, focus, and trust of Jordon exudes in these heart-pounding moments.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/11/26/creed-2015-review-indie-adam/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring, Uplifting and Emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed stands on it's own as it's own as a film which should appeal to audiences searching for a new hero. For those familiar with the Rocky series, Creed is a fantastic epilogue that pays homage to previous Rocky films.Creed could have easily capitalized on the Rocky saga by exploiting the Rocky character, some corny sentiment, a weak script and plenty of boxing. However, Creed was masterfully done by telling an emotionally uplifting story of two lonely and broken men with no connection to one another, bound by a legend who died 30 years ago. Following their first interaction, they realize how many more similarities they have and how much they need one another.It goes without saying that Coogler was passionate about this project. He did not cut any corners to tell a great story, the cinematography was stunning (especially the fight scenes) and made great use of the city of Philadelphia. The acting was top notch with Michael B. Jordan, showing his depth, talent and chemistry with Tessa Thompson, who was subtly brilliant in her own right. The casting was superb for the fighters, handlers and managers, who came off as authentic.Kudos to Phylicia Rashad for her supporting role as Apollo's widow. Although her time on screen was limited, she made the most of her scenes. And of course, Sylvester Stallone gave what was probably his best performance in years as a shadow of his former self, living out his final years alone until the younger Creed enters his life.Without giving away any plot points, Creed follows in the footsteps of the original Rocky and reels you in on an emotional and nostalgic journey. It certainly opened itself to tell more story beyond this film so I would not be surprised if Coogler brings Creed back for a sequel or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly as good as the first Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a fantastic film. Deeply emotional, sad, fun, and highly motivating. The cast is just perfect, with Stallone ready for an Oscar nomination. Jordan is as good as Stallone, with an impressive physique and great acting skills. Creed does the Rocky universe justice, and that itself is an victory. Ryan Coogler shows that he may be one of the best directors to come. Another highlight is the score, which fits perfectly in nearly every scene. After Rocky Balboa, most fans (me included) thought Stallone found the perfect end for the saga. But after watching Creed, I have to say that this film is another highlight in Rocky-Land. A Must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Well Made Next Generation Spin-Off Sequel to the Rocky Franchise!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine years ago, I thought 'Rocky Balboa' was the final film in the series, but it turns out there was a lot more story to tell. This spin- off and 7th film was very well directed, acted, and will definitely hit you in 'the feels' if you're a huge fan of the Rocky series. I man enough to admit that I was in tears the last 30 minutes of the movie. Rocky's character is pretty depressing in this film. Not only is Adrian dead, but Paulie has passed on, too. But first we must talk about Apollo Creed's extramarital son, Adonis (Donny)Donny Johnson has lived a tough life. He never knew his dad. He loves to fight, but doesn't want to be associated with the 'Creed' name. Michael B. Jordan will definitely make a name for himself with this movie. No one will train him, so he moves to Philadelphia in hopes of meeting Rocky Balboa, the man who fought his dad in the original two films. Rocky is very reluctant to train Donny because he's out of the game, and doesn't believe that Donny is really Apollo's son. Soon enough, Rocky gives in and decides to train him. Donny wants Rocky to keep it secret about who his dad is. Along the way, Donny meets a beautiful lounge singer named Bianca, who is slowly losing her hearing. When a British fighter named "Pretty" Ricky Conlan hears about Donny being the son of the late Apollo Creed, he wants to fight him. The tears will begin to flow when we find out that Rocky is sick, and doesn't want treatment. Donny inspires him to fight on and live because Donny and Rocky have an immediate bond that's probably one of the most heartwarming in the whole series because Donny and Bianca give Rocky a new reason to try and keep living. There are major nods, throwbacks and flashbacks to the previous Rocky movies. The main fight is awesome, powerful and will definitely bring out some nostalgia during the final round. This movie is definitely an experience and a beautiful tribute to the Rocky series and will hopefully start something new. I highly recommend CREED!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1st Round Knock Out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a month ago a friend called me from L.A. sobbing and slobbering like a baby. Once I got him calmed down, I asked him, "What's the hell was going on?" He said, "If you are wondering if J.J. Abrams did it, he did!" For those of you not in the know. J.J Abrams is famous for being the creator of Alias, Lost, 8MM, The Star Trek reboot and most recently The Force Awakens. Due to his Screen Actors Guild affiliation, my friend was able to see an advanced screening of the film. He told me for the 1st time in his life, he felt like a kid again. Although I couldn't really identify with the statement, I believed I knew what he was saying and where he was going and eagerly awaited seeing the film.I experienced this first had today. No, I haven't seen The Force Awakens, but I did see Creed. It amazed me how many people I talked to over the past few months were unaware of this reinvention of the Rocky franchise. No question the series came off the tracks after Rockey IV, The War. However, this is the first movie in the series to not be written by Sylvester Stallone and although you know the character, you don't know the man, at least not yet. By the third act, I found myself crying uncontrollably; literally vision blurry from the emotional flood. The story was stirring and flawless, the drama, conflict and tone were far beyond real. This isn't the Rocky, or the struggle you remember. I challenge you to see this film and not be moved and that goes for men or women and franchise fans or not.Imagine Michael Keaton in the Batman Begins role. That's what this film did. They took a familiar face and name and moved it into a rough rugged and raw, realistic world. This is the second film from Oakland native Ryan Coogler. His first film Fruitvale Station was a sobering tales based on an actual event that produced L.A. Riot destruction in the Bay Area. This up and coming writer and director is Oakland born and raised and his urban city upbringing casts a light on the film that makes you understand the journey in a way that pulls at your heart.Visually the film is staggering, light, texture and motion all draw you in. Ironically the fight music from the Rocky franchise is called, "Alone in the Ring" at least twice I was drawn into this film deeply that I would have swore I was in Creed's corner if not in the ring myself. The soundtrack, although rap will motivate you. The lyrics may escape you, but the beats and fluidity and actually match the pace of your film and much like the thump of "We Will Rock You" your pulse and breathing will start to match the pace of the film. The acting is so strong, you won't miss "Yo Adrian" and you will remember that Stallone is an Academy Award Winner and that much of Hollywood thought that the director and star of this film should have got Oscars for their collaboration on Fruitvale Station.By the movies end I was on such a euphoric state that I was fully prepared to leave my car and the theater and do a little road work and run home. Now, I wasn't alone, so leaving my car wasn't an option and certainly a block into this legendary run I would have realized that I'm a heavyweight in size alone and no longer a competitive athlete out of breath, would have walked back to my car with a Slurpee and fast food burger in hand.Now, how often will a grown man admit to crying when it has nothing to do with the size of Kim K's ass. I can tell you this, fella's. There is The Godfather, Scarface and Creed. The movie is just that Gangsta.I fully expect a nomination and win for this film. It's hands down top 10 in my book and the 1st movie to make me cry since E.T. re-boarded the mothership. Both this film and Straight out of Compton are strong arguments for Black Cinema and although race is not the issue here, we all have a story to tell and if it's only told from one perspective, you are missing out on details that may shape your belief, but then again, that might be "The Mans" fear.I am moved, my soul is refreshed and I'm rejuvenated by the notion that great storytelling still exists. Rocky was the original story of the underdog, and this retelling of his tale is overdue.A bit of trivia, the original Rocky was released 40 years ago to the date of this release and Sylvester Stallone is the same age as Burgess Meredith at the time of that release. Full Circle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A passing of the baton from Balboa to Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a film that from the trailers can be looked at as a continuation of the Rocky franchise, but it is actually more of a 'Rebirth' for the franchise and a passing of the baton in a way. My experience with the Rocky franchise is limited to half of the first film and bits and pieces of iconic moments and characters, but missing out on the previous Rocky films will not harm your experience with this film. This is definitely not a 'Rocky movie', it definitely stands on its own and the main focus of the film is Adonis Creed. Of course, being in the same universe and featuring the series' main protagonist does lead to many callbacks to the other Rocky films. Now i didn't know the significance of every reference, but i knew enough to know when they were referring to a past event. But these callbacks (apart from the obvious) are not crucial to the plot and really are just there for die hard fans of the series. The main focus of this film was the journey of Adonis Creed and his rise to hopefully live up to the legacy set by his father with help from Rocky Balboa himself. The story, this journey was incredible to see. There were not too many BIG moments in the film but it really didn't need any because this whole film was a progressive sequence of events that were building up intensity to a big finale. There were many intense training montages and very interesting and emotional storytelling sequences that all tie together the events of the film really really well. There was never a dull moment in its 2 hour runtime and i was glued to the screen and really interested in Adonis' story. He is a very strong minded, likable and determined character who you really get behind and want him to succeed in every way. Michael B Jordan definitely redeemed himself for that Fant4stic disaster that wasn't necessarily his fault, but at least it can't be held against him now. He embodied the role and you really bought his character, wasn't over the top in any way and played a very grounded, realistic character. He conveyed emotion and determination very well and managed to eclipse the presence of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa at times. Having Rocky Balboa in the film and being a mentor and coach for Adonis was a really great aspect of the film that worked in every way. This could have easily been a very forced element where they just threw Rocky in a few scenes occasionally to make sure people know "Hey come see this film because...... Rocky". But he really was an integral part of the film and contributed to the plot, bought a slight tad of humour to lighten the mood occasionally and also really emphasis the emotional weight of some of the films key moments. Sylvester Stallone was great in the role, i can't speak for whether it compares to the other Rocky films but you could see that he was a very experienced boxer who has definitely been through a lot in his life. If anything, this film made me WANT to go and see the other Rocky films because even seeing him at this stage in his life was fascinating and i wanted to know more about the character. But despite the big name and the fact that he is so loved by film fans, he did play second fiddle to Michael B Jordan, and i don't think anyone should be mad about that. There was also one incredible moment in the film that was made even more amazing by the camera-work in this scene. There was a fight that was filmed so amazingly i was mesmerised and totally sucked into the scene. The entire fight was filmed with one continuous tracking shot that takes you all around the ring and made you feel like you were literally in the ring with these fighter, truly incredible film work right there. In the end, this was an incredible Boxing film, one of the best if not the best that i have ever seen that if you are a fan of the genre you should definitely see. Fans of the Rocky franchise will love this film for it's callbacks to the other films but as it is a passing of the baton per se, even if you are unfamiliar with the previous films it doesn't lessen the amazing experience you will have with this film. - 9.1</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks ass, I don't get the praise and the hype for this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed (2015) for me personally sucks! I am really disappointed with this film! It is not a good film, not a Rocky film. For my opinion this film ruined Rocky nostalgia films for me. After watching Creed I login to make a review for this film, I hate this film. I would rather watch Rocky Balboa, Rocky I, Rocky IV, Southpaw, Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood, Grudge Match Rocky II, III and even V as a time waster, those movies are far way better films for me. Southpaw kills Creed for me! I don't get the hype and praise for this movie! What is so good about this film that Rocky sequels are so bad to this movie? I did not see the point in Creed at all. I haven't hear any inspired speech in the entire film at all. I don't like Stallone in this movie I think this is the worst performance of his as Rocky Balboa. He doesn't do anything trough whole film except winning Paulie is dead, Adrian is dead. Why was a clip in this movie from Rocky II and not Rocky I? is beyond me. They disgraced Apollo's name by saying that he had an affair with other woman, and he cheated his wife, why? Trough entire Rocky films I never hear or saw that. The third fight Rocky reveals that Apollo won why? please why? I always though Rocky and Apollo are tied not that Apollo won the third fight! The training sequences where absolutely terrible for me. Why did Stallone won an Oscar for his performance as Rocky Balboa and critics are pressing him by saying this is his best performance?! Really? What about Rocky Balboa (2006)? "It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!" I love Rocky Balboa and Stallone wrote 10 years ago and directed the sixth Rocky film and he did not won anything, but suddenly he has nothing to do with another Rocky film and get's an Oscar for it?! Why? That is wrong!!!! I love Rocky Balboa and in my opinion Rocky Balboa ended perfectly the nostalgia franchise and Creed did not do that, it ruined it! This film is about some rich guy who has a nice life and a beautiful job, gets a promotion and he quits to become a boxer, than he goes to Philadelphia to find Rocky Balboa and fight professional wow that sound's awesome not! This film is awful. Southpaw is MILES way better film than Creed is, it is about a guy a champion who loses everything after his wife's death, his title, his respect, his daughter and his wealth everything. Than he goes back to the roots and he fights to get everything in life he once had including his daughter back, he has to fight in a court and in ring with his toughest opponent to gain respect, I love that movie. I haven't seen anything in Creed like that.Rocky has a cancer now, wow, Adrian is dead and Paulie for some reason is dead now! Robert doesn't have anything to do with Rocky anymore. Where is Marie she isn't in this film at all! Where is Duke in this movie? He isn't even mentioned at all. Creed is far worst to me than Rocky V, at least in Rocky V you have Adrian, Paulie, Duke and Robert alive in it, in here you have absolutely nothing. The problem with this movie was also with Adonis Creed character (to not mention his girlfriend), I simply couldn't relate and care for him in any way, I feel that Jordan was a miscast for that role, his acting felt very forced and weak IMO. I think as well that this was a rather unnecessary revival of the series which ruined the established. Creed's girlfriend in this film was terrible why did Creed even had a girlfriend in this movie? If he wouldn't had any girlfriend here, he would get my respect. What happened to Danny "Stuntman" Wheeler (Andre Ward)? He knocked Adonis in L.A. and he only had two scenes in the film and that it was all. This movie is too long it is over hyped, mediocre and boring love drama film! Michael B. Jordan? I like the actor...but for me? He was One Note. I'm sorry, I just don't see what people saw in it. The fights? Done well Technically...but I felt Nothing. I felt no Heart, I felt no Passion, I felt no Energy, and I felt no Adrenaline.Rocky Balboa (2006) is MILES much way better movie, better story, better music. I don't need to see this I have Rocky Balboa. So my bottom of line is you can have Creed I will take Rocky Balboa. You can have Creed there you go that is fine, I will take Rocky Balboa anytime. " It Ain't Over 'til It's Over. Where's that from, the 80's? That's probably the 70's."F 1 out 10 for the worst sport boxing movie and Stallone isn't that good, honestly? I would even rather watch The Expendables 3 I saw twice that movie and at least I like something in that movie, I did not like nothing in here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below average movie that was basically a remake of "Rocky"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if it's just me being out of touch, but I don't get any of the hype about this movie. All of the acting is average, including Stallone's: It should almost be embarrassing to Hollywood that he is up for an Oscar for a supporting role. But truthfully, the bottom line is that this is a complete remake of the the original Rocky movie... I'm old enough to remember the original, and this adds nothing new to the plot or overall storyline. Actually, it's sad that this is even nominated for anything. This should have been released as a B, made- for-TV flick. Stallone's "Over the Top" was 10 times better than this. (And that isn't saying much, except for the fact that it is still aired on cable a few times a year, whereas you will likely never see this movie on cable on a Saturday afternoon in 5 years, because it is that bad.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rebirth of a franchise with a huge dose of nostalgia !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Creed' is directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler and it stars, Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson. It tells the story of Adonis Johnson who never knew his father Apollo Creed. But he loves boxing and he seeks out Rocky Balboa to train him to become a top notch professional.Although there is a theme running through the film about Adonis trying to initially run away from all connections with Apollo Creed to create his own identity but then identifying who he is and owning the name Creed later on, however the film apart from being a rebirth is also a big homage to the Rocky franchise. This movie depends on nostalgia and subtle references to the original series. The screenplay based on a story idea by Coogler is to be honest an updated and adjusted version of familiar elements of the films in the entire Rocky franchise especially the first Rocky film.So the script isn't something that hooked me as it really is a mash- up of familiar elements. But what did really impress me is Coogler's direction and the acting on show. Coogler adds his style of independent filmmaking to the scenes. He really allows the actors to express themselves. There is a great amount of gravitas and humanity that is added to every scene. We end up caring for the characters big time. This is a film that could have easily been cheesy and Coogler's endearing direction prevents that from happening. Apart from the emotional aspect, Coogler shows great craftsmanship too especially in a fight scene where the entire boxing fight in the ring gets captured in one uninterrupted single take which was bloody impressive. Michael B. Jordan is very good as Adonis. He brilliantly expresses the repressed inner struggle to prove himself in his own eyes and kill his inner demons. He also sells the boxing very well physically. But the standout performance in the film comes from Sylvester Stallone. He is surprisingly nuanced and I would go so far as to say that this might be my favourite Stallone performance ever. I have never seen him be this realistic and understated in anything ever before. His sheer charm and likability to some extent elevates the film to the next level.So the film as a whole didn't give me anything that I didn't expect from the point of view of the script. But Coogler's command behind the camera, his emotional storytelling and the acting from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone made this a very enjoyable film.P.S. - I always knew Stallone was an Everton fan as I had seen him attend one of their matches at Goodison Park. But I didn't know his love for Everton was so huge. There are whole chunks of this film where you see nothing but the blue of Everton and clearly this was Stallone's idea, not Coogler's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky 7: Not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Creed ladies and gentlemen. This is not Rocky 7! And you want to know why? because, even though Rocky Balboa is in the movie, even though he is somehow connected to boxing, for the first time, common sense has struck him, and he finally has decided to hang up his gloves for good. That's right, you will not see Rocky fighting anyone! Thanks God!So I will go as far as to say that Creed deserves credit on its own, but as a sequel of the sequel of the sequel?, it is to me the best since Rocky 2. Clearly!! Some elements will remind of the original Rocky, and the movie still feels down to earth enough and believable, so if they decide to make a Creed 2 or Rocky 8, I will go watch it. Damn right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed isn't Balboa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't bring anything new. Again (and again) it's a cool movie that keeps the Stallion fans entertained. The cast has good performances, but no one get closer to reach the star of Stallone, who mixed his life with the character in a way that sometimes when I see Stallone I think that Balboa is playing him. So, there's no way you wouldn't be convinced that Balboa is really a boxer, with all that oldness could bring to him. The soundtrack is good, specially Creed's theme. There is some electronic music too, that when you bring together with the visual effects when the fighters are presented to us, and the use of electronics throw the history, seems like the Balboa fans aren't enough. Looks that they want some new guys to see Creed 2, or even 7. Well I don't think that Creed could be compared to Balboa, but, who knows?</fullReview>

I mean, with the latest story about Creed's son is really interesting, but the directing and acting didn't quit satisfy me as an fan.Story was good, but Stallone could act a little bit much, some scenes were stretched out, some rushed, even if movie lasted over 2 hours, it would still won't be that good, because some scenes were unnecessary, even boring, even camera shots were kinda rookie mistakes.But you try as you live, so Stallone had to continue his Rocky story.

		<fullReview>First of all some honest talk. Hollywood loves to make sequels. Rocky series were great and inspirational especially rocky 3 and 4. The grit, determination,the angst and the perspiration were all depicted too well.Then came rocky 5 and 6 which were a pale shadow of its predecessors. Though this movie does not bear the original movie title, it is but a natural extension of the saga. Creed ( Adonis Creed ) played by Micheal B. Jordan, the son of former heavy weight champion Apollo Creed is determined to make his mark as pugilist on his own and just not as a creed.He requests Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) to be his mentor and trainer .He goes on to fight the reigning world champion mean and vicious "Pretty" Ricky Conlan ( Tony Bellew) to prove his existence was and is no mistake.He does this and in style winning accolades and the hearts of the people and quite predictably not the match. Beyond the determination of the champ, the sweat and the intense training , the movie is downright predictable. Thrown in the drama is the parallel fight of Balboa against cancer,a rather lackluster chemistry between him and the other interest in creed's life Bianca(Teesa Thompson). Together the smörg?sbord works okay . Ageing Stallone (Balboa) plays his part very well and is as good as it gets. He plays his part as creed's trainer really well.He is subdued,caring as for his age, gentle and tough at the same time. The final fight is well shown ensuring a steady secretion of adrenaline. The movie does have its moment when creed badly bruised and with one swollen eye and near blurred vision still manages to stay on in the ring with some clever finger tapping hint on the nape of his neck from balboa. All in all a very predictable sport saga that just manages to hold on.You seen them once, you know them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A great Spin-off to the Rocky saga"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when i go to see Rocky Balboa a tough that was a great way to ending the series of movies,Rocky still have the punch and the people still love him (one of the best endings of the series) so i think "this is it".When i see the trailer of Creed i was surprise because this time is about Creed son's and not of rocky.Even that he already was a trainer before (remember Rocky V?) this time is different because is the best friend son who training so you can see the passion and magic of this.Stallone is same Rocky...Now i know the big question here:He deserves the Oscar for this movie? Yes and No.The acting is the same (I think he was better in Rocky Balboa) but if you take a count all saga movies of Rocky of course he deserves...But not for acting in this movie.The one who steal the movie is of course B.Jordan you can really feel that he is Creed son!!! and the direction are more that great.This movie in many ways a "homenage" to Rokcy saga and believe me if you are Rocky saga fan you won't be disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great boxing film though not a patch on Southpaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally got time to see this film and I'd heard some very positive things about it so expectations were reasonably high. Another outing for the Rocky franchise, this films fits in the sequence well and is certainly a worthwhile addition to the series. That said, it's most definitely a film that stands on it's so there's no need to have watched the previous films.The storyline holds few surprises, based on the son of Apollo Creed trying to make his own name in the world of boxing. The lead actor, Michael B Jordan, is surprisingly good in his role, despite a sometimes poor script. However the real star is Sylvester Stallone, the moment he arrives on screen (in possibly the single best scene of the film) it takes on a whole new feel, one that is familiar and comfortable. He simply does his thing and you can't help but love him for it.For me though it wasn't a patch on one of my favourite films of 2015, Southpaw, in either style, substance, soundtrack or the sheer grittiness of a boxing film. It was certainly worth seeing, if only for the superb performance by Stallone, but not one that I'd rush to re-watch anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky is a legend Adonis is a legend in the makingBeing a financially successful person with a great job is something nice but Adonis wants to be a boxer so he goes from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. He gets mistreated all because of his last name being one of the biggest boxers. Nobody wants to train him until he finally convinces Rocky to do the job. He also forms a romantic relationship with Bianca, his neighbor. After the first win he is challenged by the champ for a one on one match. Rocky only accepts to continue training with Adonis while fighting cancer because it reminds him of what his past is and Adonis' future can be.The cast really works well and especially Jordan as Adonis but the true performer is Stallone with his ability to perform well in a supporting character. The editing is solid with modern and new music adding to what time the movie takes place. Hey, I may prefer the first Rocky film but Creed is a great conclusion and hopefully nothing else follows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky Balboa as a trainer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Creed" is a Drama movie in which we watch Rocky Balboa training the son of his old friend and former rival Apollo Creed. The former World Heavyweight Champion now has a different role as a trainer and he understands that this is also a difficult task for him.I have to admit that liked this movie a lot because of the plot which I found very interesting and a repetition of all the previous Rocky. This movie combines very well drama with sport and also the connection with the previous movies and the story of Rocky Balboa is equally good. At this point it has to be mentioned that the interpretation of Sylvester Stallone in this movie was outstanding. Michael B. Jordan made also a good interpretation but not something extraordinary.Finally I believe that "Creed" is a very good movie to watch and I really recommend it to everyone. I believe that in this movie Sylvester Stallone remind me his first interpretations in the first movies of Rocky where everything started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gonna fly now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Airplane II foresaw the cycle of Rocky films by having a poster of an aged Rocky in Rocky 38. Stallone himself run out of ideas as to what to do with Rocky by 1990 with the decidedly average Rocky V and ramped up the nostalgia for Rocky Balboa which owed more to boxers like George Foreman making comebacks as veterans.It took co-writer and director Ryan Coogler to come up and angle to continue the franchise, pushing Rocky to a supporting player and concentrating on Adonis Johnson (Michael B Johnson) the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed rescued from a succession of care homes by Apollo's widow. Despite an affluent lifestyle, Adonis is an angry young man, someone who feels like an outsider and needs to prove himself. Adonis takes up in the underground boxing scene in Mexico however unable to fight in the west coast he makes his way to Philadelphia to persuade Rocky to train him.The plot is basically a mixture of Rocky &amp; Rocky II. A British World light heavyweight champion who is due to be stripped of his titles and serve time inside sees an opportunity to set up a lucrative fight with an unknown boxer who also happens to be trained by Rocky Balboa and is the son of Apollo Creed thereby mirroring the situation when Apollo plucked an unknown opponent to fight for the world title in the original Rocky.In Philadelphia Rocky and Adonis bond, they get closer as Rocky is struck down by illness and Adonis helps him thought it although Rocky is initially weary of his help.Coogler goes for a modern urban Philadelphia setting of dinghy gyms, dirt bikes and a multi racial city reflected in the music throughout the film. What Coogler gets right is the beat of the film which rang true in the original. Rocky is again lonely, visiting the grave of his wife and also his brother in law. The restaurant is all he has and Adonis drags him back to the boxing world albeit reluctantly. In essence he is now playing the Mickey role, the grouch, wise old trainer.The main fight bizarrely takes place at Goodison Park, home of the soccer club Everton in Liverpool. Will we hear the Rocky theme? Will Gonna Fly Now soar? You bet.What Ryan Coogler has done is refresh the ingredients, Rocky Balboa is a character that will live on outside of Sylvester Stallone, in future generations re-booted and re-invigorated.Stallone playing the character for the seventh time but for the first time as written by someone else imbues Rocky with inner calm. Here is a character that has become tired of life and sees a chance to become alive again by training Adonis until fate intervenes with a cruel twist.Michael Jordan bounces back from the Fantastic 4 flop by giving a spirited performance that is also tender and heartfelt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone deserves an Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can say with all seriousness that Sylvester Stallone deserves his Oscar, and I didn't believe that the original and rather obvious "Rocky" deserved Best Picture Oscar, so I'm not some fan blind to the weaknesses of the series . He was excellent in that film. While some can argue that the Oscar would be a reward for the entirety of the Rocky franchise, I think that Stallone's performance in Creed stands on its own and is wholly deserving of any accolades he receives. His performance of an aging Rocky Balboa coming to terms with his own mortality (and the mortality of his loved ones, like Pauly and Adrian) and dealing with the effects of aging and the realization that he cannot partake in the rigorous boxing world anymore is very heartbreaking and compelling. Without providing any spoilers, the scene in which Adonis Creed and Rocky return to the famous steps from the first Rocky is a very poignant scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky Fans won't be Disappointed,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. For being the seventh Rocky film, it manages to feel very fresh, it stands out as an original piece of work that is quite different from the other six, here we follow Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son, getting training from Rocky to become as good a fighter as his father was. The relationship between Donny and Rocky was beautiful, serving as a father figure to him, the conflict and frustrations that they cope with throughout make us support them even more, making the big fight at the end the most intense of any Rocky film, it had me at the edge of my seat. The only issue I had was that it didn't focus on Balboa enough, I was fine with Creed's son being the lead role and Stallone is still very important, but I would have liked to see more scenes with him on his own, such as when he visits his family members grave, moments like that which reflect on the previous films. The cast is terrific and is the main reason this worked out so well, Michael B. Jordan shines in the lead role, he certainly had some big shoes to fill and he does so with pure class. As for Sylvester Stallone, I would consider this to be the greatest performance of his career, he's emotional and more vulnerable than he ever was before, it's clear that he is so used to playing this character that he feels like another version of himself doing it, and that's why he's able to react to other actors so naturally, he deserves any award he gets for this film. Intense, dramatic, well acted and simply breathtaking, Creed may very well be my favourite of the entire Rocky franchise, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. Rocky Balboa begins training the son of his close friend and former rival Apollo Creed, who shows as much dedication as his father once did.Best Performance: Sylvester Stallone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie. Loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a remake of Rocky, as some people are saying. It does use the same basic plot most sport movies use but, through the use of some bold directional techniques and some of the bravest acting and script choices i've seen this side of the inspirational sports movie genre, it manages to make it's own fresh thing.Michael B. Jordan excels in the part of Creed, the illegitimate son of Boxing legend Apollo Creed, and his interaction with the Never this Great Before Stallone as Rocky, provide the film with much needed gravitas and genuine emotion. The profound respect the character of Adonis feels for Rocky the character, it's clearly the same respect the filmmakers who brought this project to Stallone feel for the actor, the character, the films and the real world legacy of the Rocky franchise; this is the way you make a sequel to a franchise that seemingly needs no more sequels and the producers of all those recent films that try to hack their way into a paycheck, by taking advantage of our nostalgia should take note: do it right or don't do it at all.While the story follows the same beats as the Rocky films, it does it in it's own unique way, taking advantage of Adonis' clear young age and inexperience in all things life to give us a different take on the underground stereotype we all know and, yeah, love.While Rocky in the first film was a burnout bum with a heart so big he couldn't cut it as an enforcer for loan sharks, Adonis here is a cocky kid who knows what he wants, what he's worth, what he's capable of and has a swagger and confidence that masks all of the fear and hurt he also feels, not that deep inside him.Oh, yeah... the boxing scenes... man, the boxing scenes, whether they're one take or heavily and expertly edited, are a thrill to watch. The ones here really are the best in the franchise.Creed (the film and the character), is a great and deserving heir to the Rocky legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this latest instalment Adonis Johnson, illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, seeks out the services of Rocky Balboa as his trainer.The result is a tale full of heart, resuscitating the franchise only just before it was counted out. Michael Jordan is excellent as Adonis Johnson, giving believability to a character trying to find out who he is and struggling with the shadow cast by a legendary father he never knew. The film, however, belongs to Stallone who probably finds nuances and depths he has never plumbed before. It's a supporting role, supposedly, but he is the heart of a movie full of heart and he richly deserves his academy award nomination.The climactic boxing match is, of course, way beyond anything humanly possible. Put that to one side and try to enjoy the drama as it unfolds, and you'll enjoy the experience. You'll also care about the characters, which is something far too many film makers don't consider these days. Treat yourself - go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the rocky films and now I have finally had the chance to see creed and I loved it. The premise of the film sees adonis johnson the illegitimate son of apollo creed try to get rocky balboa to try and train him to be a fighter like his father. Michael b jordan plays adonis and he does an excellent job in this film. He sold the physicality of the role but also made donnie a really likable character that you wanted to root for. But the biggest surprise in this film has to be the amazing return by Sylvester stallone as rocky balboa. He is awesome in this film and his chemistry with jordan is off the charts good. Vanessa thompson was really good as donnies love interest Bianca because she had some character to her and they both worked together well. Even tony bellew the boxer as the opponent was pretty good and had a pretty decent background about him. The story is really powerful as you see adonis and rocky try to overcome their struggles together and its emotional. By the end of the film you are really rooting for them. Unfortunately there is a story arc in the middle of the film that I felt was a little unnecessary and weighed the film down. The script is really good using allot of powerful drama but also subtle comedy that worked for the film. The style was brilliant, you truly feel like your in Philadelphia with rocky and adonis. The boxing scenes are the best ever put on the big screen, the cinematography for the fights is amazing. The sound of the hits really works as well plus the score is brilliant. Overall this is a fantastic movie that should be seen if you appreciate good films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the best Rocky Movie, obviously not better than the original Rocky, but rest assured it is the second best Rocky Movie. Stallone is amazing and at his best which is well illustrated by his Oscar Nomination, but what is surprising is that the movie has not got a nomination for the best movie. Arguably, Michael Jordan deserved a Best Actor Nomination, but Academy's hate for Non- White actors is displayed at best here. Pretty nostalgic and the Fight between Creed and Ricky Conlan reminds you the fight between the Real Creed and Rocky. Great movie altogether with stellar performances by Jordan and Stallone. The story is top class and so is the direction and the fight scene at the end is reminiscent of a real Boxing Match. This is a must watch movie and one of the top movies of 2015.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of Rocky but I watched all the movies of the famous saga more than once and I loved the first one. I still remember when I went to Philadelphia, where some relatives of mine live; I was 11 and I ran up the glorious stairs with joy and excitement and it's absolutely true that when you're up there it seems you can fly. Watching the sun set over the city from there was an incredible pleasure. Even though I heard very good comments about this film when I went to watch to watch it I wasn't expecting too much but I got out ecstatic! The directing left me perplexed. I didn't like it at all in some shots but then I loved in some others, particularly the fight scenes. The beauty of this film is that you can enjoy it both if you're a Rocky fan and if you know almost nothing about it. There are so many wonderful quotes to the original saga that every time something came up on the screen (from the turtle to the ball Balboa always plays with and many many others) I smiled like an idiot. Jordan strongly got up from the total disaster that Fantastic Four was. Stallone was incredible, he moved me badly, nearly made me cry. The finale is wonderful. In a boxing movie you can end in one way or another. There's always the big fight and the protagonist can win or lose but here you see the beautiful touch of the screenwriter in how it ends. How Rocky and Adonis fight together, what pushes them and how they fight. A word must be said about the beginning as well. I loved how they catapulted the viewer into Creed's story. So pure and natural his mother's feelings and how lovely they showed the emotional progression she has about him. As I previously said I wasn't expecting much but I was very satisfied with it. Such a good film, a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Creed is a 2015 American sports drama film, directed by Ryan Coogler and written by Coogler and Aaron Covington. The film stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson Creed, Apollo's son, with Sylvester Stallone reprising the role of Rocky Balboa. It also features Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rash&#x101;d, Tony Bellew, and Graham McTavish. It is the seventh Rocky film, both a spin-off from the original series and a sequel to 2006's Rocky Balboa. The film reunites Jordan with Fruitvale Station writer/director Coogler, and with Wood Harris, whom Jordan worked with on The Wire. -Filming began on January 19, 2015 in Liverpool, and later also took place in Philadelphia, Rocky's home. Creed was released in the United States on November 25, 2015, the fortieth anniversary of the date of the opening scene in the original Rocky. It received acclaim from critics, who called it the best Rocky film in many years. For his performance, Stallone was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, his first such nomination since the original Rocky film 39 years earlier. He also won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, his first Golden Globe.--Critical response-Creed has received critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, reported that 94% of 203 critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's consensus reads, "Creed brings the Rocky franchise off the mat for a surprisingly effective seventh round that extends the boxer's saga in interesting new directions while staying true to its classic predecessors' roots." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.-- Sequel-In January 2016, Sylvester Stallone and MGM CEO Gary Barber confirmed that a sequel to Creed is in development. On January 11, 2016, it was reported that Creed 2's release date is tentatively set for November 2017.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always thought Rocky Balboa was the perfect end to the series, that it was a truly satisfying ending and we didn't need another Rocky film after this (you think of the aged boxer poster gag in 'Airplane 2'). But Creed pleasantly surprised me, its a pretty mature film, neither Rocky nor his protégé are down and out in this film, their lives are pretty good, they both just need a new challenge to fulfil themselves. Equally his opponent is no Clubber Lang, his performance and motivation are hugely credible although you wonder what American audiences will make of the scouser accent? Great performance from SS, very brave for him to now play someone so age appropriate, the love story between Adonis and his girlfriend is also fine, very believable and if they make another film I'd like to see where it goes, a budding music star going progressively deaf is a great dramatic concept. The fight scenes are good as always, Hollywood exciting in a way real boxing can never really be but also not shying away from the brutality of it all, when they're spitting blood out or when Adonis' eye swells up you really wince for them. Equally the cancer subplot really works and doesn't shy away from the reality of it, you understand Rock's reluctance for treatment having seen his wife go through the same. If I had a complaint I would have liked to have seen Rocky's son in this film. In the last he was trying to escape his dad's legacy, as Rocky comments it can't have been easy trying to have been Rocky Balboa's son on the streets of Philly. Here we have Adonis trying to live up to his father's legacy. But I guess with the death of Sly's son from a heart attack that would have been to painful for him. Reputedly the director had to persuade Sly to let him use the picture of him from Rocky 5 and the film is dedicated to his memory. Maybe if they make a sequel?</fullReview>

Casting Tony Bellew as Creed's final opponent too was very well done since it added an extra realism to the boxing scenes. 'Creed' is a clear crowd-pleaser and exhilarating to say the least. The poetic nature of the film with its love story about fighting the 'good fight' is portrayed very well throughout the film. Furthermore, a special mention deserves to go to the director, Ryan Coogler who brilliantly portrays the legacy of Creed and the complex relationship between Rocky Balboa and his rival turned friend. A negative though on the films parts is its inability to maintain its pace throughout since the middle part of the film can seem like a drag.

		<fullReview>The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. Don't be fooled by the title. For all intents and purposes Creed is Rocky 7. Some will even say that this emotional new film is the best instalment since 1976 original. Sylvester Stallone first Rocky was dark, a downbeat masterpiece that reflected a new era in Hollywood. Creed taps into that same gritty underdog authenticity. This film isn't only about boxing, but about these two men and mainly about this man who doesn't have a father and who really needs a positive male figure in his life. Characters are very well realised. Michael B. Jordan is looking every inch like a fighter, he brought a terrific sense of grit and realism. He obviously sold the physicality but also the emotional scenes in which his character breaks a little and reveals finally some of the things that is going on in his mind. Jordan has washed the terrible Fantastic Four off his career, let's be honest, he earned that from us. Rocky has always been essentially the same person, for better or worse. It's Stallone signature role, his baby, way different than Rambo. I found him continually surprising, showing an understated note of tenderness and regret. In fact I used to think he was just a cartoon version of the actor he used to be anymore. But, Sylvester Stallone is not buried yet. Director captures the streets of Philadelphia so beautifully, he added such a great urban feeling that you can almost smell the city. It's so well filmed that the city genuinely feels like a character on its own.This film is very fresh, even if it's using elements that are a bit seen before. We expect it to end with a big sporting events. The problem with that type of ending is that once the suspense is gone and you know what team looses and who prevailed, going back to watch this film a second time is not that entertaining. Creed reaches back to the archives a few too many times for key locations, costume elements and music cues - which are by the way magnificent, loud, big and exciting - but it's the details that elevate this material. The first major fight is staged with breathtaking precision, in what appears to be a single take. This being a Rocky movie, it goes without saying that the training montages are plentiful, featuring virtuosic editing and one bloodily beautiful extreme-slow-motion shot. Finally Creed is as formulaic and sentimental as you'd expect any Rocky movie to be. Plus, it reminds you why it was great in the first place. This film is a testament for greatness and it comes from the heart. Overall, this film doesn't rely only on the fights but doesn't waste anything in it as well. It's not always as exciting as you expect it to be but it's a good character movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed follows similar Rocky routes but manages to be one of the better in the franchise due to new focus and originality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler has revitalised a franchise that otherwise seemed dead. Stallone wasn't keen on the idea of a new Rocky film, but with a decent script and much persistency, Coogler managed to convince him. And what a story it is! Coogler has deviated the attention to former collaborator Michael B. Jordan, who plays Apollo Creed's illegitimate son. Stallone's Balboa may be on the sidelines, but has just as much impact on us than when he was in the ring. He agrees to train the young Creed (who's going by the name of Johnson). Creed's story follows the usual pattern laid out by previous Rocky films, yet musters enough originality to place it amongst the best of them. Stallone puts in his greatest performance to date, whilst Jordan is exceptional, as he battles with his name and tires to build his own legacy. Jordan is improving over time. One of Creed's fights is shot in one, long breathless take. His fights place us in close quarters. We're there for every punch given, and every punch taken. Expect a sequel very, very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic, just EPIC, epic Sylvester Stallone!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is MUST WATCH MOVIE!!!Another epic role from Sylvester Stallone, hopefully we are going to see a new sequel!I bet everyone want to see Rocky fight with illness and Apollo's son fighting to become a legend, just like his father!But let's get back to this movie! I didn't expected that Michael B.Jordan would be so good in this role,but acting along side with one of the greatest actor made his role easier to act. We can say that Michael B.Jordan has a great future, and that he is rising star, but Sylvester Stallone is a true LEGEND!!!This movie from the beginning till the end can be described with only one word, and that's legendary!!The movie starts of with an introduction to Adonis Creed's life.His early childhood, he was in child prison, and we found out that he has the same passion for fighting just like his father. Later he was adopted by Apollo Creed's wife. Later on Adonis had only one mission to get Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa, best friend of his late father, and one of the fighters with the biggest legacy in boxing history,to become his personal coach.As the movie progresses they even become best friends,and quickly enough Adonis becomes the most important person in Rocky's life.That friendship inspired Rocky to start a fight of his own, a fight for his life. Soon enough Rocky saw that Adonis had talent,fighting spirit and we can easily say "Eye of the tiger" to maybe even be better than his father.They started training together,an epic journey together which leads Adonis to his biggest challenge yet, the fight for the title. Even though Adonis didn't win match, but he became people hero,so we can say that he won something more important, the right to carry Apollo's legacy.So wrap this up, if you are a fan of Sylvester Stallone, or boxing movies, then make sure you don't miss this EPIC movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming New Start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time of bad remakes and reboots Creed manages to go into a new direction without falling on its face. It's a fresh start that's a logical continuation of the Rocky series.By far the shining gem of this film was Sylvester Stallone. He delivers an unexpectedly good performance. Just for that alone I would recommend this film. Besides that you see a heartwarming relationship develop between Rocky and Adonis.Creed is a film with both drama and comedy, all equally proportioned. I liked it very much, however there were several flaws that kept me from loving it.Film's quality dropped during the second half. Final fight is not impressive as there were no real stakes to it. The film would have almost been better without it by just focusing on the two main characters and their friendship. But I guess they felt a boxing movie needs a climactic fight to end with even though it doesn't really add anything to the story.There is too much name dropping. Yes, we know, he's Apollo Creed's son, you don't have to repeat it every ten seconds. And it's a bit too self-aware and trying too much to be meta.Overall Creed is a good film and I can easily see why some people will love it a lot more than me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Creed" is a spin-off/sequel from the Rocky Balboa franchise and focuses on the story of Adonis Creed the son of the famous Apollo Creed. He yearns to become a professional boxer just as his father was, without being overshadowed by the name Creed. Therefore he seeks out Rocky Balboa, who becomes his trainer. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" just recently proved that the fact being the 7th installment of a movie is not necessarily representing its quality. Similar conditions appeal here. "Creed" adds many new elements to the franchise and pays homage to it at the same time. Especially Adonis is a likable, multi-dimensional and interesting new protagonist portrayed by an outstanding Michael B Jordan, who redeems himself from the awful "Fant4stic" we had to witness last year. Additionally, Sylvester Stallone reprises his most famous role as Rocky Balboa and achieves to add new depth to this beloved character and in my opinion delivers the best performance of the movie.Furthermore, the fight scenes are well made and edited, though for some inexplicable reason they didn't get me to the edge of my seat as they were supposed to do. In total the whole movie just was not as exciting to me as other movies of the franchise or genre! It definitely is a fun time watching it and has great character development but after witnessing the hype I just expected a little bit more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never, ever been a fan of the Rocky franchise to being with, having only liked two of the movies (the first and the last). Neverthelees I was eager to watch "Creed" solely based on the fact that Coogler is probably the hottest director of the moment in Hollywood. Coming out I must say that the movie doesn't manage to shake off the sports movie formula and clichés, yet it does succeed in making a solid drama.I think that 2015, more than any year in cinema, proved the power of the long take and tracking shot. I have seen so many films this year take advantage of this and actually use it to their advantage and I am so happy for this, being obsessed with the use of one takes. I think that when use for story reason they can support the drama immensely, give breathing space to the action and use the full power that cinema can provide. "Creed" is one of the the perfect examples for this, using it repeatedly, but never selfishly, and making some moments really shine.Not being a fan of the franchise overall it is very simple for me to make out what works and what doesn't. The film does rely on a little too much nostalgia, especially in the start, it falls really deep into some unbearable clichés and some boxing movie formula that really made the whole direction where it was going fall apart, sometimes character is given up in favor of these very dramatic in your face moments that really didn't work. It also manages to stray away from some clichés but still it doesn't do too much to give a full original picture.Fortunately the cast is just too good. The fights are just too visceral. They really pay off repeatedly and thanks too some heart felt character work I was never lost by the film. It was a pleasant experience, not a layered or complicated one, just a great flow that I would be happy to revisit occasionally.</fullReview>

I'm not talking about the rap, but the general background music that can make of break a movie. There did seem to be a lot of rap in the movie, but considering the background of the main character it's not a surprise.I also don't understand why Paulie was written out. He added some much needed comic relief. The biggest problem is that the last two movies in this franchise had to live up to the legacy of the first four excellent films which perhaps was impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when you think the sport of Boxing is dying a slow death, movies like this come along and reminds us what it is that we enjoy about Boxing.But that can be only done with the right combination of events leading to the Boxing match. This movie did exactly that.Not only are we interested in the boxing matches but also the rise of young Creed. Rocky's presence in his life made the young Creed character more likable. You only wish Boxing could produce a real life story line like in this movie.The acting in this movie was pretty good. Michael B. Jordan looked, trained and moved like a boxer. Boxers lives are never even close to perfect and this movie shows that Boxers will tend to need that extra motivation to fight an opponent to the best of its ability by using the strength gained from surviving hardships in the real world.Tessa Thompson did a great job as the leading actress. Phylicia Rashad also did great, you only wonder why she wasn't cast in the original Rocky movies.This movie makes you forget you're watching just any boxing movie because based on what some people have said they were in theaters where the audience were standing and rooting on Creed.There are certain formulaic Rocky movies moments that make the movie predictable at times but isn't that what we like about this movie franchise? The important thing about Rocky movies is to have a fun Boxing viewing experience and this movie did it's job.</fullReview>

Not something you see a lot in that kind of films.

A really nice story! 1h 35 minutes - just like in Southpaw (2015), there is more focus on the life outside of the ring. There is more training and preparing here though. It really fires you up~! 1h 51 minutes - so far, the final fight looks quite overblown1h 53 minutes - and there goes realistic looking fight, right out of the window... It looks comical...2h - they went full-retard with the ending (fight)...tgchan's rating: 7 /10</fullReview>

Obviously everyone has personal bias's that influences their perceptions, particularly with franchises such as rocky. Because of this there'll always be people who either love or hate it because it's a franchise, the feelings it evokes and the preconceived ideals we hold. Looking at it objectively, ( removing my personal bias as best as I can ) I wasn't expecting much, and was truly encapsulated throughout and really struggled to maintain my emotions. It hit a chord with me ( and I think most will find at least something they can relate to in it ). Bottom line, this film is a testament to the original. Awesome.</fullReview>

There were a few good fight moments during the final boxing scene. Fighting at the beginning of this movie made Creed appear to be action packed, yet watching someone practice nearly un-opposed for most of the storyline was boring. If Creed had had as many fights as Rocky did between matches, then this movie would have been good. Sylvester Stallone definitely made some easy money during this film. Boxing landmarks seemed important in this film. Increasing the action for these new characters to assume the leadership of the hallowed Phillie boxing grounds would help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the true successor to Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's fair to say this film is an instant classic. It's a bit of a genre movie, but for what it is it's very very solid.I deducted two points from the score, 1 because there are only a handful of perfect 10 films and another one because Creed follows a proved formula. But it follows that formula exceptionally well. We only have to look at some of the latter Rocky films to see how hard it is to do justice to the original. Unlike other follow-ups to long-dormant franchises (cough*starwars*) Creed has enough originality to earn it's own place and not become an empty money-grab, disguised as an homage. You can truly feel how Stalone's life has become intertwined with 'Rocky Balboa's' and the nods to the original movie are moving and self-reflective in the way that there's the right combination of what one might call nostalgia and acceptance. This aspect also makes the film larger than it is at times. The older, wiser Rocky is an immensely likable character, with just enough mistakes to make him feel vaguely realistic. The parallel between Adonis' and Rocky's fight is tastefully done; there's enough humanity and wisdom there, that even though the outcome is somewhat ambiguous in the latter's case at least, the suggestion that it's not really about winning or losing is well communicated.While this is not a Rocky film per the title, it's really not about Adonis either. Michael B Jordan (come on, that's a terrible name...although on reflection he's the perfect guy for the 'man trying to live up to his name' role) does a decent job, but Stalone and Tessa Thompson steal the show. They're both very well written characters, and I very much welcome the film not focusing so much on one character. Oh and just so I don't forget, the soundtrack here is great, although I missed the Lupe track used in the trailer from the actual film.Overall, very solid film. Stalone finally made a true successor to the original movie with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good addition to the Rocky Franchise and a happy welcome to the 21st century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the newest chapter of the Rocky franchise and it takes an interesting turn to bring Rocky into the 21st century. Sylvester Stallone once again stars as Rocky Balboa and he shows that he isn't only available to star in mindless action movies and that he does actually have acting chops. Michael B Jordan co-stars as Apollo Creed's estranged son and he gives an excellent performance to portray him as an angry, talented and hard-headed young boxer who wants to nothing more than to make a name for himself, not simply relying on his last name. The movie is not without its flaws though, I found that it merely recycled and re-used the story line of Rocky 1, which worked in a way but i was disappointed to see that it didn't try to be it's own movie but it worked none the less. I feel like some of the humor that the movie attempted to bring forth fell flat at times and I found it lazy, simply pointing out how Rocky was up to date with technology (continuously re-using the same type of jokes). The movie also had many positives including excellent dialogue between the two stars, showing excellent chemistry between the two actor that showed on screen. They truly put emphasis on Creed's training and it showed throughout the movie that he could truly be a contender in the boxing world. The movie also has many emotional twist in the movie that adds layers to the movie taking it away from a simple boxing movie to one that holds its own in the Rocky Franchise. Finally it showed that lots of time has passed between the 1980s and today and that the circle of life happens to everyone, even Rocky Balboa as you got to witness the toll that life has had on the retired boxer adding more layer of emotions and it truly pulls on your heart strings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in the theater with high expectations. All six others are very good - good - watchable, so I thought Creed, it will be a good movie, I thought it will earn 7-8 points from me.False. This movie is awesome. I really don't know where i shall begin. Because nearly everything is perfect. Adonis Creed aka Michael B. Jordan had a lot of pressure. He can't be that what Stallone was 40 years before, right? Well, he is not. Because Stallone became a legend with Rocky 1. But I claim that Jordan's Performance is WAY better than Stallone's in the first movies! This guy is so sympathetic, his performance is simply perfect.The Love Story isn't kitschy at all. Also, the actress did her job very well. I've already seen couples with better chemistry (for example Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone in the amazing spider-man), but in this movie the chemistry is still solid - good.Stallone had touched me very deep and sometimes i had to hold back some tears. This performance! His appearance suffice to make the movie a lot more watchable. He doesn't try to steal Jordan's show. He holds himself a bit in the background. The chemistry between Rocky and Adonis is flawless. I think it's Stallones best performance he ever made. And I've seen a lot of Stallone-Movies.Then we have the music. The tracks are from God's hands. Meek Mill's "Lord Knows" mixed with "Fighting Stronger". A short part from the original theme."Don't waste my time". "Check". " Last Breath"...Perfect.Training scenes. Perfect. Fight scenes. Perfect. Creed doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Sometimes, It follows a bit the pattern of Rocky 1. And this is good. Because every idea is already exhausted.I want to tell you my favorite scene because i got goosebumps watching this: it was at the point Adonis runs to Rocky's apartment, followed by quads and motorcycles, then he stops in front of Rocky's window, then gives him to understand he is ready to fight, and rocky who smiles and gives some punches in the air. During the whole scene, the track "Lord Knows/Fighting Stronger" plays. Has this movie got some flaws? If you want to search on a high level, you will find some of them. The jokes aren't placed very well, so they steal a little bit atmosphere for a few seconds. Mary-Anne Creed was a bit superficial. The adversary wasn't very strong like Ivan Drago or a bad-ass like Clubber Lang. But this is necessary, because in the sequel, the antagonist has to be more powerful than in the prequel (this is marketing). But, even this little flaws can't worsen the score. Watch this movie or die. This is definitely the best movie I've ever seen in a theater in the last few years. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the Rocky fans, "Creed" is like the cherry topped in a legendary dessert. Even though the film is 2 hours and 13 minutes, the time is never felt, only the story. We are aware that this film has the same clichés as the previous Rocky's films in terms of preparing for the fight, the main character being the underdog, the opponent being unstoppable and arrogant and in the end the protagonist proving himself to be a worthy opponent. This is what Rocky is all about.The story is perfectly constructed in reminding us the previous Rocky films and also bringing Rocky Balboa as a victorious survivor. Sylvester Stallone gives the best acting performance I have ever seen in any of his films. The match scenes are well constructed in terms of editing and camera angles. The audience feel the intensity of each punch that is delivered to a character. The final boxing match reminded me of the boxing scene in Stanley Kubrick's 1955 film, "Killer's Kiss."Rocky fans will not be disappointed by this film as the legacy of Rocky Balboa still lives and continues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creed its the 7th film in the Rocky franchise and it stars Michael B. Jordan, and Sylvester Stallone. It is basically the same plot as the first rocky movie, but it tries some things different. Rocky trains the son of Apollo Creed as he died in the past and his son wants to be just like him, but his mother does not support him. I think this is a good 7th film in a franchise (you don't see that much nowadays, with the exception of Star Wars the Force Awakens). The only performance i found outstanding was Rocky, he gives such a good feel to the movie. As you are there with him in the city of Philadelphia. Creed its a good movie because it does not really follow the same formula as some boxing movies in the past, it mainly focuses on the characters, mainly creed. But they also give a good screenplay with rocky as he has a lot of regretting in his life and he tries to live it set past. The main problem i found with creed its that they gave Rocky cancer for the purpose of just moving the plot along. It was not really necessary as he does not dies neither his character changes. Also the romance its a little iffy but not terrible. Creed its a good movie with good performances, but i really expected more to this movie as it is the exact same as Rocky. Either way for the movie that it is, its good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the praise director Ryan Cooglan has gotten is warranted and well deserved. HIs direction is really the spice and life of "Creed". The screenplay doesn't miss a step until two hours into the film, and that makes it nearly a perfect movie.I went into viewing Creed as a skeptic because I haven't been impressed at all with any sequels since Rocky IV. But the witty script, swift moving dialogue, and pacing will make you a believer.Michael B Jordan turns in a surprisingly impressive performance with shades of Denzel Washington's range, and Sylvester Stallone definitely deserves his award recognition. Stallone plays an elder Rocky loosely, having fun in the role, but also capturing the film's most dramatic scenes with poise and solid delivery.The story is really great. It has heart, which is something many films nowadays lack considerably. The camera-work, story, and screenplay make this one of the best movies of the year and arguably one of the top 3-4 of the franchise. Except that is the thing about Creed- what is interesting about it is it sets itself apart from the usual Rocky series and charts a new course and direction, making it its' own film and own series with lots of potential for the future.This movie is so good in a technical way, it's difficult to consider it a Rocky movie, and the most impressive scenes and writing all occur outside of the ring in day to day living. Witty dialogue, great direction, and a clever vision make Creed a surprise hit worth seeing of 2015.4/4 stars (10/10)</fullReview>

Maybe it's because a lot of screen time is dedicated to his training and the relationship between Creed and Balboa. The story is a gripping journey of a young man who is determined to succeed. The boxing scenes are very engaging, and I find myself holding my breath, eagerly waiting to see the outcome of the fight. I think the guy playing Creed is a good actor, he put on a good performance in "Fruitvale Station" last time. This time, he seems to be overshadowed by Sylvester Stallone in the Oscars.

		<fullReview>I am a tough critic of the Rocky movies, and movies in general. I'm not even a boxing fan. But I can say that this is by far, the best of the Rocky series, and the cast and crew killed it.Donnie "Hollywood" Johnson, played by Michael B. Jordan, is the son of the late Apollo Creed, who died in the ring before Donnie was born, before he was acknowledged by his father. His mother died early on his life as well, and Donnie comes to know one thing in his life, anger. When the son of his father's trainer refuses to train Donnie, he seeks out Rocky Balboa, former champion, to help him train.Along the way, he also meets and falls in love with Bianca, a singer and musician, who is gradually losing her hearing, which will someday rob her of her true passion, music.There are many themes running through Creed, family, anger, legacies, and following your heart, but they all give Donnie an unexpected depth of character that usually these types of movies miss out on. It was easily to believe in the original Rocky that he was looking for his one shot at greatness. Here, the shot at greatness, honoring his father's name, and legacy, are merely the subplot. As Rocky tells him early on, it's about facing the toughest opponent, the guy in the mirror.Sylvester Stallone can really act. Yes, it's a role he's played before, and knows how to play it in his sleep, but there's a freshness to the role, and spirit that Stallone has never shown in the other Rocky films, and with his cancer, there is a vulnerability that he had always attempted to show in his scenes with Adrian, but finally shows when he breaks down and talks to Donnie about why he doesn't want to fight his cancer. I actually want to see Stallone in more dramatic roles after this.Creed is an amazing movie, Stallone almost brings tears as a dying Balboa, Jordan proves he has the acting depth and the action credibility to pull off this role, and carry it into sequels. And if the fight scenes in the final act don't get you hyped, you have no soul. When the Rocky music starts and Donnie comes out to fight, my audience stood and cheered like it was a real fight.Ryan Coogler, who directed and co-wrote, knocked this one out of the park. There should have been Oscar's, there should have been a lot of them. The performances are outstanding, the cinematography is a brilliant modern take on the original Rocky's look and feel, but yet better than the original. The Rocky legacy is in very good hands under Ryan Coogler, who also directed the underrated and severely overlooked "Fruitville Station." Coogler, Jordan, and Tessa Thompson (Bianca) all have brilliant futures ahead of them, and Creed will go down as a classic. I can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

I honestly thought when the rumors of the film surfaced the character of Micheal b Jordan might be that of rocky's son which i might add would have been kiddish. well yesterday when i saw this film i might add it felt energetic. The first half was bit messed up. the second half was a blast.....full of energy that you except from a sports movie! Stallone had done amazing job supporting the main character!The last fight was awesome! I had seen that fight a couple of times but still its pretty awesome every time. i urge all the rocky fans and others to watch this movie !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand out performance from Stallone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on watching Rocky films and my kids have seen re-runs of them all too . They are an important part of my movie watching history but Creed feels like an end of an era. This is right up there with the best of them. It reminded me a lot of the first two films. Gritty yet still with the over the top boxing action. This is Stallone's best acting performance of the lot though. He really gets back to grass roots with this performance. Michael B. Jordan is excellent too but what was really surprising was the acting from the real life boxers Andre Ward and Tony Bellew. The one strange thing is the Everton connection to the film. Fans at the fight wearing Everton scarfs and singing Everton songs. Strange. I wonder what the American audience thought of it. All in all I enjoyed this as I have done with most of the films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a real heavyweight knockout of a film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to be honest and make this review clear.. i have never seen a Rocky film. Judge me if you will, but i just never got round to it. That being said i know of other work by Sylvester Stallone and from what i have seen this is actually his best performance yet.The film follows Addonis Creed, who wants to make a name for himself instead of simply following his father, Apollo Creed's legacy. Rocky Balboa takes him under his wing and trains him under the name Johnson to be a champion in his own right, but when Rocky gets sick they both have to fight their own battles. That is what sets this film apart from other boxing films, it is more than that. A fighting film yes.. Rocky fights out of the ring this time though, which made him that much more compelling to watch. Michael B Jordan once again proves himself as the leading man. He went from being in the worst film of 2015 to giving a real knockout performance, if you'll mind the pun. We get a good insight into what both of these characters are going through and they play off of each other so perfectly.So why do i call this Stallone's best performance? Well firstly, he went from adding some hilarious humour to the film, to bringing me to tears. You feel like he is in this for Creed. He says he is ready to embrace death, yet you see in his eyes and in this brilliant performance that he really wants to see Donnie succeed and become everything his father was and more. The cinematography also stands out really well. From Donnie's first fight you knew it was something special. I knew this was the scene that was done in one shot and it looks amazing. We follow Creed and his opponent as they are throwing punches and evading them. It makes us as an audience feel we are right there in the ring dodging blows. This carries through a few times and the last climatic fight is a spectacle to behold, especially when that iconic Rocky theme blares from the speakers. It put a huge smile on my face. There are more than a few times that i teared up at this movie too, especially at the heartwarming ending that really shows how far Rocky, as well as Donnie, have come as champions.So does it make me want to watch the Rocky films before this? It sure does. I am going to now spend the time to watch them all and get to know these characters as well as i got to know Donnie and i am looking forward to it. I was on the edge of my seat by the end, but as i said this film has a hell of a lot more to offer than just the boxing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless we're talking James Bond by the time a film franchise wheels out number seven moviegoers can be forgiven for leaving their jaded palates at home but Creed is actually much better than any seventh entry in a franchise has a right to be. For one thing Rocky Balboa has wisely hung up his gloves and all the retinue surrounding him have been killed off either really or metaphorically leaving only Rocky himself in the shape of Sylvester Stallone and what amounts to a new, improved Rocky in the shape of Michael B. Jordan, the son of Rocky's great rival and later friend, Apollo Creed, also resident in the big gym in the sky. The premise is simple. Creed junior wants Balboa retired to train him until he's ready for a crack at the title. Once Stallone agrees we're all set for s reprise of the original Rocky. The training montage, the taunts, pressure, the climactic fight. You're right, we have seen it all before but most of us have eaten top sirloin before and followed it with pie a la mode, does that mean it doesn't taste just as good the hundredth time we dig in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Champ For A New Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the continuation of the Rocky saga, the film series we all thought we saw the last of with Rocky Balboa. Where else could they go with the ageing slugger from Philadelphia? The answer is here. Directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) and starring Michael B. Jordan as 'Hollywood' Donnie Johnson, the love child of deceased boxing champion Apollo Creed. The film deals with Legacy, as a young and angry Donnie is taken in by Apollo's widow and raised as her own son. Despite having a good career prospect ('be a thinker, not a stinker') Donnie has a drive in him to fight. Not only fight, but to make a name for himself out of the shadow of his father. With no club in L.A. willing to coach him, Donnie seeks out his father's old rival and friend, Rocky Balboa. Along the way he meets and falls in love with Bianca (Tessa Thompson) an up-and-coming musician who has her own fight to deal with also.Coogler has been masterful with the material. Throughout watching it would have been all to easy to crowbar in as many Rocky references as possible, and he would have been forgiven for doing this. But, he doesn't. There are lots of references to the old series in the film, however this more than stands on its own. This is not a Rocky film. This is a film with Rocky in it. Stallone's performance in this is one of the best of his career, perhaps as good as his original Rocky performance. He plays Balboa with a quietness this time. Gone is the meat-punching, chicken-chasing champ of old. This is a Rocky whose quietly living his life running his restaurant. There are some powerful scenes from Stallone, ones even I was surprised how well he acted in. With the right director pulling the strings, Stallone can be great. There's an almost perfect pace to the screenplay. Never once did it feel like it was dragging. The beats of the story are on the money, and I felt the script was tight with some excellent dialogue. You could be forgiven for being fooled into thinking this film would be cheesy, when I first heard this was being made I thought exactly the same thing, however, it's never over-nostalgic, it has a perfect balance of old and new. There's Rocky DNA in the script, but it's not a copy of Rocky.Jordan's performance has been my favourite of the year so far. It's a crime he hasn't been nominated (along with Coogler) for an Oscar for this. He plays Donnie with passion, conviction, and heart. He's not a fighter off the streets, he's had a privileged upbringing, yet there's a fire in his performance as Donnie that's electric. He's a guy with a chip on his shoulder, but has a good heart. I did feel Tessa Thompson's character Bianca was a little underdeveloped, but she still proved an interesting foil for Donnie to bounce off of. The verisimilitude of the boxing world in this film is perhaps the most authentic I have seen. Along with the fight choreography (gone are the days of the wild haymakers) you feel you're with Donnie preparing for the biggest fight of his career. I loved how the film was shot. Maryse Alberti weaves this beautiful canvas of life. She takes the slums of Philadelphia and makes them vibrant and exciting. There's a realness to her lens and what she gives us, but there's a polish also. I could have spent hours just looking at the Philly skyline she made me fall in love that much with this city through her work. Another addition to the film was the score by Ludwig Göransson. Again, there's very little of the Rocky score in this, there's enough, but it's more it's own original music than reusing anything that's come before. Overall, I thought the film was great. There's a few minor irritations I had with it that's knocked down the score I've given it. A couple of characters felt a bit flat. I would have liked to have seen more between Donnie and Maryann, but that's just personal choice. It's a film that can stand proudly next to the original Rocky, and more importantly, out of its shadow and on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all accounts, the Rocky series came to a satisfying conclusion with 2006's Rocky Balboa. Critics called the film one of the best in the series, there was a higher box office total than one should have expected, and fans (myself included) were, for the most part, generally happy with the picture as a final chapter. When Creed was announced, it seemed likely that the final product would be little more than a cash crab, or a desperate attempt to bring back a series best left in the past.To almost everyone's surprise, Creed is just as great, if not even better, than Rocky Balboa. It may even be the best in the series. If nothing else, Creed is, without a doubt, the best seventh installment of any film series. Everything from the writing to the production design is impressive, made with love and care for a franchise that is almost 40 years old at this point. It would have been easy for co-writer/director Ryan Coogler to essentially remake the first Rocky with a new character, but he's too smart to just shoot a lazy sequel. Creed may share a few story beats from the original Rocky here and there, although 90% of the film is an original boxing story that just happens to feature Stallone as an aging, tired Rocky Balboa.Stallone gets a lot of criticism for some of his acting and career choices, and some of it may occasionally be justified but there's nothing to criticize in Creed. Stallone is as impressive here as he's ever been, delivering an absolutely knockout performance as the legend who has seen almost everything good in his life disappear. It is a sad, at times beautiful performance that makes Rocky feel like a more realistic character than ever before. Stallone has nice chemistry with Michael B. Jordan, playing Adonis Creed, Apollo's son. Even taking a backseat as a supporting character, Stallone could have completely overshadowed Jordan--it is, after all, still a Rocky movie--but both share the screen and are electrifying to watch together. Jordan has to display a wide arrange of emotions throughout: sadness, anger, grief, and they are done in such a way that he always remains a sympathetic character even when he's being a less than likable guy.Creed is so great that the only real disappointment is that it doesn't run slightly longer, which is something that I never say about a film. It's an amazing accomplishment from such a young director, and an absolute delight for anyone who has ever been a Rocky fan. Creed is by far the best movie to have come out in 2015. 9/10</fullReview>

But there was word of a another Rocky film, which was thought to be titled "Rocky 7" was titled Creed though a UK release date was yet to be set until I found out it was to be release in January. I got to see this as a preview at my local cinema. It was pretty good!The film is about Adonis Creed, a young man who wants to be a boxer just like his dad, Apollo Creed. He then begins to take an interest in fighting &amp; gets the help of the legendary, Rocky Balboa to train him! The film was pretty good! I did like how there was references to the previous films, along with verbal revelations about the past. Though I thought this was a good film, I felt the other Rocky films were better, though this was a great spin off &amp; I like how we got to see the son of Apollo fighting in the ring! It was overall a great film &amp; a good addition to the Rocky series! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sly's best friend is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone lives up to his name, Sly, fleshing out a great character to revive his 'Rocky', overshadowing all the other characters, even the young Creed himself.Michael B Jordan slips into the role as smoothly as his hands slip into the gloves. He brings in a new age street smart to the Rocky story, without making Rocky look like a dinosaur. The contrast between the two generations is brought out beautifully when Creed refers to the Cloud, confusing Rocky. Those of us who have straddled the both the age of the tape recorder and the Ipod can relate to this huge change in lifestyles. The plot steers clear of melodrama even when opportunity presents itself. Whether it is a chance at hostility with the Sporinos, or Rocky's personal fight, Cooler gives it all a miss to stick to spirit of 'Rocky'.For the Rocky story, beneath all the slang and street culture, has always been about pushing oneself beyond one's own limits, about achieving the seemingly impossible. This time, Rocky says it loud, showing young Creed his own reflection at the Mirror,'That's the toughest opponent you're ever going to have to face. I believe that's true in the ring, and I think that's true in life.'The ending is a bit of a surprise, but Coogler realises the changing tastes of audiences. A story like Rocky's needs a more practical ending, and anything different would probably not have gone very well with the audiences. Thank you Coogler, and thank you Sylvester 'Rocky' Stallone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the 'good' Rocky movies of the 70s and 80s (iconic, but very dated), or the bad ones of the 90s, this movie may be the best of all of them. It is not so much a boxing movie, as there are not a huge number of fights, it is more drama.As the story starts, we get to know Apollo Creed's young son who must leave his life of leisure and find Rocky to help him create his own boxing career. Stallone is excellent sitting at the sides of the movie, using his legacy to further push the powerful story telling.Michael B. Jordan is extremely likable as Adonis Creed, and Phylicia Rashad lends her talents to the cast as well.The movie adds just the right amount of nestalga to the mix, but is its own story.As a passive fan of the original Rocky movies, I enjoyed this movie hugely. It is closer to Million Dollar Baby or Southpaw than to Rocky. If that sounds good to you, then watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan combining with Stallone will leave you KO'd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the seventh film of the Rocky franchise that started back in 1976. More often than not with a franchise this old, people wouldn't be too excited for a new film and judging by the fact that both Rocky V and Rocky Balboa were pretty lacklustre in comparison to the earlier films, Creed could have gone under the radar a little.Now, I really like the Rocky films but I wouldn't call myself a die hard fan of the franchise. What made me stand up and take notice of Creed, other than the word of mouth from across the pond, was the talent found to breathe new life into the franchise in director Ryan Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan. What a great move that turned out to be.Adonis "Donnie" Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is the youngest son of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, whom he never met as Donnie was born after his death. With a childhood filled with violence behind him, Donnie quits his job to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional boxer.Donnie travels to Philadelphia to seek out his father's former rival turned friend, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), another former heavyweight champion, to train him. Keeping his identity as a Creed under wraps, Donnie tries to make it on his own name all while trying to build a relationship with Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a singer trying to make it in her respective profession.Creed has many strengths but its real one is the story at the centre of the film that harks back to what made the earlier films of the franchise so strong; underneath the tough exterior, there is a vulnerable man trying to find his place in the world. Ryan Coogler's story is an emotionally powerful one that deals with legacy, the fear of failure and loneliness rather beautifully.Coogler quite rightfully broke onto the scene when he wrote and directed Fruitvale Station and he picks up where he left off with that film in Creed, revelling in both the role of writer and director. I knew the more dramatic scenes, particularly between Donnie and Rocky, were in capable hands with Coogler however, I wasn't too sure how he would handle the boxing sequences.All I can say now having seen Creed is wow. Coogler not only delivers a pulsating training montage, important to any Rocky film, he also manages to hit the nail on the head when it comes to the actual fights. The last fight would have been good enough but there is a real gem of a scene that occurs halfway through the film. Donnie's first fight under the tutelage of Rocky is all done in one long take and it really is a stunning piece of filmmaking. Coogler owes a lot to cinematographer Maryse Alberti as it is her camera-work that makes this such an unforgettable scene, making us feel every punch as they land.Coming to the performances, I really do think Creed showcases the best performances of the franchise. In Michael B. Jordan, they have found a young and exciting actor who could go on to play this character for years to come. Jordan portrays both the cocky and vulnerable side to Donnie with an abundance of maturity and confidence.The more surprising aspect of the performances is just how good Sylvester Stallone is in the role of Rocky Balboa. Now, Stallone has never been regarded as a great actor however, you can't deny that this is the role that has more than ever showcased the acting talent he does possess. In Creed, I can't think of one scene involving Stallone that let the film down. This is his franchise and you have to give the man credit for bringing in the likes of Coogler and Jordan to take it forward. Creed is an outstanding example of how to respectfully breathe new life into a flagging franchise from Ryan Coogler, who has a big future ahead of him, as does Michael B. Jordan. It might not be the most popular statement but I genuinely think I prefer Creed to any of the previous six Rocky films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Rocky is really one of those franchises i could watch new installments forever. But Creed is a sweet surprise, , for being able to recreate the feeling of the Rocky films, while bringing so much more, for being something really new and different, for how great it is.The story is amazing, the screenplay is just so great. The way it integrates all the elements you love in The Rocky films and the story of one of the best characters in the franchise in a new and exciting story is incredible. There's so many amazing scenes, some really funny, but overall this film has a lot of really epic heartfelt moments that you wont forget.It introduces such a complex, interesting new lead character, one that you just want to see more and more. There's also plenty of other amazing characters, especially Bianca. But no matter how great the characters are, The actors are the ones that bring them to live. And the film is filled with amazing performances, but of course Michael B. Jordan shines like the sun. He's just so great he deserves tons of awards, But Sylvester Stallone really is at his best, i mean he's always wonderful, but i haven't seen him like this in a long time, he's just so amazing. He definitely will be nominated and win the Oscar for best supporting actor. His character has such a brilliant arc. And the two actors make the perfect duo. Production values are great, the score is amazing, integrating some of the classic scores you love and bringing a new feel, even if sometimes i wish they used it a little more. And the cinematography is incredible.There's many references to some of things you love the most in the Rocky films, especially at the end, What a great ending! Its a really immersive film, one that has an amazing story that will glue you to the screen, And i love how they ended Adonis character arc for now. Just watch this amazing film, one that is everything you could ever which for. I cant wait for the sequel!Right now im close to give it a 10, but i didn't feel it, so im just going to give it a 9 (.8) maybe after a second viewing i will give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost good as the first "Rocky" if not at least to it's level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that really beat my expectations, it really is a heartfelt film about the bond between the master and his student. This formula has been done before, but it's execution in this is what makes this one stand out from the rest. It's like the "Karate Kid" for the 2010's. So when it comes to the plot, Rocky Balboa is now really old and feels that he is now washed up and just doesn't have any use anymore. All his main loved ones are gone and he has nothing really left to fight for. Something a lot of old retired people feel at that age. While also dealing with his own mortality and his longing for deep human connection. Than there comes Adonis "Donnie" Johnson Creed or Creed Jr (Michael B. Jordan). Who after some thought takes under his wings. Now Creed Jr. has his own demons and insecurities he is dealing with. One of the main thing is the fact that he is a foster child and he also feels that he is living in his father's shadow. While people claim he is just riding on the fame of his father. Some fighters fight for money and to meet ends meet, some to put for their kids education and to put a roof over their heads. However for Creed Jr's case he has enough money because of inheritance, but still wants to fight and become the best at it. Because fighting is just in his blood. Michael B. Jordan who plays Creed Jr. in this was really good and is a likable and relatable character because of his flaws. Even though he reminded me of a similar character he played in "Fruitvale Station" except he picked up boxing this time around. Now when it comes to Rocky Balboa he is not some Steven Seagal that tries to gain the world's attention by riding the wings of young and up and coming youngsters. He actually cares about his fighter more than himself. And wants to see Creed Jr succeed and to make a legacy for himself and to fight through his insecurities. Now that to me is a true hero, a hero to me is someone that doesn't try to drag others down because of their own insecurities. Or try to use and manipulate others for their own gain or their own comfort so they can feel better about themselves. A hero is someone that drives others to spread their wings and fly to bring out their full potential with love. Creed Jr's girlfriend who is this underground singer isn't just wise but she has the wits to know what is going on for the most part. She sort of reminded me of Vesper from "Casino Royale" except more street. She is however isn't keen on giving people chances all that much, probably from being burned one to many times in the past. So in this she lacks empathy and trying to understand it from the other sides point of view, which is a big aspect when it comes to wisdom. But sometimes getting burnt can teach you and help you grow in the process, but it can also lead to not being able to trust people as easily. So it goes hand in hand. So I thought her character was actually really believable, not a fan of her music though. Sometimes the female lead role doesn't really play much into the core of the story, but her character is one of the core characters that opens up the inner thoughts, heart and drive of the male lead in this. The emotions and the drive to the human heart in this is impactful without it being pretentious or forced. I just thought this was going to be a cash in, a simple mentor/coach to a student kind of deal movie from the first teaser. And just thought they should have ended it with "Rocky Balboa". It's a good thing I was wrong. The bond between the Rocky and Creed Jr. really has heart and a deep connection going for it and not just through boxing either, although that is the main part of it. No one wants to watch a hero deteriorate, but it also shows the natural of life. That the people you look up to on earth will not be here someday. It's kind of like watching Batman getting Robin to take his place when he is done, but Batman or Bruce Wayne is irreplaceable. Still a "Robin" movie can be really good if done right and that is the case with "Creed". It's a film that is executed superbly. Even the training montage pumped me up, it was exhilarating and emotional because of the distance and direction of Creed Jr. and what he is fighting for while seeing eye to eye with Rocky Balboa (No he does not hit hanging pieces of meat in this). This is a great boxing movie that beats the crap out of "Southpaw" and I am super glad it wasn't another "Rocky 5. I personally think it's not as good as "Million Dollar Baby" but it's still a exceptional film. There is two main boxing scenes in this, minus the amateur boxing and sparring. And it's still engaging from start to finish and that is a accomplishment. There is one single take boxing sequence that probably took a lot of planning, practice and many retakes to do.*Interesting fact* they actually used real topnotch boxers to play some big roles in this.8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Rocky off the benches in a beautiful new way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it fascinating that despite growing up with Star Wars all my life and Rocky for the first time a few weeks ago, Creed filled me with far more nostalgia than The Force Awakens did. Despite the fact that both are clear rehashes of their original winning formula, there is something bold and yet elusive about Creed that makes it just a bit more of a cinematic experience. Having not seen Coogler and Jordan's acclaimed Fruitvale Station, this was my first exposure to Coogler's directing talent. What a truly champion director this guy is. He can toy with your emotions, keying your to a fever pitch with perfectly gauged levels of energy. One such scene sees young Creed sprinting full pelt up the street with a squad of youths in tow to Ludwig Göransson's beautiful music is utterly triumphant. In another, Rocky visits a cemetery and will have you in tears despite the simplicity of the scene. As a writer, Coogler and his team do a marvellous job of retelling Rocky with enough variation to make it engrossing. Creed, raised Adonis Johnson, wants to prove himself in his own right and chooses not to accept his father's name. It becomes an obstacle for Adonis just as it was for the film. As "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, the film's antagonist, points out - the roles are reversed: our protagonist is the one who comes from money and legacy and genealogy, not the villain. The clever writing means that we can see both points of view. I also loved the cheat sheet way in which Coogler gives exposition, the camera freeze frames and information is shown on screen like real boxing. Not only stylish but helpful to deliver information.Michael B. Jordan does a great job carrying the lead role of Adonis, especially in the heaviest scenes where he can flex his considerable acting chops. You don't question for a second that he's a boxer of considerable skill. He can also do a mean Brando impression. Tessa Thompson is Creed's Adrian with an achingly sad story of her own, which does much to elevate her from a generic love interest to a character in her own right. Sylvester Stallone, who I have unashamedly loved when everyone else hated him, gives a heartbreaking, tender and strong performance as Rocky. Its a performance very reminiscent of Micky Goldmill's turn in the original Rocky, with shades of Clint Eastwood Million Dollar Baby. Graham MacTavish and Tony Bellew come close to stealing every scene they are in as the antagonistic boxer and his manager who really does just care about his client and more importantly, his client's family. The chemistry between the co-stars is palpable and I come away wanting to spent more time with them, the same sentiment I had at the original. The film's music is a huge achievement, with an original piece that is reminiscent of Rocky but able to be triumphant on its own. Teases of the original song from Rocky are hugely appropriate and enormously enjoyable. The film's cinematography is an absolute triumph, especially the unbroken long take that is a two-round fight in the middle of the film. Unbroken shots are becoming synonymous with exceptional cinematography, but the sheer challenge of creating such a scene is worthy of commendation. Creed is a delightful film. The challenges facing Adonis are exactly the ones facing the film - the question of acknowledging your roots or trying to make it on your own. Unlike the fan service done in Star Wars, which too often felt obvious and too like the director was a big fan, the references to Rocky in Creed feel more natural and more like this film exists in the same world as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2015's Best Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only does this new Rocky film NOT follow the same rough story line as all its predecessors, it doesn't even address the same theme. However, it is a great pleasure to watch, my favorite of all the Rocky films. Rocky himself shows more vulnerability than ever before as the aging, reluctant trainer. Creed's girl friend brings more to the table than just a star-struck sidekick - she has her own career. She's beautiful, intriguing, and adds another (good) layer of complexity to the story. Creed's mother, played by Phylicia Rashad, has a relatively small part, but seeing Phylicia is like seeing an old friend after many years. The main focus of the story is Creed coming to grips with himself and his family. It's more like a film about people that uses boxing as the backdrop, which is why I really like it. With all due respect to Stallone's writing, the fact that this episode was written by someone new I think helps it to have more depth than just 'boxing underdog beats favorite'. Possibly the best film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed is the cherry on top for the whole Rocky franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still can't believe that I gave a 10 for this movie because I only gave 15 10's in 600 movies but this movie is so much more than an average boxing film. Creed does carry a great, phenomenal background story but it delivers every special moment that the whole franchise ever had. It just touched my heart because as a little boy I loved watching Rocky fighting. But the past Rocky movies weren't that good individually like this one. This isn't just a boxing movie and that is what I liked the most. It had a nice romantic moments. It had some many tensions. And it had a twist that I never expected. Creed was just unexpectedly phenomenal. I never thought that I would give a 10 for this movie but this 10 is for the whole Rocky franchise that made my childhood and Creed just summed it all up in an exceptional way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Spoilered review* of this exceptional movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, it's time for my very first film review. My first film of choice is Creed, There will probably be lots of spoilers,I like spoilers, sorry. Firstly before I get into the plot points, this movie is probably the pinnacle of any movie ever, in my time. The first four Rocky films were released before I was born, when I was 4 Rocky V came out (to everyone's disappointment) then there was a great 16 year gap, no one ever thought Mr. Balboa would return. I remember watching Rocky when I grew up, it was great, he was this nobody he rose, he fell, Rocky Balboa was human, that's what made him great. When Rocky Balboa came out, life was great again, it was the swan song to the Rocky series...or so I had thought, it's good to know that that the champ still had some fight left in him. Our movie starts out with Adonis (Donnie) Johnson in a juvenile detention, the walls are cold and pale, new inmates are being brought in then they go on lock-down as we find out because Donnie was fighting one of the bigger kids due to the bigger kid making comments about Donnie's mother. Donnie is then introduced to Mary Ann Creed, whom Donnie assumes is another social worker and Mary Ann says she was married to Donnie's father, to which Donnie asks the man's name. Cut to present day Tijuana, Donnie fights the good fight and wins a bunch of cash, goes to work quits, he goes to Delphi's where Apollo trained and gets cocky offering his car to who knocks him down first, he comes so far to fall too fast and Stuntman Wheeler hit's him and alone Donnie drops. Angry, Donnie goes home, when dreaming he's guided to another world, there's a hunger, a longing to escape from the life he lives when he's awake. However when he get's home Mary Ann catches him she gets angry and informs him of the sacrifices she made taking care of Apollo. But after many years of holding her head up high and hiding pain that burned inside she let loose, and it fuelled Donnie's selfish pride. Donnie leaves to move to Philly, meets his love interest, goes to Adrian's (Rocky's restaurant) to speak with Rocky asking Rocky to train him, eventually revealing he is Apollo's son. After us as the viewers find out that Paulie has died, when Rocky goes to visit his grave for Paulie's birthday, Rocky then has a change of heart and decides to see what the kid had. Rocky agrees to train Donnie, Donnie want's to make a name for himself, and Rocky tries to explain to Donnie that we're held captive by the sun, a sun that shines for only some. Rocky agrees to let Donnie fight Leo Sporino as his first big fight, going under the name Donnie "Hollywood" Johnson. Rocky pulls him from Leo's father's gym and brings him to a different one in a different part of Philly with a team to help train. I liked this part especially, because it was the perfect transition of Rocky from fighter to trainer, as Rocky became the Mickey character of this story, an added bonus of this is that Rocky was Mickey's age in Creed as when Rocky came out. It is one of the most perfect torch passing moments seeing Rocky happily dance around to the wake up song, and comment how "chickens are getting slower" as Donnie has no problem catching one. Just before Donnie's first fight, Leo's father comes and tells Rocky he found out that Donnie is Apollo's son, he want's to use it to exploit the fight, Rocky asks him not to and Pete agrees, after beating Leo it comes out the next day that Donnie was born out of an affair Apollo had. A disgraced fighter, Ricky Conlan, hears this with his manager, the manager wants to promote a fight with Donnie using his Creed last name, as Donnie doesn't want to because he doesn't want to be thinking he's just using his late father's name to gain fame. While training Rocky falls ill and gets taken to the hospital. After a little bit of time, Donnie finds out that Rocky has cancer. After getting into a fight and thrown in jail, he agrees to keep on fighting and training, if Rocky would try the cancer treatment he had previously denied as it didn't work for Adrian. The fight is set for Conlan v. Creed. Mary Ann hears of the fight and sends Donnie Apollo's Red, White, and Blue trunks to fight in. During the 12 round fight, there were a few good times Donnie had, and other times where he left himself arms wide open, wearing a sign that said "welcome to this place" and shows Conlan everything. Eventually getting knocked out, Donnie should have been dead knocked out, expecting no return, as he dreams as if to say "heaven save me" when he's down to one last breath, he hears a thunder in the distance and a vision of his father, this brings tears to my eyes. In the end, after fighting the good fight, through Donnie's training and Rocky's help each man finds family in the other, they held each other when they were six feet from the edge and thinking maybe 6 feet ain't so far down. Eventually showing each other that you don't have to be related to be family. I'm on the fence of the ending of this, I understand that they wanted it to stay true to the franchise, but on the other hand Donnie was a Creed, not a Balboa. They could have let the kid win. This movie brought tears to my eyes. I could (and probably will) watch it again and again and again, until they make a Balboa series with Robert Rocky Balboa III becoming a fighter trained by Adonis "Donnie" Creed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me keep this short and simple. Creed is a loving homage to the original Rocky movie and at points it certainly recaptures it's greatness. Adonis is a charismatic lead and is supported by Stallones best performance as Rocky Balboa. The whole movie feels completely in tune to the world the Rocky franchise created and it's always great to go back to Philly, Mighty Mick's Gym, Adrians and all the familiar places. Sadly the Spectrum is gone. It all feels so natural and fitting. The whole franchise is more than some dumb boxing movies because they chronicle the life of Rocky Balboa. So it's great to see him again and dealing with his problems. You may argue that the story doesn't break new ground but here it's a perfect example of not fixing stuff that isn't broken. Especially because Adonis starts his journey from a very different starting point.The music is a fitting mix of familiar tunes and new Hip-Hop stuff. Direction is beautiful, the fight scenes are done very well. Probably the best in the series. Long takes and certainly the most realistic in the franchise.The only minor gripe is the tradition of people getting hit way too much and too hard for me to stay invested during the fights.Anyway in conclusion Creed is the prime example for a spin-off done right. Thumps way up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky is back and as good as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed lands all of it's punches. Creed (Played by Adonis Johnson) is a character that you want to see win and succeed. Every time he is in the ring you are 100% behind him. When he is hit you feel it with him. Stallone as Rocky is as great in the character as he's ever been. Overall a stellar performance from the cast and I would consider to be one of the best movies in the "Rocky" family. If you are on the fence about seeing this movie I urge you to try it out. The biggest detractor from this movie is that it is full of clichés. But if a movie can take clichés and somehow make them feel new and fresh who can really say that is such a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unexpected Knockout, Ryan Coogler's Creed Is The Dark Horse Of This Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976, Sylvester Stallone scripted an underdog tale whose critical &amp; commercial success emulated its very own story for Rocky was hailed by many as the perfect exemplification of the American dream and turned Stallone into a major star. The sequels then began a quality slump and the franchise slowly faded into oblivion until in 2006, Stallone resurrected Balboa for one final round &amp; delivered a knockout that concluded the whole saga on a perfect note, something this cultural icon always deserved.Now Creed, at first, felt like a misstep after Rocky Balboa but Ryan Coogler has pulled off a rare miracle in this era of sequels, prequels, remakes &amp; spin-offs for Creed emerges as the surprise package of this year and is an underdog story for the ages that treats the legacy of Rocky with utmost respect yet has its own identity, thus working as that cinematic moment where the baton is passed from the old to the new. A perfect homage to that quintessential sports drama, Creed has that same old blood flowing in its veins, albeit in a new body.A spin-off from the original Rocky series, Creed tells the story of Adonis "Donnie" Johnson, the illegitimate child of Apollo Creed, who wants to step into his late father's footsteps and become a professional boxer. Quitting his stable job to pursue his dreams, Adonis moves to Philadelphia in order to get in touch with his father's old pal &amp; rival, Rocky Balboa, and tries to coerce the retired boxing legend to train him. Refusing at first, Balboa eventually agrees to mentoring Adonis but when his real identity is leaked, an unexpected offer arrives out of nowhere.Co-written &amp; directed by Ryan Coogler, who made his breakthrough with Fruitvale Station a couple of years ago, Creed is only his sophomore effort yet it's some leap for this promising new talent for Coogler takes a very risky route by attempting to script the next chapter of a beloved franchise but it all works out amazingly well in the end. The script is as good as his direction for the characters are nicely fleshed out while Rocky Balboa's arc is handled with great care as Coogler approaches his character from a fresh angle. And while a number of parallels emerge between Creed &amp; Rocky, Coogler's film is entirely his own.The technical aspects are skilfully executed &amp; there are plenty of moments that evoke only admiration. With majority of its plot taking place in Philadelphia, its street culture &amp; notable landmarks are sensibly incorporated into the picture. Cinematography is highly impressive for the camera moves around with kinetic frenzy while capturing each moment in splendid detail but the highlight is an entire boxing match shot in one unbroken take. Editing keeps the plot tightly-knitted, provides ample screen time to each character &amp; steadily paces the story. The soundtrack includes a few tracks from the original series but for the most part, it's an original composition.Coming to the performances, Creed features a devoted cast in Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad &amp; Tonny Bellew, and every one of them delivers the goods. Jordan further strengthens his acting résumé with another fantastic performance as Adonis but supporting him on the exact same level is Stallone who reprises his signature role of Rocky Balboa and it's been a while since we've seen him deliver such an emotionally powerful performance. Thompson plays Adonis' love interest but even her character shows some depth, thus making her role a bit more relevant. But it's the terrific chemistry between Jordan &amp; Stallone that steals the show.On an overall scale, Creed is an absolute knockout that borrows the right ingredients from its predecessors, knows where exactly to draw the line, successfully steers its franchise to a new direction, and manages to be just as rewarding for newcomers as it is for fans of the original series. While the boxing matches brim with adrenaline-rush &amp; testosterone-fuelled excitement, the strongest aspect of Creed is the mentor-disciple bond between Adonis &amp; Rocky for it is the core element that makes this movie work on so many levels. With clear understanding of what Rocky was all about, Creed perfectly recycles its source material for the new generation of filmgoing audience and is one of the best films of the year, one of the best sports drama in recent memory &amp; quite possibly the best start there ever has been to a spin-off series. Definitely, delightfully &amp; very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cookie cutter stamp makes this a must miss!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So if you saw the first Rocky movie, don't see this one. First, I would like to say I am a huge Rocky fan. Saw every movie multiple times, but this one was a cookie cutter of the first one with lazy writing. I predicted the entire movie, including the rounds fought, when the girlfriend comes back in, and of course the end. I was dying to see this movie thinking some creativity was going to be brought back into the mix. Boy was I wrong. I wanted to love this movie as I like Stallone and the other actors, but the predictability was the worst I have witnessed in years of movies. Why bother? There was one thing different I must say though...The audio in the ring scenes. I mean in all the Rocky movies the announcers voice is heard throughout the arena. Not this movie. It is like they are doing an audio recording in an office with the door closed. No echo or anything. I know I am nitpicking on that one but this is how the movie is. I was so bored predicting the entire film that I had to pick apart other things bothering me. Skip this one and go back and watch the great classic that you loved. Lazy writers in Hollywood continue with their hard work apparently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastically Written, Directed, and Performed Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed.As a fan of the Rocky franchise in general, with the original film being my favorite and a considerable admirer of the last film Rocky Balboa I awaited Creed with a high level of anticipation and excitement.Do not mistake this as another addition to the Rocky franchise, this is very much the story of "Adonis Creed" played superbly by Micheal B. Johnson. It is his journey we follow, in which Rocky Balboa becomes intertwined. The way in which elements of the franchise are incorporated is brilliant and never too sentimental. This is the film that really paints a picture of Philadelphia as a city and gives us an overwhelming sense of place by incorporation of its hallmarks and even signature food.Micheal B. Johnson gives an honest performance as "Adonis" a young man trying to create his own legacy and overcoming the situation he is placed in. It's his interactions with Sylvester Stallone that are some of the highlights of this film. As for Sylvester Stallone himself reprising the iconic role of "Rocky Balboa" he is terrific and gives a stunning, emotionally rich performance and is genuinely heart wrenching in certain scenes. He retains some of his characters old sensibilities while adding a deeper more subtle layer to the role.However in my opinion the true star of this film is writer/director Ryan Coogler who does an outstanding job at visually as well as narratively telling this story. His use of tracking shots, long takes and close ups are masterful. In one particular fight sequence he uses one take to film it entirely, the camera serves in and out of the action showcasing every character movement, panning to "Rocky" in "Adonis's" corner, then panning back to the action. This sort of style was so unexpected by me going in to see this film as I have not seen any of Coolger's previous works, but he is a talent to be reckoned with. In another striking fight sequence Coogler focuses on the impact of the fight, showing quick shots of the blood hitting the floor and minuet details that are occurring around the fighters. He later uses color to focus all attention on the fighters themselves.Nothing is rushed in Creed and scenes play out at there own pace, allowing the audience to interpret character motivations. The script is fantastic and brings out the best in the actors, with certain monologues containing a deep grasp on there situation in the narrative. Tessa Thompson excellently portrays "Bianca" who plays against the female archetype that boxing films sometimes enable. She is a fully fleshed out character of her own, with as much depth as everyone else.As the story progresses the films becomes about so much more than boxing and its major themes freely run through, such as, making your own legacy, the importance of human relationships and the sort of effect someone can have on your life.Overall, I did not expect the sort of impact Creed could have on me and how deep it could really be. From phenomenal direction, affecting performances and an expertly executed script, Creed is a film that is a testament to the talent of writer, director Ryan Coolger. I am going to give it a 9.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Addition to the Rocky Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a new addition of the Rocky series that won't disappoint. The movie follows the adventures of Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. Many of the movie elements are similar to the original Rocky as Creed tries to pay homage to it.I felt Creed did a better job than Star Wars 7 when it came to originality. Creed felt more original. I brought Star Wars The Force Awakens into this review because that is an example of a movie that has recently came out and did the exact same thing.They both paid homage to their original films, but Star Wars kinda overdoes it a little. Creed has the emotional scenes, the action scenes, and a little romance scenes, this movie is no disgrace to the Rocky series. The music is different to fit the modernness, the acting is excellent for our 2 main actors, and Adonis has a legitimate reason for wanting to fight. The excellent bond from Michael(Adonis) and Sylvester(Rocky) is a great thing about this film. If you get a chance to watch, watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Really Rock 7</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie sequels thrive on similarity. Sequels either carbon copy the original or follow-up it up with something similar but different. "Fruitvale Station" writer-director Ryan Coogler's "Creed," starring Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, could have taken advantage of an obvious franchise title like "Rocky 7." Mind you, Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa, but he doesn't put on the gloves. Nevertheless, like his struggling protagonist, Coogler sought to deliver something similar but different with the Oscar-winning franchise. Indeed, "Creed" does carbon copy a lot of the original "Rocky" (1976), but the action occurs from the perspective of an African-American. Sophomore helmer Coogler and co-scribe Aaron Covington focus on the late Apollo Creed's illegitimate son, so the film qualifies more as a spin-off. An aspiring pugilist in his own right who since his youth has refused to knuckle under to adversity, Adonis Johnson insists on carving out a name and a reputation for himself without exploiting his father's legacy. Like Rocky, Adonis has boxing in his blood. Unfortunately, despite his undefeated light-heavyweight record of fifteen knock-outs in Mexican boxing matches, our hero cannot recruit a trainer. Predictably, Adonis must surmount similar obstacles to those Rocky faced to arrange a bout with a champ. Along the way, Adonis redeems himself, respects the father that he never knew, and appreciates the mentor who prepares him for the arena?Rocky Balboa."Creed" opens in 1998, in a Los Angeles County jail, as a wayward youth, Adonis (Alex Henderson of "Supremacy") is getting beaten up by an older adolescent because his opponent uttered ill words about his late mother. Before the jailers can break-up the brawl, Adonis devastates his enemy. Later, as he is cooling off in a holding cell, Adonis is surprised when Apollo Creed's wife Mary Ann Creed (Phylicia Rashad of "Good Deeds") persuades him to come home with her. Subsequently, "Creed" flashes forward to 2015. An older, adult Adonis (Michael B. Jordan of "Chronicle") knocks out a competitor at a weekend boxing tournament in Tijuana, Mexico. The following day at work, despite having gotten a promotion, Adonis resigns because the job doesn't suit him. He fails to attract a trainer at the Los Angeles-based Delphi Gym where his father got his start. The owner displays nothing but contempt for him. An irate Adonis promises his Mustang to anyone who can deck him, and Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler (newcomer Andre Ward) promptly puts him to sleep. Adonis bids goodbye to Mary Ann, and relocates to Philadelphia, where he approaches Rocky about training him. Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) still runs the same restaurant that he managed in "Rocky Balboa," but his wife Adrian and his quarrelsome pal Paulie have both passed away. Initially, Rocky refuses Adonis's offer. Nevertheless, the tenacious Adonis keeps bugging him and eventually persuades the Italian Stallion to teach him. The training montages are both amusing and challenging. Rocky clocks Adonis chasing chickens in a coop to enhance his timing. While he sits in the gym reading the newspaper with his spectacles, Rocky has Adonis skipping rope and shadow boxing. At one point, Rocky changes the gym where they train and Adonis has to follow him on foot while he drives his van across town. The training sequences will make you perspire, but "Creed" never captures the gritty atmosphere of "Rocky." If you remember the original "Rocky," our woebegone hero earned spare change as muscle for a small-time Mafioso. Moreover, Rocky groveled under the harsh verbal abuse of a trainer. Comparatively, the college-educated Adonis has squirreled away sufficient funds to survive until his big break.After Adonis has settled into his Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, apartment, he finds it difficult to sleep because a downstairs dweller plays her music loud enough to make the floor thump. Adonis meets Bianca (Tessa Thompson of "Selma"), and they are attracted to each other. Whereas Rocky and Adrian in "Rocky" were eking out an existence, Adonis and Bianca are half-way up the ladder. Just as Rocky is transforming Adonis into a top flight contender, the former champ encounters serious medical tribulations that threaten to disrupt their best-laid plans. At the same time, Bianca learns that Adonis has been concealing his heritage from her as Apollo's illegitimate son. The friendship between Rocky and Adonis and their tenacity to survive everything that life hurls at them elevates "Creed" as an inspirational experience. Of course, the savvy filmmakers draw on our sentiments while Rocky struggles to conquer his medical woes. Naturally, things take an upbeat turn when a pugnacious English pugilist, 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (three time ABA Heavyweight Champion Tony Bellew), challenges Adonis to a fight on HBO. Tony Bellow's 'Pretty Ricky' is reminiscent of Mr. T's Clubber Lang from "Rocky 3," and the blood and guts fisticuffs will have you shadow-boxing before the bell sounds.Although he plays second fiddle to Michael B. Jordan's prizefighter, Sylvester Stallone steals the picture with a heartfelt performance. Stallone served as one of the producers of "Creed," but "Creed" doesn't channel the same vibe of Stallone's "Rocky" movies. The music differs considerably, and the bittersweet experience of another underdog who triumphs isn't entirely alike. Interestingly enough, this distinguishes "Creed" from the six previous "Rocky" epics. Coogler stays away from the cute dialogue that Stallone used in his movies. Meantime, the chemistry between the gung-ho Jordan and reluctant Stallone is palatable. They appear as a believable team, and Stallone doesn't have to ham it up to contend with his young co-star. A sizzling romance between Jordan and Tessa Thompson's hearing impaired nightclub warbler gives our hero added dimension. Of course, when everything boils down to the final, big bout, "Creed" cashes in on the unbeatable "Rocky" formula. "Creed" may not clinch any Oscars, though talk has been echoing that Stallone will land a Best Supporting Oscar, but it is contagiously entertaining, not only as a date movie but also as a movie about human beings without CGI special effects. A refreshing change from the usual "Rocky" antics, "Creed" pumps fresh blood into old franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky's legacy has been kept alive even after 39 years. Michael B. Jordan has been the real reason behind this movie being a perfect treat for Rocky and boxing fans. The end was more like the legendary Creed vs Rocky match from the 70's. Everything was great for it to be called a great addition to Rocky series. It was really great on the team's(Writer's/Director's) part to get the old school coaching with the modern day Philadelphia spirit.All was good about the direction, screenplay and acting by the leads. With films like Southpaw having released in the same year, Creed still holds a place. Emotions, memories and boxing makes it a good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a pessimistic and heavily critical human being. With that in mind, I want the readers of this review to realize that this movie is still one of the best movies that were released in 2015. If I were responsible for giving out a movie of the year award, I would hand it to this movie (though "The Martian" is a more complete movie and a close second to this one). This is not "just another Rocky movie". Instead, the focus shifts onto a man developing into his prime as realizes the legacy of the father that he never knew. Ironically, of course, everyone else is awe-struck by his parentage because of the great man that our main character's father was in life. There are plenty of Easter Eggs for those of you who are Rocky fans and want to reminisce in nostalgic memories of the Italian stallion! I will say that Rocky is no longer the man that we all remember him to be as old age has caught up with him and all of the other characters we knew and loved have passed away. This movie is emotionally moving, action packed, and it does justice to the Rocky movies. More so, this movie instills ideal values as it goes along and teaches the viewer that "yes life sucks, but you can choose to look life in the eyes and punch it back." Definitely worth the watch! I hope you enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't Rocky 7. It's Creed 1.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the events of Rocky Balboa, we don't pay as much attention to him. We're focused on Adonis Johnson, the son of Apollo Creed. He decides to pursue a career in boxing, and gets trained by Rocky. Michael B. Jordan absolutely redeemed himself from Fantastic Four, and kicks so much ass as Adonis. He is fantastic, and if it was up to me, I'd make him nominated for best actor. Tessa Thompson plays the love interest in the film, Bianca, and she's not that bad in the movie. The truly great performance is by Sylvester Stallone. He once again shows us that he is indeed the Italian Stallion. His chemistry with Jordan is phenomenal. They make you feel like a part of their journey from the bottom to the top. Ryan Coogler did a fantastic job. The score is good as well. As usual with boxing movies, they're a little predictable, but the heart is there, and it's great. Also, there isn't much buildup for the antagonist boxer who fights Creed in the end. But other than that, its perfect. That's why I love Rocky so much. Because of movies like this. Easily, Creed makes it at number 2 on my Rocky Rankings (behind the original). This is a great movie, one of the best of the year! I'm hoping there's a sequel down the line (Sly, MAKE IT HAPPEN!) I am confident that it'll be nominated for at least one Oscar. The script is great. The shots are fantastic, and the fights are good and bloody. The blood gets gross at one point, but that's what I'd expect from boxing. Just like Rocky, however, it is really predictable and has a similar story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reinventing an old franchise that has a lot of miles, as well as imitators, seems like a challenge. Kind of like a long shot underdog pulling an upset. Creed is not just a story about a raw underdog boxer surprising the boxing establishment, it's as much a surprise Rocky as a franchise is not dead. Some folks have said it's as good or better than the original. That's high praise, but does Creed live up to it? Overall, yes.Creed's most awkward moments are in the first 20-minutes. The back story feels a little forced and not as compelling as it wants to be. That soon fades and Creed makes barely a misstep in the rebuilding of the most popular on screen boxing saga in modern times. There is lots of conflict outside the ring as well as a brotherhood forged literally in life's hard knocks. Even as it feels predictable it just works. This is a completely engaging and entertaining story. Rocky passes the torch. This is a movie with a rich character who, finally, doesn't have to carry the show singlehandedly - and at this date it totally feels right. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Championship Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.5/5 stars"Creed" brings the "Rocky" franchise off the mat for a surprisingly effective seventh round that extends the boxer's saga in interesting new directions while staying true to its classic predecessors' roots. After "Rocky" and its immediate sequel, this is the best film of the series, and worthy of the championship belt. Director Ryan Coogler ("Fruitvale Station") infuses his film with a genuine passion and un-ironic attachment to the original's best qualities, particularly its delicate balancing act between anguish and triumph.The surest sign that Coogler has honored his source material is that "Creed" is populist cinema through and through. His achievement is that he gives his audience exactly what they want and makes it feel like a gift rather than a bribe. But Coogler manages to soar beyond simply making an entertaining boxing movie by infusing "Creed" with a chief detail that makes it so good: perspective. The smartest thing Sylvester Stallone did was to not write and/or direct this film. Ryan Coogler brings a fresh set of eyes to the project. "Creed" works both as part of a larger franchise and on its own massively entertaining terms - it's a loving look to the past and a confident glance towards the future, and most importantly, a triumphant return to form for the "Rocky" franchise that kept losing its way further and further since the third entry.Sylvester Stallone gives a spectacular performance in the film as he returns to his iconic role of Rocky Balboa. Stallone acts as both a mentor and hero to Adonis, delivering a heartwrenching and emotional performance that's should certainly snag him an Academy Award nomination, and had it not been for Idris Elba's bone-chilling, spellbinding act in this year's "Beasts of No Nation", he might have won the damn thing, too. Still, after all these years, Stallone has finally turned to a dramatic role rather than adding another action hero credit to his sterling repertoire, and pulls it off with stunning aplomb that would leave even his most ardent fans gobsmacked. Jordan is perfect in the boxing scenes, and plays off Stallone admirably in the dramatic and emotional ones; their chemistry and relationship is the film's high point, even more than the triumph and tenacity of the pugilist's character."Creed" rises above its well-worn premise and delivers a film that's at once stylish, engaging, and ultimately moving. The gritty direction, sensational performances from Jordan and Stallone, and surprising depth packs a combination of punches that make the film both brilliant and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was worried about this sequel to the other Rocky movies. I thought the last one was a fine way to end the series, but Creed was a very nice addition. Its about Apollo Creed's son pursuing a boxing career with the help of the late, great Rocky Balboa. With some luck, he gets his chance to fight for the title without really proving himself at all. There are a lot of positives with this movie, with just a few flaws. For the positives, the acting was actually spectacular. Rocky movies can be know for some corny acting, but Creed was actually really good. Stallone in particular was a great surprise. He had, in my opinion, his best pure acting performance ever as he took Rocky to a whole new level. He even got rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination. The best acting came from Michael B. Jordan though. I'm disappointed that he isn't getting more recognition for his effort as Creed. He is a future star actor and played his part incredible. Besides the acting, there were a lot of great references to the old Rockys with Apollo and other stories from the past. For Rocky fans, these were fun to hear about and reflect on throughout the film. The story line itself even SCREAMED classic Rocky: bad guy boxer, up and coming star, love interest, training montage... The whole deal! I personally loved all the hints to the past and storyline that was similar to the original. The big fight seen was amazing as well. The fight was had back and forth action, huge knockdowns, comeback moments, and was just full of excitement! There is a lot to like about Creed.There wasn't much wrong with Creed. There are really only two aspects that come to mind. I don't think the love story was really developed as well as it should have been. Creed's love interest Bianco disappeared for a while and then comes back right at the end to cheer on the fight. I thought there could have been more of a reconciliation between the two. It just seemed too forced. The other downer was the villain boxer... He just didn't have the menacing look and character that Rockys usually have. I wanted a larger than life opponent, not just a villain. Creed is really worth the money to go see. It has the making to be a movie that will be remembered for a long, long time. Even if you haven't seen the other Rockys, Creed is an entertaining stand alone boxing movie. Cheer for the underdog and go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie. It's about trying to find meaning in life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting a tired worn retread of the Rocky formula, you will be pleasantly surprised, possibly even elated. This is a wonderful movie. It's about an elderly man who is living out the remainder of his life. All of his props - the money, the fame, the glory, the excitement, the action, and most importantly, his family - are gone. He's by himself. He has nothing to do with boxing, hasn't been to Micky's Gym in years; he's in quiet retirement, content to have his memories. Then someone enters his life: Apollo Creed's illegitimate son, Adonis. The movie is about him too. He is a young man in search of an identity. He doesn't want to be identified with his father. The two form a relationship, almost that of father and son, and bring meaning to each other's lives. This plot may sound corny or contrived, given that the context of the story is boxing, which is depicted in all of its ugliness and brutality. But the plot is sound and each scene intense and dramatic. Although ostensibly a sports movie, it's not about sports. It's about the human condition and about trying to find meaning in life. This is a great movie. This movie also contains Sylvester Stallone's finest performance in years, maybe in his entire career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Underdog Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a Rocky sequel that now focuses on the illegitimate son of the late Apollo Creed, who is now aiming to become a boxer without bearing the reputation of being the son of Creed. And as the story goes, it actually follows the classic underdog story of the first Rocky movie. The style may be a little more bombastic in comparison, but everything else is just the simple character study of an underdog reaching into his goal, except maybe in a newer generation. There isn't much novelty to it, but it's impressively put together, resulting into a surprisingly moving picture, thus it's kind of remarkable for its own thing.Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) leaves his pampered life with his father's widow to build this boxing career independently, by starting from the bottom and live at the same city where Rocky Balboa came from. There isn't much luck for this guy, unless he is trained by his father's old friend, Rocky, and we also get to explore their relationship and how Johnson rise the same way as Balboa did. So this might be just another underdog story, except in a different context: Adonis doesn't want to rely on his blood. He wants to establish his own self as a boxer. And while it's sort of following the same steps as the original, every moment feels genuine, like Donnie's determination, how he lives with this new lifestyle, how faces the decisions he makes. It has all the qualities it may get, but also having the consequences of acknowledging where he came from; the son of a legendary boxer.But the more stronger moments of the film is exploring to what has happened to Rocky these years. It's just a simple heartbreaking witness about the cruelty of time; how he lost some friends, how age has taken him over. The movie really spares no risk on developing this iconic character and that's what truly makes it utterly compelling. The filmmaking is downright impressive. People have been talking about the single take boxing match scene and what they're praising for it is absolutely correct. Everything else is just stylish, slick, but never misses the heart. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone are both terrific at keeping their roles engaging.Creed is easily a worthy sequel. The story stays compelling, the spirit of the franchise is still felt, and whenever it tries to revisit some elements from the original, they're not made for empty fan service, but rather does a part of keeping the film downright moving. Overall, it all works and probably even better than expected. It doesn't quite top Rocky since it doesn't quite have the exact same authenticity in character, then again, Creed is more of this generation's voice. It's relatable, dramatically effective and really earns its own triumph. It may be bigger in style, but it never overlooks what made it all special to begin with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting strong now! Gonna Fly! Creed is a welcome addition to the Rocky Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Rocky says in this movie, "You have to be stupid if you want to be a boxer". That is true given that the sport of boxing guarantees that your gonna get hit in the head plenty of times, and continue getting hit until your brain damaged enough that you have to retire. I once brought up the idea to my parents when I was in high school, around the same time I saw the first Rocky movie, and they told me they would hear none of it. Boy, am I glad was I told otherwise. It's not for everyone, but for the likable Rocky Balboa, it's a life.Rocky just may be the greatest sports story of all time, giving the chance of a lifetime to an underdog who never thought he'd amount to anything past the slums of Philadelphia. What drew people to this was how relatable Rocky is, being a tough guy, but also funny enough that we really want to see him get with Adrian and possibly win the heavyweight championship. Each sequel gave Rocky more opponents, new financial and health challenged, and something to morally fight for. This time, Rocky steps aside as a manager for a new boxer in the latest of the Rocky saga, Creed. It seems that Apollo Creed (Rocky's opponent/friend from Rocky I though IV) had a child through an extramarital lover. Young "Donnie" Johnson Creed is found in a juvenile hall center by Apollo's widow Mary Anne Creed and takes him in.Years later, Donnie (played by Michael B. Jordan) is boxing in the underground fights, while working for a successful securities firm in LA. He finally decides to leave his job to become a professional boxer, much to the displeasure of his mother, who remembers her husband getting killed in the ring (from Rocky IV).He moves to Philadelphia where he tracks down an older Rocky Balboa (played by Sylvester Stallone) who still runs his restaurant. Though Balboa at first says no to returning to the world of boxing, he changes his mind once he see's how skilled Donnie is. From training at Mighty Mick's (under new ownership) to fighting small matches, Donnie makes a killing. Once his identity of being Apollo Creed son is discovered, heavyweight champion "Pretty" Ricky Canlan wants a match before he retires/serves his jail sentence. Donnie not only struggles to embrace his father's legacy, but finds out that Balboa may have a life threatening illness. Having seen six previous Rocky movies, I expected this to be totally predictable and a retread of the original movies. What's amazing about Creed though is that even though it does tread through familiar boxing territory, it's still a knockout of a personal story. Unlike the Rocky movies where Balboa was dirt poor and came from the slums, we have a guy who had every privilege and is trying to go through the same path that his mentor did. He discovers a lot more about himself and his father then we realize and the movie end's up becoming a fascinating personal story for our hero.Michael B. Jordan is both very likable and relatable as Apollo's son. He represents everyone that has wanted to follow their dream, yet is afraid to risk what they have now. Sylvester Stallone tackles a new part of Balboa that we haven't seen before; older and weaker then he was in Rocky Balboa who's questioning his own mortality now that all his loved ones are gone. Though the boxing material is easy to guess, it's just done and shot so well that it feels fresh.I'll give this nine Rocky statues out of ten. Creed isn't just the best sequel to the Rocky movies, but is a guarantee favorite of 2015 of mine. Like the classic training song, you should be "getting strong now and fly" as you see this new chapter of the Rocky saga and see that is has more punches to throw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"1 step at a time, 1 punch at a time, 1 round at a time." Adonis Johnson (Jordan) is trying to make a name for himself as a boxer. He is very successful but no one is willing to train him. His mother doesn't want him to box and he sees his chance passing him by. He decides to look into his past and finds the only person he thinks can help him. With the help of a boxing legend Adonis wants to prove he is more than his famous father. I am a huge fan of the Rocky series and was very excited about watching this one. I was trying to temper my excitement though because usually when they try and reboot something they fail miserably. This is a bright shining exception. Michael B. Jordan is a perfect choice for this and Stallone gives maybe the greatest performance of his career. This movie has the feel of the original and is almost as good. It sacrifices the theatrics for an actual story that makes you care more about the characters then the boxing. This is a movie that I just can not recommend enough. Whether you are a fan of boxing or not you will love this movie. For the first time in I don't know how long I walked out of a movie wanting to immediately watch it again. Overall, not just one of the best movies in the Rocky series but one of the best movies of the year. I loved it. I give this an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lands Every Punch It Throws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the newest addition to the Rocky franchise that began with the Best Picture winning original back in 1976. Helmed by Fruitvale Station director, Ryan Coogler and led by Michael B. Jordan, expectations were pretty high regarding Creed. Furthermore, we already had Southpaw this year with Jake Gyllenhaal so Creed had some competition in regards to boxing movies in 2015. Creed follows the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Adonis, and his dreams to make a name for himself in the boxing world without having to rely on his father's name. The film is sort of trying to do the same thing with being apart of the Rocky franchise, yet still being fresh and original. Creed succeeds both as a film and as a tale of talent and heart in its central athlete. From a technical standpoint, the movie is nearly flawless. The music is inspiring and very reminiscent of 1976. The camera-work and editing is outstanding, some of the tracking shots left me with my jaw dropped. Furthermore, the montages that everyone comes to Rocky movies to see are hugely entertaining and just as good as the iconic original. As for the acting, Sylvester Stallone is better than he has ever been as the older, slightly out of touch Rocky Balboa. He walks the line between lovable and heartbreaking so well that he will definitely get a Best Supporting Acting nomination come Oscar season. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as well as the short-tempered Adonis who wants to be a fighter like his father before him, but stand alone. Tessa Thompson is believable as Bianca and Coogler managed to find a perfect balance between the romantic scenes and those of the boxing or drama with Rocky.Overall, Creed is a fantastic addition to the Rocky franchise, one that does justice to the original, but still manages to find its own way. The performances and direction are phenomenal. It's likely that Creed will see a few sequels in the future and I would be open to that as long as Ryan Coogler agrees to come back. For now, don't miss your chance to see this first one."One step, one punch, one round at a time."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this with a bit of tempered expectations. I am wary of sequels, even "honored legacies" like this, but Ryan Coogler, Jordan, and Stalone restored my faith. This movie adds an amazing personal take on the "Rocky" universe, and makes characters we come to know and love who join forces with characters we've known and loved for years. Storytelling and acting chops were showed to me I didn't know anyone assembled had in them (Especially sly). And lets talk about the Score! I've found a brand new assemblage for my "study/workout" motivational music. Ludwig blends the best of a beloved jewel of the 70's and 80's with the best of today, in all its grungy imperfection, and it was quite literally music to my ears, street, and orchestral, and club, and just utterly uplifting. This music made me see Adonis Creed Sprouting angelic wings spouting fire as he made a triumphant lunge punch on the screen. It just....captured me in the moment in ways that few movies have in recent years. I'd gush more, but I"m limited in words...Conclusion: Solid 9/10. A damn good movie, doesn't quite make my top 20 of all time, but easily slides into the top 40. Cornball and delicious with just the right amount of grit and real conversation to keep it grounded. See this movie. Even if you aren't into fighter movies, consider this one, its a damn good story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining watch, but not anything particularly special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to name the biggest and most prevailing issue with Creed, it would be that the movie saves all of its "sucker punch" moments (so to speak) til the third act, and because of that, the first two acts feel overwhelmingly uninspired.While there are things about the entire movie which are technically solid, for example the performances by all the actors were extremely put together and consistent, the lack of anything special cinematography-wise in the first 2/3rds of the movie made it ultimately a primarily visually uninspired watch.The second act birthed forth every contrived plot device ever conceived in film and all packed into about 20-25 minutes worth of screen time. The most painful of these involves the singular female character whose entire purpose plot-wise seems to be to be Adonis Creed's girlfriend and supporter. For the sake of not spoiling anything, I'll leave it there, but those who have seen the movie know the parts I'm talking about.That said, both the very beginning and last third of the movie are very solid visually and editing wise. The opening scene and fight scene boast extremely crisp editing, and the final fight scene is shot in such a way that it remains suspenseful throughout the entire duration rather than relying on the dreaded jump-cut to communicate that Fight Things Are Happening.The end also has some nice musical bits, but as far as the soundtrack goes, that's about the extent of the notable moments.Overall, I can see why someone would be very impressed with this movie if they perhaps walked in late, were caught up to the plot by a friend outside, and only caught the last act. But as a whole, the movie is not particularly impressive. The movie is relatively entertaining and save for some moments in the middle, mostly refrains from being boring. Give it a watch if you have nothing better to do, or if you just really want to see a somewhat satisfying resolution to the Rocky franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original "Rocky" films but still worth the watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I liked "Creed." I thought it was a decent movie and for the most part I enjoyed it.I think Michael B Jordan did an excellent job in the role. As did all of the main cast including Sly Stallone (Rocky), Tessa Thompson (Bianca), Phylicia Rashad (Mama Creed)and Tony Bellew ("Pretty" Ricky Conlan).I thought the story was pretty good (except for one major flaw that I will get to in a minute). It was a well written story with good character development and was well paced. I did think it lacked a little on the original "Rocky" films though.My biggest gripe with this film is with the main female lead - Bianca. That is not to say that Tessa Thompson made a hash of the character. Not at all. I think, as I previously stated, Thompson did a great job in bringing that character to life. I do think however that she was let down by a poorly written character, not worthy to become the "love interest" of the movie. I will explain why I think this.For anyone astute enough to realize, the original "Rocky" films were at their very heart a beautiful love story. Yes, it was about boxing but at it's very core the "Rocky" films told us of this beautiful journey of love between Adrian and Rocky. We got to see all the ups and downs in their life but through it all was this unconditional and eternal love they had for each other.We got to see these awesome character arcs as they both developed and grew throughout the films. Adrian was this shy, plain wallflower who wouldn't even speak and yet we see her over the course of the films grow into this strong, beautiful confident woman and mother.Rocky was a rough meat-head who was roughing people up for a loan shark and going nowhere in life. We see him develop into this caring and loving father who became a better man for the woman he loved because that was what he thought she deserved. The character development of these two main characters underlies the whole "Rocky" series and we can still see and feel the absolute love there was even after Adrian passed away.Which brings me to my gripe about "Creed." and the character of Bianca.Bianca is written as this selfish, self-centered, obnoxious gold digger who sees Adonis as a trophy to be on her arm.Adrian tried to protect Rocky and stop him from fighting because she loved him so much but she always encouraged and supported him. Bianca at first mocks Adonis about being a fighter then finally comes on board once she realizes he has a famous birthright. When it looks like her career is taking off she drops Adonis like a hot potato when he is going through a hard time and struggling to cope. Then, when Adonis's star begins to rise and he becomes a household name she injects herself back into his life. Hmmm. She clearly is disrespectful and a horrible person as she is constantly blasting music at 2 am and annoying her neighbors. Even when they ask her politely to turn it down she makes fun of them then continues to blast the music. .She only becomes interested in Adonis after she realizes that Rocky Balboa is his Uncle. A horrible, horrible person in my book. Not someone worthy of being the main love interest in this movie.I ended up spending most of the movie thinking "Adonis, why are you chasing after this terrible chick. Forget her. She is vain and self-centered and arrogant and rude and disrespectful. Stop wasting your time with her and concentrate on your training and you will find a girl who is 10 times better than her." So while the original "Rocky" films had you really caring about the main characters and wanting to see their love story unfold this film leaves you saying "run for the hills idiot and stop trying to get with this horrible shrew." The character arc for Bianca goes nowhere in contrast to how Rocky and Adrian both changed even over the course of a single movie. Bianca starts off as a horrible person and ends up as a horrible person and does not redeem herself in any way throughout the film.My only hope is that in the sequels Adonis leaves her and goes on to find the love of his life and be finally understand what true love is like Rocky and Adrian.All in all, this is a good film. It just lacks that 'magic' that the "Rocky" films had. The love story isn't there (well it is but it is very one-sided). Go watch it and make your own mind up. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll have to admit, I was a little skeptical when I heard a Rocky "spin-off" had made its way into theaters. The long-running legacy had made such a mark in Hollywood, that I found it had to believe there would be a noble contender in the ring. "Creed" not only far surpassed my expectations, but it was a total knockout. It was truthfully one of the best films I have seen all year, and I am an avid film-goer. The cinematography was enchanting; the perfect balance between an old-school, coming-of-age feel with the necessary modern twist. The love story intertwined in the plot was heart warming, and even as a female that has never been in the ring herself, I was on the edge of my seat during every fight scene, nearly having a panic attack until it was over. I commend Sylvester Stallone for his unwavering mark in the film industry through the years, and applaud Michael B. Jordan for an unforgettable performance.</fullReview>

Rocky always beats the odds with nothing but heart but to see him give up really was a sad moment but it was uplifting to see him "fight" cancer with the help of Adonis.One of the view movies that I shed a tear for and then cheered and clapped. It was a bit unrealistic for a guy with hardly any real boxing experience to come out and beat hardened contenders but why carp.The ending was predictable as rocky movies go but i wouldn't have it any other way.For Rocky fans go out and see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed - a new era for the Philadelphia folk hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky Balboa returns as Adonis Johnson Creed's mentor in Ryan Coogler's Creed. Who knew that Stallone still had some acting chops?Creed is about Adonis Johnson played by Michael B. Jordan who wants to be his own man and step out of his father's shadow. His early years as a youth were struck by group homes and juvenile detention, but Apollo's wife, Mary Anne, takes him into their lavish home. The movie jumps into Adonis as a 20-something promising boxer who decides to dedicate himself fully into the sport. He goes by Johnson to ensure that he's not cashing in on the legacy, but he has some difficulty in finding a mentor. He travels from LA to Philadelphia to find Rocky Balboa played by Sylvester Stallone to convince him to train him.The movie does nearly everything right. It follows the Rocky formula correctly with some deviation, and it has a good mix of a serious and dramatic tone with some bits of humor throughout.At first, the stakes aren't as fully realized since Adonis has a decent job and lives in a nice mansion with his mom due to Apollo's earnings. Despite the cushy lifestyle, he doesn't embrace it and he wants to make a name for himself as a boxer. As the movie progresses, his dream to be a fighter in his own right becomes more important and forefront, since he wants to become his own man. If he fails, he disgraces himself and the name. His dignity rather than his possessions are more important to the story.At times, the movie was a bit heavy handed in the dramatic department, but this was a nice generational shift into grittier and more dramatic movies since the ones in the 70s and 80s were a bit more light-hearted.Michael B. Jordan does a great job in playing Adonis or as he's more commonly called, Donnie, and throughout the whole movie, the childhood trauma of group homes and juvenile detention is evident. The need to be his own man rather than living in his late father's shadow is prevalent. His pain and memories are reflected in his training, motivations, and how he carries himself.Sylvester Stallone is natural as Rocky, and it's been a while since Stallone has done a serious acting job. The Rocky franchise is what he does best, and it brings the heart of his acting out. He's good at bringing humor in the midst of a serious Adonis Johnson.The mentor-student relationship between Adonis and Rocky was done well without being hammy at all. It hits all the right emotional and dramatic notes.The way the fights were shot were close. It was like watching a close to the shoulder 3rd person shooter. There are hardly any distant shots like from pay-per-view boxing. This closeness shows how personal and meaningful this fight was for Adonis. Throughout the movie, the camera-work was close- up as well.I didn't like the music as much in this movie, but I'm not a big hip hop and rap fan. I missed the classic trumpet-roaring Rocky music, but it's still in the movie but briefly and sparsely.This movie was directed well overall by Ryan Cooper and there are hardly if any flaws in this movie. It's tight and well edited, especially the fight scenes. The movie does have some references and homages to the previous Rocky movies. Some of them seem cheesy, but what's a Rocky movie without cheese?Creed is a good movie, but I didn't absolutely love it. I should have loved it, since it was well put together. I think there was no need for another Rocky movie, and that's why I didn't enjoy it as much. Nevertheless, it's worth it to see in theaters this holiday season. Creed is a worthy successor that begins the Rocky franchise in a new and refreshing era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great new addition to the series yet also stands alone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't freshen up on my Rocky series memory so I can't recall all of the history, but I do remember that Rocky lost against Apollo Creed but managed to stay through all the rounds in the first movie. I think that's about all the knowledge a viewer needs to go into this movie with though they hinted at other happenings, which left me a bit confused. However, this movie stands alone.The story works as a typical boxing movie with a montage of training and several fights to keep the drama going, all leading up to the final bout, this time in London. The juxtaposition of Rocky's battle with cancer and Adonis's training did add a new level plus the idea of legacy and proving oneself beyond the name we are given. I thought Michael B. Jordan's performance was stellar and he continues to solidify himself as a movie star. I have enjoyed his acting since back in the first seasons of The Wire and he was certainly not the worst part about this year's bomb Fantastic Four. Whenever he was challenging an opponent in the ring, I was instantly on his side and he made rooting for the character easy.Sylvester Stallone returns with another great performance as Rocky Balboa, though this time he is obviously to old to put the gloves on and fight. He was the source of the much of the emotion and I'm glad he returned to push his legacy as this tremendous character. I don't think there will be many more Rambo movies in the future but we'll see how Hollywood reboots that franchise.The directing was also brilliant by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station). This is his second time working with Michael B. Jordan. There is one exceptional fight scene in the middle that has no cuts. It may be one of my favorite boxing scenes in a movie. I hope the rumors are true that he will direct Black Panther because I can tell he would make that movie great. I need to see Fruitvale Station. Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) also did quite a job as the romantic interest. She is another up and coming actress that will be making waves in the film industry for years to come. Overall this movie will be considered as a top ten for this year. I think the only hold back is the familiar tale of boxing is such a retread though this movie did everything it could to break the mold. Eight out of ten stars!

		<fullReview>Well done Mike. You have erased Fant4stic from your resume.You never know what you're gonna get with the seventh film in a franchise? Well, I guess you do. They're usually terrible by this point. But frankly, Creed doesn't even feel like it's a part of the Rocky franchise. Just like Donny said, "I wanna make a name on my own."Creed is a fantastic breath of fresh air into the often slow moving boxing genre, and a terrific beginning of what might be a new boxing franchise. Ryan Coogler gives another brilliant take in the directors chair, and he's a guy that just really understands characters and how to make us care for them. And that was no easy task in this movie, because Donny wasn't what I would call the most likable character in the world towards the first half of this film. It wasn't like in Rocky where we already liked the main character, Donny had to earn our respect just as how he had to earn it from the world of boxing, and he did so with flying colors.The real triumph of this movie, however, is the return of Rocky Balboa. Stallone was unbelievably real and grounded that you were so easily able to forget that that guy's name isn't actually Rocky. I cared more about this character in Creed than I have in any of the previous 6 films, and Sly definitely gave the best performance of his career. And I loved that they kept all the little 'Rocky-isms' in there, like him bouncing the ball. Great attention to detail.The best part of this film though, was the fights. Creed showcased some of the most intense and nerve-racking fight scenes I've seen in a boxing movie to date, and the first one in particular was just a masterclass in cinema. It was all shot in one take, and the sound editing (which I won't spoil) was so engrossing that it actually kind of startled me. Verdict:Creed was a brilliant addition to an aging franchise, and with force cemented Michael B. Jordan as a talent of the future. Stallone gave one of the most compelling and human performances of the year, and other than a few muddled motivations and character decisions, this movie was the whole package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Stallone All the Awards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed, like each of its six predecessors, is ostensibly a boxing film, and quite a good one. There are two featured fights: the first is intense and natural, punctuated by an artfully effective long take; the second is pure edge-of-your-seat action that, as clichéd as it sounds, really pumps you up. Thankfully, however, relative-newcomer Coogler recognizes what makes these movies great: not the boxing or even the plot, but the people. Creed is by no means super-original, but its big-hearted script and punchy performances soar it towards the top of the Balboa heap. Part continuation, part spin-off of the Italian Stallion saga, we meet Adonis, the son of Rocky's one-time opponent / friend Apollo Creed, as he makes waves in the boxing community under the training of Balboa. Jordan, playing Creed, continues his assent to stardom, showing his hard-work and commitment in every frame. However, he still pales next to the Rocky character, one of the most lovable in all Hollywood cinema. Stallone wears Balboa like a wonderfully tailored old suit, playing the ever-deteriorating champ who, once the icon of running up flights of stairs, now struggles to get up a slight hill. Natural, funny, and ever-affable, Stallone puts himself deep in Oscar conversation, beautifully underlining his character's optimistic exterior with soulful heartbreak from years of loss. This unrelenting passing of time is highlighted in an early line of the film: "Time beat him. Time beats everybody; it's undefeated." But while this pessimistic realism may be the message, it is by no means the attitude; Creed is still very much a "Rocky" film at its core: unabashedly earnest and crowd-pleasing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed is Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like 'Creed' are the reason I go to the movies. Each year I slog through a lot of "meh" films and hope a few gems are sprinkled in. This is one of those gems. 'Creed' plays like a love letter to the city of Philadelphia, and it was evident that a love for the city was present. This movie is a worthy continuation of the 'Rocky' franchise and was truly a rousing effort. Sylvester Stallone is excellent, and Jordan proves to be a talented young actor. The direction was great, the score was perfect, and I just really enjoyed this film. The only negatives I can think of come with the acting of one of the doctors in the film, and the slightly unrealistic amount of shots landed in the final fight. If only real boxing were that exciting! That last one is a bit nit picky however, since suspension of total realism is a big reason I go to the movies. In conclusion, I really enjoyed this film. It had an emotional weight to it that you could feel in the theater and it even managed to bring tears to my eyes. That to me is one of the highest compliments one can give a film. It means that the emotions that the director and the actors were trying to convey to the audience went through, and went through with realism. That counts as a triumph in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice surprise in a rather disapointting year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like when movies describe themselves in-between the dialog lines. In one point of the movie, Adonis Johnson explains that he doesn't want to carry Apollo Creed's last name because he wants to build his own legacy. Mocking him in his response, his opponent refers to Rocky as a real legacy, and doubts the young Johnson could ever get close to that level. Now let's put this dialog out of the movie and into the context of the production of the film. Rocky is without a doubt a legacy. Six movies under the belt, with the first one released in 1976. Creed is a Young spin off with audiences doubting it could compete with a massive franchise. Well, to avoid spoilers I won't tell you if Adonis Johnson was able to live up to the expectations as a boxer, but I can assure you that Creed met and surpassed this reviewer's expectations as a movie. There's something about the direction that makes you feel every punch that Michael B Jordan takes. Ryan Coogler is definitely talented. In his second film after the very-well-developed- but-not-so-exciting Fruitvale Station, you can tell that the 29-year-old director is going places. The acting is engaging. Stallone is and always will be Rocky. No doubt about that. Jordan is solid and he needs to do more justice to his talent. This means more Fruitvale Station and less Fantastic Four and Awkward Moment roles. Altogether, Creed tells an interesting story at a welcomed pace. It serves to show Hollywood that you can exploit your Golden egg goose all you want, but you need some new twists and less recurrent clichés to keep the story interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legacy is in safe hands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I am not a mistake." Creed is fantastic. Ryan Coogler is an exceptional director. So he proves whilst taking beautiful and perfect long uncut shots. The best ones are the ones where he gives an impeccable follow up to Jordan by constantly staying behind him and during the fights wherein he changes perspective by dangling right next to the fighters. Knockout shots are gorgeous too as they have been given an abrupt closure and a splendid follow through.A brilliantly written plot which also runs into a sub-plot at one point. But the bottom line of the tale is that the Creed son is bent on proving himself to the world and he wouldn't stop at nothing to prove his genes. Period. Melodramatic scenes are brilliantly shot. The drama is deep. Screenplay outstanding! So many great words in there that are worth listening to. A little bit of humour has been thrown in to make the product look complete and to keep everyone interested. Fight scenes are arresting. A perfect take of how things really work in today's boxing arena. The way the boxers enter into a mobile lit backdrop with a super-rad music is breathtaking. Watch out for the Conlan entry! Balboa: The nicest trainer one could have ever asked for. Jordan's walk towards the arena has been complemented endearingly by Balboa, as not even for a second he removes his hand from Jordan's shoulders. Talk about support eh! His refined pep talks and soothing words constantly keep Jordan in game. His legacy isn't lost at all. There are moments wherein praises are showered and things have been hinted from the past. Every bit subtly shown, not elongated to capture the new.Johnson: He has surprised us all. From the trailers it was hard to tell, but somewhere inside we were feeling he wouldn't be enough to fill them large Rocky shoes. But boy did he prove us wrong! With marvelous acting and striking diligence Johnson was forever on his toes filling the voids and holes that could have possibly been arising due to Rock's retirement.The Rocky franchise isn't gonna die after all. With Creed in the vanguard things have gone into safe hands. Now we can die in peace!</fullReview>

I never felt bored at any point in the film, which is a testament to how great the director and cinematographer are. There are moments where the film was simply stunning, captivating, and honest. What made it less than perfect for me is the anticlimactic ending. It just didn't have the same overwhelming excitement for me as the original. Of all the Rocky films, I had Rocky ranked first followed by Rocky Balboa. I think Creed deserves to be right in between those two. Hoping to see Creed II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fist pumping awesomeness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as edgy as fellow 2015 boxing flick Southpaw, but tonally more consistent and featuring an equally brilliant central performance, this Rocky spin off delivers the sort of fist pumping sports drama you would expect. Following Adonis "son of Apollo" Creed as he channels his anger into a boxing career, there's little variation from the tried-and-tested cinematic sporting formula, but it's executed with such flair and intensity that barely matters. Taking on both writing and helming duties, Ryan Coogler's technically marvellous direction finds fresh ways to capture both the drama and the action, dispelling any thoughts that his fantastic debut Fruitvale Station was a one-off. The training montages are traditional yet electric, the emotional beats are occasionally a little too melodramatic yet still pack a wallop, and the showdowns in the ring are ferocious and exhilarating. There's a truly awe-inspiring mid-film fight that is shot in one, long continuous take (aided by some cleverly hidden edits), which stands up as a genuine contender for the best sequence of the year. Bulked up and bringing the emotional heft, Michael B. Jordan puts Fantastic Four far in his review mirror with a compelling portrayal of a man attempting to step out from underneath another's shadow in order to craft his own legacy. Sylvester Stallone shakes off the cobwebs to return for the seventh time as the Italian Stallion, thankfully toning down his usual overwrought acting to offer a subtler supporting turn as Adonis' mentor and surrogate father. Serving up a hugely satisfying slice of sporting drama, both Coogler and Jordan demonstrate they are young Hollywood players to keep a close eye on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the last 10 years, there have been too many remakes and continuations of old films. It's getting exhausting and annoying. What Sly has done though, is recapture the essence of the old Rocky films by starting a completing new journey. I enjoyed every Rocky film and Creed just brings a new dimension to it all. Every film is a reflection of the present or what was present at that time. Sly takes you a journey of a character that deals with what life has to throw at you. Now, the torch has been passed on to new blood still some-what family. Creed might probably be the best film I've seen in 2015. If you're a true Rocky fan, Creed won't disappoint. :) It brings potential for a sequel but it will be very hard to top. If this is the end of the Rocky/Creed franchise, it will seal the 7 connected films as by far the best film series ever made. At least, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Worthy Performances With Unnecessary Subplots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Creed' is a good movie with great acting and great directing. The humor kept me focused, bits dropped in here &amp; there to grounded an exaggerated plot and bring it back to reality. Director Ryan Coogler knows how to give a nod to the old 'Rocky' fans without pandering to an audience, but the workout montages were too much. I would have rather seen the story slowed down and not worry about time constraints.Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone have a great chemistry on screen. The one thing I like personally about Sylvester Stallone is that he's a high-profile actor who knows how to take a back seat to make the movie work. Sly is a humble man. Too many actors today (Tom Cruise being the perfect example) would have jumped on this role and put the sole focus on them. Jordan is young likable actor still proving himself in Hollywood and I hope 'Creed' gives him the attention he deserves. I expect great things to come from him.Phylicia Rashad is wonderful. She is an actor that can say 1000 words in a single look. She's brilliant. I found it sad that her character Mary Anne Creed was pushed into the background of this film. One can remember how the "Mrs. Creed" of Rocky 1, 2 &amp; 4 was the woman behind the bigger-than-life Apollo Creed; This would have been that character's moment to finally shine. Phylicia Rashad gets under-utilized as the character with the most direct family connection to Creed and Adonis Johnson.Almost the same situation happens with the Bianca character, played wonderfully by Tessa Thompson. Instead of making her background decor, she's arm candy in this film. Bianca is sexy &amp; beautiful, she's a talented motivated woman, but Ryan Coogler just wants her to be the new woman behind the bigger-than-life man. She progresses as a subplot that could be edited out completely without interfering with the story. I can't stand to see talented women like Tessa Thompson under utilized for a testosterone flick.The writing though ( damn) seemed like a lot of people were putting their own ideas into the story; It was over done - complicated by subplots of cancer, people refusing to train Adonis and the unnecessary girlfriend drama. The reason the 1976 'Rocky' remains so popular is because it was a simple down-to-earth story about a regular guy who gets an unbelievable opportunity. Adonis started out young &amp; angry thinking life owed him something and he held on to that belief for most of the movie. He completely ignoring any sense of humility ... even when he was humiliated.The editing provided that perfect single take two-round boxing match but then lagged into the main event. Of all the places you needed something closer to the OG 'Rocky' movie it should have been in the ring. The only thing resembling 'Rocky' in the ring was the bad fight choreography ... It's been near 40 years people, that's not how real boxing works. You don't wrestle &amp; spin each other in the corner and you don't stand still and take wide hooks to the jaw.All in all with some easy to overlook errors, 'Creed' is still a fun watch. It's got some Oscar worthy performances, not really an Oscar worthy piece, but it will always be a guilty pleasure for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How hard this franchise can get hit and keep moving forward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first trailer for "Creed", I thought "This movie, even though it looks fine, is another cash-grabbing flick from Hollywood". What I got, instead, is a beautiful progressive movie that makes me want more from Ryan Coogler and more from Michael B. Jordan (Let's just ignore "Fant4stic"). It is original (for a Rocky-sh movie), it's touching you right to the heart and it's realistic as no other before when it comes to the fighting scenes. First of, it's astonishing to watch "Creed" and realize that it's the Rocky V we never really had. To see Rocky as the trainer but in a supporting role is the perfect way to make that type of movie and I wish Ryan Coogler could go back in time and show to John G. Avildsen how he made it. The acting in this movie is delightful and the casting of Michael B. Jordan as Adonis is a perfect move. Jordan is really showing the fighter personality all along the movie and it makes the audience remember the first instalment in this franchise. To summarize, he is doing a great job in the continuation of the "Never give up" tag-line. On the other side, Sylvester Stallone is literally Oscar-worthy in this film. He is portraying the sad, lonely, sick Rocky at perfection. He is also involved in some really funny scenes like the "iCloud" one. Mary Anne Creed is also really well portrayed by Phylicia Rashad, who is sometimes dramatic and serious but also sometimes really humorous. Like I said before, Ryan Cooler is directing this movie like a master and now that i've seen "Creed", it only makes me wanna watch "Fruitvale Station", his other movie. In particular, there is this scene in "Creed", the first pro fight for Donnie, where Coogler is just handling the camera so well, shooting it in one shot. That scene is literally giving life to the movie. It makes you feel the fight and it's great. Beside, he really captured the tones and emotions of pro fighting and did a magnificent job in the Philly scenes. The score and the soundtrack are amazing, including Future and 2Pac as well as Ludwig Goransson, composing the score, which I also really liked (surprisingly) in "30 Minutes or less", and then again in this movie.Concluding, I must say that "Creed" is a impressive movie that reinvigorate the Rocky franchise by it's acting, it's outstanding directing, the original screenplay and the splendid fighting scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A championship movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CREED: If we're to be honest, Stallone has certain limits as an actor, but there is one character he does extremely well and that's Rocky Balboa, a character as iconic as, dare I say, Vito Corleone. In CREED, Stallone delivers a subtle, nuanced, layered, Oscar worthy performance. In fact, CREED may well get a Best Picture nom, as well as Best Screenplay and Director nom. I know I said the same thing about the other boxing movie, SOUTHPAW and it wouldn't surprise me if these two films went head to head in the Best Picture race. Unfortunately SOUTHPAW came out in the summer and CREED will be fresher in voter's minds, but I gotta give the edge to CREED mainly based on Stallone's poignant performance. Michael B. Jordan is riveting as Apollo Creed's son, Adonis, a self-taught street fighter who fought his way through foster care and is rescued by Apollo's wife who takes him in and informs him of his legacy. After several successful semi-pro fights in Mexico, Adonis heads to Philly, with all the nostalgia of familiar sights, to seek out Rocky to train him. These two strangers, who only share a common bond in Apollo, teach each other what it means to have a family and how to fight. Of course, there is the obligatory training montage but it's broken up in such a way that there is a degree of freshness to it. Like SOUTHPAW, the director puts us in the ring where we can almost feel the blows. The boxing sequences are masterfully filmed and exquisitely choreographed. In the finale fight, the whole HBO team shows up to give it authenticity. Everything about this movie seems to have been handled with love and sensitivity for it's characters. BTW, bring Kleenex. Score: 10. GO! It's a championship movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up on the Rocky movies, this film really hits the mark. The set up and even the ending does feel like a "paint by the numbers" type of effort but it totally works. Where it really excels is the emotional connection felt and utilized during the heart of the film and meat of the story. A majority of the emotional impact stems from paying off what we already know about the character of Rocky Balboa but it feels earned and right in place with the current story arc. I was moved and I was inspired, which is EXACTLY what should happen when depicting the swan song of a legendary character. Rocky feels like family because we've taken this ride, his life's journey, with him on screen. So, fans will truly connect with this effort far more than those unfamiliar with Rocky. Make no mistake, this is Creed's movie but, for me, the film rose to the realm of extraordinary because of Rocky's continuing life struggles. Overall, a wonderfully filmed and written movie that leaves things perfectly in place. I truly hope there are no sequels for Creed and that the line that ended the first Rocky actually comes in to play now. "There ain't gonna be no rematch. Don't want one."</fullReview>

The only thing I really didn't enjoy about it was I had a headache afterward from trying to suppress tears rolling down my face as I watched this film. I guess the main thing that hit me so hard, was seeing Rocky as an old man, passing the torch. I am a child of the 80's and Rocky was definitely one of the icons I grew up with. Stallone as Rocky put in a performance of a lifetime in this film. But the kids will enjoy this film as well; there was a kid sitting in front of me who started clapping loudly as the credits started rolling and the whole theater followed suit, applauding at the end. This movie definitely captures something a little magical. It was very well done, especially the camera-work, writing and acting. This is an instant classic that should be seen in the theater.

The only complaint I have is the training sequence I was left with a feeling of being short changed, I feel it needed to be more intense. The end fight was great, and some of the small subtle nods to past Rocky movies were amazing did you guys catch Rocky say "there is no tomorrow". The way going to fly now was used was perfect. It is a great start of a new franchise watching Creed take the title in Creed ll would be nice with Rocky at his side again. 8 out of 10 Thanks for your time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed is the Best Rocky since... Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a feeling this movie would be good but I didn't realize that it would be one of the best films to come out all year (my opinion). The story is phenomenal, the acting is great, and the cinematography is spot on. This is the first Rocky film that actually felt like the original and it's not even called Rocky. The movie is directed by Ryan Coogler who is known for the amazing Fruitvale Station and he brings just as much drama to this film as he did his last one. Let's talk a little about the story.Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is the son of Apollo Creed. He was born from an affair that Apollo had with another woman but Adonis never knew his father because of his death during the events of Rocky IV. Adonis does know about his father though and has a strong desire to follow him in the world of boxing. He decides to travel to Philadelphia and get some training from former boxing champion and his father's close friend, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone, who else). Adonis's time in Philly allows him to build a new career and, more importantly, a new family.The acting in this movie is absolutely fantastic, which isn't something I always get to say when Stallone is in a film. Michael B. Jordan kills it as Adonis. Adonis is out of his comfort zone but he's bound and determined to become a great boxer like his father. Jordan's range is incredible as we see Adonis's pride, anger, and vulnerability in this role. He also manages to portray the role physically very impressively. Sylvester Stallone returns to play Rocky Balboa and I have to admit that I'm impressed how well he did. I sometimes forget that Rocky was the role that Stallone won an Academy Award for. It sounds cliché to say this but Stallone really was born for this role. Rocky has always been a tough guy but he's also so innocent, it's hard not to like him. I also need to mention Tessa Thompson as Bianca. It would have been easy to just make her another love interest but this character is fleshed out with her own dreams and problems. It's nice to see more well-rounded characters like this. I'm not really familiar with this actress but she does a great job on giving us a strong female lead that doesn't need the male lead as much as he needs her.The acting isn't the only thing that's great about this movie. We once again get to see Philly in all of its glory and it is fantastic to revisit this city so many years after the other films in the series. We see night clubs, restaurants, and gyms and the great thing is that they're actually surprisingly true to the actual city. It feels like these films are as much a love letter to the residents and the city itself as it is to the sport of boxing. Speaking of the boxing, these are some of the best boxing scenes I've seen in a movie like this one. I won't spoil who he fights, but there's one scene where Adonis's fight lasts two rounds and it's one continuous shot. I was blown away that they were able to do this in this kind of film. It's not only one of the best Rocky films but easily one of the best boxing movies I've ever seen.I really don't want to spoil too much about the film so let me just say that everyone needs to give this one a shot. I always know a movie is good when it causes me to choke up while watching it. Any film that causes that kind of emotional reaction is definitely doing something right. Go out and see it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It might as well have been one long montage of scenes pulled from the previous six pictures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Los Angeles in 1998, young Adonis Creed just can't stop getting into fights. Whether it's in the group homes, foster families, or detention facilities he's continually rotated between, the urge to defend himself with his fists is in his nature and in his blood. Salvation comes in the form of Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), Apollo Creed's wife, who decides to raise little Adonis, even though he was born from an affair that Apollo had with another woman.Seventeen years later, Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) is working at the Smith Boardley Financial Group and facing a handsome promotion. But instead of taking the extra money and responsibilities, he abruptly abandons his honest future for the riskier venture of training at the Delphi Boxing Academy, where he hopes to go pro. When no one in L.A. will mentor the light heavyweight, Adonis journeys to Philadelphia to track down the legendary Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), who just might have a soft spot when it comes to coaching the son of his greatest opponent (and a dear friend).There are only so many training montages a person can withstand. But this seventh entry into the "Rocky" franchise doesn't let up with its seemingly endless supply of hand-thrusting, muscle-flexing, fist-pumping workout routines set to motivational music. In fact, boxing movies in general are being released so regularly that writer/director Ryan Coogler should have strayed away from such formulaic, unoriginal material. But, handed one of the most inexplicably enduring series in cinema, he clearly couldn't bring himself to refuse.In an attempt to bring one new element into the fold, the editing style has changed. But not always for the better. Sharper images and more complex choreography can't save "Creed" from the video game-like statistics that pop on screen in a completely terrible idea that drives the production further away from the realism it hoped to attain. It's as if the movie doesn't want to be taken seriously ? which is basically what happens as soon as Stallone makes an appearance as the famed Rocky, putting this piece of dramatic fiction squarely into the realm of fantasy.It's not all bad, however, as the first real fight (taking place somewhere in the middle) is shot in a continuous manner, never cutting away while hovering over the shoulder of each pugilist in turn as they exchange blows. It's only two rounds long, but the technique is mesmerizing, placing the viewer directly into the ring as if in place of the referee, scrutinizing each punch and remaining in the moment, even when the bell beckons the fighters into their corners. Unfortunately, a classic mistake is made when this lone, fascinating sequence can't be outdone by the climax (a traditional championship bout with an interchangeable, essentially random, undefeated opponent), causing the second half of the feature to meander with downhill momentum.With all of the redundancies in plot and imagery, "Creed" might as well have been one long montage of scenes pulled from the previous six pictures. Even when moments of humor highlight the motif of young versus old, or when father/son bonding edges in, or when the obligatory romance sparks between Adonis and his noisy neighbor Bianca (Tessa Thompson), or when the inescapable, inspirational sports drama theme of never giving up rears its ugly head, bits of genuine poignancy are lost on the stretched out running time and the clichéd interactions. The instances of heart are buried so deep that audiences are left with nothing but the excruciating pattern of training and fighting, training and fighting. At least Jordan looks very much like Carl Weathers.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CREED': Four Stars (Out of Five)The seventh installment in the 'ROCKY' film franchise; this one focuses on the adult son of Apollo Creed, who's now being trained by Rocky. The movie stars Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, as Creed and Balboa; and it costars Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rash&#x101;d (one of my biggest childhood crushes) and professional boxers Tony Bellew and Andre Ward. It was directed by Ryan Coogler (who also directed Jordan in his feature film directorial debut: 'FRUITVALE STATION') and it was written by Coogler and Aaron Covington. Being a 'ROCKY' fan, I really enjoyed the film; but it's not quite as good as all of it's critical hype (currently 93% on Rotten Tomatoes!).Adonis Johnson Creed (Jordan) grew up a troubled child; always getting into fights, for no reason. He never knew his father, boxing legend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers, in archive footage), or his birth- mother. He was raised by Apollo's widow, Mary Anne Creed (Rash&#x101;d). Now, as an adult, Adonis dreams of becoming a fighter, like his father. He travels to Philadelphia, to meet Rocky Balboa (Stallone); his father's old rival (and friend), and asks him to train him.The original 'ROCKY' is one of my all-time favorite movies! I've enjoyed all of it's sequels, as well (some quite a bit more than others). I was excited for this installment, and I really like the idea for the film; I was especially eager to see the movie, after hearing about all of it's rave reviews. Like I said, it doesn't quite live up to all of it's hype. I'd rank it about forth, among all of the 'ROCKY' films; but it's still a good addition to the series. It's classic Rocky, and Stallone gives another amazing performance, in the co- lead. He's still the star of the movie (even as just an elder trainer); fans should be pleased.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard a new Rocky film was in production I thought to myself "Man, do we really need ANOTHER Rocky flick?". And the answer to that is no. This movie was thoroughly unnecessary. That being said, Creed is great. It is in fact so good, it actually justifies its own existence.I am a huge fan of the Rocky franchise, the Rocky movies are films that I grew up watching. I've seen 1-4 probably a million times, those are the movies that actually inspired me to start working out. I don't like 5 and Rocky Balboa was OK. I would have never thought another good thing would come out of this franchise, so when I started reading and watching very, extreme positive reviews to this, I was shocked. I had to see it for myself. Now, even as a huge fan of the series, I have to admit, I think the only really good film, from a critical standpoint is the original Rocky. As a matter of fact, Rocky 4 is one of the dumbest movies ever. But I still love it and it's the one I've seen most times, probably. Well that has changed, because Creed is a great film, as well.This movie does such a great job at trying to recapture the feel of the original Rocky film, which was not really about boxing, but about the characters, an underdog stepping up to fight the champ. That's the main theme in this movie, too. Not saying the fights in this movie aren't great, though, cause they were. This may come off as bold, but the fights in this movie are the most brutal in the entire series. Every punch feels real, I constantly found myself saying "ouch" while sitting in the theater. The first fight of Adonis, the main character is wonderfully shot. The entire fight is just one, continuous long shot and was expertly directed. The movie is slow paced and it's really a drama that takes itself seriously, like the original film.Performance-wise, Michael B. Jordan was great as Apollo Creed's son in the film, but we have to talk about Sylvester Stallone. Wow, just wow. Stallone's performance is amazing, he really impressed me and what captivated me the most about him is that it felt heartfelt, it really seemed like this is a character he was invested in and because of his performance, I nearly cried during a few scenes in the movie.I loved the score of the film as well. It does a great job of taking fragments of the classic, iconic Rocky songs and making them original, I loved it. I have one flaw with the movie and it's that they introduce a character, who serves purely as a love interest for Adonis and for me it was pretty clear that they just had her in the movie as a manipulative device for the audience to care more about the main character, but it really didn't work for and it actually took me out of the movie. Luckily, she does not have that many important scenes or anything so it's a minor thing. I do think they could have cut her out of the film entirely and it wouldn't have affected it in any way possible.Besides that, I loved pretty much everything in Creed! It's a great surprise to see a movie like this. In an age of reboots and remakes, which many exist just to make a crapload of money, regardless of content, it's so amazingly refreshing to see a movie like this, which actually takes its time and cares about quality. Creed respects the original film, but at the same time creates its own legacy. A very good film.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed is a great movie that will amuse and move the audience. One step at a time. One punch at a time. One round at a time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a love letter to the rocky franchise as well as a beautifully crafted movie that stands on its own. Even though this seventh installment in the rocky franchise isn't as refreshing and new as the first film in the franchise, it sure feels new. The introduction of our new underdog Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) is told in a very fast pace. The narration of this film is focused keenly on the goals of Adonis to make it into the boxing world, like his father did. The style of storytelling by Ryan Coogler makes this film a pleasure to watch. Clichés in the story are told in such a playful and skillful way that it doesn't come off as comparable to the other movies in the franchise as it should have been. Adonis Johnson is a smart but troubled young man who has been fighting his whole life. His mother died at a young age so he gets in and out of juvenile detention centers and doesn't have a place to call home. Until his father's wife Mary Ann Creed (Phylicia Rashad) comes to take him under her wing in Los Angeles. Adonis is educated, smart and works for a big company, but he feels that working behind a desk isn't in his spirit. He decides to move to Philadelphia to start a boxing career. This story is truly about legacy. Even though Adonis does not want to take on the name of his father but wants to make it on his own, he does not want to shame the name of the late great Apollo Creed. When Rocky comes to serve him as a trainer and mentor, a new underdog story begins. Creed steps in like an underdog should do: Nobody knows what they are going to get, but the underdog knows what he is capable of. Director Ryan Coogler tells this story with confidence and isn't afraid to tell this story his way. A story of a young man who is fighting his way (literally) to the thing he is most passionate about is highly intriguing to say the least. A story like this is however told many times before, but Coogler found a way to keep the story interesting. The craftsmanship behind this film is the main reason why this movie is so great to watch. The acting, the script and the cinematography are the elements that are outstanding in this piece and are strongly correlated to each other. The main actors Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson and Sylvester Stallone are fantastic in their roles, and their roles are greatly written. Adonis and Rocky are both characters that have endured pain and loss and it serves as their motivators. However, this collective sentiment also brings up destructiveness upon themselves. Adonis becomes reckless and Rocky becomes world-weary. Rocky isn't a smart man, but he knows things. Life has taught him a lot and he has seen what time does to people. Everybody he loved has moved on and he stopped looking into his future, he is only looking back. He doesn't see that Adonis is there for him every day. The struggle and relationship between Adonis and Rocky is portrayed with the perfect amount of melodrama, and the natural chemistry between the actors gives a certain level of realness to it. The way the fights in the ring are crafted is outstanding. The fighting choreography, close up shots and camera movements gives the fighting scenes a raw, brutal and real atmosphere. Add awesome sound effects and a greatly integrated score of Ludwig Göransson and the scenes become a real pleasure to watch. The score of Göransson is a perfect blend between a new euphoric score and Rocky's nostalgic score which is a great addition to this film. There is a fight scene halfway in the film that is shot in one take which is done beautifully. Subtle transitions between wide shots to experience the fight, and close-up shots to observe the fighters brooding facial expressions makes this scene an intense and a truly amazing cinematic experience. Even though this movie is about legacy of the name Creed, one could say this is the legacy of the underdog story. Not the legacy of Apollo Creed to Adonis Creed, but the legacy of the Italian Stallion Rocky to Adonis Creed. This story is told to satisfy old fans and captivate the new ones. To continue the saga and to still stand on its own. Ryan Coogler did a phenomenal job and this legacy will certainly continue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've seen this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was extremely hyped for this movie and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed! I don't understand how some people think that it was terrible. I think this movie is a 10/10, from the beginning to the end. Michael B. Jordan gave his best performance yet and Sylvester Stallone as well. This movie brought the same inspiration that we all felt watching the original "Rocky" and the final fight scene brought a tear to my eye. I hope that Stallonne wins that Oscar like he won the golden globe award. He definitely deserves it. I was surprised to see that it was rated only 7.9 on IMDb. Although it did get a rating of 94% on rotten tomatoes and 82 on metacritic. It's very rare to see a movie rated higher on both rotten tomatoes and metacritic. Either way, this movie was definitely a masterpiece and anyone who disagrees is either dumb, or a hater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Turn for the Franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed (2015): Dir: Ryan Coogler / Cast: Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Andre Ward: Triumphant turn in the Rocky franchise. This film regards one's legacy. Michael B. Jordan stars as Adonis Johnson Creed who grew up in youth detention halls until he is taken in by the widow of the father who died in the ring before his birth. He was born out of an affair but legendary boxer Apollo Creed is his father. Adonis quits his job and, against his mother's wishes, moves out and seeks out his father's greatest opponent Rocky Balboa to train him. Reluctant Balboa finally caves but is met with health issues. Director Ryan Coogler of Fruitvale Station takes this franchise in a smart direction by concentrating on Apollo Creed's legacy. Jordan plays out the determination, anger, frustration, and ultimately the desire to win when he faces an undefeated opponent whose size exceeds his own. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky runs his restaurant tired of old fighting days but stands in the corner with new hope in his pupil. Tessa Thompson plays the romantic interest who is a musician with hearing loss and lives in Creed's building. Phylicia Rashad plays Apollo's widow who raises Adonis in hopes of steering him away from his father's fate. Andre Ward makes a good impression as Creed's domineering opponent in an electrifying boxing bout that holds up to any other in the franchise. This is an intelligent road to take with this franchise and it is presented with themes of hope and a strong desire to exceed even past a great legacy that one is tasked with comparison.

		<shortDescription>Why Creed is a great Rocky sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is an excellent 10 rated movie for many reasons guys and girls.First of all it is really great that after 40 years Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky and as a trainer.I would say that it is a 'must'.He is now what Mickey was to him and i believe that's very important.I believe so and Sly believes it too thats why we have in the film some quotes connected to previous Rocky films.I admit it, this movie made me cry at many scenes.I was really really surprised by this magnificent acting from Sylvester Stallone.This is a real life movie with many lessons, an inspiring one that motivates people nowadays.It is so so sure that people will watch this movie again and again after time.I recommend all of you to see it and rate it so we can thank Sylvester Stallone's work and encourage him for a sequel that has been heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up with the Rocky films and I have seen them all at least 20 times each. I had skyhigh expectations and I was very sceptical about Creed because of the new star, I was worried that it might be a new Tommy Gunn. But it wasn't, Michael B Jordan did great! This film lived up to all my expectations and i absolutely loved it. In Creed the boxing was way more realistic than the Rocky films but the boxing was still really exciting to watch. The Creed film does have the Rocky touch to it which completes it! At one point in his film I got really emotional and actually fell a tear. The film wasn't predictable at all either and it left me wanting more, if there is a Creed 2 that film will have huge potential. A Creed franchise might even be as big as the Rocky franchise. God I hope so! I really want more of these guys, the acting and directing was on point!Most importantly Creed gave me inspiration to keep fighting whatever is ahead of me, no matter what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's what I'm talking about!!....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adonis Johnson never knew his father, boxing champion Apollo Creed, who died before Adonis was born. But boxing is in his blood, and he seeks out Rocky Balboa, to ask the retired champ to be his trainer. Rocky sees the spirit Apollo in Adonis, and agrees to mentor him, even as he battles an opponent deadlier than any in the ring. With Rocky's help, Adonis soon gets a title shot, but whether he has the true heart of a fighter remains to be seen.......When this movie was first given the green light, it sounded like nothing more than a way to milk the Rocky franchise, and it kind of tainted the magic that the ending of Rocky Balboa gave me. After all, it appeared, well, it appeared to the audience, that it was the perfect ending to a much loved franchise.But it's here, and it doesn't do anything to taint either franchise, even if it's a spin off, and again, it proves that Stallone has wonderful screen presence, and his performance as Rocky is up there with his greatest performances.Like the original Rocky, and Balboa, it doesn't glamorise the monetary side of sport, it shows the struggles and the tribulations of wanting to make it on your own, and not to cash in on a legacies name, which is ironic considering the name of the film and how detrimental it could have been to the legacy of Rocky.The references to the franchise are there, but they don't hinder the narrative of the film as they've been used previously and at times are essential to the plot, such as when the titular character and Rocky meet for the first time, and the picture from the end credits of Rocky III is a talking point.Jordan is great as Creed, and doesn't try to emulate Weathers persona from the original movies.There is a sub plot involving health, and it does feel a little crow-barred to make the final act seem legitimate to the narrative, but with Rocky movies, there has to be an element of emotion, but where the others had subplots involving loss, and coming to terms with loss, this sub plot focuses on finding a reason to live a reason to carry on, as life gives a new meaning when characters meet.so all in all, it's a welcome edition to the franchise, wonderful performances from the two leads, and even if the final showdown isn't as iconic as some of the Italian Stallions fights, it's as brutal as ever, with some wonderful use of make up.Essential viewing if your a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael B. Jordan shows that he has the eye of the tiger in this Rocky spin-off. Creed is a hit. It really does go, the distance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This inspirational, action-packed, emotional driven, underdog story was a 1st round, solid knock-out! Written and directed by Ryan Coogler of 2013's Fruitvale Station fame. The movie tells the story of Adonis Johnson Creed (Michael B. Jordan), a young man with a trouble past, trying to forge a career of his own as a boxer. Intent on becoming more, he eventually travels to Philadelphia to seek out his father's old rival/friend, ex-boxer, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and convince him to become his trainer. Can, the illegitimate son of a famous late world champion boxer, make a name for himself, or will Adonis Johnson Creed, forever live, under the shadows of his father's legacy? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; despite, the fact that this movie is a Rocky spin-off, it still follows the same guidelines as any of the previous Rocky franchise films. (1976 to 2006). All the familiar schmaltzy tropes are there in this film, from the small touches of the iconic theme song, the training montage, and the clever shout outs film references. While, this makes this movie, somewhat of a predictable rethread; there still something to say, about Creed. It also gives something new to the table and doesn't feel like an accessory to Rocky films. Yes, it's true, that all the nostalgia Rocky mentions, are the reasons, why I went to see this film, in the first place, but even, if you take away, all of that. This film would still stand out as a really great film, after seeing it. There is plenty of new things, worth noticing about. I love how the new music by composer, Ludwig Göransson sounds so much more epic than any of the Rocky soundtracks combined. Despite, not being a huge rap fan, the hip-hop touch to the film, was indeed something new to the franchise and wasn't as annoying as I thought, it was going to be. The way, this movie shot, its fight choreography is amazing. It looks a like more realistic, brutal &amp; grounded, rather than older cartoony style of the last series of films. I love how the movie shows the fighter's fighting stats, before each fight. It really shows the pressure that Adonis is getting himself, into. In my opinion, this film doesn't feel like it's ripping off, any of the previous films. It's more, like it's changing how fighting movies are made. Fighting against the established fighting tropes, the movie shows a more complicated side of the main character. Unlike Rocky Balboa who came from poverty to become somebody. Adonis Creed has always been successful, but wants to have something more than his normal 9-5 white-collar job. He wants to do something, some people don't try. Go for his dreams. This make him, so much more relatable, than Rocky; whom chose to do boxing, because that's what he felt, he was only good at. While, Adonis has a chip on his shoulder about being Apollo's son and has demons to silence. He's well-intentioned, kind, and determined to succeed. In my opinion, Michael B. Jordan really does turn in, an outstanding performance, showing great details of Adonis's struggles of trying to figure out, who he really is. Yes, it does mean that, we don't get to know him as deeply as we did Rocky, but for me, in a personal level, I found the scenes with Adonis to be engaging. While, his relationship with singer-songwriter, Bianca (Tessa Thompson) was a bit underwhelming. I wish Bianca was given, a little more depth. She seem to be missing, a lot of it, compare to other boxing films, love interests. However, I did like how the character was hearing-impaired. I wish, the movie would explore that, a little bit more. I also like how, both Adonis and Bianca, were able to connect. I really did buy into their relationship. Tessa Thompson does well in her limited role. Still, by far, the best relationship within the film is that, of Adonis and his trainer, Rocky. The scenes between Rocky and Adonis are one of the highlights of the movie. Both characters have very good chemistry, and feels so much, more real than 1990's Rocky V's trainer &amp; trainee, concept. Watching the two men size each other up, figuring out what the other is made of, was enjoyable in this film. Rocky V, not so much. The sub-plot of Rocky trying to figure out, what to live for, after losing so much, in his life, is emotional tearful in this film. When Balboa makes his first appearance, it's hard not to root for him. We've known this character for years, and there's something fundamentally appealing about him. Rocky may no longer be an unrelenting fighter in the ring, but he's still the same generous, big-hearted, and humble guy that we love from the previous movies. Stallone is outstanding in this. Great acting from him. I hope he get nominated for an Oscar. He deserve one. The only problem, I had against Rocky's story is how their absence, Rocky's son, Robert from the film. I really didn't like, how he was mention in a throwaway line. I can understand, why they omitted his character, so they can show, how physical deterioration, Rocky has become, but come on! At least, they come had put Robert toward the end. Overall: While, Creed is full of Rocky references. It's not a cash grab type film. The story is driven forward by Creed and him, himself. Made with a lot of love, the film tells the dangers of boxing, while also showing the positive and negative effects of the champions, willing to make a living out of this sport. Films like this, show that it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard, you can get hit and keep moving forward; because of that, Creed is a must watch film.</fullReview>

First off when I first heard they were going to do a spin off of the Rocky series, I wasn't excited and I thought it was going to be horrible. I was completely wrong. Creed is up there with the first Rocky. Creed has fantastic acting, the boxing scenes were incredible. Just an amazing around. The acting was great. Michael B. Jordan played apollo creed's son so great, you believed he was his actually son. Now Sylvester Stallone. I thought they were going to show too much of him or he just wasn't going to try. I was wrong again, he was fantastic and they used him just enough, enough that you still know it's Adonis story. The boxing scenes were another amazing part of this movie. Every boxing scene was shot so well and so believable. Overall Creed was an amazing movie if your a fan of Rocky or just trying a see a great movie. A must see in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you're probably wondering why my summary says Fantastic but could of been Phenomenal, well let me explain, this movie surpasses any expectations I had even for a Rocky movie, people will immediately say this is not a Rocky movie it's Creed movie it's a new story, and you'd be completely wrong, this movie continues the story of Rocky Balboa and just like you see in TV shows like The Walking Dead where they dedicate a show to do a back story on some character and then integrate them into the current story, well the same is done here, you see Creed getting in trouble as a youth with a short temper and likes to fight, fast forward several years and he finds out he's Apollo Creed's son, at this point the stories are starting to merge and when Adonis seeks out Rocky Balboa at his Restaurant still in business years later then it becomes a continuation of the Rocky Balboa story, yes the focus is on Adonis Creed but it's a continuation of the story not a side story and it is told beautifully, the movie for me was better than Rocky Balboa and obviously Rocky 5, but for me Rocky 1 thru 4 are still my favorites and for me are all a perfect 10, I'm a die hard Rocky fan and Creed would of benefited tremendously from a classic Rocky score, some of the Rocky music is in there but for a true Rocky movie fan it's just sprinkled lightly here and there throughout the movie, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that we actually get a Rocky movie score and that's when people at the theater came alive, I got goose bumps myself and felt the music really should of been more faithful to the Rocky series and make no mistake this movie was great, I truly loved it but it would of gone over the top to perfect if it had the appropriate score, I have no doubt you'll see a Fan Edit version of Creed in the future with the score reworked to be more in tune with a Rocky movie when the Blu Ray comes out, I've seen it done before with the recent release of A9 Prometheus (A9 being the editor) and a true die hard fan of Alien movies re worked the story and score of the movie even added deleted scenes and gave it a more Aliens movie franchise feel to it and in my opinion an improvement, A9 even re-did the Alien attack scene at the back of the bay doors to the ship and made the Alien look more like the traditional Alien but with notable differences, and trust me a Creed Fan Edit will be done because that's already the number 1 gripe with Rocky fans, the music, I can't wait to see it, but for now this will be the next best thing, great movie I give it a 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***I enjoyed this film***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie on Thanksgiving and I was excited to see it because of the reviews but a little skeptical at the same time. Long story short I loved it. I know it was 2 hours long but it didn't seem like it at all. The acting was great I felt that the passion was there I never got bored or anticipated the next scene I just enjoyed every minute of it. I rated it in an 8/10 because I wish a few things were different, but it was good for the most part. I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic nature of the movie, it is definitely a film I would recommend. It was also good to see Sylvester Stallone in the movie he did a good job acting as usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard Creed was good. I had no idea it was THIS good. Coming off of the brilliant Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are back collaborating for the Rocky spin off, Creed. Knowing how well made of a film Fruitvale Station is, I figured Coogler was the right guy to helm the film but for some reason I was still skeptical about the project in general. The story itself is fascinating but I didn't know if it would be handled with the care needed to produce a quality installment in this legendary franchise. Not only is this a great boxing film, it's one of the best all around films of the year. Everything you love from the original films is here in at least some capacity and the nostalgia is at an all time high. I haven't seen all of the Rocky films but I love the characters and aesthetic of the series enough for Creed to emotionally resonate with me multiple times throughout the film. A lot of people are going to complain that it's too similar to the first Rocky, and while that may be a valid criticism, I think you can make the case that great films always take from the best. Creed has the best aspects from the original films and takes an original spin on it.Most notably being that our lead character, Adonis Johnson (son of Apollo Creed) isn't like Rocky Balboa at all. He has the passion and fire but his background is completely different. He's from Hollywood and due to his father being a heavyweight champion, he's well off as well. I really like this twist on the boxing film. As much as I really liked Southpaw from earlier this year, Creed really hits on all levels. The acting is getting a lot of credit and rightfully so. I don't know that Sylvester Stallone has ever been better. Michael B. Jordan, who may have been snubbed for an Oscar a few years back, is just as good. I think because of how good Stallone is in a supporting role, you don't realize how perfect Jordan is in this role.The directing from Ryan Coogler and cinematography from Maryse Alberti is marvelous. The camera work and shot selection alone is worth seeing on the big screen, and then probably seen again. All the fight scenes are good, but the first big fight Creed has is quite simply one of the most well choreographed scenes of 2015. It is all done in one continuous few minute take. I really couldn't believe how well that was handled.But by far the biggest thing I took away from this film was that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It knows it's a spin off from Rocky and it plays on that in a perfect way. Yet it also doesn't rely on the nostalgia factor alone, though it does have some great callbacks to the old films. It doesn't take unnecessary risks or try to do too much with its plot. It is just one of the best executed films of the year. The entertainment value is just as much if not more than the superhero films this year, and it also has a well written story, directed to perfection, along with a fantastic sound design/mixing/editing, with incredible performances all around. What's not to love about this movie?+Stallone at his career best+Impressive direction+Contained story+Awesome fight scenes+Sound design+Nostalgia 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Rocky movie since the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boxing movies usually follow a cliché script or finds ways to just completely ripoff its far superior predecessor (I'm looking at you Southpaw). Some take stories from real life, while others focus on a down and out person who pulls himself/herself together to fight for a living. The then come together and become the top of their craft. It gets to the point where the stories get boring. They're predictable, sappy, boring, etc. Creed might steal some clichés from boxing movies or previous rocky movies, but mostly it throws all the other clichés out the window. This gives audiences a refreshing take on the Boxing genre and a great movie in a long time.Both of Adonis Johnson's (Michael B. Jordan) parents weren't around when he was growing up. His aggressive and insurgent nature has caused him to get a bad-rap in the foster home that he lives in. His life suddenly changed when the wife of Apolo Creed comes in to adopt him. Apolo had cheated on Johnson's mom and left Creed's mom before he was born. He can now lives the life he's always wanted or maybe not. He's always wanted to follow the footsteps of his father without getting there with his name. He meets up with Rocky (Sylevester Stallone) to get him to train him and eventually is able to get into the sport he loves.Creed exceeds past its predecessors (besides the first one) because it does a great job of combining both the amazing parts of the Rocky series while giving audiences a new and fresh take. It doesn't want to ride the coattails of the past while still still staying true to the name, and the movie gives us those moments that made the franchise great. This small little awesomeness of irony in the story, is just one of the great things Creed does. Creed the movie doesn't want to be great because of their name while Johnson also doesn't want to get into boxing because of his name. It's an interesting parallel that really shows us that the director really does get it. He knows what the fans of the series want, while pulling in a new generation of fans.The best part of the movie is the acting within the grittiness of the movie. The movie has those amazing corny moments that people love from the last films, but the movie is grittier version of it's predecessor. The acting reflects this as Stallone really shows a broken down version of the once great boxer. His idea of knowing that the past is in fact the past, and he can't cope with leaving the past where it is. Also everything he's loved in life has pasted and gone. His career, his family, and his life has been transformed into something different. Both Jordan and Stallone show their acting chomps as their chemistry is great together. The script helps in this but it's really their performances that make you believe that they're this new family. Stallone gives his best performance, maybe even better than the original Rocky. Michael B. Jordan sells that he is indeed a boxer and the direction of those fights were fantastically put together. The cinematography brings to life the fight scenes and it feels extremely real. The choreography is best since the Fighter.The script helps the movie feel real as well. Johnson doesn't all of a sudden become this amazing boxer. It take months for him to train before his first bout. He has boxing all his life in different countries underground. Nothing about the script screams cliché and it doesn't scream for attention. I simply knows what the fans want and it produces that product onto the screen. Bringing back some of the original actors, characters, set pieces, etc., is something not really done anymore. At least not to the quality of this movie. Overall the script prevails without an overabundance of the Rocky formula, while still giving us that Rocky feeling. Also they answer the question of who won during the third fight of Apolo and Rocky.Overall, the movie is fantastic. The cinematography shows us the grittiness of Pittsburgh while giving the audience fantastic fight scenes that can rival any boxing movie. The acting sells us on the script as well, with Jordan and Stallone seeming like they've been acting together for years. This might be the most surprising movie of the year to some as well. Creed is the second best Rocky movie of all-time and might be the be the best boxing movie since Ragging Bull. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie for the long gone series of Rocky, since 2006 no one would expect another Rocky movie (or at least one to be good)40 years after the first Rocky movie we got an incredible beginning to a modern day Rocky (Michael B. Jordan) as Apollo Creed's son made this happen. If you watched the Rocky movies this feels more special, but if you haven't seen any, it would still be watchable! If you go to see this movie be prepared for many emotions, sadness, happiness, and anger. The movie seems slow at times but after you wont complain. The main character is not Rocky Balboa but he still plays a huge role to this movie as the trainer. Adonis Creed is the modern day Rocky ,Michael B. Jordan is a great actor, and in the future i hope to see another entry to the series.</fullReview>

I thoroughly enjoy Michael's role as Adonis Creed because you get to see how overcomes and perseveres. The movie is about motivation and fighting for what you believe in. After watching the movie, I felt like I needed to motivate myself to get in the gym. Another thing I would add is that you feel like you are in the movie itself. Creed is everything I thought it would be from my perspective. I felt amazing after the movie ended and definitely will see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The son of late great Apollo Creed enlists the help of Rocky in order to make a name for himself and prove his own worth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Rocky first tapped his gloves up to fight heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, I wasn't even an idea born in the minds of my parents. When Rocky steps back into the ring with Apollo after embarrassingly working at a meat packing plant, I was still six years away from coming into this world. It wasn't until colossal Soviet heavyweight Ivan Drago broke Apollo, shattering Rocky's world that I was conceived, though it would be another nine months until I came out kicking and screaming. Having watched all the films as a kid I continually found myself surrounded by those who favored Rocky IV, which features one of the most iconic beginnings, only to become a sagging punching bag in its remaining acts. Rocky trains high in the mountains and eventually trades unprotected blows with Ivan Drago, Russia's super soldier masquerading as a boxer. It's a big bloated boxing movie that acts as an ode to America and a polished finger to Cold War Russia amidst a time when the boxing sub-genre was starting to wear thin. Among all the training montages, "I will break you!" one liners and inaudible accents, there lies a ferocity that rouses the spirit and sets up the story perfectly, only to trip over its shoes and land chin first on the uppercut of the cinema spirit. When one witnesses Apollo Creed's lifeless body hit the mat, the beast at the heart of Rocky IV loses its claws, ultimately pawing at the screen in an attempt to bring new life into it.That's where Creed comes in, writer/director Ryan Coogler's second full length feature that once again reunites him with Fruitvale Station actor Michael B. Jordan, who ignited the screen as real life tragedy Oscar Grant III in 2009. Coogler takes the story of Rocky IV and deflates some of the excess muscle and brawn that it carried, focusing on the death of Apollo as the catalyst for his second round with Michael B. Jordan. Creed quickly introduces us to Adonis Johnson, the late son of Apollo, who is duking it in and out of foster care and juvi as a kid only to be introduced and brought home with his biological mother Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad). We learn that Apollo had an affair with Mary who got pregnant and gave birth around the time of his death, only to give him up to foster care being unable to handle the pressures of being a single parent. Flash forward years later in which Adonis has a stable job, a lavish home with his mother, and a budding underground boxing career south of the border living in Los Angeles. Looking to further his interest in boxing and take it to the next level, Adonis moves to Philadelphia in search of Apollo Creed's old friend Rocky Balboa, who he feels can mentor him and train him to the top.From the moment we see Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson, sitting in a dark, dank basement of an underground ring somewhere in Mexico, there's an intensity that permeates the air. His built physique, clenched jaw and focused gaze reminds us of what a determined and toned actor Jordan is, a blistering powerhouse and cinematic firework that works with a long wick, relishing the slow burn before exploding on screen like a lion protecting his food. You may wonder what Jordan has to protect, having chewed up the screen in the vastly under- appreciated Fruitvale Station, and the answer is everything. Stepping into the ring as Creed's offspring and Rocky's trainee, there's a wealth of history that accompanies this role, a history that both Jordan and Coogler can just as easily choke on if handled poorly. When we witness Adonis stare deep into his opponent, he isn't looking at his next fighter but at the core of what fuels him, what drives him to continue hunting and eating.Working against the hunger that reaches out of Adonis with both gloves on is a remarkably soft, and poised performance by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, who seems content at owning an Italian restaurant named after his late wife Adriane. Seeing his steadfast and content nature outside the ring recites a quiet life of devotion and love for what once fueled him. Stallone works with a character he wrote almost forty years ago and a character he directed for four Rocky movies, bringing a vast understanding of his nature that subdues and tames the fiery determination within Adonis. It's a role that Stallone never would have been able to perfect and fall into had he not been the age he is now, firmly understanding the patience and grace that comes with true experience. Near the third act there is a slight role reversal, as Adonis must cut off the gloves he's tied so tight in order to take care of his mentor that works brilliantly at not only developing our characters but showcasing the strength of the actors. Watching two characters from opposite ends of life's vast stage cling to each other for ample footing is cinematic virtuosity with finesse for storytelling. It's something only two actors at the top of their respective game, one rising while the other peaks can truly pull off, allowing us to bear witness to the power of film....Read the rest at www.reelbrew.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CREED (2015) ***1/2 Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Andre Ward, Tony Bellew, Ritchie Coaster. Fresh blood infused into the ROCKY franchise with Jordan giving it his all as Adonis Johnson, the son out-of-wedlock of Apollo Creed (and uncannily resembling Carl Weathers so that helps!), who decides to forge his own path to fame as a boxer despite the family (and familiar) trappings and pitfalls which leads him back to Philadelphia seeking out his late father's frenemy Rocky Balboa (Stallone adding some nice shades to his iconic character) to enlist as a reluctant trainer, aide de camp and father figure. Jordan reteams with his FRUITVALE STATION collaborator Ryan Coogler who double teams as director and co-writer with Aaron Covington that employs all the tropes of the film series (montage training sequences, big bout etc.) but make it their own that not only pays tribute to the movie dynasty but also gives it a solid punch of energy and entertaining to the hilt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sentimental tale and a journey of passing the torch of love and courage for a victory of life and hard knocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always been a fan of the "Rocky" movies as Stallone always does so good with them, as each are action paced and packed with ring action all while telling a story of life, heart, and courage. This latest installment called "Creed" picks up and follows the tale and journey in a fast paced and quick moving way of one young up and coming Adonis Johnson(Michael B. Jordan) later to be known as simply "Creed" as this young man guy is the son of former Philadelphia boxing legend and heavyweight champ and "Rocky" friend Apollo Creed. Starting with Adonis getting out of jail and reform school on the west coast he decides to moving back home on the east coast to Philadelphia with mother and you guested it he wants to follow in the footsteps of dad and be a fighter. Soon he meets "Rocky" in a restaurant and talks about being trained in the light heavyweight ranks. Slowly but surely Balboa gives in as Adonis is hot headed stubborn and with a high temper. Thru the ranks of hard knocks and life, Adonis learns about love, friendship, and commitment to people and Balboa himself. As "Rocky" reveals some bad news to Adonis before his big fight. Again this "Rocky" picture proves it's not if you win or lose but how you play the game and how hard you fight. It's a clear picture of faith and a tribute to courage and discovery of new life and a passing of the torch to the next and new generation of fists and hard knocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Rocky movie in years but still not as good as the original one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outside of the original 1976 Rocky film, the Rocky franchise consists of some decent films but none can hold a candle to the original film which still holds up today nearly 40 years since it's release, however Creed is a very good film and earns the spot of the second best movie in the entire franchise. The film does so many things right, the gym politics between fighters is an interesting angle, the boxing choreography is the best the series has ever seen but still not at Raging Bull's (one of my favorite films notwithstanding sports or boxing movies genre) level of realism and accuracy of how boxing matches actually happen. The acting is phenomenal, Michael B Jordan will be a heavyweight (boxing puns!) in Hollywood in a few years, Sylvester Stallone however surprised a lot of people with a very touching and emotional portrayal of a man who has lost his family and is just waiting for death. Stallone's performance didn't surprise me because I have always known in certain situations this guy can deliver, watch the original Rocky movie, the guy was nominated for an Oscar, he absolutely deserved that nomination, there is more to him than Expendables franchise.I would recommend everyone to check this out, as much as I liked this film I have to admit that it will not reach the iconic status of the original Rocky film. Primarily because the film had a few missteps in the editing department, the first half could have been shorter by 15 minutes or so, it was trying to be a cool funny film for everybody but I was glad that it ditched all that for intense heavy emotional drama in the second half. Another minor nitpick I have is I never felt as invested in the relationship of Adonis and Bianca compared to Rocky and Adrian, these films aren't about romance though so it's not a big deal. Further, I found Adonis Creed to be a lot like Apollo Creed smart, intelligent and charismatic, which is great and all but I prefer Rocky as the protagonist because he was a blue collared simple man who was not good with words but always got up after being knocked down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky's Golden Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought seven sequels and nearly forty years after the original, we would have a film that rocks as much as the original? What is truly amazing is how much fun, how uplifting, and how good "Creed" is. We have Michael B. Jordan proving that he wasn't a one-hit wonder in "Fruitvale Station", and he makes quite a comeback from the much maligned "Fantastic 4" to a fabulous tribute to "Rocky", which is an overall winning project, with the support of its original star, in a performance that might take him back his bookend Academy Award."Creed" brings Rocky and his protégé, Adonis Creed to a climatic fight in London, putting together a series of events that gives us background on who these people are, where they come from, and what a special relationship they have. It's a rocky road for all of the people involved, as the young Creed is fighting emotional trauma, as he is trying to discover who he really is, but he has problems with the ghosts of his past. We have Rocky, who has now settled down as a widower and runs a restaurant, trying to live in almost complete isolation from his past.There are many touching moments in the film, and most of them involve Stallone who shows incredible range here, as a man who carries with him a legacy, is now in the last years of his life and who misses the best things in his life, as both members of his family have gone away. There are plenty of references to the original inspiration for this film, but it doesn't dwell on it. There is a new star here, as Apollo finds his footing, develops new relationships and evolves into a new boxing star.Many of the fighters have a problem, involving short tempers, and this has proved to be the downfall of many, not being able to discipline themselves by focusing entirely on the task ahead. This is where Rocky shines, as the voice of experience, giving Adonis tips and sage advice. It is both professional and personal, and it rings with much sincerity, never becoming a maudlin joke.The film is full of exciting set pieces, and no one is going to be disappointing by the spectacular boxing match in the end, which is a work of art that shows the potential dangers of the spot, the beauty of film editing and that proves one can demonstrate how complex the sport is, without resorting to fancy camera work and excessive use of foul language. Here the kids are not hoods and not everyone gives in to violence. People have difficult problems to overcome, and it's not certain if they will always succeed, but it shows the determination of the human spirit, and it surely delivers a true winner and a wonderful crowd pleaser.</fullReview>

I like the way that the film is it's own thing, but there are parts it does homage to Rocky movies. Michael B. Jordan is great has Adonis, I believe his best performance since Fruitvale Station. Stallone is also great has Balboa, he plays the character now who is now past his prime, and at odds with his mortality, and he and Jordan play off each other perfectly.

		<shortDescription>The second-best next to Rocky, and one of the great boxing stories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the drill: Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) will either win or lose the last bout of Johnson VS. Pretty Boy Conlan, who has a few choice barbs sent Donny's way before the bout, just so we don't like him. It's an unavoidable formula done well by some solid performances from Sly Stallone and Michael B. Jordan.Although it sounds like I'm relegating this film to formula hell, it actually rises above the clichéd boxing story to tackle real issues such as family and disease with a legacy handicap each child must overcome (think Michael Douglas, for instance). The large issue here is Donny coming to terms with the shadow of his famous father Apollo, at one time the greatest boxer in the world.Never for a second doubt that Rocky (Stallone) will return as he always does in this series, this time as an old man who agrees to train young Creed (Jordan). Stallone is credible as a former heavy weight champion with life lessons aplenty. For that matter, Jordan has both the physique and attitude of a bloodline that brooks no defeat. Bianca (Tessa Thompson) as Adonis's love interest underplays nicely a role usually reserved for a demure, dismissed female.Creed is a solid entry in the boxing genre, not anywhere near the complexity of Raging Bull but good enough for a rainy Saturday afternoon at the movies. Come to think of it, that's a cliché that still works, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar but fresh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is the latest film in the 'Rocky' film franchise. This marks the seventh installment so far. But unlike the other films 'Creed' is not about Balboa. It is instead about Apollo Creeds son, Adonis. A smart, driven kid that wants to be like his father. A world class boxer. But he doesn't want to have to ride his fathers coat tails to be great. He wants to create his own legacy. As I watched this film an interesting parallel started to develop between this plot line and the film itself. 'Creed' is, in many ways, a lot like the 'Rocky' films but it doesn't ride on their success. It develops its own story and motives outside of the other films. And, like its main character, it achieves this. This is what is so compelling about this film. While it does follow a very familiar formula, it doesn't ever seem like it's checking things off a list. It is its own movie. This is in large part thanks to the outstanding direction from Ryan Coogler. A (now) sophomore director previously known for 'Fruitvale Station'.His knowledge of film is prominent. He understands that these types of films have been done to death. And if he is to make a successful film, it HAS to be different. So, he took a all to familiar plot and made it feel new with its fleshed out characters. Adonis isn't fighting his way off the streets or trying to make a miraculous comeback after a catastrophic failure. No, he a child of privilege that is tired of people treating him as such.The film also gives Stallones character, Rocky, a face lift. It shows him as an old man just going through the motions of being retired. But once he decides to train Adonis, that is when these characters really get interesting. There isn't many scenes of boxing in this film so the dialogue has to be good. Thankfully the film has both great characters and great dialogue.Which makes the slower pace not feel to slow. The conversations actually feel like they have meaning and aren't just trying to fill time. This is where the talented cast thrives. In these quiet, expression driven moments. While they may not be perfect, they are able to communicate what their character is feeling with a simple look or movement.There is a lot to like about this film. A lot that I haven't even talked about. Like the stunning cinematography, or the impressively choreographed boxing scenes. But I am limited, so lets talk about the few flaws that cropped up amidst all this. One that I already mentioned was the formulaic story line. If you have seen any sports movie then you most likely know exactly how this film is going to play out. Since I have, predicting what would happen next was fairly easy. This made the two hour run time feel a bit stretched. Especially since the film was still unveiling plot points in the third act.However, these are small errors in a film that, overall, exceeded my expectations. Cooglers tight script and direction really display his knowledge of film. This helps the film not just be another sports movie, but more. It is able to offer deep characters that, by the end of the film, you actually care about. And, as an added bonus, the fights in the film are awesome. 'Creed' is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rocky," a movie where the big fight at the end is almost an afterthought to the central love story and underdog tale, spawned four sequels, and while they varied in quality, it wasn't until 2006's "Rocky Balboa" that star and series creator Sylvester Stallone brought the character back to his quiet roots and found a nice coda to the boxer's tale.The new film in the franchise, "Creed," isn't a continuation or a passing-of-the-torch film, but rather a spin off in the best sense that manages to keep the Rocky character alive and bring him to new places while birthing a compelling new central figure.Ryan Coogler's film stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson, the illegitimate offspring of Rocky's friend and rival Apollo Creed, takes a little while to find its footing as it works to hide its protagonist's motives, but once the young Adonis and the old Rocky team up, the movie is magical. It has all of the heart of the original "Rocky" mixed with the goofy lightness of the better sequels.You know you have a strong film when the romantic subplot could stand on its own as a worthwhile movie. The original "Rocky" is a love story, but "Creed" doesn't want to copy the Rocky-Adrian dynamic or anything else from the classic 1976 film.Adonis and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) have a unique relationship, their own give-and-take, and it's compelling in its own way thanks to the excellent chemistry between Jordan and Thompson. The "Dear White People" actress is excellent as Bianca. Like Talia Shire's iconic Adrian, she radiates both intelligence and kindness, and Coogler's given Thompson some interesting conflicts of her own, as Bianca is a budding singer dealing with the fact that she's gradually going deaf. Just like Creed and Rocky, she's a fighter in her own fight.However, the real central relationship is between Adonis and Rocky. Coogler demands that we hold separate ideas in our head about Adonis' motives: he's a young man who wants to create a reputation based on his own achievements, and yet he also wants to be trained by the man who presents a direct connection to the father he never knew. It's both a rejection and a longing for Apollo, and I love that "Creed" puts a conflicted protagonist front and center where he knows what he wants, but he's not exactly sure if he's going about it in the right way.Rocky presents the other half of the story, and it's wonderful to see him take on the role of trainer rather than fighter. We meet an incredibly lonely Rocky Balboa in this film ? his son moved away, Adrian and Paulie are dead ? and there's a healing power in his relationship with Adonis. This isn't a father-son story; it's a friendship story, and it's heartwarming without ever falling into mawkishness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A One-Two Punch of Sentiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is directed and written by Ryan Coogler (Fruitval Station). It stars Micheal B.Jordan (Fruitvale Station), Sylvester Stalone (Rocky 1-6), and Tessa Thompson (Dear White People).The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed.Creed is the best boxing movie of the year and is tugging with The Fighter (my favorite boxing film) for the best boxing film of the decade. This movie was possibly the best time I've had in a movie theater all year. Writer/Director Ryan Coogler does it yet again and crafts a film that may be better than the original. This is impressive for two reasons. The first reason is Rocky won best picture and is celebrated as one of cinema's best. The second reason is, it is Coogler's sophomore attempt. This doesn't shadow Coogler as he crafts a masterpiece of boxing cinema out from the ruble known as the Rocky squeals.As a writer, Coogler dominates his heavy and thorny themes and builds them up to make one of the most inspirational movies I've ever seen. With more focus on Adonis' (Donny's) relationships with Balboa and his new girlfriend Bianca, Creed develops a unshakable dramatic core, that reduced me to tears in one scene. With that said however Coogler understands there must be a balance between melancholy and humor, and blends them well, to create a gritty feel for the movie much like the original. With that said, however, this movie, like its protagonist, strives to create its own legacy and largely succeeds because, unlike its likable protagonist, It embraces the fact that is a Rocky spin-off/squeal.As a director, Coogler works wonders, crafting inspired fight sequences that left me at the edge of my seat; especially the last fight. Though the seemingly unbroken shot fight was exceptional due to the great make- up work; the last fight pulls together not only the brutal action sequences the series is known for but also the dramatic core to end this movie with a finale that is wholly satisfying and mostly perfect.As for the acting in this movie, it was impeccable. Tessa Thomson, Bianca, more than holds her own against veteran Sylvester Stallone and pulls off a role that demanded a sympathetic, kind and overall delicate performance and definitely deserves an Oscar nod.Speaking of Mr. Stallone, he delivers a performance that can only be described as legendary. Shedding his 'macho man' exterior for a more feeling and broken kind of Rocky, He handles feelings of disappointment, grief, and self loathing in Oscar worthy fashion. His understated and often times heart breaking portrayal of the aging, quintessential hero demonstrates that no matter how many times Rocky pops up on the silver screen there is always something new and remarkable to learn about him. Micheal B. Jordan was absolutely, positively brilliant in this movie. The bright and shining star of this movie, Jordan once again demonstrates that he is one of best actors working today. Arrogant and obnoxious yet sweet and likable, Jordan lives and breathes in the shoes of Adonis Creed. This may very well be his best performance to date.Creed isn't a perfect movie but no Rocky movie is truly perfect. What it is is a powerfully written, exceptionally directed, and well acted movie that I have no problem giving an A+ or 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this spin off/sequel to rocky balboa, the film now has rocky in a mentor role in the way that Mickey was to rocky in the first film bringing it full circle. Being a big rocky fan, it was interesting to see where rocky story picks up now that he lost Paulie and facing issues of growing age and having to deal with his mortality, the story also focuses on Apollo creed illegitimate son Adonis Johnson creed who like his father follows in his dad's footsteps of being a boxer. He comes to rocky to help train him even thought the Italian stallion has no desire to return to the boxing world at first feeling he is done with that world but agrees to be the mentor to him and train him. It is interesting that Sylvester Stallone is the same age that burgess Meredith was in the first rocky film. Overall a rather touching tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky Reincarnated Himself In Form Of Creed !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 'Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI' world turned on it's back on the character of 'Rocky' which inspired several generations . Some realistically thought Rocky is too old to put up with fights any more while some thought his hesitant son would be the unlikely torch bearer of his inspirational legacy . However it is never a 'name' which bears legacy it has been always the 'karma' (action) which sets the contours of a legacy . This cannot be more aptly exemplified by this emotional action packed saga of 'Creed' which is not only the beginning of the rise of a new icon but also the recreation of the magic of 'Rocky' yet again .'Creed' is an emotional yet gripping story of a fighter who while struggling with his identity ends up being the student of the man who is synonymous with the word 'Legend' . Yes our own 'Rocky' paves the way for the rise of this new star who happens to be the son his greatest rival and friend . The movie goes through several emotional and action packed moments which will move you as well as enthrall you .Michael Jordan must be commended for a successful portrayal of 'Adonis Creed' who is so full of inner conflict , pride , doubt and love . Sylvester Stallone is a man who can never disappoint you as he switches over to the role of a mentor who is passing on the torch of his legacy to the young Creed . Tessa Thomson as 'Bianca' and 'Phylicia Rashad' as 'Mary Creed' have delivered strong performances which were necessary to support the character of 'Adnois Creed' .Direction of the film by 'Ryan Coogler' was fantastic as he never lets you feel that you are watching something outside the league of Rocky series yet he gives a distinct touch to the story of this new champion of a new generation . The Story and Script of the movie holds you and inspires you to no end . The soundtrack of the movie is powerful and as per the storyline and some of the tracks can give you Goosebumps like Rocky series has been able to deliver successfully in the past .On a personal level I was so impressed by the movie that is made me sentimental at times and gave me shimmers of inspiration while this saga unfolded . The boxing scenes were unbelievably realistic and well shot as after a long time I saw the crowd cheering and applauding as the last fight goes for a thrilling climax . So friend grab a movie ticket fast and witness the rise of a new Rocky in form of Creed . A Must see for every Rocky fan .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WARNING: Stallone does not yell anybody's name in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a spin-off of the Rocky series and follows Apollo Creed's son, Adonis as he seeks a boxing mentor. The film is directed and written by Ryan Coogler (The script was also co-written by Aaron Corvington), and stars Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. I think in ten years, most people will remember the performances in Creed. Michael B. Jordan is a strong lead and brings a determined energy to the underdog role. This is complemented by a reluctant Sylvester Stallone, who gives one of his best performances in years and gives candid and touching moments in different scenes during the film.The star of the film though has to be the fight scenes, which are beautifully shot by Marysee Alberti, who decided to use flowing long wide shots complemented by minimal cuts - except for the climax. Outside of the fight scenes the whole film is rich in great shots and there is one in particular towards the end of the film, which holds a lot of energy, and encapsulates everything the film wanted to show and I feel we will be talking about this scene for a while.By the way the score by Ludwig Goransson is pretty good, especially during the fight at the climax.Now the story, it is good, however it begins to wobble slightly during the second half of the film and by no means is it subtle, which is proved by the characters who just state what they mean, fortunately Jordan and Stallone manage to work around it. I felt the romantic sub-plot came out of nowhere. Other than those minor problems I found the film to be high entertaining, during the fights the tension and the stakes are felt and the father-son like relationship between Balboa and Creed is played out nicely however it is not too subtle.Now the sound editing is good for the most part, however in some scenes when Stallone is shouting- it sounds as if he is sitting inside of my ear with a megaphone. Also some of the make-up is distracting- I won't say any more.To conclude, I recommend you go and watch Creed, it is a very engaging film with some exciting moments. I know I will be buying it on blu- ray for the score and the beautiful cinematography. Creed has a place in my top five films of this year, therefore i am going to give Creed an 8/10 or a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MicroReels Film Review - Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few movie franchises can continue on to 6 sequels and stay strong, despite the different directors, musical composers and story writers. The Fast &amp; Furious franchise is one such example ? being extremely entertaining to watch even after a total of 7 films. But here's a much better example that outshines it. A much more polished, dramatically hefty and visceral punch to the critics and celluloid ? The Rocky Series. Ladies and Gentlemen, tonight's contender, weighing in at total awesomeness, is none other than ? CREED!I knew what this movie was all about before stepping into the theater. I did expect greatness from it, considering that the previous six films ranged from terrific films to decent ones. A pattern had been established at the heart of the series ? defeat leads to hard work leads to victory (personal or public). Rocky's journey from the first film to his hunger for being the best, never giving up despite getting hit hard both emotionally and physically, and never losing the respect that he had earned, is something that few people will ever forget. Etched into the hearts and memories of millions worldwide, the 6 previous films told the tale of an underdog that rose to legend, and defended it, all the while, with a heart of gold and fists of stone...........Continue reading the review at my blog:https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/11/27/creed-film-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh look at a classic, new and old meet in harmony. But, better on your home screen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is intentionally concise. Nostalgia can sometimes overshadow drama, though in this classic tale reborn in a new light, they seamlessly intertwine. Cinematography is top notch, still has shades of the series pilot. It was a heart thumper at times, has a touch or two of Stallone humor, and packs a surprise for those who think they can predict it's direction, think again. We loved this movie! I want to add something here that perhaps will reach one or two who could impact the future of motion pictures. We are a couple who usually watches movies at home, for a few reasons. I can say that honestly, the only reason I rated this film any lower than a perfect 10 is not the fault of the production itself. Our experience was interrupted by the setting: theaters are increasingly becoming overrun by immature individuals who carry in their hands the tool fully capable, combined with their own addictive behavior, of ruining the movie-going experience for all, and it's quite difficult to concentrate any longer. I am not sure I will be seeing many more movies in theaters. I'm just over it. We need, in every theater in this country, those ripping those tickets in half, warning theater-goers to put away their phones. This is getting really old, and it's killing a tradition. End cell phone idiocy now, please. See this movie! It is a MUST for every fan of it's Rocky predecessors. I want to suggest seeing it in a theater, though, you do these days run the risk of having it ruined by immature theater goers of all ages, who are incapable of dropping their idiot boxes. But if you can prop your foot up just right as to avoid the glare of the distractions, by all means, you'll find it a perfect investment in entertainment. I just cannot wait to see it again, instead, on my home screen- I know I'll enjoy it even more. Wishes for better. :-) Thanks to the producers of CREED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great continuation of a Great Franchise- Congrats to Michael B. Jordan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was overly impressed with the acting and writing in this movie. It's so hard to revive a franchise/build off a franchise, and they were able to seamlessly accomplish this and gain an entire new audience. This was the perfect movie for the family to see during Thanksgiving weekend. Now some of the kids want to see the original Rocky movies. You can't ask for anything more than that! I was moved by the storyline and I am excited to see what's next. Congrats to Sly Stone for delivering on all fronts. Michael B. Jordan has really developed into a great actor/leading man. He has a big career ahead of him. Newcomer Tessa Thompson delivered, as well. She was able to show us a bit of her acting and singing background. Overall, I would say that this is a must see for all ages. You know it's good when the audience claps at the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Creed' is a Powerful Knockout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Creed" is the latest installment in the "Rocky" film franchise directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan, SylvesterStallone, and Tessa Thompson. I'm just going to say this right off the bat, "Creed" is the best film of the year so far. The film feels so real and so raw that I couldn't help but be so invested in the well developed new characters and some of the veterans such as Stallone as Rocky Balboa. This realistic feeling thrives from the brilliant and energetic direction from Coogler. All throughout this movie I kept repeating to myself about how incredibly masterful each scene is brought to life. The directing is truly inspiring. Michael B. Jordan has absolutely redeemed himself from his dirt stain of the year "Fantastic Four". I could tell how much effort and training he put into the role because he feels so real as a boxer like it is natural. Stallone also serves the film with a wonderful presence as his famous 'Italian Stallion' role. Truly these actors created such heartfelt performances. The trio of Coogler, Jordan, and Stallone gave their all for this movie and I couldn't help but find myself shedding a tear or two. "Creed" was just absolutely overwhelming. Another element that added on to the overwhelming feeling was the wonderful film score. Composer Ludwig Göransson creates an epic and emotional score that enhances the experience of the film. My only picky flaw I have with this movie is something incredibly small. One of the characters Bianca, played by Thompson, has a hearing problem that really just feels thrown in for an additional emotional effect. It doesn't really go anywhere in the film unless the studio plans on making more "Creed" entries. See this movie; do not miss the best movie of the year. I am beyond excited to see "Creed" again. "Creed" is an absolute full price. Review Key: Full Price, Matinée Showing, Morning Showing, Rental, or Waste of Time. (If movie is shown in IMAX or 3D, the final verdict will include if upgrade to IMAX or 3D ticket is justified)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lasting Goodbye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think if you are a fan of the Rocky films, then you're probably deeply and emotionally connected to Rocky Balboa and his many battles. For those of you who haven't watched any of them, you'll find this movie still has a lot to offer.Sylvester Stallone returns for his final portrayal of Rocky Balboa, but this time a 69 year old restaurateur and a notable face still residing in Philly. Admired by many and respected by the residents of his home town, you meet him at the twilight of his life, working by day and still semiretired. He no longer wears the gloves but has surrounded himself with the memorabilia and photographs of his time in the ring. Enter Michael B. Johnson as Adonis Creed, son of Apollo Creed; a formal rival and friend of Rocky's who had passed away due to his numerous head injuries in the ring. Adonis has a chip on his shoulder, from a youth spent abandoned and forgotten by family. He picks up his father's career, despite his distaste for his dad yet more out of a deep and seeded need to prove his worth in the ring, if only to himself.I wasn't particularly impressed by the Adonis character to be honest, he seemed to lack any real conflict besides being really upset about his father, and as a talented fighter to begin with I didn't feel like he particularly had much to improve on. He is raised in a wealthy family, has a natural gift for fighting, and didn't really seem to change as a person throughout the film. I guess I missed the classic fitness montage that Rocky was all about in previous films as well.On the other hand, I was touched by the depth of character Stallone brought into this film. After a lifetime of forging a career as an action superstar, I never really considered him anything but. Yet for the first time I really saw his personality shine through his character and portrayal of a man past his prime and moving on into old age (aptly; not dissimilar to his real life). I wasn't really expecting much, and was a bit turned off by the previous film "Rocky Balboa," but this is the film I think they should have made it it's place. It is a perfect swan song to a character that has been on screen for 30 plus years, and inspired a city to build a bronze statue in his name.Overall, a very good movie. I would say you don't really need to be a fan, nor watch the previous films to enjoy this one.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another boxing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a fan of Rocky (I've only seen the first one and I did not think it was a classic by any stretch of the imagination) and I do not like sports films nor boxing films in particular. Many though have received high praise, but to me it always seems to be the same film. The difference is made by the actors and how much empathy they can get you to feel for their character and their plight. Now Creed will mean most to people who remember Rocky and the Rocky franchise films fondly. It will be a trip down nostalgia lane seeing their childhood hero has become and old man and the son of Apollo Creed rise by the aid of Rocky. But for someone like me, who looks at it as just another boxing film it doesn't have to offer much special. The story in itself is as cliché and straightforward as they come and the acting is very good but nothing worthy of an Oscar. This film is no Shawshank redemption ladies and gents. I watched it to see if it could live up to the Oscar hype, otherwise I would have just ignored it. Should Stallone get an Oscar for this: for me, no. Should Michael B. Jordan get an Oscar for this: no, too soon. For a better role than this maybe, yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky series has been a mixed bag over the years since it began in 1976, the best one has always been the first one, then followed the sequels, three were alright and two were terrible, this was the sixth instalment, taking a slightly different direction. Basically Adonis "Donnie" Johnson (Chronicle's Michael B. Jordan) is the son of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, born from an affair his father had, as a child he was serving time in a Los Angeles youth facility, before being taken in by Creed's widow Mary Anne (The Cosby Show's Phylicia Rashad). Seventeen years later, Donnie walks away from his security firm job to pursue his dream of becoming a professional boxer, but Mary Anne ardently opposes this, remembering how husband Apollo was killed by Ivan Drago in the ring, Donnie is turned down trying to get a slot in Los Angeles' elite Delphi Boxing Academy. Undaunted, Donnie travels to Philadelphia to find his father's old friend and rival Rocky Balboa (Golden Globe and The Razzie Redeemer Award winning, and Oscar nominated Sylvester Stallone), Donnie tracks Rocky down at his Italian restaurant Adrian's, named after his deceased wife, he asks Rocky to be his trainer, he is reluctant to get back into boxing, having previously made a one-off comeback at a very advanced age, despite suffering brain trauma. However Rocky eventually agrees, Donnie is trained at Front Street Gym, with several of Rocky's longtime friends as corner men, and along the way Donnie also finds a girlfriend with up-and-coming singer and songwriter Bianca (Selma's Tessa Thompson). Donnie defeats a local fighter, word gets out that he is Creed's illegitimate son, world light heavyweight champion "Pretty" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) is due to retire before serving a prison term, his handlers of want to organise a fight, Conlan offers to make Donnie his final challenger - provided he changes his name to Adonis "Hollywood Donnie" Creed, Donnie refuses at first, not wanting his father's legacy to overshadow his own legacy, but he eventually agrees. While helping Donnie train, Rocky is taken to hospital, he is told he has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, his wife Adrian died of ovarian cancer, despite going through chemotherapy, he is unwilling to do it himself, he has recently suffered the death of his best friend and brother-in-law Paulie Pennino, Adrian's brother, and already lost Adrian, Apollo and his old trainer, but he is forced his own mortality, Donnie urges him to get treatment. The fight between Creed and Conlan is taking place in Conlan's hometown in Liverpool, Donnie receives a present from Mary Anne, who is watching him on television, she sends him American flag trunks, similar to those Apollo and later Rocky wore, and the fifteen round fight begins. To the surprise of everyone, Donnie goes the distance and gives Conlan all that he can handle, there is a split decision, but Conlan is declared winner (just like Apollo against Rocky 40 years ago), but Donnie wins the respect of Conlan and the crowd, the film ends with Donnie and Rocky climbing the steps outside the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art together, like many times before. Also starring Graham McTavish as Tommy Holiday, Andre Ward as Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler, Ritchie Coaster as Pete Sporino, Jacob 'Stitch' Duran, Malik Bazille as Amir, Liev Schreiber as HBO 24 / 7 Narrator, Jim Lampley, Hannah Storm and Michael Buffer ("Let's Get Ready to Rumble!"). Jordan is a rising star and gives a great performance as the son of a champion wanting to prove himself in the ring, Stallone the "Italian Stallion" is a most welcome return as the former fighter turned trainer, together they are a good mix of the old and the new and a solid partnership. I had perhaps varied feelings of there being another Rocky movie, because of the mixed results of the sequels, but I was glad to know it was getting praise from critics, saying this was one of the best since the original, it is indeed, the fight scenes are exciting, the story has terrific emotional ups and downs, and it is well written, an entertaining sports drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old formula still works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it ain't broke, don't fix it.This seems to be the recipe for all rocky films. They all build on the same ingredients, and then it comes down to how you mix them and how you cook it.The first rocky film stands as a monument in film history, the true underdog film. It was made by underdogs starring an underdog that reaches the stars. It was a symbol of any mans dream, to become something, to fight for something and be proud of himself.For the most part in Rocky films, this "theme" became somewhat washed out. But the first one nailed it, and Stallone did a good job bringing the elements together again in 2006 with Rocky Balboa.But Creed is better, This is the second best Rocky film IMO. And it's almost a bit strange that i still find this movie enjoyable, it is at times very predictable, i feel i have seen this film 20 times already. The Rocky films are of course not the only ones cooking with these ingredients.But the chemistry between Stallone, Jordan and Thompson is great, and i mean great. This is what carries movies, when actors bounce energy of each other and builds a relationship right there on the screen in front of our eyes. Creed does this very well.I feel somewhat embarrassed for having doubts about this film. I was unsure if Jordan could pull it of. But you know, he did, my hats off to him. I first saw Jordan in The Wire, the TV series i consider to be the best ever made, and there he did a wonderful performance. But i could not see him as a bad ass that fights heavy weight championships. But Mohammad Ali didn't really look like he could either.But anyways, whatever doubts i had before the film, the film delivers.This is Rocky for the new generation. You don't need to have seen the previous Rocky films to enjoy this, but the film carefully makes sure we all remember what Rocky Balboa has gone through in his life, and Stallone delivering his best role in many many years.The direction is surprisingly good as well, making good use of shots and some impressive long shots. I didn't count minutes but one or more matches in this film is filmed without a cut. This is a sign, that this director is a visionary, that will go out of his way to get good shots to tell a story. I truly hope Ryan Coogler will chose his projects carefully and continue to deliver awesome cinematic displays in the future.Overall this is a good film. The "enemy" in the film was given little to work with, and that is a shame. So basically what we get is a sort of good vs evil. And it becomes a bit shallow to be honest. I wished there were room for something more there.But the movie still is about Apollo Creeds son, who is afraid to fight in his fathers name, scared he will bring shame to it. Rocky Balboa is the guy who decides to train him, even though he don't want to at first.Together They bring a good chemistry to the screen which lasts throughout the film. This was a worthy installment in the Rocky franchise and for some reason the old formula still works.7/10 - Quite Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A familiar and welcome mix of nostalgia and contemporary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Tis the season for the revival of two extremely successful and popular film franchises, each nearly 40 years old. Both stay true to their roots. For Star Wars that means big budget and ground-breaking special effects, while for Rocky, that means a personal mission and Sly. Writer/director Ryan Coogler and his Fruitvale Station (2013) star Michael B Jordan unite with the Italian Stallion himself, Sylvester Stallone, to add another chapter to a story we all thought concluded with Rocky Balboa (2006).Thirteen year old Adonis Johnson is an angry boy who doesn't shy away from fights. While being held in a juvenile detention center, he is visited by a woman named Mary Ann (Phylicia Rashad); she adopts him and fills in the gaps of his family tree. Adonis is the illegitimate son fathered by Apollo Creed, the champion boxer who died during Rocky IV. Mary Ann is Apollo's widow and she plops Adonis into her world of affluence, and sets him up for a career in finance. Of course, thanks to YouTube, Adonis studies his dad's old fights and promptly sneaks off to Tijuana to test out his own boxing skills.It's a foregone conclusion that Adonis will persuade his father's old adversary/friend to train and mentor him, and just like that, the owner of Adrian's Restaurant slips into a similar role made famous by Burgess Meredith. That's right; Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) becomes the Mickey to Adonis ? right down to the (slower) chickens. Sure, it's a bit formulaic, but that's the idea behind a franchise. We have a history with Rocky, and know that he is basically a sweet guy who thrives on competition. Here, he has to tame a wild, self-trained young boxer who is connected to him through history.The film does so many things right that it's easy to forgive the missteps. Adonis' love interest is a young singer named Bianca (Tessa Thompson), who easily could have had a more substantive role in the story ? in fact, it's a bit disappointing when she disappears for long segments. Also, there is a medical/health sub-plot that comes across a bit contrived and serves only the purpose of putting Stallone's role on more equal footing with Jordan's. Minor qualms, but annoyances just the same.What the film does right is create a terrific synergy between Rocky and Adonis. It's a bond both men need, though for different reasons. Stallone is so good as the aging Rocky that it's reason to forgive and forget his many cinematic foibles over the years. Also, the boxing cinematography from Maryse Alberti (The Wrestler, 2008) is stunning ? especially her extended long take in the ring during Adonis' first professional fight. For the final fight, Adonis dons a special pair of trunks and takes on the nasty, thunderous punches of "Pretty" Ricky Conlan (played by boxer Tony "Bomber" Bellew), providing some of the most realistic cinematic boxing scenes (right there with Southpaw from earlier this year).It's a relief that Mr. Coogler and his co-writer Aaron Covington avoided the expected cheesiness, and instead focused on the intimate personal stories while also paying tribute to the legacy of the franchise ? Bill Conlon's original score is heard at least once, the Philadelphia MOA steps have their moment, as does the Rocky statue that draws fans and selfies. Heck, there is even a disclosure of who won the Rocky III fight between Rocky and Apollo. It's that kind of nostalgia that complements this modern story and contemporary character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had a lot of heart! Wasn't as good as Rocky 1 or 2, but better than the rest of them. Worth a see! I like the fact that it doesn't rely too much on Stallone. Michael B. Jordan does a good job. I think he captures the role just enough to make it believable. Stallone gives a good performance. I think over time he has grown into his character much better. Since he is older he has a bit of wisdom to him like Mickey used to have and in a lot of ways is like him. When he talks you can see a lot of that in him.The fights were really good! Good story. If you like Rocky go see it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie in its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a huge fan of the Rocky Balboa movies, where this is a spin-off/ continuation off. I saw Rocky rise, stumble and get back up again through out the series. After the Rocky Balboa movie it was clear.. my beloved character wouldn't be able to take on the gloves in a believable way. So thats one of the angles of "Creed". Rocky fans will instanly know what Creed stands for and yes your suspicions are true. Without giving spoilers i think this was a good road to go by. It has its roots in the previous movies while still staying fresh enough to get the attention of people who never saw every Rocky movie or even none at all. Now why i only gave it a 7. Although this movie is good its far from great. It clearly shows its not directed by Mr Stallone. And even though its a tough job and the director did perform nicely.. it feels just a little off. Another reason for my grade is the explanation of the character and his background. I felt it to far-fetched for a movie connected to the Rocky series. They could have gone with a more simple and easier believable path then this one. Also some fight scenes bothered me greatly. Usually i never see mistakes in movies the first time i watch them. But here.. i did. A jab that doesn't land even close and still they try to sell as if it did, the special make-up for wounds inflicted. Not something i enjoy seeing.Still it is a good movie even though it could have been better. After all its just the first one. All the new characters have to grow in their role and this is a tough time to reboot or even continue an excisting franchise. It also answers small questions that were still unanswered. That really pleased me as a fan and for that i compliment the people who made this. If there is a sequel made then yes i will watch it. ALthough i hope everyone is more used to their role by then. I also hope more characters will return from previous ones. Especially old opponents.If your a Rocky fan you'll want to see this. Just don't expect a Rocky-like quality or even a Rocky Jr kind of movie. Its a Creed movie. Bare that in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aging with Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This my friends, is how you age with grace. I thought the Rocky franchise was a forty year old odyssey that that was one brilliant shipwreck away from an ugly demise. The original was a Great Movie, but it was never close to being equaled. Creed is most like the 1976 classic, and it proved that the series had not just one punch, but maybe even the steam to go another round.There is certainly a formula to these films. I was beginning to grow tired wondering how Rocky would once again be the underdog and why I should care. The protagonist switch eliminates this problem. I love the new Adonis Johnson character. Who is more compelling? A man with nothing forced to fight or a many with everything who chooses to fight? His backstory is fresh. Micheal B. Jordan sells this new suave smart protagonist. He is now an actor to look out for. His performance makes Creed's first third one of the best of the year. And of course there is Stallone. It is easy to forget how ridiculously talented this man really is. One can only wonder what could have been if his career had taken a few different turns. Rocky naturally fits into a new supporting role. The lovable meathead and his quirky charisma already possessed traits more typically found in a side character. The transition is effortless. Rocky's essence remains pristine, the feeling of nostalgia could not be stronger.The plot is a little less inspiring. There is a first fight conducted with brilliant cinematography/editing that punctuates a perfect beginning. What follows is a long decrescendo. The plot simply becomes predictable or boring. The new characters are not expanded in a compelling way. I will not belabor the bad, but the weakness of Creed's middle prevents any chance at true greatness. However, in true Rocky fashion, the film does rally. The iconography of the Rocky Steps can never be replaced, but we are provided with a memorable substitute. And a reevaluation. It is difficult to discuss the final fight without spoilers. This new champ is not Apollo, but the intensity that ebbed and flowed in previous sequels returns in fullness here. Satisfying without cheese. Creed provides nostalgia without any of the associated cheapness. Inspired and well made, this Rocky installment is the new model for revitalizing ancient franchises. Creed lacks some components necessary for an Oscar run, but will be remembered as one of the year's highlights for practically all audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary Anne Creed adopts his husband's son from another woman, Adonis Johnson. Years later Adonis yearns to follow his father's footsteps, fighting small arenas and quitting his job. He goes to his father's old training camp Delphi Gym, challenging the fighters there for his car until he gets defeated by a pro boxer Dan Wheeler. He moves to Philadelphia, tracking Rocky Balboa. He asks Rocky to train him. Adonis asks who won Rocky and Apollo's third unofficial fight, which only few people know. Adonis sees news about the undefeated boxing champion Ricky Conlan who is about to fight Wheeler. But it gets cancelled due to Conlan punching Wheeler. Adonis meets his neighbor Bianca. Later Adonis visits Rocky's old gym at Mick's but he doesn't get any attention. Adonis and Bianca get closer. After visiting Paulie and Adrien's graves, Rocky decides to train Adonis, taking him into his house. Soon the manager at Mick's, Pete, proposes a fight between Adonis and his son Leo. Rocky takes Adonis to Front St. Gym so they can train at different gyms than the opponent. On the fight, Adonis takes hard hits but he can knock Leo out in the third round. news spread about Adonis's lineage. Conlan's trainer meets Rocky and Adonis, proposing a fight between the fighters, to which they agree. But as they continue training, Rocky collapses. He has Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. Adonis eventually finds out about this and demands Rocky to go on chemotherapy. Rocky refuses, saying that it didn't help Adrien when it hit her. Adonis gets into a fight as he dislikes people calling him 'Baby Creed". Rocky bails him out. Rocky eventually takes therapy as he and Adonis make a deal that he will undergo therapy and Adonis will continue training. Adonis gains more local support as he continues training. Adonis, Rocky and their team fly to Liverpool for the fight. On the press conference Adonis and Conlan almost get into a fight due to Conlan calling him a fake Creed.Before the fight Adonis receives Mary Anne's gift, trunks with Apollo Creed's original colors of the stars and stripes. As the fight commences, Conlan easily owns the first round, cutting above Adonis' right eye. Later Adnis retaliates, cutting Conlan's left cheek bone. They both trade hits through the rounds. AT round 11 Conlan knocks Adonis down, but he gets up again. As the round finishes the doctor examines Adonis shut out left eye, but his team aids him secretly. Round 12 sees brutal hits trading and Adonis knocks Conlan down but he also gets up again. Conlan wins the fight with a split decision but Conlan acknowledges Adonis Creed. As Adonis gets interviewed, he admits Rocky as a family and states he understands what his father did.The movie sets a great new development to the whole Rocky saga. I am part of those people who as a child grew up watching re-runs of Rocky i through IV on TV. They do it quite often when I was a little kid so those movies stayed with me. They were some of the movies which helped me learn enjoy the more dramatic movies.The story in this movie feels so unique. It succeeded in merging the feels gotten from the old Rocky saga and the more contemporary feel of modern pop cinema. All the movie's aspects are comprised of these two aspects. You can see reminisces of the first Rocky movie from the remakes of some of the iconic shots like the gray sweatshirt running scene, the student-mentor conflict between Adonis and Rocky just like Rocky and Mick had, and most of all are the blunt references here and there to the old saga materials like the message on Adonis' training shirt.But the director Ryan Coogler did a great job in keeping the movie relatable to the contemporary generation by having the same feel on the non-sports drama like what Fruitvale Station had. The drama with Bianca feels adequately intimate and close without having to be sexually suggestive. Seeing that Sylvester Stallone gave a go ahead on this movie, I think it'll be a great start for the saga's new focus, all done without leaving the character Rocky behind. Further I think it'll great if the sequels for this can also revive the other old beaten characters like Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago; and even get in sync with the current situation in the real boxing world where we have also many renowned Latin American boxers.I also like how the movie adds something great to the saga technically as there are two long uncut scenes shot amazingly in close-up ranges. One of them is even a great full two rounds of boxing.The acting overall is adequately good. Michael B. Jordan did well in portraying the son who long for a father figure. Sylvester Stallone did great in adding a new stuff into the character Rocky as he faces illness. Tessa Thompson succeeded in elevating her role as not just the love interest. I think it'll be great if she can be Adonis' Adrien.I give Creed (2015) a score of 7 out of 10, and a recommendation surely. Especially for those who, like me, enjoyed the Rocky saga over the years, This movie nicely adds to all that without losing it's grip on the old stories and staying up to date contemporarily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed has potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the first Rocky film, and I suppose I like the other films in the series as well. Creed is a solid film, that has a good premise. Creed's illegitimate's son, trying to walk in the footsteps of a father he never knew. I can honestly say that I was with the film at the beginning, that premise is intriguing to me.But strangely enough, I think the film started to tail off when Rocky was introduced into the story. As someone else had said, Rocky's life had become a bit too depressing, with Adrian, Robert and Paulie gone. The old fire of the Italian Stallion was just not there, this is not how I would've imagined Rocky's life ended up.Anyways, back to Adonis. As I stated before, the premise of one of Apollo's son wanting to follow in his footsteps is intriguing. But I think the filmmakers/writer's took a wrong turn as to how that was supposed to happen. Apollo to me represented something different from Rocky. Rocky represented heart, stubbornness, believing and hoping against hope. Whereas Apollo represents grace and skill. The silky guy BORN with the talent. A Mozart, a genius.So the fight between Rocky and Apollo to me was a clash between unbelievable desire and unbelievable talent. So if Adonis was to follow in his father's footsteps, I think the Rocky way did not suit him. I think the writer's should've emphasized the natural talent as opposed to being able to take a beating.This movie also lacks a captivating 'antagonist' like Apollo. Anyways, I liked the movie. I had hoped they would go another way with it. The movie gets a lot right. e.g. I could buy the love story between Adonis and Bianca.With that said, Creed is a solid 7. It's a nice change from the usual comic book movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael B Jordan did a great job and Stallone was also pretty good (you could actually understand what he was saying). The chick from Dear White People was okay, nothing that stood out.The story is where I had problems. While it was interesting and a good way to make a spin off I felt like they tried too hard to separate it from the rest of the movies.Constantly throughout the movie they remind you in many ways that Rocky is old. After a few times it got annoying. They also keep reminding you that the main character is Apollo Creed's son. I get that it was part of the story that he wanted to create his own legacy, but almost every 15 to 20 minutes they remind you that he is Creed's son.The romance arc of the movie didn't feel right for the movie, it was a side story that wasn't needed.Mainly, Creed was a good movie, I would recommend it, but had problems that annoyed me. The story constantly reminds you of things instead of assuming you know it, that got annoying and took me out of the movie. Good movie, but had annoying story problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philadelphia's culture was depicted perfectly. Being a former recent Philadelphian, I had clear identification with the scenes and language. I only lived in Philadelphia for a year, but the town is very small, so it is easy to see the places that were filmed. There were streets in The Badlands that I drove down often, The Library Area that I passed every morning on my way to my shop. Those trail bikes used to freak me out. As a matter of fact, I know those bikes weren't just stunt bikes because that silver quad that was behind the main character while passing Amber Street is always racing through the Badlands. For some strange reason the movie made me proud to have been a part of Philadelphia's culture.The movie brought back so many memories; the bar/club on Spring Street was one that I used to visit regularly. And how could they not include Maxx, the Philly cheese steak place on Erie and Germantown Avenue. I remember asking a friend. "What the hell is a Jawn?" The same as the main character asked. Its Philadelphian slang. Only a Philadelphian could have made this movie to depict so much of the city's culture precisely.Stallone looked a mess as I expected. I felt sorry for the old guy as he slowly walked up the library steps, the same steps he used to run up when he was in the film, Rocky. The scenes that were supposed to be tear jerkers didn't come close to jerking tears. I felt Stallone's situation could have been a little more emotionally moving. I noticed several abrupt time-line jumps. I felt there should have been a smoother transition for the main characters change from boy to man. For those reasons I must hold back one star.The characters in the movie played their parts well. It's not your typical Rocky movie. I do see where the ending sets the movie up for part 2, I am looking forward to it. I strongly recommend you see this movie.Books written by Erik Smalls:Never Give Up, Eye For an Eye, Cold Blooded</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed: Inspiration for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed, written and directed by Ryan Coogler, co written by Aaron Covington and starring Micheal B Jordan(Adonis Creed) and Sylvester Stallone(Rocky Balboa), tells the story of Apollo Creeds Son(Adonis) and how he aspires to be a great boxer like his father, whom he has never met. Adonis goes to Rocky for help, and at first is reluctant to train Adonis, but after careful consideration choices to train the energetic Youngster. Creed, which is almost as great as Rocky(1976), is one of the years best films, and the most inspiring picture to hit screens in 2015.Michael B Jordan is the perfect actor for his role as Adonis. The way he shows the emotions of a troubled young man, and how he conveys humour into his role is astounding. Sylvester Stallone, in his second best performance of his career(behind Rocky), does a good job 39 years later playing the same character. It is enjoyable to see Rocky back on the big screen, with style too. The Films is an excellent film and I highly recommend viewing it in cinemas before it's too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but a bit overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen all the "Rocky" films and found them enjoyable but I would not call myself a big fan of the franchise. I wanted to see this film because of the high praise it was receiving. While I agree it's a good movie, I don't think it's a great movie. Sly Stallone is excellent as is Jordan in the title role. But, I didn't find the movie as memorable as I would have wanted and that's mostly because the motivations of the lead character, Adonis Johnson (Creed) aren't all that clear or believable. At the onset we're introduced to a hardscrabble young Adonis, bastard son of late, great Apollo Creed, who's been in and out of foster homes but is whisked away by Apollo's wife to live a life of luxury. He's well-educated and has a white-collar job in the financial services industry. Why he decides to up and leave all that behind and pursue a life as a professional boxer is inexplicable. He says it's because he's been fighting his whole life but that assertion rings hollow when we see him pulling into the driveway of the huge gated estate that he shares with his "mom." When Adonis first meets up with Rocky Balboa, a scene that should be charged with emotion and nostalgia falls flat because Adonis already knows all the stories, having been told them by Apollo's wife. He knows more than Rocky does and the reveal that he's Apollo's son just isn't that dramatic. The romantic story line also falls a bit flat at Adonis is paired up with a clichéd character: hot and alluring singer. One of the aspects of "Rocky" that was so wonderful was the atypical romantic story line, where Rocky is paired with a mousy, decidedly unglamorous woman who slowly emerges from her shell. Rocky and Adrian's relationship felt real and the famous "Adrian!!!" cry packed an emotional wallop. Finally, the main event lacked emotional punch because I actually felt for the opponent, a working-class Briton who was facing the probability of a lengthy prison sentence and having to leave his young children behind.The story would have been much more interesting and emotionally engaging if Adonis had been raised by his working-class mother and perhaps only learned who his real father was upon her deathbed. That would have been a believable impetus for Adonis to seek out Rocky Balboa, to learn about his father and connect with him through Rocky, and train to become a champion like him. The scene in the restaurant and in the various gyms would have worked so much better if Adonis was hearing and learning about his biological father for the first time. And , I would have been more emotionally vested in the outcome of the main event if I'd truly seen Adonis overcome major hurdles. But, despite the flaws in the story, this was a well-made and well-acted film and I did enjoy it for what it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Flaws, Could Reinvigorate the Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed.This is one of the most divisive films of 2015, it seems. A fair number of people think it is brilliant and was snubbed by the Oscars. Other than Stallone's nomination, it has nothing to speak of. Some say it could have been Best Picture (I don't). And there is an argument to be made for cinematography, because the fight scenes are incredibly well shot, jumping in and out of the action smoothly.Then there is a group who thinks the film is awful, pointing out the obvious: this is very much a rehash of the original "Rocky" film in many ways. We have the underdog who rises quickly to the top. And in some ways this is not even as spirited, because Adonis is coming out of a home where money is not a problem. He does not need to fight. He could loaf around, and as we see early on, he can quit a good job without a care.Adonis is also a hard character to be supportive of, because he has everything handed to him and it all comes so easy. He does not lose a fight, he gets Rocky on his side without a struggle, he finds a supportive girlfriend who stands by him even when he is awful. Where is the struggle? Where is his heart? But let us not be too harsh. Instead, we will shift gears to Stallone. How about that supporting actor nomination? Indeed, he does pretty good here, and this may be the most emotion we have ever seen out of Rocky Balboa. Some of it seems out of character. Compared to the early films in the series, Rocky somehow got a little smarter (though he still cannot spell). And some have said he gives up a bit too easily on things, notably his health, for a man who is always about the fight. (I am less convinced of this point. His reasoning seems valid.) I would not expect Stallone to win. He does great, but we have seen Rocky before... six times before. And when up against Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance, it seems unlikely. He may edge of Christian Bale and Tom Hardy, but still... the category is not his this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is always a first thing that comes to your while the movie ends, the very first thing that came to my mind was one of the sound track. The movie is revolves around a "orphaned bastard child" by one of the late most famous boxer. However not portraying the transitions of the angry young child to a self made aspiring boxer is a major betrayal to script and the reason I believe for not creating a major impact on the audience. The female lead character Bianca, seriously? Slam the door on hero-----Go out for a dinner----Sleep with him---One encouraging dialogue--fight-One loud cry in climax. Olive in Popeye does more than this! The two main characters Adonis and Rocky had a huge scope of acting with the action and both actors have grabbed the most of it. Having the support of a sport in the play, the movie doesn't disappoint at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Creed and although I was underwhelmed it didn't wow me either. Going into this movie I had very high expectations because people were giving it such high praise, there was even chatter of a return to form for Stallone. While my high hopes weren't necessarily met there are definitely great elements of the movie! For starters Michael B Jordan continues to bright new face in the acting industry as he delivers another solid performance, but its not until he meets are good pal Rocky that things get really interesting. The relationship between these two is handled very well in most parts, but in very few scenes it seems a bit rushed or forced. The fight scenes were actually handled pretty well in my opinion, as they had a certain unique style to them, but still made it feel like it was in the Rocky environment. The last thing I will touch on (so I don't get into spoilers) is the soundtrack is handled really well, and thats saying a lot given the popularity of the infamous Rocky soundtracks. For me the movie does drag a little bit for about the first 3/8 of it, but there are still redeeming qualities from it, for the people giving this movie an A+ rating I'm confused as to where that came from, maybe they looked past the lackluster start. Overall I'd would recommend Creed if you are a die hard Rocky fan, and if you aren't there is still a good fighting movie there, but some parts will go over your head.Creed gets a 7.8 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been almost 40 years since "Rocky" burst onto the scene and wowed the film world with 10 academy award nominations and garnering 3 wins. Rocky went on to become one of the most successful film franchises of all time with "Rocky I - V", "Rocky Balboa", and released this year, "Creed".Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordon) is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Apollo was killed in the ring (Rocky IV) before Adonis is born. His mother dies when he is a small child and Adonis becomes a product of Foster Care. He is a troubled youth and spends a lot of time in Juvenile detention. Apollo's wife, Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), comes to Adonis' rescue and takes him out of the foster system.Flash forward; Adonis works in an investment bank but just doesn't feel he is fulfilling his destiny. He quits his job and moves to Philadelphia where he seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He convinces Rocky to train him as a fighter.The film does slow down at times but overall is an enjoyable 133 minutes. You don't need to be familiar with the Rocky films, but it does help in filling in the back story of the characters. The movie, however, can stand on its own - unlike the final film of the "Hunger Games" series. This film is rated PG-13.This is "Rocky" for a new generation. A young unknown fighter getting a shot at the big time.If you have an afternoon or evening to spare - go see "Creed".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest gifts that the movies can give back is the feeling of coming home. Few movies are worth the return trip, but when done right we get the joy of reuniting with old friends, catching up years later and seeing how their lives turned out. There are a few movies from my childhood that formed my passion for this crazy medium that are worth revisiting, and there are few characters that I enjoy revisiting quite like Rocky.You'd think that by this sixth sequel the series would now be just a giant parody of itself, but Stallone reeled it back in 2006 with Rocky Balboa and he does it again here. You can feel the passion that he has for this character and his world. These movies are, if nothing else, proof that given the right material Stallone can really act.Creed is one of the most beautiful sequels I've ever seen. It contains the dark corners that made the original special. It has an agenda that seems to be more than just to ride the coattails a famous series ? and remember this is the seventh movie! We see real characters on the screen. We feel for their plight. We love these people. Director Ryan Coogler isn't satisfied to let the film lay on its side and just purr with nostalgia, he wants this story to breathe with a life and energy all its own.Coogler, I am sure, knows that he can easily get by on nostalgia alone, but he'd be making a very bad movie. After the poetic beauty of Rocky Balboa nine years ago, which wrote the final chapter for Rocky, this chapter turns the story in a different direction. We meet a troubled kid, Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) an orphan who has landed himself in a juvenile detention center. A woman comes to visit him, Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), the wife of the late Apollo Creed. Adonis learns that he is the product of an extra-marital one-night stand that Apollo had not long before his fatal bout with Ivan Drago. Yet, despite Apollo's transgression, Mary Ann pulls Adonis ? nicknamed Donnie ? out of the narrow destiny of guns, drugs, and swagger and gave him a chance at a productive life.Years go and destiny calls Donnie's name. He begins making money by boxing secretly in Tijuana making his own name but never telling anyone about his famous lineage. He wants to be he his own man, and not be just a hitch upon a famous father that he never knew. Leaving home, Donnie finds himself ? where else? ? Philadelphia. Determined to make his way in the boxing world he looks up Rocky, now pushing 70, at his restaurant and asks him to train him.What happens is not all that surprising if you're a veteran of this series. What is surprising is how human his story is. Rocky now deals with his own mortality ? his extended family is gone and his world is basically empty, and he's dealing with issues of his own mortality ? there's a development that I won't spoil.Adonis' fire and determination are an eerie shadow of his old man. The flow of the film is that each character is given one dimension more than just their service to the story. For example, Adonis gets a girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson) a musician who is building a music career before she succumbs to a progressive hearing loss. She stands by Donnie but she's more than just a fixture. There's a feeling that she's lived as hard a life as he. There's a grace to her character that makes us want to see her succeed.The arc of the film is Donnie's troubling family name. He keeps the name Johnson, but never tells anyone about his famous father. Once he's outed offers pour in for major fights because everyone wants to cash in on the name. But Rocky doesn't want to see the kid get destroyed by bad decisions, and that becomes the crux of the relationship between the wise old man and the hot-headed young kid.This is a beautifully made film. It has edges and corners that we don't expect. Even the familiar formulas of the other films feel fresh and new. The final bout between Donnie and a British bruiser named "Pretty Ricky" Conklin feels original. All boxing movies have a final fight, but the great directors know how to tell the story inside the ring. Here we understand what his happening and what is at stake at every single moment, making this one of the most exciting cinematic boxing matches since Raging Bull. I was so happy that the filmmakers had the intelligence not to put Rocky back in the ring ? it's not his story. This is the story of the rise of a kid determined to climb out of the shadow of a father so lionized by history that it might be easy for him to simply skate by. Donnie has a lot of demons to battle and a lot of pressures to overcome.Essays can be written about this movie. It steps right where other sequels step wrong. This far into a series we might expect that it had spun its wheels until they come off, but by twisting the focus the screenwriters have written a new chapter here. There are themes to be explored not just about determination but about battling this thing called life and making decisions that will chart the course of destiny. Plus it's also about coming home. The best movies do that, they allow us to come back around and see the great characters pressed by the adamant of time. He's home again, and so are we. This is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Rocky sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed is a sports drama film which is essentially the seventh movie in the Rocky film series. Not only is it a solid entry into the series but it also stands on its own as a great sports movie. So far, I consider it the best of the Rocky sequels, which is saying a lot.Adonis Creed Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate son of former heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed, is a young man who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. After some unsuccessful attempts of making big in his hometown of Los Angeles, Adonis travels to Philadelphia, where he meets up with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), the friend and former boxing partner of his father. Although reluctant at first, Rocky takes Adonis under his wing and trains him to become a heavyweight champion boxer, following in his father's footsteps.Filled with great boxing fight scenes, Creed is respectful to its source material and contains the right amount of heart and emotion. Michael B. Jordan gives a great performance in the lead role, you can really tell he's worked hard to make his character convincing. However, Sylvester Stallone steals the show as an older Rocky Balboa. It's fascinating seeing this character whom was once the student become the teacher. I would not be surprised if his performance earns him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.I rate it 8.5/10. If you're a fan of the Rocky film series, definitely give this one a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Start of a New Franchise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Creed", starring Michael B. Jordan-Fantastic Four_2015, Fruitvale Station; Sylvester Stallone-The Expendables movies, the Rocky movies; Tessa Thompson-For Colored Girls, When a Stranger Calls_2006; Phylicia Rashad-For Colored Girls, The Cosby Show_tv and Tony Bellew-This is his first movie, he is a real boxer from Liverpool, England.This is a 'Rocky' movie but Rocky doesn't do any boxing in it. Maybe it's the start of a new franchise or something, since Sylvester is getting a little older. Michael plays the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. It seems that Apollo had an affair outside of his marriage-Wow, who ever heard of a sports figure doing such a thing? Anyway, Phylicia plays Apollo's widow-in case you may have forgotten, Apollo was killed by a big Soviet fighter, aka, Dolph Lundgren-and she adopts Michael from an orphanage, where he is always getting into fights. I guess fighting is just in his blood. Since Michael was born after Apollo died, he never knew his father. He decides to try to make a living as a boxer and decides to look up Sylvester, since he is the closest person he can think of that knew Apollo, and see if he can train him. Sylvester is running a restaurant called Adrian's-I bet he loves answering the phone with, 'Adriannnn's!'-and is reluctant to train Michael at first but soon gives in. He even tells Michael about the 3rd fight between Rocky and Apollo at the end of Rocky 3, and who won it. Tessa plays a neighbor of Michael's that is trying to become a singer. Oh yeah, she is his love interest, too. Tony plays an English boxer-I know, a big stretch for him to do-who also happens to be the big opponent for Michael. The fights are good, just as exciting as in the earlier Rocky movies. Michael even gets to wear the red, white and blue American trunks in his big fight. It's rated "PG" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 12 minutes. If you are a fan of the Rocky movies, you will probably enjoy this one, too. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great knockout boxing film,fans of the rocky series will be happy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not huge fan of boxing other than jumping on the Floyd Mayweather bandwagon for the last 5 years, and the Rocky series is not the same it used to be with the last couple of films being mediocre at best. So with Creed my expectation were literally zilch. Fortunately for me Creed was highly enjoyable, and way better than I excepted. It not only brings back the rocky series too life, but Stallone finally gets a role he can flourish in, and that suits him. While the film does take the predictable route, its still a highly inspirational, and motivating film. Michael Jordan most be applauded for the shape he got into for this film. Bravo. I must say this is one of the better sports films I have seen, but thats not saying a lot, because most of the sport films are full of clichés and bore me to death. However without giving any spoilers away let me tell you its not only Adonis Creed battling it out, so is Balboa but in a different way. Story wise Adonis Johnson never knew his famous father, boxing champion Apollo Creed, who died before Adonis was born. However, boxing is in his blood, so he seeks out Rocky Balboa and asks the retired champ to be his trainer. Rocky sees much of Apollo in Adonis, and agrees to mentor him, even as he battles an opponent deadlier than any in the ring. With Rocky's help, Adonis soon gets a title shot, but whether he has the true heart of a fighter remains to be seen.Acting wise Michael Jordan is just a few films old but the kid has dedication to make it big, the level of fitness he shows in this film is amazing. He has a bright future and is picking the right films, but his acting skills need to polished he is a bit raw. Sylvester Stallone in my opinion has given his best performance in the last 10 years, he is finally playing his age, and the emotional depth he brings to his role is commendable.Creed is pretty much a lead up to the films heart pounding climax. The climax is what makes the film notches above the ordinary. Its a standout sequence.The film also goes into the nitty gritty of boxing and is very technically sound. Watching the athletes go through the gruelling training was very motivational and inspiring. Creed had great emotional depth, and the two main leads were made to be very venerable, and that did wonders for the whole underdog, trying to get out of hid dads shadow angle in the film. The film's highlight for me though was when 2pac's Hail Mary was playing the background and Adonis was walking out for his final fight, that scene gave me goosebumps. The fighting choreography was amazing, and the boxing scenes were realistic as could be. Bravo for those scenes to the Dir Ryan Coogler . But the film at times was way too melo dramatic, and those scenes lead to same clichéd, predictability we see in every other sports film. And what was need for a love story in the film. However these are minor blemishes the film has, and they are more than made up by the cast performances, and exhilarating fights.Overall Creed is not only made for fans of boxing, or the Rocky series, it is just a good film in general, that the whole family can enjoy this holiday season. Its a clean film, that has got some very good boxing sequences and some top notch acting. 3.5/5* or 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot, well acted, but a flawed script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creed was exciting from start to finish, and to quote a line from the film, "you belong here!" Creed does indeed belong in the Rocky saga. It was a passionate film, directed by a young passionate film-maker named Ryan Coogler, who happens to be much more talented with his directing ability than his writing, but I'll get to the script's flaws later. First and foremost, the fight scenes in this film are amazing and some of the best you'll ever see. The final showdown in the end was brilliantly edited and cut, and there was some noticeable influences from The Raging Bull too. There was also a fight in the middle of the film that was absolutely brilliant. This particular fight was shot entirely on a single take without any cuts. And it wasn't just a one round fight either. I don't think I've ever seen that done in a boxing movie and this single take method was very effective at creating tension.Action aside, the the urban cinematography was as good as John Avildon's work on Rocky and Rocky 5, and many scenes were shot on some of the very same streets from those films. Unlike Rocky Balboa, and many other sequels, this film had a somber tone throughout. And it didn't have that comic book, campy, superhero vibe to it like so many of the sequels had. There were some instances in the end that were very exaggerated and illogical but for the most part, the film maintained a very serious tone. Homages to Rocky's patented training sequences were cool to watch too, and the soundtrack will surely please Rocky fans, as well as hip- hop fans too. However, I would not say that this film is as good as the original Rocky, its not even close. Creed is a boxing movie, and Rocky was a movie about humanity. Creed had bits and pieces of lectures here and there, about overcoming one's demons, but it was an action movie at its core.I will guarantee that every one will be pleased by the lead performances. Stallone was superb as a lonely and somewhat depressed man who was beginning to give up on life. He was tired; tired of the bad stuff on the news, tired of being lonely, and tired of having nothing left to fight for. As for Michael B. Jordan, I thought he had excellent chemistry with Stallone, both really made the most of what was a rather formulaic script at times. It wasn't really the best script in a Rocky movie and its clear that the plan is to make more sequels because many of the story's sub-plots never developed or had closure. It's unfortunate too because one subplot was very emotional.Final score is a 7. I'd give it a higher score if I wasn't comparing it to the other Rocky films but it was definitely much better than the last Rocky film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Been a Rocky Fan until this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am from India, growing up I had no idea about the Rocky Movies. I was first introduced to Rocky Movies around 10 years ago. I have since been a great fan. The thing I like most about the movies are the comebacks. Life has a way of pushing us down but the movie has always inspired me to a higher place. So much so, that when I first came to the United States I went to see the rocky statue and rocky steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Arts. This movie has always led me to believe that the underdog had a chance. That if you are prepared to work hard and stay disciplined you can make a good living. You can have a respectable life despite your beginnings. You have a chance at life despite your neighborhood or your upbringing. So in a real sense it was more than a movie for me. This movie and "Rocky Balboa" released in 2006 carry that charm but loose the grit and determination that so inspired me the first time around. It takes strength, focus, perseverance, discipline and persistence to undo the many wrongs. That was what drew me to the movie. When I see "Creed" I see that Adonis (Michael B Jordan) was wronged, born as a child out of wedlock, had a rough upbringing but I don't see the passion in this movie. A large part of the movie is spent on focusing how he has been wronged. If equal parts of the movie were spent on how he overcame, that would've made a good story. There are certain parts where the young actor shines, but they are far and few in between. I love the last scene where they climb atop the Philly Museum and stare at the horizon and Rocky says his life turned out "not bad at all", just loved that scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Creed, Not False</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to start off saying that I grew up watching the Rocky movies and pretty much enjoyed everyone of them. Seeing that there was another installment in the Rocky series definitely sparked my interest. To get started, I was entertained the majority of this movie. For starters, the soundtrack and overall sound in the movie was fantastic. There were some scenes where it actually sounded like there were people in the movie theater yelling at the screen, as if we were at a live boxing match. I love when movies can utilize a movie theaters' sound system to the fullest. Also, I thought Michael B. Jordan did a solid job at playing Creed's son. Where this movie's rank falls in the Rocky franchise, I'm not quite sure. It definitely had some Rocky-esque qualities, mixed in with a new feel as well. Over the last two months, I've seen 42 movies in the theaters. I'd say this in one of the better movies Currently playing at the moment. I recommend seeing it. If you are expecting Creed to be better than the first Rocky movie, then you could possibly be disappointed. If you go in with an open mind, you may find yourself liking this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creed(2015) - Build your own legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>https://soumavamaiti.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/creed-2015-build-your- own-legacy/ - Yet another Boxing movie? Well Yes &amp; No.. Yes because it has got Rocky Balboa and the looking back at the Creed legacy and shedding blood and sweat all the way to glory in the ring.. NO because it has got more than just that.. Its about Rocky passing the baton to the "Unc" &amp; "Cloud" generation? Its about crossing the hurdle of Great Expectations of Lineage and building one's own legacy and earning it while at the same time accepting real friendship across age and sex.. Its about some street-smart preparation with the gang in Philadelphia rather than working on the moves alone? Its about a realistic touch of the Creed Junior feeling nervous and going to the loo before the big fight.. Its about MGM's lil prank of Rocky watching Skyfall at leisure .. the overall feel is not the old-school fighting alone but rising to the occasion of the next generation and making a name for oneself.. Bridging the Gap and taking the leap of faith.. A good movie to watch..</fullReview>
