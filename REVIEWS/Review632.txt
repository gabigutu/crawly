		<shortDescription>Ridicoulous, stupid, offensive and dreadful..... would watch again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the movie is a over the top comedy that is ridiculous and sometimes straight out offensive and disgusting, the movie makes you laugh. I haven't laughed like this for a good while, so it does however do its job as a comedy. if you are however looking for a calm comedy that takes itself a little bit serious..... stay away XD It contains offensive jokes, foul language (often from the small ones) over-dramatic scenes with plot twists, scrap that! there is plot twists everywhere, but the movie is for some reason able to keep you entertained as you try to pick up all the popcorn you dropped on the floor after laughing hysterically from a really bad line that just turns even more awkward as the other character replies back. A must watch mess for the ones that needs a good laugh, and bring a friend. It makes the movie 10 time better when a cheap but funny line comes up and both of you can relate XD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have discerning tastes, don't see this movie. If you need escapism from the daily grind and are not in the mood to over-think anything, this is a good movie for you. It's true; it is crude, much cruder than the original. Most comedies today are just that. The people responsible for this movie were not thinking lets win an Oscar, they were thinking lets make people laugh. According to the theater I was in, it worked. We were all laughing. I wish it had been longer with more situations, but I enjoyed what I saw. I recommend not taking your teen to see it. Let them wait till they're 17, not because they are too young, but as a mom it was really awkward. I will say this about Chevy Chase, he will always be Clark, but keep in mind people age and put on weight. I say so what! The man is funny as hell! This movie will not hold up to the original, don't see it without seeing the original; you won't get the jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands on it's Own, but very Raunchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a HUGE Vacation fan...and went to see this new one fresh except for the trailers. Let me say this upfront....It's very funny, BUT, it's also very raunchy. I have a high tolerance for that, and still found myself cringing a few times. Funny that there was an "older" couple behind me in the theater, with their teen "kids/grand-kids". They were laughing HARD the first few minutes, then the lady says "this is too much" and they almost left...but she said "no, it's funny". They stayed all the way and we're laughing most of the whole way. BUT it is uncomfortable at times. Still, it was VERY funny.So, I went home and re-watched the original. It was pretty dark, and filthy at times too. Just a little more "inside joke" than in your face like the new one. But anyone that says the original was not cutting edge...watch it again. Plenty of cursing, animal abuse, sex, and shenanigans. It actually holds fairly true, given the 30 years. Oh, and Chevy Rocks in his part. Still great comedic timing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the worst ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there is no way to describe how bad this movie is. when we arrived, we were the ONLY 2 people in the theater! eventually 2 more people came in. I've read some of the positive reviews, and I can only surmise that we saw different films. there are no words to describe how horribly bad this film is. I cannot fathom how anyone associated with making it, especially the leading characters, would allow their names and careers to be associated with such a disgusting film. how many times can a 9 year old say "fuck" or vagina or some other body part out of context. swimming in feces is supposed to be funny? the humor is less than juvenile. I don't think I have ever seen my wife walk out of a movie, no matter how bad. she really wanted to see this but was ready to leave after 20 minutes. I would give this move a minus "-" rating if possible but a 1 is the only option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really funny if you love this this type of humor and are a fan of the vacation series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS I love the Vacation movies. In fact, "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" is one of my favorite Christmas movies. And this movie did not disappoint me.This movie was really funny. It was classic Vacation humor and conflict. The movie still reminded you of the Vacation that came out many years ago. The jokes were funny and you laughed quite a bit. And the trouble and all the stuff that went wrong just reminded you even more of the original Vacation films. This movie was very raunchy and it was also rated R unlike the other Vacation films which made the movie even funnier with the inappropriate sexual humor and the coarse language.The cameos were awesome in this film. Chevy Chase, Charlie Day, Norman Reedus, Keegan-Michael Key, and Michael Pena were all very funny (especially Day) and were great cameos to have in the film.Besides the cameos, the film had some good acting too. Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo, and Chris Hemsworth all did great and were funny. But the actor who stole the show was Steele Stebbins. He was hilarious and I laughed at nearly everything he said. He was a great and hysterical child actor and I hope to see him in more films to come.I loved in this film how they gave you little flashbacks of the past Vacation movies because it gave you a good feeling of when you were watching the originals and how much you laughed. It was a great addition to the movie and made the film have that touch of the past that everyone loves.If you love raunchy and dirty humor and you loved the original Vacation movies, then you will love and enjoy this comedy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most importantly: relax. Take it easy (as the song goes). But do not watch this, if you are easily offended. It really goes out there and language wise, it does not only cross the line, it catapults over it, with a vicious grin on its face. If you know you can't handle that, better save your money and time.For those familiar with the original (it's been too long since I last saw it), there are a few throwbacks, most of which surely can be read here. They are nice and as "tasteful" as they can be expected to be in a movie, that really takes no prisoners. And I only watched the version that was shown in cinemas. I can only imagine where they probably will go in an extended version (that's surely happening, right? If not at least many deleted scenes and outtakes, with more "fun" - for those who liked it). Also many jokes throughout the credits, that will either delight you or annoy you more - depending on how you liked the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailer trash will embrace the stupidity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who DOESN'T remember the original Vacation film? I hate crude humor with a passion, but I could overlook the occasional innuendo or sex joke because the original film stayed family-friendly for the most part and never got too crass or offensive. Well, unfortunately it looks like the 21st century is now casting its wave of stupidity across every nostalgic family film, and Vacation gets it especially bad.This new Vacation film, starring the now grown-up Rusty Griswold, wasn't funny, wasn't even remotely humorous, it was just disgusting and pathetic. I was horrified by the number of parents bringing their children to the theater to see this film. The scene with the cow's insides exploding across a car? A little girl in the aisle in front of me began to scream and cry and her parents ended up leaving with her. I heard many adults saying "what the f*ck?" and just leaving out the door. It was a nasty film, as if somebody took that Robin Williams RV film, tossed it in a blender with a bad exploitation film and a few episodes of that god-awful Family Guy show.Some people love fart jokes and pervy sex jokes (what's wrong with humanity these days!?), but if you're going to see this film, whether you're into crude humor or not, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN. I don't understand why it was being marketed on the radio station here as being a family film. It's the kind of film that drunk college guys and rednecks will fall in love with.I bet it'll be The Goonies or Beetlejuice that gets wrecked by crude sequels next. :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising trip to the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest. Vacation isn't one of those must see movie blockbusters, and would probably be one of the last choices for anyone to watch for the month. On the other hand, its much easier to arrange a group movie outing as the chances of everyone watching that is pretty low ;)The ratings for this particular movie are quite bad(reference Rottentomatoes), which is no surprise as most crude comedies are rated so. It wasn't as crude as I expected it to be though.(then again maybe thats because it was moderated in Singapore)To sum it up, we went in with low expectations. But! I could hear the hall filled with laughter through-out the movie! and we came out smiling and discussing about the funny parts as well. All in all an enjoyable movie experience :)Yes, it's not gonna win any awards or sure. but for anyone looking for a light-hearted movie packed with laughter, WATCH THIS! :D I was honestly afraid of drinking my soda for fear of spurting it out from laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Movie of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too often you see a laugh out loud movie at the old multiplex, but Vacation is surely one of them. It was hard for me to hear the dialogue for the guys behind me laughing so hard. There were just scene after scene of hilarity. Right from the opening credits up until the final credits, nothing but laugh, laugh, laugh. The top laugh getter though I guess would have to be the trip to Hot Springs Arkansas by the family. It will make you and your whole family want to schedule a future bathing adventure in some nearby hot spring. But there was one sour note. The movie is rated "R". There are lots of filthy words, and some naked people in the movie. So do not let your young children see the movie. Other than that the movie is a hoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived, tasteless, unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, as supposed Rusty Griswald attempts to bring his family together by locking them together in a car for a week, and remaking his original trip to Hell, aka Wally World.A variety of gross-out gags follow, each more tasteless (and therefore more boring) than the one before it, as the family is followed by a seemingly obsessed truckie, goes swimming in an open sewer, and, in a pointless vignette, visit supposed Audrey and her husband on a lavish farmhouse- and while this audience member wondered why Rusty has become even more stupid than Chase was in the first film. Subplot involving son's romance with a cute girl traveller was potentially amusing, but her character disappears after only a couple of scenes. The youngest son needed to be tasered, he was such an obnoxious twit; completely irredeeming character. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo's characters put in brief cameos in the film's penultimate scene, as does the Wagon Queen Family Trickster, looking as grotesque as ever, in this far too self aware rehash/ reboot. Seemingly every other scene's climax was given away in the two trailers, which made me feel as though I had already watched the film before. I give this film a 3/ 10, one point for each time I chuckled during this film's seemingly never ending run-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved Vacation movies, and this one continues the tradition of laugh-out-loud humor. There are several scenes which pay homage to the original Vacation movie which was great to see. Fans of Chevy Chase will be shocked to see how much his appearance has changed, even since his role on Community ended. Ed Helms did an amazing job as a hapless father trying to give his family a great vacation, in the only way a Griswold knows how. Along the way he has to deal with his own family's quirks, his extended family, car trouble, a menacing trucker, and numerous other problems. Christina Applegate was also great as his wife, in the same straight-woman vein as Beverly D'Angelo's portrayal of Ellen in the earlier films. I saw this at a preview before it was released and it was clear from the laughter that the audience thought it was worth their time. If you grew up on the Vacation movies as I did, I think you'll love this entry too, but be prepared for outrageous situations and ridiculous scenarios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to it's expectations!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment it began and I heard it open to 'Holiday Road' I knew I was in for a great ride! I think there are two types of people that will not like this movie. First, those that see it as a stand alone movie without having seen the original and those who are comparing it too much to the original. You have to go into this movie as a fan of the original Vacation, however you have to realize this isn't a story about Clark Griswold and his family, it's a story about Rusty Griswold and how much he is like his father in how over-the-top caring he is about his family. I think Ed Helms did a much better job than some of the other actors that were considered could have done. As I watched this movie I found myself saying, "Yup, that's what Clark would do in that moment", so kudos to Helms. Now, (spoiler alert) you do have to stay seated through the first run of incredibly poor jokes about Rusty being an airline pilot for a low-budget company. This was very tedious and made me wonder what I was in for. Like I said, stay seated! Once you get past this first few minutes the fun begins! The director did an incredible job paying just enough homage to the original to make you respect his ability. You don't get the feeling they are ripping off jokes from the original at all and that's the sign of a great (and rare) sequel. It doesn't rely on old jokes, it respectfully honors the original in ways that you expect and want to see. And yes, when we finally get to see Clark Griswold it is incredible! Chevy's short screen time is definitely worth the wait, he truly is and always will be Clark Griswold with his wacky ways but yet wise words of wisdom for his son. The best part for me (again, spoiler) is when Clark opens the (correct) garage door and you see the pea green wagon-family-truckster. It's almost tear-jerking joy when it happens. So, again, enjoy the homage paid to the original, listen closely and you will pick up on so much like the references to cousin Eddie and even the joke about the first grand canyon visit. The one disappointment I had (last spoiler, I promise) was the girl in the red Ferrari scene. The joke was funny, however it lost a lot of it's translation when they didn't play the song 'Little Boy Sweet' as done in the two previous presentations of this long-running joke. Now beware, it is obvious that the film makers are seeking a new, younger franchise audience so this movie is cruder, ruder and at times can make you literally gag with their brand of humor. It does go over the top in my opinion with the vulgar music lyrics twice during the film which I felt was totally unnecessary, but if you can deal with this you're still going to have a great time! The overall acting was excellent. Christina Applegate is still hot and the two kids that play Rusty's son's are very funny. This movie is even better if you watch the original the night before you see this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Vacation" stikes a great balance between honoring the original film and paving its own holiday road.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I found out long ago. It's a long way down the holiday road." Those are the opening lyrics from the Lindsey Buckingham song that is found in all four of National Lampoon's "Vacation" movies of the 1980s and 90s. Those movies all starred Chevy Chase as the father who would stop at nothing to give his family the perfect vacation, whether it was a European vacation, a Vegas vacation, a Christmas vacation or a road trip to California's (fictional) Walley World theme park. The holiday road is indeed a long one. It led us to all those places and back? and then it led us here. 32 summer vacations later, a movie called simply "Vacation" (R, 1:39) is a remake/sequel/reboot hybrid which also features Buckingham's catchy tune. The question is whether this vacation lives up to the legacy of the iconic film that shares its name.This time, the only son of Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo) is all grown up. Rusty (Ed Helms) is a pilot for a small budget airline. Like his parents in the earlier films, he's married, has two kids and lives in Chicago. His wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), is loyal and supportive, but longs for a little more spontaneity and variety in the marriage. They have two kids, boys named James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). James is an awkward, nerdy teenager and his foul-mouthed kid brother teases him mercilessly for it. Maybe a cross-country road trip is just what this family needs to come closer together. After all, as the movie poster asks: What could go wrong? Rusty decides to drive his family all the way from Chicago to Walley World in California, recreating his family's similar (but infamous) childhood trip? hopefully, with better results. Rusty starts by renting a "Prancer", a car that's even more? interesting than the "Family Truckster" in the original film. It has two gas tanks, along with a plug which doesn't look like it would fit any outlet in the known universe. This boxy blue bastardized Toyota Previa has a key fob and control panel with a bewildering number and assortment of buttons and a GPS that too easily gets stuck harshly giving directions in Korean.But taking this "Honda of Albania" out on America's highways is only the beginning of this Griswold adventure. Their ill-advised road trip involves being followed by an ominous-looking truck, being directed to a "hot spring" that really isn't, losing personal possessions, plus father and son having a sex talk that's more conjecture than fact. Stops on the trip include a very revealing visit to Debbie's old college, a river rafting trip with a highly unstable guide (Charlie Day), a visit with Rusty's grown sister, Audrey (Leslie Mann), and her hunky local TV weather man husband (Chris Hemsworth) as well as stopping at a bed-and-breakfast owned by a couple who will be very familiar to fans of the earlier films."Vacation" strikes a great balance between honoring its iconic origins and paving its own holiday road. The movie makes use of a few sight gags and incidents from the 1980s classic, but puts its own spin on them. The adult Rusty is every bit as earnest and bumbling as his dad, but Helms makes the character his own. As in the first film, the script makes good use of the comic potential inherent in a cross-country car trip, but doesn't copy any scenarios from the earlier movies. Despite the distractingly inappropriate amount of foul language coming from the family's youngest member, the humor, as raunchy and crude as it is, works well. While the first film's humor was often more subtle in nature, the jokes in this one are often laugh-out-loud funny."Vacation" has some self-referential fun as Rusty's family discusses who has heard of the original vacation and whether trying to duplicate it would just result in a big letdown. Whether an on-screen family conversation or a reflection of the thoughts of real-life moviegoers, those concerns are unfounded. The new fictional Griswolds are brought closer together by their trip and the cinematic portrayal of their misadventures is both fun &amp; funny? maybe even more than the first "Vacation".

		<shortDescription>It's a Very Raunchy/Crude Vacation film meets We're the Millers, Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was the most fun and most funniest I've seen in a while at the movies. I saw this Opening Night and I was very skeptic and worried because I loved the trailers but I've seen other comedies in the past were the trailers were so funny but the movie overall wasn't funny and was so disappointing. The story follows Rusty Griswold as he takes his family on a road-trip vacation to Walley World because he went there when he was a kid with his family and he wants to reconnect with his family and spice things up with his Wife. I thought this was the funniest movie I have seen since The Wedding Ringer, which came out in January of this year. I'm a big Vacation films fan and I was so excited about the son taking over Clark's place and Ed Helms succeeded big time as Rusty Griswold. It was great seeing Christina Applegate in this film as Rusty's wife and as well of course seeing Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return. It was also surprising to see Leslie Mann as Audrey, Rusty's Sister, Chris Hemsworth as her Husband and nice seeing a few surprising people appear. The kids in the movie did a great job but the small kid needed his mouth cleaned out, he used a lot of language in the film. The story was so relate-able and was so much fun to see and watch. This Vacation movie also reminded me as well of the 2013 Hit-Summer road trip comedy "We're the Millers" which I also loved. Parents should not bring their Teenagers and their young kids, this is not appropriate for teens under 17 because of the constant language, some nudity and the raunchy/crude sexual humor/situations. There was moments in the film where it was awkward and sorta uncomfortable but it was a good, fun, funny movie. There has been so many bad reviews, complaints for this movie since it's been filming, it's not a remake or a reboot people, it's basically a continuation after "Vegas Vacation." There was maybe one or two slow parts in the movie but besides that, I loved this movie. If you want to go see this and have a good, fun time, this is the movie to come to, don't come to this movie very serious and expecting it not to be funny because trust me, it's hilarious. I'm going to see it again in a few days and I can't wait to watch it again. Vacation deserves a lot more praise because it's such a funny, funny movie and it's probably this years "We're the Millers." Hilarious, fun movie!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I enjoy crude humor. I loved The Hangover, Old School, SuperBad, etc. But "Vacation" is flat out obnoxious and unfunny. Not a single laughable moment. I didn't even find myself smirking at any point. It was that awful. Not even the nostalgia of the old "Vacation" movies could save this atrocity. The script seemed like it was written by spastic 13 year old juvenile delinquents. When the script wasn't obnoxious it was simply just uncreative. The car was so over-the-top that it was eye-roll inducing. The angry Korean voice on the GPS was unoriginal and cliché. Helms and Christina Applegate should quit acting, out of shame.</fullReview>

The opening credits were the best of this film after that it was all, way down hill. I remember with some affection the original but this remake is a travesty. The lead cast at least the adults are hopeless comics and get the tone all wrong both are miscast, the kids i'll be more generous given the material both provide the movies highlights on the road trip especially Skyler Gisondo as the older boy who manages to achieve some amazing depth in his nerdy character.The movie has one high spot (pun) that of a well hung weather man played by Chris Hemsworth, now this sketch was at least amusing, as for the rest, save your cash for a better film, or stick to the far superior original on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded Our High Expectations...Watch It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the original Vacation. Like a lot of my friends, I pretty much have the whole 1983 movie memorized. When I first heard they were making a new Vacation, I was worried. But when I heard about the premise and saw that Ed Helms would be in it, I was really hopeful and excited. And then my expectations were really high. And it exceeded them. True, the humor is dark. But Ed Helms is a genius. And the writing and timing in this is so good, my wife and I laughed pretty much the entire time. (To be honest, I have never heard her laugh that hard, and it was so awesome.) Right from the beginning, it is FUNNY. If it helps, I think THE OFFICE is funny, and CADDYSHACK is funny, and the first VACATION is funny, and STRIPES is funny...This movie was way, way better than any comedy I've seen in a long time. I will buy it. Worth owning. And I'm sure years from now, as time goes on, it will get something closer to its proper due.</fullReview>

Literally nothing about Vacation was good or even remotely funny, which is a shame, given the strong cast.Pedophile and rape jokes begin almost immediately. The cursing and bad language is relentless and the younger brother is a psycho path! I am angry at myself for watching this whole movie. I was really hoping it was going to turn around, but it just didn't. I think it's perhaps the little brother who was most offensive... at one point he leans over to his big brother and menacingly whispers, "I would shoot you off that horse." It is not funny at all. It's sick and disgusting.Lazy, uncreative, and insulting. This movie is terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, the film follows the misadventures of the Griswold family, trying to reach their vacation destination. This time, it's Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms), all grown up and with a family of his own. Idealizing past events, Rusty hopes to reconnect with his wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), and his two kids, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins), by planning a cross country trip to Wally World. On the way, there, the group encounters several missteps that can only bring their family, closer or farer apart. Can Rusty save his marriage and bond with his children or will the chaos of the trip, be, too much for them, to handle? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this 2015 road trip comedy directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein was somewhat hilarious. Serving as both a reboot and a sequel to the National Lampoon's Vacation series, I like how the movie has direct recalls to the original four films; 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation, 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation, 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and last, 1997's Vegas Vacation. Not only that, it has references to the 2003's TV-movie spin off, Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure &amp; 2010's short film, Hotel Hell Vacation. I love all the similar jokes or previous film character cameos. While the movie has all those callbacks, I like how the film was also giving its own vibe. Most of the film's set pieces and locations are different, from the original film, so they're plenty of new humor, coming out of it. Unlike the 1983 version, this Rusty-led version of Vacation has more toilet humor jokes that might be a little too gross for some viewers. For me, I found the overtly raunchy scatological humor, somewhat amusing. It really hit the funny bone. Vacation is also chock full of overtly raunchy crass humor, coarse comments, sexual references, and constant strong language. Still, there were some jokes that really did bug me. Most of them, came from Kevin character. He's supposed to be a little kid, but instead comes off as a complete unwatchable sociopath. The jokes about the truck driver wanting to rape children, the whole plastic bag gag and the mean-spirited jokes from him, are frequently crosses the line into Dude, Not Funny! Territory! His character really hurts the film. Other jokes that fell flat, was cause, by the film quickly abandoning subplots: such as Rusty's brother-in-law, TV anchorman Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth) being an extreme conservative. While, some of his jokes were left hanging. Chris Hemsworth still have a very amusing role. I just wish, they had more jokes for his wife, Aubrey (Leslie Mann). She seem underused in the film. Amid the crude/over-the-top content are some positive messages about steadfast marriages and the idea that vacations form lasting impressions on kids. The acting is pretty good. While, Ed Helms might not be playing the same persona of that of the previous Rustys, he honed this role. I like his in-over-his-head normal positive thinking, father know best attitude. He was very likable. He delivers some great, funny reactionary moments throughout the film. Christina Applegate is amazing in her role. I like how her character was able to play to play, into the laughs, as well. In fact, one of the film's funniest moments, was her chug-run sequence. The like of supporting characters played by Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Michael Pena, Norman Reedus and many others, make this movie, a lot funnier than it could had. As much as the critics, might think, the appearance of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo toward the end, as lackluster. I have to disagree with them. It was nice to see the two, play their roles, once again. Pretty much all of these cameos are used well, offering a solid comedy beat. I also love that Lindsay Buckingham's 1983 hit single, "Holiday Road", the theme song to most of the Vacation series, is include with this film. Overall: While, the movie could quite capture the inspired lunacy of the original John Hughes-written/Harold Ramis-directed film. However, this remake did pretty well for itself. As long, as you don't take it, took serious. You might like it, too. It's time to take a Vacation, indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie we've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our family has seen all of the Vacation movies and were eagerly looking forward to this one. We were incredibly disappointed at how unfunny this movie was. We don't mind swearing as long as it's funny, but much of the swearing in this film added nothing. We also couldn't believe that Kevin putting plastic bags over a person's head (a well-known method of suicide) constitutes humour? Similarly, seeing someone commit suicide and actually seeing their head hit a rock was distinctly unfunny. We could go on but there are just too many examples to pick from. Even the final scenes at WalleyWorld (a real highlight from the original film) couldn't save this one. From now on, we will just watch the DVDs of the originals which were genuinely funny. It's hard to imagine why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo agreed to appear in this one. Randy Quaid was lucky to dodge this bullet. No wonder it didn't have the "National Lampoons" logo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's getting annoying seeing reviews giving this film a 1/10 because people have misinterpreted 'Vacation' for a family film and been disgusted by it. It's crude humour and outrageously funny if you like movies like Due Date and The Hangover and deserves more than a 1/10 (Mums who haven't bothered to check the rating).The film its-self is also good and I think it's rating has been brought down by disgusted parents who's children have seen a little more than is desired. The acting is good enough, the jokes are tops and the situations get more and more extreme.If you want a family movie take your kids to something else but if you like a rude comedy with plenty of laughs, this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never went to see this movie with the expectation that it was going to top or at least compare to the original,so maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed in it like obviously many others here and in general were.The 1983 Vacation that kick-started this franchise was even better than the sequels that followed,and I'm honestly one of the few people in this world who didn't see the appeal of Christmas Vacation beyond that one scene with Bing Crosby's Hawaiian Christmas song.Anyhow,this was a decent reboot with a now-adult Rusty Griswold with his own family.The crude,adulterated humor and foul language in this one is not so over-the-top in this day and age as it would have been 32 years ago had it been prevalent then.Ed Helms was a great choice for the role of Rusty as was Christina Applegate as his wife Debbie.On top of her obvious risqué humor that we know she conveys so well on screen,she can play the straight woman convincingly enough that you forget for a brief moment that she was "Kelly Bundy" on "Married With Children" 3 decades prior.While I won't exaggerate by giving this modernization of Vacation 10 stars out of 10,it definitely deserves 7 for sticking with tradition and yet standing out on its own in a Hollywood that's become too formulaic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is new generation of the beloved Vacation movies. Of course a 2015 comedy has to be cruder. It's funny more often than not. The Grand Canyon rafting scene is really laugh out loud.Rusty is now a regional airline pilot. Ed Helms is competent if a bit old. Christina Applegate plays his wife. She is as always very likable and carries off the less funny parts with enough charm to make them bearable. The kids are okay too with the bullying thing. Chris Hemsworth is quite funny and well cast as Rusty's brother in law they drop in to visit on the way to Wally World. Ron Livingston is well cast as an obnoxious pilot. Beverly d'Angelo and a much heavier Chevy Chase make an appearance.Overall liked the updating, it has enough homage to the older movies and shows the formula still works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reboot to the National Lampoon's Vacation series that's also a sequel of sorts. Rusty Griswold is all grown up with kids of his own and decides to take them to Walley World like his dad did with their family all those years ago. The results are just as chaotic, if never quite as funny. Remakes, reboots, etc. are always tough to make work (as they should be) but this one does surprisingly OK. It's not a patch on the first few Vacation films with Chevy Chase (who has an unfunny appearance late in this movie) but it is good in its own way. Ed Helms and Christina Applegate provide few of the laughs, which hurts more than anything since they are the leads. Most of the successful humor comes from the guest stars like Chris Hemsworth and the two kids playing the sons, Steele Stebbins and Skyler Gisondo. Stebbins is especially funny and easily the best part of the movie. To the movie's credit, it doesn't simply do a scene-for-scene remake and tries to make its own mark. But years of road trip comedies, many of which were inspired by the original Vacation, makes this feel more than a little familiar. Still, it's watchable and provides some laughs if you're in the right mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Hysterical! The Funniest Film in Years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacation is an awesome movie. It's hilarious. It's fun. It's a nostalgic trip to the past. It's almost an R Rated Family Movie. Everything about Vacation works. Even though the movie is not going so successful critically and commercially, I still say go to this one.The movie is about Rusty Griswold who is a pilot now. After hearing behind his back that his family is tired of going to the same cabin every year, he decides to take them to Walley World as the original Vacation movie did. There, they visit Rusty's sister, Audrey's New Husband (Chris Hemsworth), and his parents Clark and Ellen, and get into some serious adventure.The movie is all out hilarious and crude which is why I think the movie is being criticized. I don't remember the old movie being this crude, but hell, it's freaking funny. The movie's jokes are all hits and sometimes there is lots of shocking moments. The film made me go OMG lots of times because I was so stunned by what was happening. The ending where the two rivaling families fight to get on the roller coaster is hysterical.Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are in the movie also as Clark and Ellen. The roles that made them famous. It's nice to see them again even if it might be the last time. There is so much to learn from this movie. I wouldn't suggest bringing young children to this movie as there is some graphic nudity in some parts, but for parents with teenagers, I definitely think you should take them to see the new Vacation film. It really is the funniest film in years.96/100 A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hilarious! I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard at the movies. The writer/director team clearly hold the original movies in high regards. This isn't just some stupid pointless Hollywood remake of a beloved classic. You can tell just by watching that they are big fans of the original. Many references throughout. If you haven't seen the original Vacation movies you will surely miss many of the jokes and references. Be warned, this movie is a hard R rating. Definitely not for kids. Many cameos throughout the movie. Charlie Day from It's always sunny in Philadelphia was probably the funniest of them all. His rafting sequence had me rolling on the floor laughing. You will definitely enjoy this is you are a fan of the original Vacation movies. The weakest link was probably Audrey and husband. They definitely did not give Leslie Mann much to work with as she can be very funny when given the right material and Thor was just oddly miscast. An Australian trying to do a very bad Texas accent was just not very funny. They probably could have thrown a dart out of the studio window and hit someone much funnier than Thor. Other than that the movie was hilarious.</fullReview>

They had some quality actors but even they couldn't save the script. It had none of the qualities of the original. Chevy Chase should have refused to be in this movie and put his stamp of approval on it. The casting of the two kids was awful and there was no chemistry at all. If you think watching a 10 year old kid dropping F-bombs in the presence of his parents is cute, and the constant reference to body parts is your kind of humor then we have a sad state of affairs in our culture.

In the End, I like to say overall its a once watch family movie and few scenes like one at Chris house and one with Charlie will definitively make you gums and checks hurts .. Go for it.....

		<fullReview>Rusty Griswold, now married and middle-aged, packs his complaining family into another barely roadworthy vehicle to reprise the cross-country "Wally World" adventure he remembers from his own youth 30 years earlier. For a remake, that's a great premise; it's just too bad they couldn't come up with a better script. There are a few good jokes, including two or three in the movie's very first minute, but almost nothing in the next 98 that tops those. (One highlight: a set piece involving territorial state troopers at the "Four Corners" monument; stick through the closing credits to see how that one comes out.)So, overall, it's cruder and less funny than I had hoped. But I give it a 6/10 anyway, because Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are always likable, the Lindsay Buckingham / "Holiday Road" opening credit sequence is terrific on a big screen, and there's a sprinkling of apt (though uneven) reminders of the original "Vacation," including one sequence featuring the original Griswolds, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Most of all, despite enough filthy jokes and language to fill several Wagon Queen Family Trucksters, the movie preserves what I have come to appreciate most about the whole "Vacation" series: the well-deserved, sentimental tribute it pays to a great unsung hero, the Middle American Dad -- a man on a mission, bound and determined to make sure the whole family has a good time whether they like it or not.</fullReview>

The story is so much predictable, what else would you expect if from the trailers we are already presented the basic premise of a family road trip comedy movie. None of the story development gives any surprises or any wow moment. But that's really not the reason we watch comedy in the first place, isn't it? The comedy, as raunchy and dirty as it's also unsuited for kids, is indeed funny. I like how the movie kept it balanced between dialog jokes and practical stupidities. The pet rat joke is very funny for me. Yes I don't recommend it highly due to there's many better comedies out there, but it suffice for now as a new release. The acting overall is lame. Ed Helms barely hold out his comic performance.Christina Applegate should have been dismissed and replaced with someone younger instead. And I agree on the casting of the two kids as a bad choice for they look stupid in most of their scenes.</fullReview>

LOL This movie takes the character of Rusty (Ed Helms), now a grown-up with wife (Christina Applegate) and two sons, and they make the same trek from Chicago to California to that infamous, "Wally World", made in the original film. Along the way, they stop and see sis Audrey (Leslie Mann), who is married to a local hunkster (Chris Hemsworth), just a little too eager to show off his politics and -um- his, well you'll see in the film.. o.O Okay, my take on this movie- NOT any great comedic masterpiece by any means, but I'll be honest, I laughed all the way through, and so did the audience I saw it with.

		<shortDescription>National Lampoon returns and probably shows its age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original Vacation films and 80's comedy in general. There was something fresh and unique about those comedies and how "raunchy" they were for the time. And I happen to think we saw some of the most brilliant comedians during that decade and whether you all agree or not, Chevy Chase was part of that. He has an indelible comedic timing and his doofus, klutzy, lovable Clark Griswold is a legend. So I was cautiously optimistic about a reboot of this franchise. The concept made sense and the cast sounded good for a new generation but I wondered what it would be like. Nowadays comedies go straight for the ridiculous toilet humour and they drive it down your throat. Body functions and sex jokes and nudity and drugs and complete stupidity. Technically Vacation has a lot of that. It is raunchy (though I've seen worse in the last few years) and a lot of the gags seem really stupid but when you look closely you'll see that I think the film makers were actually trying to capture the essence of the National Lampoon films and I think they almost pull it off. I saw so much of the original ideas and gags in this film but the biggest problem is that they feel a little stale now and it doesn't really fit into nowadays very well.Ed Helms plays Rusty Griswold, the patriarch of the family. The biggest issue with Helms' performance is that he tries too hard to be Chevy Chase. In some ways it works because he is supposed to be Chase's son but it feels too much like copying. Helms has good comic timing but he has to have someone else to play off of and no one feeds him right so he is awkward in the role. Still, I'm not sure anyone else could have done any better. Christina Applegate is Rusty's wife and she is very good in the role. She doesn't quite fit with Helms right but they have okay chemistry and this isn't her best comic role but she pulls it off decently. Both actors are trying to find their place in an average script. Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins play their sons and as MANY reviewers have pointed out both boys are annoying. Stebbins go-to gag of being foul mouthed is just obnoxious and not funny at all and Gisondo's geek role is reminiscent of the far better played We're The Millers role of Kenny. Chris Hemsworth and Leslie Mann have small roles that are decent but nothing to write home about.The thing to remember with Vacation is I honestly think they tried very hard. I have to give them kudos because I don't think this was a cash grab, I really think they wanted to pay homage to the original series, reboot it for a new generation and make something memorable. I can see why some people (especially the younger generation) would not like this at all because it does have the same vibe of the original films and in fact has some gags that you simply wouldn't get without seeing the original. You have two guys who co-wrote the script and co-directed and neither one have virtually any experience directing. Jon Goldstein and John Daley try very hard but I don't think they have what it takes at this point to really make this stand out. The film feels too dry and stale and messy. It needs a lot of editing and a lot of experience for someone to fine tune this into what it should have been. I still enjoyed it for what it was and I was able to see the respect paid to the originals. I was most excited to see Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo in cameo roles and both were very small and Chase seemed completely out of place. So if you're a big fan of the National Lampoon's classic then you'll get something out of it, otherwise its mostly a miss. 7/10</fullReview>

The sort of remake is different enough story from the original. There is a social message about family, which completes the movie's story. Accepting family because all families are screwed up.All family members have character flaws. What did not work: Some of remakes comic scenes are to over the top ie the rented car.

Some of the funniest lines came from young Kevin (Steele Stebbins) he was very funny. Some bits were a bit on the wrong side, the truck driver was a little in bad taste.Ed Helms joins the list of actor's that have played Rusty, I like him as a funny man, he did a good job, Christina Applegage was fun too, very raunchy.

The photos were a nice touch too.The Griswold's were a big deal when I was growing up, this film won't have the same impact on today's youngsters.Don't tear your hair out in anguish to see it, but watch it if you get the chance. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loosely inspired by the original 1983 cult film by the same name, 'Vacation' is a genuinely funny film, that takes a classic franchise ahead, without embarrassing itself. Its high on laughs &amp; goofy performances!'Vacation' Synopsis: Rusty Griswold takes his own family on a road trip to "Walley World" in order to spice things up with his wife and reconnect with his sons.The Chevy Chase Vacation movies have been my favorite, I just LOVED all of them. Luckily, 'Vacation' works well as a comedy &amp; despite all the silliness around, I found myself laughing &amp; enjoying almost throughout. This isn't a memorable film, but what it is, is pure time-pass entertainment! Jonathan Goldstein &amp; John Francis Daley's Screenplay is all-out foul, as most of its jokes would appeal to adults only. The madness &amp; the sequence of events that happen here with the crazy Griswold's, is thoroughly entertaining. Goldstein &amp; Daley's Direction, on the other-hand, is well-done, too. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is just right. Performance-Wise: Ed Helms is a nice match to Chase. Helms delivers a terrific comedic turn &amp; contributes to all the comical bits from start to end. Christina Applegate is first-rate. Skyler Gisondo is perfectly awkward, while Steele Stebbins is completely hammy. Chris Hemsworth &amp; Leslie Mann try hard to make you laugh. But its Chase himself along with fellow Vacation legend Beverly D'Angelo, who stand out in cameos. On the whole, 'Vacation' will make you laugh. Do watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rusty Griswold takes his wife and two bickering sons on a road trip to visit Wally World. Things do not go smoothly.This US comedy is full of crude, infantile humour and bad language. It is also pretty funny.It gets off to a good start with Lindsey Buckingham's Holiday Road theme conjuring up memories of the Griswold family's first vacation movie 30 years ago (with a wonderfully funny montage of holiday photos) before going down a similar, but updated, cross-country road trip. Ed Helms as adult Rusty has the same well-intentioned but foredoomed to failure air about him as Chevy Chase did as dad Clark, and the trip itself is loaded up with things which could only ever go wrong, most of which are very funny (and, unfortunately, most of which are heavily spoilered in the trailer). This update, though, is considerably cruder than its predecessor.It was good to see Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprising Clark and Ellen. I was less enamoured of the two sons, although there is some wonderfully cringe-inducing humour involving older son James trying to get to know fellow traveller Adena with the "assistance" of his father (which pays off in a single line later in the film). Chris Hemsworth is pretty funny, too, in a sequence which underuses the dynamic between him and Rusty's wife Debbie (Christina Applegate, also very funny).If you saw the trailer, you have no excuses ? you know what you're in for.</fullReview>

The first half of this film is outrageous and absolutely hysterical; the whole theater was laughing the whole time. Each character brought something very unique and funny, no character was felt redundant. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between the two brothers, who were both great. Chris Hemsworth was a big surprise for me in the film. He showed that he has great comedic chops!After the Chris Hemsworth part, however, the film started to fall apart. It got a little too serious, and the jokes were getting repeated and becoming a bit forced. It just wasn't that funny anymore. It was starting to get dragged out with unnecessary long scenes.Overall, definitely worth checking out; the first half would certainly make you laugh a lot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps no Summer of '15 flick embodies more American Values . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . than does VACATION. If you had some foreign friends dropping by on their first visit to the U.S., you couldn't go wrong in taking them to see VACATION. This film is chock full of vital survival tips (for instance, most long-haul truckers are serial pedophiles) and timely travel advice (such as the fact that Arkansas is our wittiest state, if you substitute and "sh" for the "w"). From Sex Education (a father explaining "rim jobs" to his son) to Agribusiness (cattle are cannibals), VACATION will help U.S. newcomers to separate the rocks from the tumbleweeds. Whenever VACATION gets a whimsical opportunity to improve upon the American Dream--whether by planting a nonexistent towering waterfall inside our Grand Canyon or by plopping down an imaginary theme park next to the Santa Monica Pier--it does so. Since "bathroom humor" is widely considered to be the epitome of American wit, VACATION inserts some of it at least every two minutes. And for its climax in the "Velociraptor Ride" line, VACATION depicts the American Golden Rule: If someone else owns what you really want, just beat the living Heck out of them, and steal it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit nasty, but it had funny moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently went to see Vacation, and like the first entry in the series, it was a bit crude. The original movie had a lot of "nasty" moments, but limited use of bad language. This one had a lot of the bad language which might turn away some who enjoyed the original movie.Though it's smutty style was similar to the American Pie series (some of the words in the movie could make Steve Stifler blush), the actors were funny (and the lead actor is known for the crude-rude movies, i.e., the Hangover triad), and there was no "Cousin Eddie" in the movie to steal the scenes (this was the second Vacation movie without Eddie...the first was European Vacation, which was a bust). I liked it. In truth, I expected a bit more of Clark and Ellen, but their brief cameo was about all that was needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Clark W. Griswold (Chevy Chase) takes his family to Wally World and the journey is shall we say, shambolic. Thirty-two years later, we get Clark's grown-up son (played by Ed Helms) taking that same journey in Vacation (my latest review). This is comedy touted as a generational gap moment. And yet, it still feels like a remake, a same same blueprint of laughs that are forced and fantasized. No matter. In between moments of mild humor and hit-or-miss gags, what's on screen is hella funny. You get to experience a vaca that has movie R &amp; R written all over it.Now for all you facetious aficionados, Vacation has sequences where characters bathe in raw sewage, hang upside down in a roller coaster (that's where it stops), try to erase penis-shaped graffiti on the passenger side of their car, and run into a cow rendering it nothing but obliterated blood and guts. I laughed out loud heartily but remembered something even before the opening credits rolled (which are more offensive than what's in all of the previous Lampoon installments combined). I thought to myself, isn't the mantra of Rusty supposed to be smarter and less of a nincompoop than his dad. At least that's what I picked up with Anthony Micheal Hall, Johnny Galecki, and Jason lively (from Vacations 1, 2, and 3). Ed Helms (mentioned earlier) plays the adult version here. He's an appealing actor, he's goofy and likable (all you gotta do is look at the guy), and basically he's Ed Helms playing well, Ed Helms. Is this how middle age Russ would act? Based on the previous four flicks (six if you count two that are direct-to-video), probably not. Bottom line: I liked Vacation and I'm actually gonna recommend it (God help me). But I feel it could have been even more effective if it was a straight up remake of 1983's monster hit. You get a funny actor to reprise the Chevy Chase role, a blond, bombshell actress to reprise Beverly D'Angelo's Ellen Griswold and so on, and so on. The director yells action, the cameras roll, and everyone freely lets it rip. Just a random thought.Anyway, 2015's Vacation tries to up the ante over all of its predecessors. It does this in terms of vacated grossness, vulgarity, and crass indignation. Two side players even suffer heinous deaths which is something I don't think I ever saw in the Christmas installment from 89', the Vegas stint from 97', and European Vacation (no dying here. A dog falls from the Eiffel Tower and survives without so much as a scratch). Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein really want to push the envelope. Proof of this can easily be traced back to the forty-five minute mark involving co-star Chris Hemsworth (he plays Stone Crandall, Rusty's well hung brother-in-law). Just revert to Mark Wahlberg's underwear sequence in 1997's Boogie Nights and that will give you a clue.The story of course, begins in Chicago, Illinois. And if you live in the windy city (like I do), you'll be annoyed by how certain characters get around in their respective automobiles (residents in Chi-town don't drive past the The Chicago Theatre then drive north by Wrigley field in or order to venture to Southern California). Russell "Rusty" Griswold (Helms) is a family man and a pilot for a second rate airline named Econo-Air (they do those mini flights from Chicagoland to South Bend, Indiana). He takes this job so he can spend a little more time with his family. He has two sons (the younger one is the bully, who'd thunk it), a marriage that seems on the outs, and a log cabin (in Michigan) where his clan goes for summer vacation. When he senses that his better half (Debbie Griswold played by Christina Applegate) is bored in said vacation pics, well Russell decides to quote unquote, "shake things up a bit". He wants to relive his childhood memories so he takes his family to the Wally World theme park. This expedition involves a similar blueprint akin to 1983's original. They drive through Missouri (check), stop at a strange relatives house (check), get lost and stranded in the desert (check), have uncomfortable moments in rundown hotel (check), and pass by the Grand Canyon (quintuple check). Chaos and high jinks ensue because the Griswold apple doesn't fall far from the tree. There's a scene where Debbie and Russ decide to have unsuccessful, sneak away sex via the borderline of four states. Spicy.In conclusion, you can enjoy this thing provided you go into it with the lowest of expectations. Truth be told, I viewed the trailer a month ago and figured 2015's Vacation had almost no affiliation with the other vehicles in this long running, Warner Bros. franchise. Boy was I wrong. As a new installment with the Griswolds of a new generation (I loved the family that was cast here, especially Applegate), it has the feel of all things Lampoon. And it doesn't hurt that an extended, Chevy Chase cameo makes the proceedings that more authentic.In addition to Chase, you get some other jocular and rather interesting guest appearances as well. Norman Reedus plays a trucker and alleged pedophile, Charlie Rich checks in as a manic rafting instructor, and Ron Livingston channels an asshat tycoon of a major 747 airline. And in case your wondering about Lindsay Buckingham's "Holiday Road" being played on Vacation's eclectic soundtrack, well don't worry. Thirty-plus years later and it's still in there. Here's my rating: A harmless three stars.Of note: In 1983, Clark and Ellen's married couple try to get their kids to sing "Mockingbird" by James Taylor and Carly Simon. Now in 2015, Russell tries to get his kids to belt out Seal's "Kiss from a Rose". If you decide to take in a viewing, you probably won't be able to get that song out of your head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not able to watch the preview the movie, so I didn't know what to expect. I just saw Ed Helm so I thought it would be funny. This movie was funny in my opinion. It might seem more stupid when I watch it a second time. I usually don't like stupid funny, and there were plenty of stupid funny. However, those scenes made sense with the movie and I just rolled with it since the movie never gave me time to think about those stupid scene. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't great and I probably won't remember this movie. I would probably others to red box this movie if they never seen it before.TD</fullReview>

Although this "movie" is rated 15 I wouldn't allow anybody under 18 to watch it because is just filled to the rim with , again, childish potty humour , it's like the whole movie was written during a frat house drunken orgy. . The characters try to mimic the Griswalds but there is nothing funny , about them. Christina Applegate used to be a respectable actress and a funny one , here is just none of that .

		<fullReview>You can't help to be skeptical when you hear they're going to remake something that worked so successfully the first time around, but then I herd that the movie was going to focus on Rusty Griswold, and his family making this as much a sequel or spin-off as it is a reboot. Rusty remembers the original Vacation to Wally World with such fondness that he takes his family on a road trip to the theme park as a way to spice up their annual vacation. the movie acts mostly as a series of sketches and gags paste together to make a movie, but each gag makes me giggle and in some cases I laughed out loud.Their decisions to make a rated R film helps a lot as well.Chris Hemsworth was great in the movie. The beautiful Aussie got to show he was more than a pretty face with muscles and did a little comedy that had me rolling on the floor.Me personally, the movie works better if I think of it as a Spin-off than a reboot. It's never going to live up to the original, but it's a fine sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Vacation-series" are all classics that are loved all around the world. They all got this warm humor with the excellent Chevy Chase in the leading role. Nowadays "Christmas Vacation" is a new tradition on our family Christmas evening. That said...This was by far the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. Bad script, bad humor, bad acting. Just really really bad. I know the movie isn't one that wafts of intelligence, but come on. A three year old kid would have done a better job than this. I know that the old character of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wasn't the most intelligent man in the world, but he still got some parts that were recognizable for a normal person. We could see some parts of our own dads in him. All characters in the old movies were built like this. With a story built upon a great portion of humor and some part kind of real situations. This movie is just dumb. Really dumb. I was sitting through the whole movie with my mouth open gasping on how incredibly stupid both the script and the characters were. Yikes. The most annoying person in the whole movie isn't actually the leading role played by Ed Helms, but the small son "Kevin" (Steele Stebbins). No adult in the right state of mind would have put up with this kids behavior. It's not even a bit funny. At all. That kid belongs in an institution. I don't think I need to say anything else. The whole movie stinks. I will now try to forget the movie all together, sit back, relax, put my feet up and watch the reruns of the old ones instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vacation Represents the Demise of the Modern Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last Vacation venture voyages into a vast void. It is the prime example for the current state of modern comedies in modern cinema. A grown Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is now a pilot for low budget airline and wants to spice things up for his family by taking a vacation to Wally World to relive his experience with his own family. Guess what happens. The movie has a decent cast, anchored by Helms, Christina Applegate as the faithful wife, Debbie, and Skyler Gisondo and Steel Stebbins as the sons, James and Kevin, respectively. This ensemble is about the only good thing for this aimless, meaningless trip. They have their quirks, and play their parts well - especially Applegate and Stebbins, who almost steals the show. Unfortunately, there is not much of a show to steal. First, is the writing. Today's modern comedy writers have no idea to write humor. Instead of using situation, character and dialog, they use gross exaggeration, excessive disgust, and over-the-top profanity. Even the main theme song has the F-word dropped every second. The disgust ranges from a swim in a sewage-infested pond to driving an ATV through a cow. The gross exaggeration is not just in the raunchy humor, but also in the situations and the characters. This ranges from an idiot brigade of a law enforcement stand-off from each of the Four Corner States to a needless and idiotic family on family brawl in the line for the roller-coaster. Oh, and don't forget Stone (Chris Hemsworth) who has to parade his abs as well as his manhood in tight-fitting underwear. Even Chevy Chase falls into the trap of overacting the part. The sad thing is there were a few moments that shined through. Applegate shows desperation as she struggles in a boring, predictable marriage. Helms, when he isn't overacting, is concerned about the whole family. Even Stebbins and Gisondo's sibling rivalry ends with some mutual respect. All that is lost for the sake of grossing out the audience. The original Vacation had wit in its comedy. You didn't have to see the dog wet on the picnic basket, the funny part was Chevy's reaction to finding out the fact. We didn't have to see Blinky get torn to bits on the highway, but got a real kick out of Chase concealing his joy from the Highway Patrolman. One of the best scenes was Chase's tirade in the car - when we finally hear the F-Bomb - indicating his patience had run out. The descent of modern comedies in this day and age is reaching a nadir and it shows no promise of climbing out of the muck. Vacation is a clear indication that we need a vacation from Hollywood Comedies that are not funny.</fullReview>

And let me tell you, you laugh A LOT. Whether from the notable actor cameos or to the younger brother tormenting the older, Vacation will have you laughing your butt off.Now, this movie is a lot raunchier than the original but that just adds to this movie's stance on being its own movie...and not a remake.This movie is not a remake and don't listen to the critics. 8/105 word review: Nostalgic comedy with constant laughter.</fullReview>

It is much raunchier than the original one but just as funny. I am a fan of anything ed Helms does. He is one funny man! The funniest character(s) to me are the two kids. They have a role reversal, which the younger brother played brilliantly by Steele Stebbins is the bully and the older brother played Skyler Gisondo, is the older more feminine brother which is hilarious how they clash! This movie all in all was a funny movie. It ran a little long but you will leave the theater with a smile on your face.

		<shortDescription>One of the most blantely problematic comedies of the last years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave it a three only because there were some simple moments that were indeed funny and did make me laugh. Like anything related to the car (excluding the gps part) or the obstacles run. Otherwise it would be a clear 1. That being said, I want to say I have seen several problematic comedies, actually, most are problematic. But I had never watched one that was so proud of it that they kept repeating cringe worthy jokes every few minutes. To anyone that supports the lgbtqa+ community or even just non cisgender people, do not watch this movie. I had never watched a movie be so offensive about it all. Though there will be one line or two that will make you think they are finding it offensive themselves, they will keep going with the genitals jokes. This is also within the first 10 minutes of the show, do I even have to say I felt like walking out right away? Then the show proceeds to make rape, incest and pedophilia jokes. All things that need to be taken seriously and stop being turned into jokes. If you need prove that Hollywood exploits such awful topics, watch this movie. It's amazing how they take those topics and think "Oh yes, this sounds like the perfect thing to laugh about.". Then the cherry on top. You see suicidal thoughts and attempts turned into jokes, physical abuse also makes an appearance on a running joke and of course, the racist jokes with the gps changing the languages. Do not support movies like this. Do not let cisgender white people make these things jokes and become even more rich off of it. Enough is enough. If they want to make comedies, they should get educated first and understand that someone's genitalia, language and crimes against children are not jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely funny movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a movie that casts aside even the pretense of sophistication in favor of bathroom humor. Bathroom humor abounds. Subtle nuances are set aside as the Griswolds, and their friends, wallow in the muck, and generate ongoing laughs. Rusty Griswold is a raunchier version of Clark. Rusty is more than just a doofus, he is the personification of stupidity itself. Rusty is arguably the most stupid movie character in recent movie history. He's up there with Stan Laurel. Lou Costello and Curly Howard. Everything about Rusty exudes a naivety that goes way beyond mere ignorance. He has a stupid streak that even his eight year son can't miss. Everyone knows that Rusty is stupid, everyone, of course, except Rusty. The other extremely amusing character is Rusty's oldest son, who is effeminate. The father-son relationship here is hilarious. Rusty is completely oblivious to his son's sexual identity issues, producing comic situations. It's not that Rusty is inherently mean, rather, he's just too dense to know any better. Remember: he's a Griswold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what a remake should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really found this funny and entertaining. I was 15 years old when the first Vacation movie(1983) came out and liked it so much that I probably watched it too many times. When you get to know a movie so well over such a long period of time, it would be easy to be cynical about any attempt at a remake. At their core, all the Vacation movies are about how you can never really go back in time and attempts at doing so often lead to disappointment. This movie however, humorously pairs the melancholy of nostalgia with the joy and discovery that comes from the attempt to recapture and share those memories with others. It accepts it's lineage and does an excellent job bringing a very enjoyable string of of movies from then to now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vacation 2015 is a very funny movie at times but I was very disappointed in the overuse of vulgar language, especially from the youngest Griswold. It's not cute - it's not funny. I'm nowhere near being labeled a prude, but I think the producers should have toned it down somewhat. Maybe even gone for the PG-13 rating. Even the soundtrack was chock full of f-bombs. I wonder, did the studio just assume they would never get close to the original Vacation movie, so they went all out for the "B" movie raunchy genre? They had a great cast (Ed Helms, Christina Applegate were great), a workable script, and some very funny bits lined up. Maybe when this movie hits television and with a little editing it will get to take its place with the others in the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Funny! 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I, surprisingly, found this movie quite funny! Each family member brought something different to this amusing comedy and the jokes come thick and fast, right from the beginning to the end. Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) plays a pilot for a low budget airline and when he returns to his dysfunctional family, they have a meal with there close friends who gloat about there amazing holiday in Paris. Rusty hears his wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), putting down there repetitive vacations at there cabin in Michigan, so he searches for the perfect place to go on vacation with his family. He finally decides to take them to Walley World in a hired family vehicle and they make many stops on the way to the resort. They first stop in Memphis, at Debbie old college, we're Rusty finds out that Debbie was an extremely promiscuous teenager. After that, they stay at a hotel, were there eldest, shy son, James (Skyler Gisondo) meets a young girl who they passed on the highway but his dad embarrasses him by asking him awkward questions in front of her. They then go to Arkansas, we're they are led to a supposedly hidden spring by a drifter but they soon find out that it's a sewage and when they return to there car, there luggage and cash has been stolen. With no clothes or money, they go to Rusty's sisters house in Texas but her boyfriend, Stone (Chris Hemsworth) has an outward sexual manner which makes him feel uncomfortable. The following night, they stay on a Arizona camp site, we're Rusty decides to try something new with Debbie, in a sexual way but they soon realise that they have an audience and the police stop there sexual encounter. James bumps into the girl that he met earlier and he tells her how he feels about her, with the help of his obnoxious younger brother Kevin. The next morning they nearly get killed by a rafting guide whilst rafting in the Grand Canyon and there rental car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert. After pressing all of the buttons on the remote control, the cars explodes, which leaves them stranded in the middle of nowhere. All the way through there trip, a truck driver has been following them and they expect the worse because Kevin called him a Paedophile over the CB but he hands over Debbie wedding ring, that she had left somewhere on there journey and he gives them a lift to San Francisco. They then spend the night with Rusty's parents, Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) with the intent on going home in the morning but Clark gives Rusty his old truckster, which was used in the earlier National Lampoon Vacation movies, and they make there way to Walley World again. After spending all day, waiting to get on the magnificent roller-coaster ride, Velociraptor, they are told that the park is going to close so Rusty fights his way onto the ride but it gets stuck halfway up a loop. It then takes several hours for the passengers to be rescued but the Griswolds grow closer after everything they have been through. Rusty then uses his airline connections to take his wife to Paris, without the kids, but they have to sit by a lavatory, during a 12 hour flight. There are a lot of funny moments throughout the film and the fact that it isn't predictable, made it a joy to watch. It is slapstick comedy with a far fetched concept but if you don't take it seriously, it really isn't that bad. The performances were believable and the various cameos were a great addition to the cast, so I'm not surprised that it made such a profit at the box office. Anyway, is definitely worth a watch if you want a chuckle! Enjoyable!Round-Up: Ed Helms, 41, has blown up since his role in the Hangover in 2009, with movies like Cedar Rapids, We're The Millers and Jeff, Who Lives At Home but he hasn't shown that he has more tools in the box. There isn't any talk about a sequel to this successful movie but he's due to star in a remake of the Naked Gun and a film called Bastards with Owen Wilson and J.K. Simmons. Anyway, this movie was directed and written by John Francis Daley, 30, who also played the ride operator. Jonathan M. Goldstein also wrote and directed this movie and he wrote Horrible Bosses I &amp; II, the Incredible Burt Wonderstone and Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2. For there first major movie release, they did do a good job with this film and they got the most out of the actors. I just hope that they come out with a sequel before the characters become a distant memory.Budget: $31million Worldwide Gross: $105millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/comedies starring Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Chris Hemsworth, Leslie Mann and Chevy Chase. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does this movie has such a low rating. Seems like people lost their humor!Watched it 3 times already and every time it was as funny as before!I guess not many people like real comedy which makes you laugh.... I found this one of the best comedies since a long time. Last real funny movies were This is the end and The world's end... Just ignore the low rating and bad reviews and watch it.All those great scenes are popping back in my mind. Which I will not spoil. Maybe people expected more a national lampoons Chevy chase version. Big difference is that this one is really funny. The old vacation movies were maybe good for that time but not if you watch it again now. This movie made a big improvement and outnumbers the old vacation movies with the amount of jokes and laughable moments!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screw the critics, I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this thinking well it wont be amazing but I want to give it a chance. I've seen all the originals. And my god, they exceeded my expectations, me and my friend were laughing all the way through. It felt fresh and original, never felt there was a dull moment. Ed helms is a great actor and I enjoy nearly everything he is in. I felt everyone was well cast, got some great cameos from other favourite actors too! There was maybe the odd one or 2 jokes I didn't find overall that funny but we're talking about maybe 5% of the movie vs the other 95%. Just goes to show critics know nothing, judge the movie for yourself. Would love to see a sequel if the story is good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly a 'Marmite' film - you either love it, or loathe it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The new vacation will stand on its own!' asserts Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) at the beginning of this comedy. To the lazy reviewer this kind of line is a godsend - 'oh no it will not!' But actually, it does.Remembering - through rose-tinted spectacles - the happy holidays of his youth, Rusty decides to take his wife and two sons on a drive across the United States to Walley World (scene of the original "National Lampoon's Vacation", 1983). On the way they get caught up in various comedy set-pieces, including but not limited to a suicidal rafter, hot springs, a particularly unfortunate cow and Chris Hemsworth in his pants.Helms does a good job: retaining from the original films the enthusiastic everyman persona created by Chevy Chase, but not making himself a carbon copy of Chase. As wife Debbie, Christina Applegate is more waspish than was Beverly D'Angelo, but she also gets more comedy moments - indeed, her (and her stunt-double's) drunken attempt at a sorority assault cause is perhaps the funniest sequence of the film, rivalled only by a scene where four police officers from rival states start arguing over who has jurisdiction where.The comedy is broad, and much of it telegraphed - but so what? Sometimes you just want to watch a fun film, and "Vacation" is certainly that. Chase and D'Angelo appear in what could almost be a 'passing of the torch' moment - and I wouldn't be disappointed if this film spawned sequels, as did the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoehorned cameos couldn't save it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacation is an average comedy that skims on the rims ;) of gross and sordid slang punched directly into a script to make it appear funny. But the truth is the movie doesn't have much to offer. Is there a story to it? Well the name of the movie is just it.You can see Ed Helms give his best shot without a proper script on his table, trying to make things work merely by his expressions and dodging awkward situations with his clumsiness. Christina Applegate tries her best to follow the lead quite well. However both eventually fail to create the magic needed to wrap up a sitcom. Their kids played by Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins are also kind of dispensable as the directors tried to weave a small sideline story to make things interesting. The only problem: They forgot to make it funny.Some of the jokes are really cheesy that we could have lived without. Some are really good though and you are squeezed into a laughter fit at times. Credit scenes contain some funny photographs to bring you in the right mood. There is this Korean GPS system that literally shouts the directions that ices the flick's jokes.Nothing could have saved this flick, not even cameos by Charlie Day, Norman Reedus, Keegan-Michael Key, Chevy Chase, Colin Hanks, Michael Pena, Nick Kroll or Ron Livingston. They do compel you to raise your brows when you realize "Ah! There they are!" But soon they shotgun your hopes with their limited screen time. When you see them, suddenly you raise your expectations and then the story spears you right there. Everyone shoehorned to make things funny! Movie runs kind of like a commercial. Abrupt frame changes, lacks focus. Some of the story bits are pretty predictable too, and you almost see things coming. Even certain situations arrive with a promise of something big, but things die down quite abruptly with no power- climax to end them up with.Also, if this was supposed to be a sequel, then we can rule this one out as one of the most average sequels ever made.You can watch it if you want something light to go with your popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'VACATION': Four Stars (Out of Five)A sequel/reboot to the classic 1983 comedy flick 'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION'. It's the 7th film in the series (5th theatrical release) and tells the story of a grown-up Rusty Griswold, taking his family on a road trip vacation to Wally World; just like his father did, in the original film. The movie stars Ed Helms as Rusty and it costars Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo, Steele Stebbins, Leslie Mann and Chris Hemsworth. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo also reprise their roles from the other films; and the movie also features cameos by Ron Livingston, Charlie Day, Keegan-Michael Key, Norman Reedus and Regina Hall. It was written and directed by, first time feature film directors, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (the team that also co-wrote the 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' films). I found it to be a pretty funny, and well made, comedy flick.Rusty Griswold (Helms) is now working as an abused pilot, for Econo-Air. He feels like his wife, Debbie (Applegate), and two sons, James (Gisondo) and Kevin (Stebbins), are distancing themselves from him; and each other. So he decides to recreate his most crazy childhood memory, a road trip to Wally World with his family, in order to bring his new family closer together. Chaos ensues, just like in the original 'vacation'. The movie is definitely pretty funny; Goldstein and Daley are clever and witty writers, and I think they've now proved themselves to be equally talented directors as well. Helms is perfectly cast in the lead, and the rest of the cast is good too (especially Hemsworth). It, of course, does not come close to matching the original; but that shouldn't be expected of it. Just looking at it as another sequel, it's more than decent; it's definitely a lot better than 'VEGAS VACATION'.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/ItzCr1Etfyo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vacation" is a movie that is a movie that is so bad, I cringe when I see the poster. I hate every moment, character and joke that's in this movie.I understand the original "Vacation" movies had gross-out humor, but it wasn't to THIS level and it wasn't THIS desperate. There is no build-up of these jokes, no technique! It's the equivalent of a 10 year old who just learned what sex is, and now makes painfully unfunny jokes. I'm not kidding, there are scenes in this movie where Ed Helms wipes off blood with a ball of 30 people's pubes. They spend a minute on Christina Applegate throwing up. Is it funny because she's throwing up? I don't get it. Swimming in Feces? Conservative Chris Hemsworth's fake penis? Cow guts? Pretty funny, huh? NO IT'S NOT, IT'S TERRIBLE!Now I know what your thinking. "South Park" has a lot of gross-out humor too. Why is something like "South Park" so funny, yet "Vacation" isn't? Because gross-out humor isn't the problem. "South Park" jokes, gross-out or not,come from satire and build-up. You would never see a joke on South Park where something is gross and disgusting just for the sake of being gross and disgusting. I guess I should talk about the story now, so here it is: Rusty Griswold tries to take his bland wife and annoying children to "Walley World" and shenanigans happen. The End. This is the worst comedy I've seen since "Grown Ups 2". It's not funny, It's not amusing, it's just terrible. 0.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the 1983 Vacation with Chevy Chase.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspected this would be a bad movie but having enjoyed the original "Vacation" with Chevy Chase, and getting a free DVD loan from my public library, I watched it on a cold day when my wife was out. She definitely did NOT want to see it.The premise is that Rusty Griswold who was a small boy in the original now has a family and lives in Chicago. He is a pilot for a smaller regional airline, it helps assure he will be home most days so he can spend time with his wife and two sons.He overhears his wife tell a friend that she really hates the yearly vacation they take at a camp in the woods, so Rusty decides they will do something different, a family road trip ending up at Wally World in Southern California. Their route will take them through Memphis, where they can visit his wife's old college, and through Arkansas near Hot Springs. And on to Texas where they can visit his sister.Virtually everything that happens to them is bad. And the humor is mostly related to sex, nudity, and vomiting after chugging beer. The language is filthy all the way through, even from the youngest son. It is mostly unfunny and mostly offensive.The lone highlight is when they make it to San Francisco to the B&amp;B run (badly) by his parents, so we see Chevy Chase as the old man Clark Griswold and Beverly D'Angelo as the old woman Ellen Griswold. Their son's rental car had been destroyed along the way so dad loans them a car to drive to Wally World, the old station wagon the family used for the 1983 trip.It would have been nice to see the original child actors play themselves grown up, instead we have Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold, super-nice Christina Applegate as Debbie Griswold.A sad and profane movie, an insult to the original "Vacation", and I won't even mention the Chris Hemsworth role and his scene where he is wearing a large fake penis under his briefs, going like that into the bedroom of the Griswolds. I also won't mention the scene where the whole family thought they were in a hot springs spreading healing mud on their faces when in fact they were in a raw sewage dump spreading feces all over their faces.A pretty poor movie, I am ashamed that I saw the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible acting, worst movie we've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writers, actors and director should be ashamed of themselves. As a stand alone movie this would be terrible, as a knock-off/sequel to a classic this movie should go down as one of the worst of all times. The plot was in the right place but apparently those involved in making this movie have absolutely no grasp of reality and therefore cant even put forth the effort to make the movie halfway believable so it can be laughed at. We were left dumbfounded after scenes at how fake they were and how bad they did faking it. That's not to mention all the overacting.Best part was see Chevy Chase, his scene is the only reason we could rate this movie a 1/10. This is the worst movie we have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat redeemed by second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I never understand films in which the cast simply seem to be humiliating themselves portraying characters acting so incredibly stupidly that it goes beyond farce and slapstick. It's just sad. The first half of this film is just another example of this, substituting characters for a pile of bits which alternate between disgusting and stupid. The second half of the film marks a change. Stupid things still happen, but they are much less stupid, and they come together with some characters backing them up. And the movie gets somewhat more interesting, and funnier. Unfortunately, it is not that funny. The cast are sympathetic, and Christina Applegate is always great to watch even when she has little to do, but that's about it.This is the third film I have watched written by John Francis Daley, and I have to wonder what the hell. There is little originality, or actual fun, in any of them. Perhaps he can type quickly.</fullReview>

If you loved the original Vacation films, and you're still young at heart with a foot in modernity, then you'll appreciate the comedy in this film and the hat- tip to it's origins.Nice work.

		<shortDescription>Actually a decent addition to the Vacation series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacation is actually a sequel to National Lampoon's Vacation series and should not be considered a reboot. In fact, this actually makes a pretty worthy 4th installment as it's better than Vegas Vacation and anything that came after it.Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are great leads and work really well together. It has some well-earned laugh-out-loud moments but what shines through what should have been a complete failure is the way in which Ed Helms plays Rusty Griswold.It's far from a great film but it does a good job of mixing the old 80's absurd slapstick comedy and the modern adult shock humour, creating a unique mix that somehow stays grounded. It never succumbs to the cartoon antics of Dumb and Dumber To yet it doesn't take itself so serious that the drama overshadows the comedy. It's not so much that we are getting jokes we've never seen before, what we are getting is genuine characters reacting to ridiculous situations in a very human way.It's dirty, vulgar, raunchy and completely inappropriate, which is exactly what we need comedy to be right now. Vacation is also surprisingly heart-warming at it's core. In a time when comedies are struggling to stay irrelevant and as politically incorrect as possible, an R-rated family vacation movie is refreshing even if it's far from original.</fullReview>

There were some hilarious moments that had me laughing out loud. The older brother played his role excellently. I would have loved it if Clark and Ellen would have had a bigger role in the movie but as a man of nostalgia I appreciate that they were in it at all.I must warn you, the movie is a bit more naughty than the previous ones and perhaps not suitable for small children.

		<shortDescription>Once again, critics are DEAD WRONG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Come on people. This movie was funny and I really believe it is (so far) the funniest movie of 2015 and one of the best comedies of the year. The people I saw this with were really cracking up. They were laughing out loud so hard you would think their lungs would explode. Let's see what critics are saying and let's find out if it can be considered a true statement:"Borrowing a basic storyline from the film that inspired it but forgetting the charm, wit, and heart, Vacation is yet another nostalgia-driven retread that misses the mark."The movie had charm, wit and heart. Most of the jokes were very ingenious and I found them to be clever, original and inventive. Of course there was some black humor but the movie also conveyed the message of the importance of family and I really and genuinely think the dialogue delivered by some of the characters was infused with interesting and enlightening wisdom.I don't know what is the meaning of charm, wit and heart to movie critics these days, but this movie did have those elements and it was a very funny movie. I mean, this is no GODFATHER or CITIZEN KANE and you can't definitively take this movie seriously since it is clearly a goofy screwball comedy.On the other hand if you want to see some real bad comedies, take a look at LEONARD PART 6, THE LOVE GURU, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE or everything Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have done lately. VACATION (2015) however, definitively does NOT fall into that category.This movie is ten thousand times better than the horrible FANTASTIC FOUR reboot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was the most relatable part of the movie using "Awkward Family Photo" styled pics of what appears to be cleverly presented family snaps of very embarrassing situations the spirit of which the movie attempted to reflect only ending up coming off too obvious and far fetched in quite a few scene setups.Conveying a slowly unfolding irreverent, almost awkward documentary style tone similar to Albert Brook's "Lost In America" or "Real Life" is what made the original "Vacation" so funny along with Chevy Chase's Buster Keaton style dead pan minimalist facial expressions and reactions to outlandish situations.The new version has very funny ideas and concepts behind each situation but my laughs were tempered by the setup and how it unfolded that distracted and made it unrelatable to me. A lot of long walks for short jokes.It was still an entertaining movie but it didn't have that special cerebral style of irreverence to family vacation traditions I remember from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching the "Vacation" movies, regardless of the fact that some of them are a little raunchy! When I first heard of this movie, I thought it was a remake, but it is actually a sequel with a very similar plot to the first movie. Of course the movie wasn't anywhere near as good as the original, but it still wasn't that bad! I just wish that they would have toned down the raunchiness a little bit because none of the original "Vacation" movies were so profane and unsanitary! I also hoped that Chevy Chase and Beverly D'angelo would have had bigger parts in this movie. They're only in it for maybe five minutes! Other than that, the film was pretty good! It had a decent story structure, the character development was great, and it was hilarious from start to finish! I would give this movie a chance for those of you who haven't seen it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Vacation", starring Ed Helms-The Hangover movies, Meet Dave; Christina Applegate-The Anchorman movies, Mars Attacks!; Skyler Gisondo-The Amazing Spider-Man movies, Four Christmases; Steele Stebbins-A Haunted House 2, Metered; Chris Hemsworth-The Thor &amp; Avengers movies, A Perfect Getaway and Leslie Mann-The Other Woman, Drillbit Taylor.I guess you could call this a sequel to the 1983 Vacation movie. It is sort of like they are passing the torch for a new generation. Ed plays a grown up Rusty, the son of Chevy/Clarke Griswold and yes, Chevy &amp; Beverly D'Angelo do make an appearance, although Randy Quaid/Cousin Eddie does not- I think he was in jail or something. Anyway, Ed plays a pilot for an economy airline company-their slogan is something like, We're working hard to regain your trust!-and he wants to reconnect with his family by changing up their normal boring vacation at their cabin in the woods and relive his unforgettable childhood trip to Wally World. Christina plays his wife, Skyler is his oldest son and Steele is his younger son. Skyler is nerdy and always being picked on by his younger brother, Steele. Steele also cusses a lot. Ed rents an Albanian hybrid car, which is hilarious because of the high tech gadgets and language barrier that come along with it. On their cross country road trip, they make lots of stops and nothing ever goes according to plan. One stop is at his sister Audrey's place. She is played by Leslie and Chris plays her husband. Chris is pretty funny here. I guess he enjoyed doing comedy for a change. There are several cameos scattered throughout the movie; I remember seeing Colin Hanks, Charlie Day, Norman Reedus, Keegan-Michael Key and Ron Livingston. Oh yeah, they did use the old familiar Lindsey Buckingham song, Holiday Road. It's rated "R" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 39 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Vacation' film has already earned the stamps on its passport and is ready for its next vacation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're on a pilgrimage to see a moose. Praise Marty Moose!" Those were wise, unearthing words from America's family man Clark W. Griswold (Chevy Chase) as he trekked his family from Chicago to California inside the Griswold family truckster back in 1983. Clark, along with his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and their two kids Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron) encountered a variety of hilarious obstacles and problems along their difficult road trip, but they stuck together as a family and proved that any American family can make it across country without killing one another...mostly.The film spawned a number of sequels over the years, which saw the Griswold family celebrate Christmas, fly to Europe, and even gamble in Vegas. It's been about 18 years since we saw the Griswold clan go on vacation or celebrate a holiday, and Hollywood thought it was time to reboot the franchise. Writing team John Francis Daley (Sam Weir from 'Freaks and Geeks') and Jonathan Goldstein struck gold with their scripts for the 'Horrible Bosses' films, and were now given the chance to direct as well the new installment of the 'Vacation' franchise. Instead of completely rebooting the franchise from scratch, Daley and Goldstein made a late sequel, which follows Clark's son Rusty (Ed Helms), who has a family of his own now including his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two young sons James and Kevin.To surprise his family by not going to the same old boring cabin in the woods every year, he decides to take his family to Wally World, the place where he first took that infamous road trip, and of course they're driving there cross country. Well of course, you can imagine, things don't go according to plan. Daley and Goldstein did a great job with the screenplay, by keeping things fresh and original, while paying homage to the original film.There are problems with the vehicle that travels across country, interesting night time talks at a motel, and side trips to see famous landmarks, but that's about as similar it gets to the original. Every thing else stands on its own and is down right laugh out loud funny. For instance, when the Griswold family meet up with sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) in Plano, TX and her hunk of a TV weatherman husband Stone Crandall (Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth), where he can't stop talking about faucets. Through all of the laughs, one things remains constant, and that is what Chevy Chase showed us in the original films.Clark taught us that no matter what issue arises, he will do anything it takes to make his family happy and have a good time on vacation, so they can better bond and love each other. Ed Helms conveys this perfectly, and it's as heartwarming as it is funny. Packed with some excellent cameos, past and present throughout, this new 'Vacation' film has already earned the stamps on its passport and is ready for its next vacation. (I'm sorry about the pun, I'll show myself out.)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see the movie Vacation today. IT IS TERRIBLE !!!. This is the second movie that I have went to where the 4-letter words were almost every other word. Even the youngest actor let the words fly. And if it wasn't the 4-letter words, it was the references to anatomy. The plot is vaguely like the other vacation movies. Where the original Vacation movie spent a lot of time at the stops and mishaps along the way, this one only shows a few stops, none of which was as memorable. If you go there expecting the same as the other Vacation movies, you will be greatly disappointed. The best parts of the movie is on the television advertisement. It's time we demand Hollywood to make good movies. Stay away from this one.</fullReview>

Very cheesy jokes, cringe worthy scenes and my goodness the child actors are just so bad and full of F bombs and other bits of profanity that are just not necessary.

I waited for 4 days in line, and when people and some newscasts saw me camping out, I explained to them that I had to see this movie before it goes to Redbox. I got into the theater, front row, with my bucket of popcorn and large Diet Coke. I laughed so hard during the trailers, nobody would sit by me, which is a strategy that I use for special occasions. The actors were hilarious, the plot amazing and the laughs were non-stop. I never moved for the whole movie, but when it was over, I pretended to go get popcorn and saw it four more times. Go see it. Spend a ton on popcorn and wait until the last credit rolls. Tears will flow. You will thank me later.</fullReview>

It is very similar to the original, humour wise, slightly more near the knuckle, which I appreciate, those who say it's to bad taste, there are a lot worse out there, but then, I like those as well. Anything against PC is good for me.Anyone that liked the originals will like this, they have nods to a lot that happened in the 1st vacation film, it has Chevy and Beverly in as well which is a plus, and I chuckled and even laughed out loud a few times, which doesn't happen much these days with comedies, as most are so bland and family based.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Round up the Family and Return to Wally World! (Not Wal-Mart)A new generation of Griswold's ride the highway."I've never even heard of the original vacation." The kid tells his parents."Doesn't matter," his father replies. "The new vacation will stand on its own."The film National Lampoon's Vacation, sometimes referred to as Vacation, is a 1983 American comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and starring Chevy Chase (Saturday Night Live, Hot Tub Time Machine), Beverly D'Angelo (Annie Hall, American History X), Randy Quaid (Caddyshack 2, Brokeback Mountain), Dana Barron (Christmas Vacation 2, Death Wish 4), and 1980s icon Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club). John Candy (Space balls, Home Alone), Imogene Coca (her work includes various television shows), Christie Brinkley (model, and various commercials), and Jane Krakowski (Fatal Attraction, Pixels) appear in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by one of my favorite directors, and another 1980s icon, John Hughes (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club). It is based on his short story "Vacation '58" which appeared in National Lampoon.Since then, we have had many Vacation films, the most recent one being the 2015 reboot Vacation. Written and directed by Jonathan Goldstein (Has been a writer for The PJ's and The Geena Davis Show) and John Francis Daley (Freaks and Geeks, Horrible Bosses). This film marks their directorial debuts. It stars Ed Helms (The Hangover, We're the Miller's), Christina Applegate (Anchorman, Bad Moms), Skyler Gisondo (2007s Halloween, Air Buddies) Steele Stebbins (A Haunted House 2), Leslie Mann (Funny People, This is 40), Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers), Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase. It is the fifth installment of the Vacation film series, the second not to carry the National Lampoon name after Vegas Vacation, and was released by New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. on July 29, 2015. When this film came out it received some nasty reviews, and for that exact reason, I decided not to see this film at the theaters. I decided to watch it at the comfort of my own home, and I am glad I did. I would not have paid full price to see this film, but at the end of the day I am glad I saw it. One thing I did not enjoy in the film is the constant reminder of we are not the old vacation. We are something new. It was trying too hard to be self aware, very much like the 21 Jump Street film. The original film is a classic. It is funny; it had a statement to make about families, American vacations, and the love of the family. It was the family along with the situations that made it great. The filmmakers knew, that the situations cannot out due the character development of the family. With this new film, the situations out do the characters. Honestly, the family comes off a little unlike-able. The yell and use profanity at each other, fight, talk bad about each other behind each other's back (Yes, I'm looking at you Christina Applegate), and like a dysfunctional family. If the biggest compliment you can find about the family is that they are dysfunctional, maybe they should consider some rewrites. That way we slightly care more about the characters."DON'T SAY WEIRD SH*T!"In my opinion, the best surprises come from the back seat of the car. Whereas "the original had a brother and sister, this time we've got two boys." The big twist is that the younger brother, Kevin, played by Steele Stebbins. He is the standout of the film. He made me laugh constantly. Even though he is the alpha, constantly bullying his dopier, sweeter older brother James, played by Skyler Gisondo. It starts out with name-calling, but leads to some shockingly dark places, such as a repeated gag where Kevin manically tries to smother James with a plastic bag. The movie does have some laugh aloud moments. I never knew Chris Hemsworth could be so funny. His comedic timing is perfect, his delivery is funny, and he really surprised me here. Even though I previously wrote that the situations out do the family, the situations are actually somewhat funny. Some of them are a hit and miss, but I personally enjoyed most of them. Even though it is one vulgar joke after another that does not really, lead anywhere, I did laugh more than I criticized. It's not as good as the original, but it is at least a onetime watch.SO HOW IS CHEVY AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY DOING?One word, and that word is just, decent. Do not go in here expecting the old Chevy Chase. I cannot tell if he was acting, or if he really is a crazy old man know. There is a scene in the movie, where Chevy holds up his grand-kids. When he walks away with his kids, it was so obvious it was a stuntman wearing a toupee. I believe, at this point in his career, Chevy should just stick to simple cameos at this point. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Vacation. The film is childish and badly written at some parts. It is not very shocking anymore to see fecal matter on screen anymore, or hear a kid use profanity, it's been done. I did laugh, though the cameos were well done, and something to watch if you are bored. The movie does have flaws, and is not as great as the original, but it is a good time waster. I believe this film earns a?6/10.This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, Don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this remake/revamp or re-whatever you wanna call it of an American classic was terrible..! Not only was it not funny.. It was unfunny which is the total opposite of the meaning of a comedy..! I've read that it's a remake that's trying to stand on it's own well someone better call Life Alert because this comedy has fallen &amp; it'll NEVER get up.. Every scene seemed as if it were filmed in blocks &amp; tapped together to complete the film.. There's no connectivity at all &amp; seems like they were following clues to a funny map that has no X marks the spot on it.. I'd say kerplunk to this turd &amp; flush without even looking to see how big is</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a lot of bad reviews for Vacation so I wasn't expecting to like it at all.It was a funny movie until the scene where Rusty is driving &amp; starts flirting with the lady driving the sports car next to him.She veers onto oncoming traffic &amp; gets smashed by a truck.Rusty looks in his rear view mirror &amp; you see a big ball of smoke.Could somebody explain to me how this is funny?! After that I couldn't watch anymore.I remember when Vacation 1st came out, a couple of the trailers looked pretty funny.I couldn't wait to see the movie &amp; then after I saw the trailer with the car crash in it I no longer had any interest in seeing it.I completely forgot about that until I started watching the movie.Before the car crash scene, Vacation was a funny movie except for the sorority party scene.I thought it was way overdone &amp; lame.I guess since I couldn't finish the whole movie, that's my review</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the movies of Vacation were in my opinion a great success. Christmas Vacation is a movie I still watch every year around Christmas time! And now there is Vacation 2015. And yes, yet again with Chevy Chase, but Chevy is not the main star in this movie. In Vacation 2015 his son Rusty is the prominent star in this movie together with his wife played by Christina Applegate. The humor in this movie is the same kind of humor you saw in the previous vacation movies and this kind of humor is something I can appreciate! I liked this movie! With a certain type of vehicle, if you can call it a vehicle, the family goes on its way to Wally World. And of course also this trip is a trip from disaster to disaster!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excessive Profanity and Predictability Spoils This Vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original National Lampoon's Vacation movie withstood the test of time because of the brilliance of the acting, comic timing, and the very realistic situations that could happen to a family on a vacation where "Murphy's Law" that "Anything could go wrong, will go wrong." is proved. The original Vacation had the proper settings for comic build up, with some levels of raunchy behavior, but at least there was a reason for the behavior, and there was great humor that led up to that behavior.This Vacation shows that the writers main premise was to have a twelve year old kid drop F-bombs and have the main characters often engage in sexual situations for little more than shock value. This story has Rusty as an adult looking to bond with his wife and sons by taking them to Wally World to reconnect with them. Continuity is incorrect as Rusty tells his family what a wonderful time he had at Wally World as a kid. As most know from the original film, this is incorrect, Rusty's trip to Wally World as a kid was a series of disasters one after the other along the way. It is as if the writers of this remake forgot that main point!Some of the situations are funny, but others are not. A scene where the vulgar twelve year old younger brother tries to suffocate his older brother by putting a bag over his head goes too far. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo who had such classic chemistry in the original film exist in pointless cameos, reduced to being cold and lifeless.Having said that, there are some funny situations, the writing however is not original at all. There was so much profanity, even in the end credits song, and that was sad to hear. Much less profanity and less forced sexually suggestive dialogue would have made this Vacation a much better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go: When I heard that they were going to be making a new entry into the Vacation series, a movie series that I adore(Christmas Vacation will forever be a classic), I was a little worried to say the least. The casting of Ed Helms, and Christina Applegate did ease my mind a bit. I love Ed on the office and the various movies that he has been in. Same with Applegate. As I sat down in the theater I prayed that this movie would deliver at least a couple laughs. I was wrong. It delivered a TON of laugh out loud moment.I was truly surprised at how vulgar it was, considering the originals were all in the pg, pg-13 realm. This movie had a bunch of laughs from start to finish. It was also helped along by some great quest stars including, Charlie Day, Leslie Mann, and most surprisingly, Chris Hemsworth. Yes, Thor was in this movie, and he was great. To me, him, and day provided the biggest quest star laughs. Although Chevy and Beverly where in this movie, there screen time was only a couple minutes, and not that funny. The two sons, played by Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins, held their own with multiple laughs with the side plot of older brother versus younger brother.Overall, I would say this this movie definitely held its own against the originals. Although I always think the originals will outshine this movie because of nostalgia, this to in time, will go down as a great entry into the series! Recommendation: See in theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second half was actually watchable... kinda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about this ... thing?It's not a comedy, people forgot what that is, whoever made this. Is it an actual movie? Someplaces it has structure, and scenes with comprehensive purpose, but ofttimes it's just arbitrary scenes piled up on each other like in many trash Hollywood motion pictures today.It's a typical production based on slapstick "humour", in which actually is on the same page with the original '83 one, but definitely with generational difference. The original, of course, as a first entry had to be a movie, with rational storytelling based on action- reaction type of situations, on which this type of humour could easily rely on, because it had satirical quality about everyday people wanting to do everyday things in America in the 80's. Here, actually, is the same situation, and because of that I actually giving points for this movie. It also tries to reflect the ungodly pop-culture society we live in today showing boys mutating into something feminine, people getting simply violent for no reason, kids throwing "fu**" for no reason, and of course the all- kinds of social differences between people nowadays. But it also holding these terrible qualities representing the taste movies, or simply people have today: terrible, un-tasteful surface, and nothing or rarely comprehensive structure under that. In other saying: mostly empty.The movie doesn't work as a comedy, because it is not a movie. It's an awkward-fest with actually good cast. The humour didn't work because it had nothing to do with the things I noted above. Any feature that had anything to say to the audience, any-kind of criticism of something was the only thing measurable, problem is, beside this nothing works, it's a mess with sometimes good ideas. However, the second half of the movie could bring up better scenes, by which I actually laughed at or appreciated. The suicidal- heartbroken guy scene, which was actually still poorly written, the violent fighting scene at the end, and most importantly, the evolution of the forging family, a family, which had this weird characterism based on today's social qualities slowly emerged into a classic family with normal attributes, or normal understanding about being a family... or something like that, you know what I want to talk about, it suddenly became the family which was parallel with the old one, they were real people, with real perspectives about social life, the brother-little brother connection got back to normal measurement, the husband and wife found out how to be happy together etc.. So yeah, some layers were actually nice, the problem is, that they were in an ocean of messiness. It's a lazily handled Hollywood flick with no structure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie if somewhat lazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like dumb crass comedies, you really can't go wrong with this.It stays consistent with the vibe from the original movies and has plenty of good laughs.Ed helms does a good job as the dad. Otherwise, the cast was pretty decent overall, but nothing to rave about. I feel they got a bit lazy in terms of really finding interesting comedic actors and crafting hilarious memorable characters. I think that is part of what will separate this from truly great comedies like the original. The jokes were funny, but the characters were forgettable. Even when they had potential to be memorable, like with the truck driver at the end, instead it's just your average dude.I will also say that there is a bit of inconsistency in the characters. Like the writers didn't really take the time to figure out who their characters were, but instead were focused on writing stupid jokes. For example, the dad knows what a glory hole is, but has never heard the term rim job?So I don't think this movie will be remembered as anything remarkable, but its still a great way to pass some time if you want to watch a dumb but very funny comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rusty Griswold is a parent...is this a scary movie???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of Christmas Vacation, I'm not fond of any of the Vacation movies. I found them pointless, tasteless, and extremely painful to watch. When I come about this title, I suppose I was expecting another bad remake from a director who was born at the same time the original film was made. No. Even better! Rusty Griswold is now all grown up, and he's taking his family on a trip to Wally World, despite remembering what a disaster this all turned out to be when his own parents took them there. So, what to expect? Well, expect to be opened up to a "not so funny" plane ride ( hey, at least it didn't take the arm off the Statue Of Liberty!), and a "no so funny" detour to swimming in raw sewage. Sound like a fun movie? It shouldn't. It's sad when a good cast, fairly decent director, and a fun atmosphere can be ruined by such lame script writing. We've all soon this garbage before, so what's left to show? Nothing. So, we have about an hour and forty something minutes of recycled garbage to watch...not to mention the truck chase by a disgruntled truck driver with a teddy bear nailed to its grill. ( Was it nailed, or strapped, or glued, or did they even say? I dozed a few times, did they say?) It could have been great, but hey, some movies slip on banana peels all the time, and Vacation was one of those slippers in 2015. Great efforts, though, I have to admit. It's deliberately raunchy, deliberately offensive, but if you've been around on the planet for about 40 years plus such as myself, I doubt anything shown here will catch you too much off guard. Is it funny or as funny as the original? That will be up to you to determine. I can't say, since I'm not a fan of the Vacation films, but I did want to give this a benefit of a doubt. Silly me. I need to stop doing that, and go with my gut feelings.</fullReview>

Needless to say, things don't go quite as planned.I saw this in theaters back when it first came out. I don't remember that much about it, but I remember I laughed here and there. I ended up having an OK time with it. As long as you don't expect the original, I think you'll be OK. The cast is certainly game. I enjoyed Ed Helms. Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase showing up was cool as well. The original is one of my favorite comedies of all time. It's rather uninspiring, but at least they didn't tarnish the memory of the original. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please never watch this movie. The only worse movies are the ones INTENDED to be a bad movie. The whole thing, plot, acting, jokes are very forced, and all jokes are overused, nothing comes naturally and nothing is actually funny. A lot of scenes were painful to watch, I am not sure why I even watched it to the end. The characters are also very cliché, but they could be OK, but the whole thing is just boring and forced. I was really bored when I started watching this but maybe I would have been better off without the movie. I seriously didn't laugh once. Many of the happenings are simply unimaginable (what is with that car, impossible, also, why would she ever marry him if he is like that - takes away all the credit).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offensively hilarious disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not any ordinary family vacation. In fact, it was more of a disaster than anything else.It began as Russell Griswold, played by Ed Harris, wanting to take his wife and kids on a vacation road trip to the amusement theme park Walley World. But little did Russell know what was about to come from the trip that awaited him and his family. There were some off the wall far-fetched sequence of event, but it was well worth the humor involved with it. A lot of it was totally inappropriate and offensive, but it kept the movie going.Russell's youngest son Kevin, played by Steele Stebbins, was absolutely out of control in this movie. That kid had said some of the most derogatory comments that a child could possibly say, and it was non-stop funny.For those who do not have a dirty sense of humor, then movie is not for you. But for those people who enjoy off the wall never been said before excitement, then this movie will be sure to have you laughing.</fullReview>

Incredibly annoying to watch when that kid is on screen. Other than that There was adequate comedy that makes all sorts of viewers of comedies laugh out loud. I highly enjoyed the references as I am also a fan of the previous Vacation films. Although it's clear the movie doesn't have the "National Lampoon's" feel, there is still plenty of comedy to go around with just enough awkward to make the movie have some cringe-worthy moments. All an all worth the first time watch,but I wouldn't put it on my rewatch list of movies. This is more of the "ask a girl to come over to your house and watch a movie" but you don't actually watch the movie, kind of movie. Enjoy! The girl.. not the movie..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though no where near the original in comedy value, this Vacation has some original twists along with the familiar territory. Unfortunately there are tedious moments aplenty. The scene at the four corners for instance. Another disappointment was the material given to Chevy Chase being totally inadequate. The fight at Wally World was yet another misfire, with Ron Livingston mostly wasted. Nevertheless, the ridiculous car they drive is a bunch of chuckles, and the suicidal white water guide is hilarious. Sure the swearing grows thin real quick, and both kids are annoying, but somehow the film generates enough laughs to clearly rate above average. - MERK</fullReview>

Gosh, I don't know. There's only one, "one". But, this movie actually had me laugh out loud throughout the ENTIRE move. That's a major feat for me. A movie has to really be funny for me to do that. Original writing, original comedy - original acting. This movie has it.There had to be the downers with this movie. The people that said this could never be as good as the original. And you know what, this movie is does truly stand on it's own. That's a major feat these days.Watch this movie because you like the comedy represented by the original and Chevy Chase. Watch this because you like raunchy, funny movies that aren't completely PC. Watch this because it's GOOD!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre, but a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rusty Griswold returns home from his job as a pilot for EconoAir to find his youngest son, Kevin, bullying his uncomfortably awkward older brother, James. Kevin had written, "James has a vagina" on his guitar. Later that night, Rusty had the misfortune of overhearing his wife, Debbie, discussing how she hates going on their annual trip to a cabin in Michigan; Rusty decides to change things up in attempt to bring his family closer together. He elects to follow in his dad's footsteps and plan a 2500-mile trip to Walley World in California, a la National Lampoon's Vacation, 1983. Even though Vacation 2015 has essentially the same storyline of the 1983 film, it falls short in both content and connection with its audience.The uncanny similarities between the two films began when Rusty comes home with a gaudy and ridiculous Albanian-made Tartan Prancer. Early in the trip an attractive younger woman driving a red Ferrari passes Rusty; this is the exact situation that Rusty's dad, Clark Griswold, found himself in Vacation 1983. However, instead of seeing her later in the movie as Clark did, she goes head-on with a semi-truck and is presumably dead in an attempt at humor. This is where Vacation 2015 begins to try too hard to be funny in an agonizingly forced manner.Along the way, the Griswold's time and time again find themselves in sticky situations. It begins when Rusty decides to make a surprise detour to the college where Debbie went to school as well as to her sorority house. Unbeknownst to Rusty, his wife is the legendary 'Debbie Does Anything' in the sorority. Debbie quickly realizes after chugging a pitcher of beer and promptly projectile-vomiting in front of a large crowd that she can no longer 'do anything.' This scene is undoubtedly funny, but is lacking the realism of every day life most people can connect to. Ed Helms, who plays Rusty Griswold, fails to fill the shoes of the iconic Chevy Chase playing Clark Griswold in the 1983 film. Helms sense of insecurity is apparent by the way he almost awkwardly speaks and holds himself; this causes him to fall short of the bold and confident Chase. Helms also lacks a connection to the audience, as well as to his on screen wife and kids, which is due to his apprehensive aura. Helms' wife, Debbie, who is played by Christina Applegate doesn't add much to film and definitely lacks chemistry with her husband anyone would find convincing. In my eyes the two characters that really made the movie are their two children; James, played by Skylar Grisondo and Kevin, played by Steele Stebbins. The constant antics between the two are both entertaining and funny. Throughout the movie Kevin constantly bullies his older brother by doing things such as foiling his attempts at seducing a girl he meets, putting a plastic bag over his head, and even throwing a needle at him while swimming in the septic dump they believed to be a hot spring. Stebbins never failed garner laughs; he always had something vulgar and witty to say, which made him a blast to watch.After experiencing some catastrophic trouble with the Prancer, the Griswold's visit Rusty's parents at their home. Rusty's parents, Clark and Ellen Griswold, are played by the original Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Chase brings energy and passion through his booming voice and renowned slap-stick, as he did in Vacation 1983. Chase's relationship with D'Angelo also, fortunately, has the same spark it had in the 1983 film. D'Angelo and Chase are so relatable and lovable, it's a bit like seeing old friends for those who have seen the 1983 film; this is the essential element that Vacation 2015 really missed the mark on this time around.Vacation 2015 was full of ridiculous and obscure situations, didn't have the lovable family man, and ultimately didn't live up to the original National Lampoon's Vacation, however, it is still worth seeing. More than likely if you've watched any of the National Lampoon's Vacation films this will be a must-see; not because it is their best film, but because for many it is nostalgic and it will give you a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should You Spend Your Vacation Watching This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Vacation films are the kind of films that you can't take too seriously and in fact you shouldn't watch it unless you have a group of people to laugh along with you. The films are a fun time with a group of friends or maybe some family members. The film is about a family who goes on a vacation that of course doesn't go their way and they end up going through chaos. This film is not that great as your typical comedy film. Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins do provide the film with some good comedic moments. There may not be enough to laugh your butt off the entire time but there is just enough so you are not completely bored. This film was not as great as the previous vacation films but still remains somewhat decent and is worth at least one watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of vacations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This vacation stands on it's own", something Rusty Griswald, says early in this rehash sort of pic. You could say that as flaky statement to this movie. Vacation does have many funny moments, some of them, I admit are really priceless, none more funny than the Hemsworth bedroom, intrusion scene, packing a lot of sausage. In between the funny bits though are dry patches, a few intentional bits, jokes, falling flat on their face. Helms as Rusty Griswald, decides to bring family closer together and revisit that unforgettable theme park, just like he did, many yesteryears ago with his klutz father Clark, who we meet near the end (a really beefed up Chevy Chase) Christina Applegate is really good as Rusty's wife, and like the first Vacation, there are moments that we familiarize with the first, and again, like the first, there are some cruelly funny bits here, notably the hot chick in sports car scene. We also have a vengeful trucker on the Griswald's tail. Hemsworth as Audrey's second half absolutely steals every moment he's on screen, we are rudely reminded of how good this actor is. At it's start, I kind of anticipated a much funnier movie, or may'be I hung my hopes too high. The killer roller coaster mishap, I unconsciously predicted, before the line wait out, I couldn't believe it happened. One thing that sucked in this pic, was the slow version of Holiday Road. We can only feel appreciative of the small time we share with Chase, where his part, hardly raises a laugh. I like some of the original touches, gags to the movie, like the beer chug run, and again, I really like what Applegate brought to her role. Still this Vacation, not a bad run, does suffer it's suffer it's faults, and needed to better applied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a movie is going to be bad when it starts with every 5th word a four letter one. That is the best the weak excuse for a story, the amateur writers, could come up with. Even the theme song (not the original Vacation jingle, the 2nd one you here) is all F' words. Since they call this a "Vacation" movie, the Griswold family and all, there going to be an inevitable comparison. This nothing at all like the original movies. Those were lighthearted, unassuming, and fun. This movie is absolute trash. Even if you looked at it not being a "Vaction" movie it would be even worse. What a waste of resources and talent (the writers excluded). All the F' words, lowbrow tasteless non-humor, couldn't save this trash heap they call a movie. Flat out lame! If I could give it a negative start I would.I'm going to go back and watch one of the originals and pretend this one never happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to give any spoilers, but after watching this, I have to assume there are some VERY drunk people who rated this, or the studio had about 200 people who worked on the movie come here and give it a good rating. I want my 95 minutes back. Sure, it's got Christina Applegate, she's cute but she doesn't have much to work with. Think about every horrible cliché you can come up with, then imagine it in a movie where the acting is horrible, with a bad plot, and that's this movie. That's pretty close to a spoiler. Don't waste your time, it's not even worth seeing on cable, you'd be better off being waterboarded, or perhaps beheaded, your pick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I'm saying this, but this Vacation continuation was really funny! The car was freakin' laugh-out-loud hilarious, too, and left you desperately wanting for them to hit more buttons.The only major knock I have against this movie is that Rusty didn't feel quite like Rusty. Ed Helms is awesome, of course, but the old Rusty Griswold we know and love was usually the smartest guy in the room. This new Rusty devolved into his own clueless dad, which made for a lot of good comedy, but just felt a little bit wrong.I'll go see more, if they make them. The original European Vacation has always been my favorite of that series... let's see another one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot of history in this movie. From the very origins of Laurel and Hardie and slapstick humour to the Vacation series. The added sexual content tilts this remake more in the direction of Porky's and teenage bawdy humour. General every character holds their own and the plot begins quite realistically. Truly the best acting or most realistic feel from the characters came from the "kids". At times the adults seemed over stressed in their roles. In all, it was a good laugh. A great movie for a rainy day, a long flight or a kick back and chill moment. The values are pretty wholesome, despite the swearing and sexual innuendo. I love the cameo of Chevy. It's hard to believe that so much time has past. Who knows what the next generation will create. It does remind us that despite the many challenges of life, the foundations of family haven't changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, swimming in faeces _is_ funny. It just is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the negative reviewers of this film made this comment: "...swimming in feces is supposed to be funny?" Well, if the idea of a whole family finding itself inadvertently up to their shoulders in radioactive poo doesn't tickle your funny bone, you aren't going to enjoy this movie.It's certainly possible to play a scene like that in a way that isn't amusing; what makes it work here is that we have a situation that is on the one hand utterly absurd, yet at the same time horribly believable. I've been on family holidays and done things that are no more ridiculous than the escapades of the Grisworlds; in fact, every time Rusty did something stupid, the rest of my family looked at me in a sly, knowing way. This is precisely the reaction they gave me in all the other Vacation movies.No, the real humour in this movie doesn't come from swimming in crap, or any of that other slapstick stuff -- at least not entirely: it comes from the latent silliness in family life. In particular, it comes from the utterly unrealistic expectations that we all have of our parents and our children, and what happens if we are daft enough to let those expectations direct our actions. When I was much younger I loved the Vacation movies because I thought they were sending up my parents. When I was older, I thought they were sending up my children. Now, of course, I understand that they were doing both these things at the same time.Yes, it's mucky -- uncomfortably so in places. But, really, it's no worse than the originals. Have you seen them lately? Neither the references to sex, nor the foul language, are any more shocking than the originals, and they all look pretty tame alongside "Ted," for example. But this is much funnier than Ted. I started laughing in the first minute, and I didn't stop until the closing credits. At times I laughed so hard I thought I would swallow my own eyeballs.The only thing that stops me giving this film ten out of ten is that there isn't enough Chevy Chase in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The National Lampoon series has been pretty awful for the past decade or so, so I wasn't expecting a huge amount from this movie. Happily it proved to be much better than I had thought. It really does stand as a great comedy movie on its own merits and although it helps if you know the backstory, it's not really essential. The comedy is noticeably more "modern" than the original Vacation and like so much else has been influenced by the Apatow / Farrelly movies of the 2000s. That's no bad thing though, as it's generally hilarious. The only slight misfire, weirdly, is the cameo by Chevy Chase later in the film that doesn't quite work. It's nothing to do with the story, but more the fact that his performance is weirdly flat, especially compared to everyone else in the film. I know he's getting on a bit, but he really seems like life has kicked the crap out of him and his turn as Clark feels a bit out of place. Overall though, a great laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't laughed this hard for a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Vacation' movie was a comedy classic which has the rare ability to remain funny in today's modern, evolved-humour world. The sequels not so much. The sequels lost that magical touch the original had, partly because they were often rated lower to cater to a more family-friendly audience and partly because they were often showing the actual holiday itself as opposed to the journey getting there. This remake/reboot/sequel, whatever you want to call it, finds that magic again for the first time since the original was released 32 years ago.I wasn't quite sure what to expect going in. The poorly made sequels to the original had left me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth and I worried we could be in for more lame comedy gags that barely make you crack a smile. If I had known just how funny it was actually going to be I wouldn't have waited this long to see it.The first improvement I noticed were just how funny the children were as characters for once. They were responsible for a number of the heavy laughs throughout. When you only have four central characters in your story why waste any of them, right? Secondly Ed Helms and Christina Applegate really bought into the whole thing and actually had terrific comedic chemistry. Helms is always brilliant in whatever he's in. I genuinely believe the 'Hangover' series would not have been what it was had anyone else been cast in that role. A great choice to cast him in the lead role hereFinally the 'R' rating was the best thing that could ever have happened to this film. It let the children have hilarious dialogue throughout and left the audience never knowing just what was going to happen next. Nothing felt out of bounds. Hilarious scene after hilarious scene take place and best of all the movie has a heart at the centre of it all. There's a real story of saving a marriage going on here that is all too believable. Anyone saying anything negative about this film I can only imagine is simply angry that they dared to remake their beloved original. Ignore the haters, this is one of the best comedies released in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found myself enjoying this flick much more than I originally expected. It's raunchy, edgy and in some ways it has similar elements of the NLP Vacation movies before it. Back when those films were in production they were controversial and this film is nothing if not that. However, for those who like to see movies that exploit the offensive topics our news media obsesses over, the kind of thing that would ruffle the feathers of old fashioned folk, this one is for you. I usually hate child actors as a general rule. They nearly always find a way to screw up something I may have otherwise enjoyed. But the kids in this movie are hilarious. Ed Helms and Christina Applegate play well off each other but Ed Helms really brings it home with his awkward humor and even more awkward facial expressions that at times make you think of a serial killer. All in all, I would recommend it. I'll probably find myself watching again sooner rather than later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm always been a big fan of the Vacation movies. Stupid but great humor from the Griswold family. When I read there was going to be another one I was wondering if it would be as good as the old ones with Chevy Chase. And I have to admit that Ed Helms did a great job as the head of the family. I didn't miss Chevy Chase at all, even though he plays a small role at the end. My wife and I had good laughs during the whole movie and that's what it's all about when you watch a comedy. Certainly one of the better ones that I saw this year. Would I go on a vacation with the Griswolds? Probably not, because there are too much things going wrong. But I certainly would never go on a vacation with the haters of this movie because they have absolutely no sense of humor. Great movie if you like a bit of fun.</fullReview>

Well i wasn't really crazy when i saw the trailer for the first time but i wanted to see it and well it was kind of a disappointment i haven't seen any of the old ones except the Christmas Vacation and that was pretty funny this one not that much too much f-bombs and the comedy felt a little bit forced also Ed Helms didn't seem like the right guy for the role. I enjoyed the cameos and i think Hemsworth was hilarious also i liked every time when they sing the 'Batman Forever' song by seal and i loved the fight scene but that's it. This is another comedy sequel that suffers from the disease of every recent comedy they're just not funny they just throw f-bombs and do awful and disgusting things but the audience isn't stupid they know how a good comedy needs to look like. Anyway if you watch it with low expectations you might like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This new vacation delivers the goods, but it's far from hysterically funny. On its own terms, it's pleasant enough, but I think I still prefer the classic movie. It's also good to hear "Holiday Road" again. While Ed Helms is enjoyable as the leading man, but he's no Chevy Chase. A lot of funny moments abound, but most of them are just cheap laughs, and don't measure up to the ones from 30 years ago. There is one scene that I did laugh out loud at: When the rafting guide starts crying like a baby. The four state corners scene, with one cop from each state, was very unique, even if it wasn't a laugh-out- loud moment. As for the Wally World scenes, I was expecting something better than what I got (although that fight sequence is very creative). I guess not every remake, or reboot, or sequel, (whatever this movie is) needs to be a classic.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK first off I thought this movie was pretty funny and sort of entertaining. I loved the cast, I thought that Christina Applegate really was the best one in the whole movie, she really embodied her character and did well with the material. I also really love to Chris Hemsworth in this movie, I thought he was very amusing. He was also not so bad to look at I might add. The underwear scene with Chris Hemsworth was very funny, and I thought it was one of the best scenes in the whole movie. I also adored Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo and their cameo appearance towards the end. This movie did have some throwbacks to the original which were very appreciated. I personally loved the scene where Christina Applegate goes back to her old college sorority, that was funny. OK now for the downsides to this movie. One of my biggest complaints for vacation is Leslie Mann, I just did not enjoy her in this movie, I thought she seemed too idiotic and just unimportant. I like her in other movies, I just didn't like her here, and I thought that she just didn't give a strong performance. I also didn't really appreciate the whole scene where Rusty runs through a cow, I thought that was just a little too disgusting and I didn't care for it. I also was not a big fan of the older son in this movie, he got on my nerves and I just thought he was annoying. So overall, you have a pretty good film with some flaws here and there along the way. 7/10 for Vacation.</fullReview>

However I felt disappointed in the first 20 minutes by so boring yet repulsive/embarrassing acts along the story.

		<fullReview>"The journey sucks, that's what makes you appreciate the destination." Rusty (Helms) decides to surprise his family with a trip to Wally World. They decide to drive in order to bond with each other. Along the way they stop at various places, all with disastrous results. Just when they think they can't go anymore the meet someone that convinces them to finish the journey. The first time I heard they were making another Vacation movie I was against the idea, then I saw the preview. I thought it could be really funny and sat down with higher expectations then I probably should have. The original was a classic and is still funny no matter how many times you watch it. This is....not that. While the movie did have some really funny parts and I did laugh quite a bit the movie had two fatal mistakes for a comedy. One was the movie tried way to hard to be shocking and it came off feeling forced and not funny. The other, and much worse offense was that it showed all the really funny scenes in the preview, which also gave away some of the gags. The "Griswold Springs" scene being the main thing. If you haven't seen the original this may be OK and you may like it more than I did. As for me, this wasn't close to as good. Overall, tried way to hard to be shocking and funny and that ruined it. Another reason why classic movies should be left alone. I give this a disappointing C+.</fullReview>

But 'disasters' take place during their drive to the Walley World. The movie stars Ed Helms as as Rusty, Chrstina Applegate as Debbie ( Rusty's wife ) , Chevy Chase as Clark, Steele Stebbins as Kevin and Chris Hemsworth as Stone. Ed Helms' acting was good. His acting,sarcasm, are good. Chrstina Applegate did a very good job in portraying as Debbie. From the beginning, she managed to keep everyone laughing. And the brothers in the film ( Chevy and Steele ) , are epic. They constantly fight with each for no apparent reason and love irritating each other. Chris Hemsworth's character was amazing. So if you are intending to watch a movie with your family, here it is. Be cautioned, it has scenes which might not be suitable for certain age groups.My rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return to the Holiday Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a virtually life-long fan of the National Lampoon's Vacation series. For whatever reason, my parents let me watch those films when I was just a little kid. Yet I never saw one in theatres before today (I was negative 1 when the first came out and only 5 when Christmas Vacation came along; Vegas Vacation was best not bothered with). Vacation '15 (obnoxiously given the same title as the original) is, as one critic pointed out, a hybrid of sequel and reboot. Rusty is grown up and head of his own family, Clark and Ellen are old (we've seen them elderly before this in the short Hotel Hell Vacation), but as Rusty boasts in a self-referential moment, the new Vacation will stand on its own.And it nearly does. There were a few things I liked about this, including bringing back the theme song Holiday Road and the R-rated humour. The sex jokes, strong language and brief nudity are back; surprising people accuse this film of being too raunchy when Vacation and European Vacation had topless women, Clark and Ellen reliving dangerous driving, masturbation references, incest jokes, heavy profanity, etc. The fact that Rusty is a pilot is highly significant, as he learned the value of the profession from the long car trip in the first film.There's other light humour that works- old people jokes with a geriatric co-pilot, the exaggerated importance of Facebook "likes" (which are indeed much more artificial than the actual human emotion), and a very foreign car with a swastika button (we saw a similarly unusable foreign car in the Simpsons episode Mr. Plow). The brothers, with the little brat bullying the older, sensitive one with imitation, graffiti and a bag over the head, actually felt more real to me than the token kids in this year's Jurassic World. Conversely, at times it goes to far, with a car crash and a man over a waterfall. These aren't funny, but then, there were things in the originals that I never found all that funny- the dog tied to the car, for example. At least Vacation '15 has more laughs than Vegas Vacation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Griswold Comedy For A New Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation is a comedy classic that still stands as popular with audiences and comedy fans alike, screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein &amp; John Francis Daley (who have writing credits for Horrible Bosses) attempt to bring the franchise back to a new generation for this 5th installment (both considered a sequel or even a reboot) and the results are hilarious, fun and really a great nod to its classic forefather.Vacation is set around Clark's young son Rusty (played by the always funny Ed Helms from The Hangover films and The Office) who is all grown up and is raising a family of his own with his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate), and sons; the shy and anxious older son, James (Skyler Gisondo), and the cruel and mean-spirited younger son, Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Seeing how his family life is apart and aching for a real family connection (especially when hearing about their family's friends holiday to Paris), Rusty decides to ditch the holiday cabin trip and take his family to the same place that his father took him (Walley World) and re-take the road trip to make the most with his family. But in tradition in the Griswold family, chaos and utter hilarity are ensured.What makes Vacation a worthy follow-up to the classic is the blend of today's crude humour with the comedic style from the original. This results in the film being cruder, much cruder than the original but then again most comedies today are just that but it ticks the right boxes for what can make the fans and audience laugh out loud. From jokes about foreign cars, sex, collage fraternities, loveless marriage and such, it suits the road trip comedy well and makes it seem worthy as its original.Not only do the original leading characters appear (we see Clark and Ellen in an older state and Audrey all grown up like Rusty) but we get the key elements from the original that made it recognizable; such as the film's original title theme song 'Holiday Road' by Lindsey Buckingham (which as well gets a cover version by country rock band Zac Brown Band in the end credits) and notably the metaphor joke that makes the reboot/sequel stand on its own and being slightly different from the original 'vacation'.The cast here pretty much nail their roles with what looks like to been a fun film to make; Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold seems like perfect casting as his comedic side always proves to be a hit on screen, Applegate having her great quality talent as seen in both Anchorman films and Hall Pass and notably Chris Hemsworth playing as Audrey's husband who shows not only his funny side but a hilarious moment involving a certain part of the male anatomy. Seeing good'ol Chevy Chase (who is much older now but funny to this day) brings the film to a nostalgic point, he doesn't rely on the present style of comedy but uses his trademark quip that makes him funny.OVERALL: Vacation may seem at first that comedies will never be original or like its processors that made them classics, but it does have a strong attempt to be fun, hilarious and introduce a new generation of comedy lovers that the age old franchise can still kick it. Just hope there's a sequel in future if the filmmakers consider it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Rubbish...Big Disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original Vacation movies, so I'm disappointed that I have to write a dismal review, but I feel it must be done.First off, the so called "humor" is horrible, juvenile, and disgusting. This movie puts regular "bathroom jokes" and the grotesque to shame. Bathing in toxic waste, a cannibalistic cow, perverted sex talk (talks about 'rim jobs' and hearing about how Christina Applegate's character slept with 30 guys before she married Rusty is just sickening-way to spread VD, woman), and the f-bomb (throughout most of the movie)basically summarize this movie. It's sad how society has come to find such things as humorous and goes to show how low class "modern" people are. Yes, I realize that the original movies had swearing, bare-chested women, and some crude jokes, but the new Vacation goes over the top.There is little substance to the plot, save that Rusty's character is trying to be there for his family by taking them on vacation. The plot and acting are simply awful. Even Chevy Chase's acting falls flat and does virtually nothing to redeem the horrible script.For those who hail this as a family movie it is not. The 'R' rating indicates that. This is so NOT appropriate for children. There are much better ways to spend an hour and a half than by watching this monstrosity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you find it funny when someone calls someone a "vagina"? And do you find it funny when that same joke is dragged out for 2 minutes between people calling each other vaginas? If yes, you'll love this movie, and every other shitty movie out there.Honestly, there's not one clever joke in this movie. It's literally just name calling of stupid, vulgar insults such as "stop being such a vagina" (from one brother to another). That's really all this is; low-brow, pathetic, humor that's just funny because "oh, he said the word vagina lol!" Not. Don't see this. Please encourage better films than this that are cleverly and originally funny. I'm a guy who likes things like Knocked Up, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The Office, Workaholics, etc, etc.This is as pathetic as pathetic movies get. I don't even care about getting my money back; just give me the time back that I wasted on this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are more than a few dozen jokes that land, and in general, there's probably more that work that don't, not to mention that Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are both great, as are most of the side characters, but this movie is just so mean spirited, that it becomes hard to watch.The genuine lack of any care or heart in this movie made it impossible to root for or even care for the characters. It felt as if investing in them meant that the movie was making fun of you, as it often does of them.Overall, it lacks the poignancy that set the first film apart. It apes the National Lampoon formula for humor but seems bereft when it comes to showing dad's desperate love for his brood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vacation Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Realizing that his family and his marriage is in a rut, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) decides to take his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and his two sons Jacob and Kevin (Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins) in a strange foreign car on a cross-country trip to "Walley World" following what his father Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) did with him when he was younger hoping to get closer with his wife and to give his family time for some bonding. This trip soon becomes one misadventure for these Griswolds and for anyone who runs into them.I was pleasantly surprised by how funny this film is since some of the reviews I've read have not been to good. Just a warning, this film is not a remake in that it has a new story and the film acknowledges the others and the way it differentiates itself is smart in a meta kind of way. Their vacation will not be like the others because it will stand on its own. Ed Helms is great here as the family's new patriarch. He is clueless and out of touch at times while desperately trying to hold his marriage and family together and his stubborn optimism is infectious. Christina Applegate was solid and had a few good moments as Debbie and she also had great chemistry with Ed Helms' Rusty. They both had their fair share of one-liners and exchanges that were both funny and also real. What really impressed me were the actors who played the Griswold children. Their exchanges with one another are some of the funniest things in the film and they both work well alongside the more experienced actors playing their parents. The chemistry the four of them had with one another kept me engaged and entertained. What I thought also worked was the film's pacing. It kept the story going as they did not stay in the same place for too long and the jokes kept coming and no single joke overstayed its welcome (except for one but that's still pretty good). I can't go any longer without mentioning Chris Hemsworth who is unrecognizable as Rusty's sister Audrey's (Leslie Mann) husband Stone Crandall. His American accent is remarkable and there is one scene of his in particular that you will not forget. We also get to see Rusty's parents Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chase and Beverly D'Angelo) who are still funny after all this time and also have some moments of their own. What I didn't like about the film was that we did not get to spend enough time with either them or Audrey and Stone as each them brought a lot of funny to the film and I just wanted more of that. I found the ending a little disappointing as well but I did enjoy the journey more than the destination. The film has a message about the importance of family and that's a message I can stand by. Despite that message, this film is not for kids and definitely earns its R rating. Be that as it may, this is a funny, smart, and edgy film that should not be missed. This definitely one of the funniest movies of the year and could be the start of a new franchise but I would be okay if this was it.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the hate, it's hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When John Hughes wrote Vacation (based on his own experiences as a child, as was Christmas Vacation) he created an iconic character in Clark Griswold and a signature role for Chevy Chase. Clark was the everyman middle-class father who just wants to have fun time with his family. His na?ve optimism never wavered in the face of adversity. The series however did, after a strong first out things took a dip with the less-inspired European Vacation, then soared again with Christmas Vacation, then nose-dived with the diluted Vegas Vacation. The less said about Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure the better. Also, the "National Lampoon" branding is gone since the name is pretty much mud by this point.Now, 18 years after their last big screen outing, the Griswolds are back. Sort of. Rusty is all grown up with a family of his own. His bored wife and warring sons are sick of the same old family getaways so he plans to recreate his famous trip to Walleyworld. Sadly for Rusty, he has inherited the Griswold disaster gene. As a child he was the perfect foil for his dad, the straight-man, the REAL adult in the household, but now he is a walking calamity zone.Their pilgrimage to visit Marty Moose is a non-stop laugh riot. I was surprised at how savage the critics and audiences reacted to the new Vacation. I went in fully expecting to hate it to the core. But I've never laughed so hard at a movie in a long time. Chevy might be reduced to a bit-part but Ed Helms really does soar as Rusty and Christina Applegate is way funnier here than she was in those overrated Anchorman movies and Chris Hemsworth also proves he's apt at comedy as Audrey's overbearing husband. Many have criticized the low-brow humor and in a way they are correct as the clever darkness of Hughes/Ramis is missing, however the jokes as so numerous you'll still be grinning for ear-to-ear for the entire running time. It's one of those movies that will keep you laughing long afterwards. I have to admit that the marketing of this film was pretty pathetic though. What happened to the Boris Vallejo art of the original and the first sequel? Even Christmas Vacation has recognizable poster art (again copied by Vegas). The poster art for this movie is so generic and unimaginative. They really dropped the ball there and completely failed to separate the film from any other generic comedy in that regard.Give the movie a chance. In a summer featuring dismal failures like Fantastic Four and Pixels there's no real justifiable reason why Vacation is being rated so low. It's funny, it's a good time. I place it in the middle of the five films in the series, ranking it above Europe and Vegas, and it really does get the series back on course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly this is an amazingly funny film and I suspect the bad reviews are coming from people and critics who are easily offended. The humour is near the knuckle at times as the jokes come thick and fast. There are lots of running jokes throughout the movie too. I'd have to say this is the best comedy film for quite some time. I am a big fan of the original and was a bit sceptical when I heard of this reboot. But I shouldn't have worried as they have paid lots of homage to the original. Most comedy movies I see generally have one or two funny moments. This movie has too many to count. I really do hope the Vacation series continues on for the new generation as the Griswolds have kept me entertained over the years and kept me laughing. But for now, I'm going to look forward to seeing this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dialogue for Kevin Griswold seemed like listening to child abuse - Kevin is so out of control and snide - he disdains everything - any responsible parent would not tolerate this form of disrespect. When you hear stories about Hollywood's war on American values, this film would be an example. The writers of this fare are going for the middle school demo and what they are modeling to viewers is despicable. It will take years for Ed Helms to live this one down - remember Tom Green and his box office flops - it could happen to you, Ed.Ranks down there with Ladies Man starring Tim Meadows. Oh yeah, it seems it happened to Tim too. Distasteful dialogue and depictions that viewers will not easily forget can do a number on a career. Not exactly entertainment. If you want raunchy then rate it X. See what that gets you.</fullReview>

I'm 55 so have seen a lot of comedies in my life but this one had me laughing from first to last, with no let up. Ed Helms &amp; Christina Applegate are brilliant, as are their sons, and the cameos of Chris Hemsworth and Charlie Day as Sad Chad. Certain scenes actually had me crying with laughter. Also add into this Lindsey Buckingham's classic, driving song and as a package it cannot be beaten. Yes, it's crude, a bit profane, but that just adds into the mix. Probably another cinema visit for it then hopefully it will be out on DVD for someone to buy me as an Xmas present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed the audacious "Hangover" movie trilogy and the two impudent "Horrible Bosses" epics, then you will probably hoot at the reboot of the vintage Chevy Chase comedy "National Lampoon's Vacation." Not only does the new "Vacation" qualify as a remake, but it also serves as a sequel to the four film "National Lampoon's Vacation" franchise. Ed Helms stars as Clark W. Griswold's grown-up son Russell 'Rusty' Griswold. For the record, Anthony Michael Hall played Rusty in "National Lampoon's Vacation" (1983) while different actors have slipped into and out of the same role in the various other "Vacation" inspired sequels. Anyway, Helms plays Rusty as a married man, with a wife, Debbie (sexy Christina Applegate), and two sons, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin Griswold (Steele Stebbins). Comparatively, Clark raised a son and a daughter. The basic premise remains similar despite the 32 year gap between the movies. Oblivious Russell cherishes fond memories of the catastrophic cross-country road-trip that his quixotic father charted for the family and its farcical finale at Walley World. Indeed, much of the same thing occurs again. Co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein, who wrote both "Horrible Bosses" comedies, have ratcheted up the raunch content considerably for bigger, more brazen laughs that may either alienate or engross audiences depending on individual prudery. Incongruity is the cornerstone of great comedy, and "Vacation" delivers laughs and gags galore that more often than not ridicule the characters with whom we are supposed to identify. Actually, Ed Helms, who endured no end of ignominy in the depraved "Hangover" movies, emerges from "Vacation" looking reasonably respectable. "Thor's" Chris Hemsworth has a field day poking fun at his masculinity. Happily, as if to bestow their seal of approval on this side-splitting sequel, Chevy Chase appears in a cameo as a bed and breakfast owner with Beverly D'Angelo reprising her role as his wife Ellen.As the action unfolds, Rusty flies passenger jets for a regional airline, Econo-Air, and the plane that he is flying nearly crashes because his elderly co-pilot Harry (David Clennon) has no business in the cockpit. Ironically, Rusty recommended Harry for the position, so it's Rusty's inadvertent fault that Harry is flying. Meantime, Rusty overhears a little boy who aspires to be an aviator. Naturally, Rusty strolls over to speak to the child. No sooner has Rusty started chatting with the family than Harry ascends the jet to a higher altitude. The turbulence that the plane encounters is violent enough to send Rusty sprawling involuntarily toward the mother. Rusty winds up groping the wife's breasts to keep from landing in her lap. An uneasy silence ensues before another bout of turbulence propels him face down onto the little boy while his thumb plunges into the father's mouth. No matter what Rusty does, well-intentioned or otherwise, his actions hasten the worst possible results. For example, like Clark, who got stuck in the original "Vacation" with the metallic pea-green "Wagon Queen Family Truckster," Rusty rents a hideous, baby-blue mini-cruiser christened the "Tartan Prancer." According to Rusty, this vehicle is the "Honda of Albania." Idiotically enough, this outlandish car features four exterior mirrors; the outside rear view mirrors block the front mirrors. During the excursion, Russell discovers a swivel seat control at the worst moment. Later, the vehicle's on-board navigation system scares them when the voice howls directions in native Japanese. Again, like his impractical father Clark, Rusty wants to do more than just motor across America. He wants his family to experience the scenic beauties along the way. They stop at a crowded, Hot Springs National Park, and an unsavory yokel suggests they take advantage of a less traveled road to a private hot springs. Little do our gullible heroes know this local is setting them up for mischief. Moreover, the gorgeous looking hot springs that the Griswolds splash into turns out to be a raw sewage pit. Murphy's Law governs everything that Griswolds set out to achieve. Nevertheless, each of these encounters is hopelessly hilarious, although you'd hate to find yourself in similar circumstances. A Grand Canyon water-rafting guide (Charlie Day) gets a phone call from his fiancée who decides to dump him. After the Griswolds set out on the river, their suicidal guide alters course for rougher waters that terminate in a waterfall. At another juncture in their journey, Rusty lets Debbie visit her Memphis, Tennessee, college alma mater where he discovers she slept with 30 or more guys before they got married. Of course, anybody who saw the original "Vacation" should remember Christie Brinkley's cinematic debut as a blond in a red convertible Ferrari. Writer/directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein dream up a different spin involving this character.Sure, "Vacation" is both infantile and scatological, but the fearless cast maintains straight faces throughout the hokum no matter how grotesque things get. All too often in lesser comedies, the cast behaves as if they are in on the jokes. Admirably, neither Ed Helms nor Christine Applegate lets on that either know how hopelessly nonsensical their exploits are. Applegate smears feces onto her face and remarks how abominable it smells until she realizes her folly. Furthermore, our heroes cruise for miles without realizing that pranksters have defaced one side of their Prancer with a humongous phallic symbol. When Rusty and Debbie realize that they have a pornographic image on their car, they spit on their hands and struggle futilely to remove it with vigorous scrubbing motions, groaning emphatically with their exertions. No, you shouldn't take their children to see "Vacation," but the Chevy Chase original had some objectionable scenes that weren't fit for young eyes and delicate minds to witness, too. Clearly, freshman directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein have designed their updated adaptation of "Vacation" at audiences that love to laugh out loud and keep on laughing out loud at blatantly vulgar antics that leave little to the imagination. If you like to laugh hard and often, see "Vacation."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a religious right or conservative. I laughed out loud through out this movie. That said, the amount of crude distasteful displays of vulgarity made the movie hard to stomach. This started with the very opening to the movie. Snot and animal humping, total trash. A ten year old dropping 50 f bombs. The Hot Springs scene was to much for me and not believable. So many good scenes and sub stories, it is unfortunate they lost the ability for this to become a classic. I hope this is not what the American public has become and wants. If it is, we have really gone backwards as a society. To bad it had to be an R but this is an R for sure. It would be nice if they would re-release this cleaning up the parts that are way to tasteless and make it a fun family movie for all PG or PG-13. I would love to have a discussion with those that decided the details of this film. I feel they really missed a big opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Terrible, But Pretty Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer for this, I went in expecting it to be absolutely awful. To my surprised, it actually wasn't terrible. With that said, it still wasn't very good. The set-up is almost exactly identical to the original Vacation with an adult Rusty wanting to bring his family closer together by taking them on a cross-country Vacation to Walley World. This sequel/remake (whichever you prefer) has a fair amount of heart to it, but is missing the charm and wittiness that made the original a hit. The humor is very hit-and-miss. There are some funny moments. Two or Three scenes in particular actually made me laugh pretty hard. The main problem with a lot of the jokes is that they are either way too predictable or go on for too long. I would say out of all the jokes here, 75% of them you could predict as soon as the set-up started. During the first half, it also felt like they were trying way too hard to be vulgar for the sake of it. The film also doesn't flow together all that great and feels more like a series. of sketchesWhile the original Vacation focused primarily on Clark, this one tries to focus a bit on each member of the family which doesn't quite work as well. Ed Helms is good, but he's no Chevy Chase. Christina Applegate wasn't bad, but her role could have been played by any other actress. The kids were the weakest link with the younger one being one of the most annoying characters I've seen. The supporting cast on the other hand is one of the strongest aspects of the film with many small appearances by well-known actors. One scene involving Charlie Day is one of the funniest scenes in the film. On the other hand, Chevy Chase's appearance felt really forced as he is given almost nothing to work with. Aside from that scene, their are some nice throwbacks to the original film scattered throughout the movie.Overall, while Vacation wasn't the terrible mess I expected it to be, it's still a very mediocre and forgettable comedy that's missing the charm and wit of the original. It has it's moments, but it's a film that's best viewed on a rainy Sunday afternoon when you have nothing better to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the vacation movies starring Chevy Chase has Clark Griswald, a family man taken his family on vacation, and everything that could go wrong does. Films that where funny, except for Vegas Vacation which I didn't see. Now this was an attempt to revive the series in this sequel/remake.Ed Helms as Rusty Griswald, don't get me wrong he is funny, but nowhere near as Chevy Chase is. Christina Applegate as his wife is good has Helms wife, but the chemistry feels forced. The actors playing there kids are annoying, if you thought the two kids in Jurassic World where bad, these kids here put one up. Leslie Mann makes an appearance has Audrey, and it reminds me that i'm getting so bored with Leslie Mann these days. Chris Hemsworth is alright as Audrey's husband, seems to be having a fun time mocking his pretty boy looks. The problem for me is that the film spends more time being gross out, instead of just going for laughs.Half the time I wasn't laughing, I was wondering if I should walk out, or stay till the end. This film was missing the style of John Hughes writing, he knew how to write comedy. The only moments I thought where funnier when Chevy Chase appears as Clark Griswald, but other than that this movie is a waste of time, it tries to be a Hangover like film, the gross out gags worked in the first two hangover films cause they had timing to them, but here there is no timing to any of it, it lacks the heart and charm of the original vacation films.Wow I never thought I'd see something worse than Hot Tub Time Machine 2 and Hot Pursuit this year, but Vacation is it.Pixels is looking like a comedy classic compared to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't know where to begin. 32 years after his memorable cross country trip to Wally World as a teen with his sister and parents, Rusty Griswald wants to take his wife and two sons to Wally World. Oh, this could have been such a great movie! The original Vacation classic, starring Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo and Michael Anthony Hall paved the way for this sequel. What could go wrong with Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Leslie Mann, Charlie Day, Regina Hall, Keegan-Michael Key and even a guest appearance by Norman Reedus? Well, everything. Rusty, who was a cool, laid back kid 32 years ago is now a huge wimp. He's painful to watch. He's a commercial pilot, but gets dumped on at work, his family don't respect him. He's boring and awkward. His wife, Debbie, is miserable. His oldest son James is awkward, shy, says the wrong things at the wrong time. The youngest one, Kevin, is a potty mouth demon spawn. After dinner with the fun, outgoing neighbors, who've just gotten back from Paris, Rusty, realizes that his family's same yearly cabin vacation is boring and plans a spur of the moment cross country Wally World trip. So the "adventure" begins. Only its not an adventure, it's painful to watch with very few laughs. Debbie is a sullen the trip who seems to care less about her husband. James is literally abused physically and verbally by his younger brother and neither parent does anything about it. Rusty has none of the comedy that his father, Clark had 32 years ago. Just awkwardness. The actors who were actually funny, Regina Hall, Keegan-Michael Key, Norman Reedus, Chevy Chase, don't have enough scenes to make this movie watchable. Bottom line, good actors, bad, bad script. Not enough great acting in the world could have saved this waste of time, money and film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I'd give this a chance knowing it would never be even close to as well made or acted as the original (which I could tell just from the trailer) but I couldn't even make it past the first 10 minutes on video. HORRIBLE ACTING!! HORRIBLE EDITING! HORRIBLE FAKE CGI! Everything from the opening "plane" looks fake, like a cartoon, and it plays like a bad Naked Gun rip-off instead of a road trip comedy. Ed Helms can't act and neither can any of the supporting cast including the kids, except for Christina Applegate. I also find it hard to watch Helms as his fake-looking, too-perfect capped teeth are nearly blinding (it's like watching Friends where Ross whitened his teeth!).Then there is the over-the-top, completely out of context use of profanity for no reason other than to get an R-rating. I'm the last one to care about profanity in a movie (and I don't have kids), but the parents and kids walk saying "F" this and that like it's nothing. In the first 5 minutes there was so much cursing it was ridiculous. No parents talk this way around their kids, or would allow their kids to talk like that! So unrealistic and jarring. It's so out of context and pointless. Horrible screenplay/writing. Trying to "shock" you with profanity from the mouths of babes to get a laugh because nothing else is funny.There is nothing worse than when a director/editor can't even keep an actor on screen to finish 1 sentence of dialog (because he's so bad) that he has to constantly switch cameras. Am I really the only person bothered by this? It's so distracting and unnatural. An obvious chop-shop editing job attempt to cover up bad takes and poorly written/delivered lines. I can't even watch movies like this because the bad acting/constant camera switching is so distracting it gives me a headache. F- for flop central.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2015's Vacation is one of the most boneheaded comedies to happen in recent years. On paper, the decision to continue the Vacation franchise rather than remake/reboot it is not necessarily a bad decision. However, it all comes down to the execution and that's where this movie fails. Ed Helms is completely miscast as Rusty. Whose bright idea was it to make him the lead? Much as I disliked The Hangover, it was definitely better for him to play off the other actors in that movie. His performance is just irritating here. Meanwhile, there's Christina Applegate who radiates sweetness throughout. Thankfully, she's a pretty face and that takes a little of the sting out of watching the movie. Then there are the two boys, who are just forgettable. Their scenes could've easily been cut out of the movie. The rest of the cast just looks dazed and confused. Hope everyone was paid sufficiently. Then of course, there's the humor. Maybe I need to stop watching trailers for comedies because the best parts were in that trailer. Even if I didn't see any trailers though, the jokes just didn't feel genuine and reeked of desperation. Worse of all, it just didn't feel like a Vacation movie. Just a very poor rip-off. The last vacation-themed movie that provoked that reaction was Johnson Family Vacation. Need I say more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you enjoy obscene crude movies this is your bag. I had hoped this movie would be a good sequel to the original VACATION that i have watched many times. I am disappointed in Hollywood and its movie makers who seem to stoop to lower levels in comedy writing. This is not for children. I have hoped movie makers read these reviews and understand why they get bad ratings. The language offends me as does the sexual innuendos used by a child. No parent of any normal intelligence would want to raise their child in such a manner as to let them view this film or even act in it. I was able to view the first forty minutes before finally giving up on this. I do not understand the rating system these days that avoids using the term, obscene with prurient interests, that had been used in the past. It seems Hollywood is trying avoid those terms in order to market more obscene material .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this was an OK movie that could have been great if it wasn't for so much, so much, so much swearing. I mean honestly they just threw in swear words just for the i don't know why. The 10 year old boy swore more in the 2 hours of the movie than I do in a week and I don't consider myself a pristine person. I don't think there was a more than 3 minute stretch in the movie that went with out f this or s that. I am not even going to count minor offensive words. Anyway, for whatever reason the makers of this movie thought if they just string enough rudeness together, it will be funny. It wasn't. However, if you subtract all the rude words, the rest of the movie was actually pretty finny. The next generation of Griswolds got to all kinds of funny high jinks and misadventures. I just wish it was more like the original Lampoons and was PG-13.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) has taken his family to the same cabin in Cheboygan, Michigan for the last 10 years. He overhears his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) complaining about it. He decides to relive his childhood vacation to Walley World. The older son James gets bullied by younger son Kevin. The family gets hounded by a trucker. They visit Rusty's sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) and her well-hung right-wing weatherman husband Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth). James falls for beautiful fellow vacationer Adena. They get to the grandparents Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) in San Francisco.This sequel takes a giant dump on the original and it's happy to do it. It's not what I'm looking for and it's not funny. It's trying so hard. It starts with the opening picture montage. It's not funny to me especially since some of them look photoshoped. It's too big and obvious. As for the new family, Helms and Applegate have their moments. The foul-mouthed little one is annoying. At least, the older one has a love interest but it could have done better. Mann and Hemsworth are a disappointment. It is great to have Chevy again. It's too bad that this decides to take the poop road from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nasty and cynical attitude sinks this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this movie at my neighborhood movie theater, I thought it looked awful, and I cancelled my plans to see it. But today, after several months had passed since seeing the trailer, I found a DVD copy of this movie at my local library. I ultimately decided to give it a chance, partly because I would see the movie for free, as well as remembering that trailers sometimes don't represent a movie well.Even though I saw the movie for free, I paid far too much! The movie is a far cry from the previous "Vacation" movies; even "Vegas Vacation" was much better than this latest entry! My summary line best sums up this movie. Now, I feel I should add that I am no prude - I watch "R" rated (and unrated) movies all the time and I often enjoy them. But the "R" rated humor in this movie is desperately unfunny. It seems more aimed to shock an audience than actually be humorous. It doesn't help that this one-note attitude makes many of the gags predictable before they actually unfold in front of us. The original 1983 "Vacation" was also rated "R", but the adult humor in that movie was FUNNY, CLEVER, and RELATABLE.Also, the movie is missing heart. There is no warmth towards any of the characters. Instead, they are all equally repulsive with their incredible and unbelievable stupidity, constant swearing, foul acts, and various acts of abuse towards each other. Oh, I will admit there there were a few gags in this vomit bag that made me mildly chuckle. But even then, I was wishing for the movie to end long before the final credits started to unfold. Thank goodness this movie bombed in theaters and effectively killed off this franchise - I don't think I could have taken another trip with these gross cretins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing continuation of franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having loved the 1st and 2nd Vacation movies back in the 80's I decided to rent this and I was very disappointed due to the fact that the humor hasn't been updated and most of the jokes belong in the 80's.The story goes that Rusty Griswold who has grown up is taking his own Family on a trip to Wally's world to recapture the feeling of togetherness that he once had.Rusty Griswold is played by Ed Helms who has replaced the original Rusty from the 1st vacation but really here, if you are going for nostalgia then why didn't they use the original actor Anthony Michael Hall ?? Ed plays the character so straight that scenes with him quickly have you reaching for your phone to check the weather. Christina Applegate who plays Ed's wife carries the movie with a believable performance. This brings me back to my comment earlier about the humor not being updated - The 2 kids play basically a jerk and a dumb ass - and they are painful to watch (worse than the 2 kids in the new Jurassic park). The youngest goes off with behavior that makes you scream "just shut up" if you were the Mum or Dad.And being not American, I don't find the foreigner jokes to be funny eg: the Albanian made car or the GPS in Korean. Come on ! It's just not funny !!! It just seems stupid and tacky to be having them in the movie.Rent the original</fullReview>

If you think 9 year olds putting plastic bags over people's heads continuously while screaming f@@##ing abuse at all and sundry is funny then see this. If you think "jokes" about the disgusting sexual practice of rimming is fit for a family movie then see it. If you think a movie that has many porn references and presents sex as purely lust and never love, see it. It has nothing like the heart and warmth of the original.

The premise is something you've seen a thousand times evolving into those Hollywood "smile" moments you've seen a million times. Most of all... it's not very funny. The movie hesitates between being one of those "embarassing funny &amp; hard to watch" humor and something more slapstick and in the end is neither... and is not fun.

		<shortDescription>What a freaky movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a let down. I was excited when I first heard about this movie, as I thought it was a reboot. But soon after I started watching I learned the movie was actually a continuation, except over twenty years or so had passed. Probably the funniest moment happened very early in the movie, in the first scene inside an airplane. The father Griswold had his typical awkward moment with a family of passengers and I thought, this might turn out to be a good comedy. How wrong was I.Sadly, all I witnessed was a series of vulgar jokes, which got tiring and repetitive. There seemed to be something wrong with basically every character in the movie. They all came out as freaks and perverts, but I guess we're all corrupted 21st century children. I usually have a thick skin for a lot of sick stuff filmed nowadays, but one bathroom scene particularly disgusted me.Griswold kids were just plain stupid and annoying as hell. What's with the constant cursing and bad behavior of the youngest kid? Wanted to slap him every time he opened his mouth. And what about the state police at the border? Should shoving a firearm into someone's mouth and sucking it make me laugh? Rusty played by Ed Helms was a typical nerd guy who didn't get laid too often as a teen. He admitted it (3 was his number, and a rule of 3 makes it 1 or even 0 partners). He was clueless and not in a funny way. His wife was the opposite and clearly out of his league, and who wanted to grasp that rubber dong and misbehave.The whole movie was quite awful without any redeeming qualities. I loved the original three movies. Chevy Chase has natural comedy talent that Ed Helms doesn't. Clark got involved in a lot of awkward moments, sometimes with the ladies, yes, but Chevy's interpretation was charming and harmless. Clark didn't feel the urge to shag his wife publicly after seeing some breast. After all, it was an early 80's family movie. How the moral values have changed.Can't believe why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo took part in this movie. Their roles were just five second cameos. Can't really blame them either. Why should they care about anything except a fat paycheck, since the writers didn't let them do or say anything in the first place. Jokes on you. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the trailer and beginning giving the idea this would be somewhat following the same type of exploits and disasters of the "real" Vacation movies... What a disappointment. If you never saw any of the "real" vacation movies, this can be considered funny if you laugh at crude and rude, simply to obtain an R rating when this is otherwise a PG-13 level movie. The language has no excuse except for raising to an R rating. The comedy in many cases would be funny if not anticipated and far below the expectations of a "Vacation" movie. If you watch this at home, it is very likely that you won't watch it to the very end - there are no redeeming qualities. Chevy Chase and Beverly make their necessary appearance, but should be ashamed of being associated with this movie that has no connection with the real Vacation movies other than several people that happen to be in it. If you never saw the real Vacation movies, you will at least find this movie amusing and better than going to the dentist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Couldn't Have Gone Wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In hopes of bringing his family closer together, Rusty Griswold attempts to recreate his own childhood cross-country vacation by bringing them all to Walley World! As you can expect, nothing goes according to plan for this amusingly dysfunctional family.Vacation definitely had its moments and was smart enough to be very transparent in its self-awareness towards being an unnecessary sequel but was that really enough? Well... I have to agree with the bulk of the critics for a change when I say that this flick was nothing short of a let down. I felt like they tried a little too hard to catch us off guard with their politically incorrect humor and while some of it was effective, most of it felt almost too mean-spirited to enjoy. The film undeniably featured some pretty hilarious cameos, including the legendary Chevy Chase himself who treats us with some flawless slapstick involving an acoustic guitar. But when the side characters generate bigger laughs than the main cast does, it's not a good sign. Maybe the directors didn't have their GPS coordinates set properly because they definitely brought this Griswold family off course into mediocrity. I have to hand it to Christina Applegate for going all out with her character no matter how embarrassing her big college campus scene may have been. You can tell everyone really tried to give it their all, but as I previously mentioned, sometimes they just tried a little too hard.Regardless, fans of the original films will be pleased to see the short but fun reunion of Clark and Ellen Griswold for the first time in 17 years, and I'm sure people will get a kick out of Charlie Day's cameo. This It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia comedian isn't on screen for long, but his side-roll as the crazy white water rafting instructor was hilariously priceless! Furthermore, I couldn't resist bopping my head to the classic '70s Holiday Road song that pleasantly supports the clever slide show opening sequence. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm towards the rest of the film isn't so consistent. Sure Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly funny, and the Griswold's infamous 2015 Tartan Prancer, which is actually a fake car created for the movie, proved to be a great impractical highlight, but I can't really think of anything else worth mentioning.Vacation might be leaps and bounds better than comedies like that abomination Date Movie, that came from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie, but that's far from a compliment. One could say some of their jokes are comparable in style, feeling both forced and like a failed attempt to shock, which equally falls flat from the lack of substance or justifiable payoff. Unfortunately, the highly anticipated Dumb &amp; Dumber To suffered similar problems with its inability to persuade the audience in feeling any form of sympathy for its characters. A little sad considering both the original Dumber &amp; Dumber and Vacation films managed to do the complete opposite with the added bonus of leaving the audience in stitches from their gut-busting humor. Thankfully, at least a few modern flicks like Horrible Bosses and The Heat are around to remind us that great comedy isn't completely dead. I just hope to God they don't attempt to give us another Christmas Vacation or, wait a minute? They already did, didn't they? Aw Humbug! With no memorable lines, grosser gags that your most juvenile Adam Sandler flick and an old Clark Griswold reminding us just what we're missing from the classics, Vacation feels more like a forgettable visit to an annoying relative's house for the weekend. Sure, you may find yourself laughing from time to time, but there won't be any sunsets or pi?a coladas on this lackluster trip. But hey, at least the slideshows were nice?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude, tasteless comedy fails miserably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation was one of the most clever comedies of the 80s, and the Griswald family brought the laughs and fun to audiences everywhere. This year, the misadventures of the Griswalds continue with Rusty Griswald (played by Ed Helms), now married to a beautiful woman named Debbie (played by Christina Applegate), and is the father of two boys: shy, kind-hearted teenager James (played by Skyler Gisondo) and the obnoxious, foul-mouthed youngster Kevin (played by Steele Stebbins), who torments James for his own fun. With the family plagued with troubled relationships with each other, Rusty decides to take his family out on a cross country vacation to Walley World, a popular amusement park in California. Of course as you might have guessed, their trip quickly goes off the rails in a series of mishaps and predicaments that stand in their way. Featuring a supporting cast of Chris Hemsworth, Leslie Mann, as well as some appearances by the National Lampoon veteran Chevy Chase, Norman Reedus, and Charlie Day, this movie happens to be the fifth installment of the National Lampoon franchise, not counting the spin-offs.This raunchy, tasteless, and over-the-top installment to the franchise is an abysmal continuation of the classic Griswald family saga that defined the road-trip comedy genre. This film tries desperately hard to be funny, but it fails miserably to bring the spirit of the previous films. Spewing vulgar sex jokes that are so forced and over-the-top dialogue that often comes off as obnoxious, this film fails to bring on true laughter from the cast, to the point where nearly scene feels like a chore to watch. If you happen to be amused by obnoxious penis jokes coming from the mouth of Steele Steebin's character who is probably 9 or 10 years old; or dumb, awkward sex conversations between Rusty and his son, then you just might be in for a funny time. Otherwise, you are facing an hour and a half of torture. Secondly, this film is a bit miscasted. I do not feel like Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are the best choices for Rusty and Debbie Griswald. While they are some funny actors, they just don't really the same flair as the Griswald parents from the previous movies. There are a few semi-funny cameos from some including Chris Hemsworth and Leslie Mann who play a married couple, who help the Griswald family along the way; then a pointless scene with Charlie Day who plays a safari guide on a rafting tour. It comes to show that directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein clearly do not know the formula of the National Lampoon films. Vacation sits down at one of this year's worst films, and is definitely a failed continuation of the Griswald family series. If you are looking for a decent comedy, you are probably better looking elsewhere because this one is a bit of a flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The National Lampoon's franchise is a strange beast that includes a wide variety of movies that range from downright cult classics, to utter bottom of the barrel dross. Aside from the odd one or two, the main movies within the franchise have to be the Vacation flicks which have become the epitome of pure 80's Americana and beyond. The original trilogy consisting of a road trip movie, a holiday abroad and being at home for Christmas, literately resonates with everyone (of a certain age perhaps) and never fails to please. They fit right in at the right times, you can't go wrong at Christmas with 'Christmas Vacation'. Now the big question is, could this new movie (sequel/reboot) manage to hold its own, or would it fall into a pit of pathetic fan service and rehashed gags from the originals? Well everything starts off perfectly, how can it fail not too with that classic rock tune 'Holiday Road'. Yes that sounds like they are just rehashing but lets be honest here, how can you not have that song, its a must, 15 love to the movie. So a nostalgic, rose tinted ripple thundered its way through my body as the credits fired up and you get that familiar montage of family photos/images through the years. So far everything looked good, they seemed to have the right vibe going, that is until we see Ed Helms as a grown-up Rusty and the first visual gag. Basically Rusty is an airline pilot and has stepped out of the cab for a moment, he greets a young boy and his parents. Suddenly the plane hits some turbulence and Rusty's hands are thrown onto the mothers boobies, turbulence hits again and his face hits the child's crotch. This really did feel kinda creepy and childish, not that I am expecting intelligent humour here but still...it also gave us the first of a tonne of profanity. Did the original movies use so much profanity? no, the odd word, one or two, but no, it they didn't need to, so why is this full of it?Alas everything goes down hill pretty fast from this point (in my view). For starters, its not too long after that we discover the plot is just another road trip to Wally World (ugh!). Admittedly there is a reasonably funny scene where the characters address this rehash by making fun of the reboot notion, claiming it won't be the same sh*t as before but something entirely new etc...Clever, but unfortunately they lied, because the film is pretty much the same as the original (ugh!!). Alongside the miscast Helms as Rusty there is Christina Applegate as his wife, never a great sign as Applegate is pretty much a B-list/B-movie actress, and two young lads as their sons (amazed there were no young daughters). One of the boys is small, very rude and obnoxious, he swears a lot which is not a funny as it sounds. The other is the older of the two, bigger, but very effeminate, this guy wasn't too bad and had some decent laughs with his wimpiness. There are also some big cameos in the form of Chris Hemsworth as Audrey's husband who is just some stereotypical jock cowboy type, and of course we see Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprising their roles but not really doing or offering much at the same time. Supposedly a passing of the torch setup, but I'm not overly sure if we're getting anymore of these soooo...Most everything else we see is merely rehashed from the older better movies I'm afraid, its amazing how Hollywood just never learns. We get another sexy girl in a red Ferrari, sure there's a twist for her, but who cares, still the same bloody joke. Even one of the young boys gets a sexy girl of his age in another car setup, just like the Ferrari girl, I mean come on! The plot does resemble the plot layout of the original movie, with the same type of stop overs and the same type of basic story arc, but of course being 2015 the subplots are more relevant. But again its all predictable stuff such as a really dirty, unhygienic motel, some sort of frat house party scenario, the weird foreign car, a crazy trucker (ala 'Duel'), running out of gas in the middle of nowhere and trying to have sex unsuccessfully. Things become really forced and desperate when at one point, Clark and Ellen give Rusty their old Wagon Queen Family Truckster to continue the road trip. Apparently the same Wagon Queen Family Truckster from the original movie, or so it appears. Just in case you forgot this was a National Lampoon's sequel/reboot and they managed to squeeze every last drop of nostalgia into this project. Why would they still even have that car??This movie has moments of decent entertainment that hark back to the good old days but overall its just a very very average film. I really didn't like the excessive profanity which is peppered throughout, including the soundtrack, I really thought it was unnecessary. There is also quite a bit of gore and hints at gore which again kinda felt unnecessary for this type of flick, they really seemed to go far too adult orientated here. It just felt like they ditched the original charm and made everything more...vile, if I can use that word without sounding too extreme. Pretty big swing and miss for me, you can't just rely on the epic main title tune and two cameos.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Need a vacation? Pack your bags and get ready for some laughs with the Griswold family, in the 2015 film "Vacation". This is a hilarious entertaining movie from start to finish in this modern version of National Lampoon's vacation. The youngest son, Kevin, will either keep you laughing with his dirty mouth or turn you away. Although I thought it was funny, there comes a point were enough is enough and I wish he would not use so much profanity. The acting of the characters keeps you believing this is anything but a normal family. While the youngest son (Kevin) is consistently bullying his older brother (James), and parents (Rusty and Debbie) are trying to rekindle there romance, this vacation is anything but a vacation. From the crazy mini-van falling apart: to finally arriving to Walley World, this movie does not leave you quiet for long, as it is filled with laughter. If you are expecting something completely different from the original "vacation" then you might be disappointed. Although the humor is modern, the story line is very similar. All in all, this comedy is sure to deliver laughs, especially to the younger adult generation. I give this movie an A for being hilarious but could have used less profanity.</fullReview>

Ed Helms is not Chevy Chase and won't be ever. Charlie Day was funnier, even in a single scene. He's not the man for the part, but it shows that Ed Helms cannot support a movie on his own. I feel that the cast around him was also not up to the task. The script was OK, but there were moments when you felt that more laughs would get out of them (like in the explosion scene), but they didn't. That's sad for a comedy. You may watch it but it's nothing special. Humour is vulgar and disgusting at some parts, which was not by kind of poison. So, overall, it's better to see the old one than the new. A good, decent effort but nothing more than that. A better casting was in order...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vacation is a sequel/reboot to the 1980's Vacation movies that starred Chevy Chase and is about the new generation of the Griswold family going on a vacation. The plot is simple and is basically just about the Griswold family going on a road trip to Walley World and as you'd expect they run into a few unfortunate scenarios that cause them problems along the way.The main characters were okay although not exactly memorable but there were plenty of cameo appearances from some great actors/comedians which I enjoyed. Surprisingly there were a few funny scenes in this movie but the humour relied on it's stupidity rather than intelligence and while it worked in parts for me, not everyone will like it. There were also a lot of jokes that just fell completely flat.Vacation is neither brilliant nor terrible, but is exactly what you would expect - a road trip movie about a family who run into trouble along the way making for some mildly funny moments. Check it out if you're looking to kill some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Vacation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacation (2015): Dir: Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley / Cast: Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo, Steele Stebbins, Chris Hemsworth: While most reboots are just horrible remakes under a different name, the latest in the Vacation franchise actually works because it goes to a new generation. It stars Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold, the son of the couple played by Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo in the previous four films. He desires to take his family to Wally World after reflecting on the adventures of the original film. While the premise is a rehash, structure features many hilarious and sometimes crude moments as their vacation hits one disaster after another. The climax lacks the payoff and feels like a scene was cut when they finally arrive in Wally World. Helms is well cast as Rusty who falls victim to one mishap after another until his rental car is blown up by nothing more than a button on the remote control. Christina Applegate plays Rusty's wife Debbie whose first mistake is appearing at her former sorority house where she ends up in a drunken obstacle course. Skyler Gisondo plays their oldest son who desires to be a musician but he is constantly bullied by his younger brother, played by Steele Stebbins. There are numerous cameo appearances including Chase and D'Angelo as Clark and Ellen Griswold who apparently operate a bed and breakfast now. Chris Hemsworth steals scenes as Rusty's sister's husband who herds cattle and struts his manhood in front of Debbie. While this is hardly the best in the franchise it is still a vacation worth taking well into a new generation. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious but predictable vacation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacation tells the story of the Griswolds &amp; is a semi-reboot/sequel to National Lampoon's Vacation(1983). Rusty Griswold(Ed Helms) wants to take his wife Debbie Griswold(Christina Applegate) &amp; two sons, James Griswold(Skyler Gisondo) &amp; Kevin Griswold(Steele Stebbins) to Walley World. Walley World is an amusement park that Rusty visited when he was a kid with his dad Clark Griswold(Chevy Chase), mom Ellen Griswold(Beverly D'Angelo) &amp; sister Audrey Crandall(Leslie Mann). The previous trip to Walley World takes place in the 1983 original. Rusty thinks that this trip will help him spend some quality time with his wife &amp; bond with his sons. However, things don't really go according to plan. With one disaster after the other, the Griswolds' road trip to Walley World turns into a hellish nightmare. Vacation is a hysterical film! The comedic set pieces in the movie are so insane that it will leave the audience chuckling uncontrollably. The highlight of the movie is its cinematography. The west coast of the US has been captured beautifully. You get to see captivating locations like San Francisco, the Grand Canyon &amp; Santa Monica to name a few. The only flaw of this movie is that, it feels like any other funny adult comedy. It doesn't do anything new to redefine the genre of adult comedies. The road trip going awry concept has been done to death in this particular genre. I'm not complaining though. I just would have loved this film more if, it was as unique &amp; non-stop hilarious as, for example, This Is the End(2013), We're the Millers(2013), The Hangover Trilogy(2009-2013) or the Horrible Bosses movies(2011-2014). Despite many bumps along the way, you just know how this holiday is going to end. I can't compare it to the original Vacation films, since I haven't watched them. This movie wouldn't have been half as funny without these talented thespians who have mastered the art of making people laugh. Ed Helms is brilliant as Rusty Griswold. Helms brings a genuine sincerity to his role, that makes the audience sympathize with his character when he wants us to. Christina Applegate is awesome as Debbie Griswold. Skyler Gisondo is great as James Griswold. Steele Stebbins is impressive as Kevin Griswold. Both Gisondo &amp; Stebbins play the parts of the dorky older brother &amp; the obnoxious younger brother, to perfection. Chris Hemsworth is scene stealing as Stone Crandall. Hemsworth will make you guffaw like a maniac by his antics on screen. Be it his Southern accent, his various talents &amp; 'assets', it's Thor like you've never seen him before. Vacation would have been much, much more funny if Chris Hemsworth's Stone Crandall had a meatier role. Leslie Mann is good as Audrey Crandall. Chevy Chase &amp; Beverly D'Angelo are superb in their cameos as Clark Griswold &amp; Ellen Griswold respectively. Charlie Day is fantastic as Chad. Catherine Missal is effective as Adena. Ron Livingston &amp; Norman Reedus are amazing in their small yet, significant roles as Ethan &amp; Trucker respectively. Michael Pena makes a welcome appearance as New Mexico Cop. The rest of the cast are perfect in their roles too. Vacation is a must watch for fans of adult comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is one word with which I can describe the new Vacation reboot, that word is: harmless. It isn't by any stretch of the imagination a good or intelligent comedy overall, but it is also light hearted and funny enough not to be anything to get angry with and even something from which to enjoy more than a couple of moments.The film does fall into ultra generic territory a little to often and has a dramatic story that simply falls flat, yet despite these problems that stretch throughout it stops in a few parts and has these very cool moments both comedic and dramatic. It is definitely uneven as is Ed Helms' performance which stretches from terrible to perfect comedic timing and everything in between, but when does moments hit they hit really good and deliver the laughs that too often miss from the rest of the film.Chris Hemsworth is absolutely brilliant (as always) and plays the part of the douche perfectly. Plus he probably has the funniest moment and gag in the whole film. Unfortunately that can't be said for the rest of the cast. Some have sparkles of good material, but for the majority they repeatedly miss the mark. That might be due to a script that is sorely missing interesting and brilliant comedy and too often falls for dull gags that don't carry throughout. Moreover the direction is too generic and doesn't use visual to the advantage of comedy enough."Vacation" isn't anything to get excited about nor something to weep about. I just feel so average about it and I know I will forget the majority of it in a very short time even though some moments will stick out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard, Sexualised, Excessive Swearing and Misses the Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the originals, I just wanted to briefly air my thoughts on this film. We've had remakes, re-imaginings and reboots and now Vacation (2015) joins the growing number of, what I will call, re-sequels. Like The Thing (2011), Vacation is a purported sequel to the original films but is, in essence, a remake.This film isn't horrendous, but it is standard. There's nothing special about it. In my opinion, Skyler Gisondo, who plays James, the eldest son, steals the show. His likable and laughable, doesn't try too hard and isn't some young Zac Effron, and that really helps his character and the film as a whole. Ed Helms is Ed Helms, exactly 30 minutes in, he's singing again, rit dit dit di doo!, and again at the 45 minutes mark. I have yet to see an appearance by Helms where he doesn't feel the need to sing.I'm not going to outline the plot because that's pointless. There are quite a few chuckle moments but everything is over sexualised and there is an excessive amounts of the word f--k, mostly by the 12(?) year old younger child. I'm no prude, but it was overdone and really not a requirement.The comedic elements also come from too many characters. The originals worked based on the naivety, and subsequent results of, Chevy Chase's Clarke Griswold as he went about a normal world carrying his abnormal and positively charming ideologies. In Vacation (2015) every character is a comedian, every character has some kind "zaney" scene whether it's a rafting instructor or a passing trucker. This takes the focus away from the Griswolds and turns the film into more of a sketch show than a story about family unity.I didn't hate it, but it was run of the mill and felt forced with an over reliance on sexuality and profanity. You'd be better off watching something like We're The Millers (2013) which is funny, natural and, above all, keeps it's focus on the story of family unity.</fullReview>

From the initial scene about the Albanian car, and it's supposed special feature on its doors already got me laughing very hard. More hilarity ensues at a very rapid rate, and I laughed so hard throughout the film. I was not expecting a touching ending, but the scene in the desert made me tear up.

The trailer got my attention &amp; then when other teasers followed I have since wanted to see this film!It was a pretty good film to say the least! Had some really great if not outrageous moments in it! Every upcoming scene put you on edge for what was going to happen next to the family! The scene with them swimming in raw sewage was just one of the most messed up things I've seen in ages, but it was good despite the unrealisticness of it! Other scenes like with the suicidal rafter instructor or the wally world scene with the Ninja Roller-coaster were pretty awesome!The song used in the opening credits was pretty catchy &amp; made the film I'd say! Along with some funny puns here &amp; there the film was over all decent &amp; well made in my opinion!I would give this film a 8/10! It was an enjoyable film to watch, don't listen to those rotten apple haters! Go see it yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 minutes into this movie and I had to shut it off.WHY? Seriously, Why would anyone continue watching this movie after the first 10 minutes? I get it that the character of Clark Griswold became more and more of a cartoon as the sequels progressed, but you never questioned his motives, intentions, and character. Rusty's character is just a cartoon. Ed Helms is not funny... period. I don't know if it is the writing, his acting, the direction, the production, or all the above, but this movie comes off as though the Naked Gun was attempting to be a drama. There is no chemistry between him and the other characters. It may be that they are attempting to show him as a distant father who doesn't understand his kids. That's fine, but give him some reasonable interaction with his wife to show that they are actually in a relationship rather than cardboard cutouts. By the dinner scene, I thought things would get better until the "perfect" cardboard family prompted a terribly executed joke about the awkward relationship between Rusty and his teenage son.10 minutes into this movie and I'm done giving it a fair shake. I'd rather watch Happy Madison Production of a Rob Schneider film before I watch any more of this movie. Don't waste your money or time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You better stay at home than going on this vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this was positively awful. Of course, the current trend of making a comedy as raunchy as possible by cramming it full of dirty jokes involving excrement and unusual sexual positions has been going for quite a while now, so you can hardly blame this Vacation for that. It's not like the original movie refrained from such shenanigans. But the level of said gags is just abominably low here, making it painfully unfunny for the most part. Too bad, because I know the lead Ed Helms, of Hangover fame, is capable of funnier routines. But even he is hopelessly lost somewhere between the rim jobs and Chris Hemsworth's erection. You got a bad thing going when the holiday car is funnier that the characters driving it. But at least the car doesn't make poop jokes galore. This vehicle of Albanian make is just loaded with silly gadgets and awkward options. Not all of them a guarantee for success, but at least I chuckled over the navigation system's sultry female American voice accidentally being replaced by a seemingly outraged Korean counterpart. If translated however, it would no doubt be revealed to get in line with the rest of the ample obscenities the script contains.As with most remakes these days, this one wouldn't have been missed if it wasn't produced at all. However, recycling the original film's plot and adding Horrible Bosses or We're the Millers type jokes to it likely saved the studio a few bucks. The story is mostly the same as its predecessor's, while some of the situations are even lifted verbatim from some of the other Vacation movies from the Eighties. It's not like this is that well known a franchise these days, so who would know, right? But if you acknowledge the status of this film as a remake by making jokes about that very fact in the actual film, you sure run the risk of people checking out the previous installments and finding out just how lazy the writing is this time around. Even such references to the original are hardly an inspired move. Remember 21 Jump Street addressing its status as a reboot by literally saying nobody at the top has any better ideas than just regurgitating old notions ad nauseam? It's a funny line, until you understand just how poignantly true it is. We don't need to hear the same argument here to hammer the point home. The movie is unhilarious enough without reminding us a better film with the same name and the same plot was produced thirty years ago. Or that we're likely to see another movie with said name and plot in a few more decades. The kids in this feature definitely appear stupid enough to make the same mistakes all over when they grow up.Luckily, this Vacation will be swiftly forgotten. It'll prove a lot harder to get that obnoxiously catchy song Holiday Road out of our heads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The four predecessors are definitely some of my all time favourite comedy films and franchises, so a sequel made me very excited. While is not a sequel with the original cast for obvious reasons, it's a sequel, and one that tries to have the same appeal of the original, does it succeed?Well i have to say yes, it's a very funny film, not on the same level of the original or some more poignant films like this, but the cast is amazing, they are the biggest stars in this film because they could make everything seem funny with awesome performances.The script is very constant and solid, there's tons of comic scenes, from beginning to end, unlike many comedies, you laugh all the time, and the story while not fresh at all, feels fresh because the actors give it a new feel. There's tons of secondary characters to back the main ones, and they all shine, but the prize has to go to Chris Hemsworth for delivering one of the best characters and scenes of the film, but Charlie Day doesn't stay far behind with hilarious work. Each scene no matter how over-the-top it's hilarious, and is unforgettable, thats what makes this film so good, it just stays with you because you will later remember how funny that scene was. Then there's the original cast appearance and is very nostalgic, if a sequel was possible, it would be so funny to see a vacation with parents and the grown up kids all together in an epic film. But audiences didn't support this one, so thats all but a dream. Overall this is a great film, not the kind of special work of art, but one that while being simple achieves its purpose, to entertain, to deliver great comedy, and i reward this film for making me laugh all the time and giving an one hour and half of pure entertainment.</fullReview>

But one thing I will say is Rusty Griswald is just as clueless as his father, so the Apple hasn't fallen far from the tree!If this is what a reboot is like of a classic comedy, then I am really truly afraid for the upcoming reboot of a certain busting spooks movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vacation (2015) * 1/2 (out of 4) Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms), realizing that his wife (Christina Applegate) and children (Skyler Gisondo, Steele Stebbins) are tired of their annual trip to a cabin, decides to re- live one of his childhood memories, which was his trip to Walley World. Rusty decides to throw everyone in the car and head out but soon it's one disaster after another.The trailer showed off one key scene in the kitchen where the cast winkling talks about whether this is a sequel or a remake. The trailer jokes about who can remember the original but I think a lot of people can and it's clear that a lot of people aren't overly fond with this latest entry. VACATION works as the fifth film in the series as well as a new start but there's no question that it's the worst of the five and that's really too bad. I was hoping the series could have gotten a jump start but this thing here is more like a death nail.What's the problem? Well, we can start at the screenplay, which is just pretty much a road trip movie with a few winks at the original film. The issue is that the screenplay is so generic and pathetic that it doesn't try to do anything other than gross out jokes. I'm all for a great gross out joke but the ones here are just downright stupid and more than often just annoying. This includes the younger son who is constantly picking on the older brother and saying all sorts of nasty things. Sorry, kids cussing for laughs was done and over with in the 90s. Another problem is that there's no heart to be found here. What made the original series so good is that it had heart as well as characters you can like. The characters here are all rather ugly, stupid and obnoxious.Yet another problem is Ed Helms. He's a fine actor and a funny one but he's just playing the same Ed Helms character that we've seen in all of his movies since THE HANGOVER. He's supposed to be playing a character in a series here but that never happens. Applegate is wasted in her role and the two kids are fine but suffer from just being downright obnoxious. Chris Hemsworth steals the film as a cowboy but Leslie Mann is wasted in her brief role as Audrey. Then we get Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo back playing their characters and what a rip. D'Angelo does nothing and Chase gets a few lines but nothing more.I'm not going to lie, VACATION does have several laughs that work. In fact, I'd say I laughed quite a bit but at the end of the film you're still left with many jokes that didn't work and it seems that the screenwriters weren't even trying to make them work.Instead of delivering something intelligent they just tried to do as many gross out jokes as they could. It's really too bad that this film didn't work better.</fullReview>

The worst part is the attempt of acting and the really bad jokes. The lead guy look like a poor mans Ben stiller. Strange part is, I think Ben stiller could have managed to raise the humor bar a notch or two. And I don't even like Ben stiller. The script is really really Bad. they've just basically tried to copy the first vacation movie. Minus all the fun jokes and the talent.And added bits here and there. It seem to also be missing bits and pieces from the story line. Which again,make it fail build the character,like it's suppose to This time it's Clark's grown son,who's gonna go through hell, and take his family on a cross country vacation to wally world. Only this time is mostly unfunny. There is few times you snicker a bit,but that's about it. There's nothing there to make you burst out laughing.You mostly cringe. They should have let the franchise stay dead. The last time The vacation series was funny,was with Christmas vacation. The only time after that, is Captain Ron with Kurt Russel and martin short. I'm pretty sure john Hughes cringes and cries in his grave right about now</fullReview>

I think producers are overdoing it and my concern is: are people really enjoying it? Come on, I have been a big fan of goofy movies, some trash and, OK some language and even people in underwear or no wear but it used to have a point. Bullying between brothers, awkward situations and some make believe dirty used to be put in a context to work and not a free for all or whatever. What happened to movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest, Airplane, Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Beverly Hills Cops? Do you really need to get that low to justify comedy? I think the world has become a funny place to be when it comes to humor then. A world where the extreme is justifiable and offensive is the new sarcasm. I think we can still crack each other up without needing to get weird. Quality is still better than quantity but I know "producers" might differ and we all know why: fast money.</fullReview>

Before I watched the movie I thought this movie would have me laughing all the way through, but all I could thing was this movie is really lame. The movie played about 5 minutes of inappropriate photos at the start of the film, such as a young boy watching two pigs mating.... At the end of the film they showed a heap of photo/snapshots of the family on their vacation, much like they did at the end of the hangover movies. The whole cinema walked out as they were playing the photos... I gave this movie a 2/10 and I don't recommend wasting your money watching it at the cinemas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LIGHT SPOILERSIn comedy the main factor is timing. You need a build up, the punchline and then an conclusion.This movie had great potential but due to sloppy writing and bad editing a lot of jokes came short and did not deliver.I watched this movie with my family. My parents and my kid, and none of us mind nudity or swearing, as long as it has some proper use. Be it comedic effect, further character building or an other god reason.In this movie, a lot of the swearing and "nudity" was completely gratuitous and at some moments even cringeworthy. For instance the kid. The movie relied too much on the "foul-mouthed little kid" cliché and while this can be funny at times, here it at many points it was out of place. The scene with the brother in-law with the big penis could have been hilarious, but I kept waiting for the punchline and it just didn't come. Same with the rafting scene. It was an okay build up but when the joke was supposed to come to its funny part, it basically went the short way and ended the scene.On the other side, this movie also had some hilarious scenes, although most of those were shown at the trailer.It could have been a great movie, as all the actors were casted correctly and it had a good story, but a lot of times the jokes felt forced and cheap. A pity.</fullReview>

And to be machine-gunned with that (also in the music) and sexual innuendo is just too much to stomach. It's bad enough that Hollyweird has run out of fresh ideas for movies but with their vain attempt to elicit laughter from people with all the shock talk and innuendo just doesn't do the Vacation franchise any justice.Having said that, there were some truly funny parts in the movie and it was cast well. But it just lacked the production creativity and innocence of the characters in the original movie and some of the sequels. And I miss Cousin Eddie, though I know it would be impossible to resurrect Randy Quaid from his exile in the Great White North. Oh well.</fullReview>

That's not to say it can work, but there better be a good reason why traveling for hours in a vehicle is better then a plane. I myself would rather fly or even take a train, but I've managed to go on certain car trips and even drive the majority of them. The misery of car travel can be emphasized by watching National Lampoon's Vacation. In 1983, John Hughes and Harold Ramis combined their comedic talents along with star Chevy Chase to create the salute and satire of taking a family on a road trip. It remains one of the funniest movies of all time because we still understand plenty problems that were addressed like traveling with an animal, meeting up with crazy relatives and dealing with the disappointment of landmarks that aren't as good as originally intended. This is one film that I always felt could have used a modern remake. Instead, we get a reboot/sequel with Vacation.Rusty Griswold (played by Ed Helms), the son from the previous four Vacation movies, now has a family of his own and is working a meek job as an airline pilot for an economy airline. His wife Debbie (played by Christina Applegate) and two boy, the older and weak James and younger and vulgar Kevin, have a dysfunctional relationship with Rusty and consider him a dweeb. This doesn't help one evening when they have neighbors over and they brag about their trip to Paris while Rusty boasts about the annual family cabin trip. It's clear that Rusty is the only one excited for it as the rest of the family has become board of the trip.When Rusty realizes that the family would rather do something different for the summer, he decides to recreate the cross country road trip to Wally World that he made back in 1983 from the first movie. He secures another ugly vehicle (the Tartan Prancer, the Honda of Albania) and embarks on many sites that lead from a suicidal rafting guide (played by Charlie Day) to a crazy truck driver stalking the family. They even meet up with his sister Audrey (played by Leslie Mann) and her husband Stone (played by Chris Hemsworth) and even his parents Clark and Ellen (played by Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo).What the new Vacation misses about the original movie was that there needs to be a family- like sweetness that makes the trip worthwhile. I saw none of that as the movie's scenes seem to play out in one gross out scene, then dialogue, then another gross out scene and so on until the ending. The original may have had some gross out gags as well, but they were not the majority. The other problem was that Chevy Chase and his family were fun to follow for four movies. This family is the kind you move away from. Ed Helms is trying his hardest to be Chevy Chase but that wasn't what Rusty was like. Christina Applegate and the two boys aren't that interesting either; they are just bland family stereotypes. The best parts of the movie are the cameos, and there are a lot of them. I would rather stay with Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo to see how their bed and breakfast is going. At least their generally funny as apposed to the forced gross humor the movie keeps pushing on us. I'll give this three empty gas tanks out of ten. Vacation is no holiday road and may want to stay home next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Worth Seeing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This vacation will stand on it's own", Rusty proudly proclaims at the beginning of the film. Well, he's right about that. Vacation stands far away from the original Vacation, and far away from any comedy out this summer. When an update is made on such a classic comedy, you're already making a gamble with your money at the box-office. 99% of the time, it's a bad, bad idea to see something like this. Vacation 2015, thankfully is no Pink Panther 2006.. and thank God, it's no Arthur 2011. But it's something alright. The makers of Horrible Bosses have taken a stab at the Harold Ramis/John Hughes slapstick epic, and seemed to have ran it through the Rhode Island School of Comedy, of which The Farrelly brothers and Seth MacFarlane are alumnus of. What do I mean by the Rhode Island School of Comedy? It's the golden rule to do everything you can to shock, gross-out and offend the audience. Vacation covers all the bases, and hangs from all the gallows. Poop, urine, gallons of vomit, animal cruelty, racism, homophobia, pedophilia, murder, suicide, hairs from the netherlands, boners, booze and mockery of the disabled. Gee, I don't remember the original Vacation being this dark. But what's the most important factor? Laughing, of course. The good news is, you'll laugh. Like the best of Farrelly Bros. and MacFarlane, you'll laugh the hardest when you really want to gasp and gag. You'll leave the theater happy, and immediately take a shower afterwords. As far as how it compares to it's source material, I think fans of the original will find many reasons to rip apart this remake, and I respect that. I mean, the day they make a lazy reboot of Big Lebowski, is the day I cry foul at Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wall-to-wall "adult" comedy, featuring liberal use of foul language (mainly by the kids, of course), sexual references, and filth. And Dad is a moron, of course. He decides to take the family on a trip to Walley World, like when he was a kid, instead of their usual summer-at-the-cabin getaway. Along the way, they discover Mom was a tramp at college. A visit to Mom's sister and her husband brings on a series of graphic sexual jokes and a sight-gag or two There are some talented actors in this flick who could have done something with a script, if only somebody had prepared one. The car has the best punch lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dirtier and Raunchier Vacation for the Next Generation of Griswolds!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 18 years, the Griswolds are finally back in action. This is definitely a 'passing of the torch' sequel, not a remake. I've always had a soft spot for the Vacation movies. I grew up with them and saw Vegas Vacation in the theater when I was 7. I was super psyched when this sequel was announced. I just wish Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo had more screen time. They only appear for about five minutes toward the end of the film. There are plenty of references and throw backs to the previous Vacation movies. While European, Christmas and Vegas Vacation were more family friendly and light hearted, this one goes back to the roots of the original with a very hard 'R' rating with lots of cussing, dark humor, dirty sex jokes and crude humor, which I enjoy. Audrey's character felt out of place. Leslie Mann probably wasn't a good choice for her. She was nothing like Audrey from the other movies. She was there just for the sake of having her character in it, much like Chevy and Beverly Ed Helms did fairly good as portraying Rusty Griswold. 18 years after Vegas Vacation, Rusty Griswold is now grown up with a family of his own. His wife is Debbie, played by Christina Applegate. His sons are Kevin and James. Kevin is the mean spirited little brat that cusses like a sailor, and James is more laid back and plays guitar. Rusty soon realizes that his family is tired of going to the same cabin every year for their annual vacation, so Rusty decides to mix things up and take them on a trip to Walley World, the fun park from the original classic film. 30 years later, and everything still goes hilariously wrong. This 5th Vacation may not have the same tone as the previous movies, but in the end, it has the same spirit. I highly recommend you take the Holiday Road to see VACATION!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie...Very Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. I laughed out loud many times. Ed Helm is great in this movie. The Griswold family hire a car to go on Vacation to Wally World theme park. They are driving along the highway in their high tech car and one of the features it has is a CB radio and they talk to a truck driver, The youngest boy asks if the truck driver is a rapist and so they think the truck driver is now after them. When they are trying to get the car to go faster, there are so many buttons on the dash board and they don't know what any of them do, they press one of them and the drivers seat starts turning around, another button makes the back bumper come off then he pulls on the handbrake and rolls the car. They then find a motel to stay in for the night. On the highway the oldest boy sees a pretty girl in the car beside them and falls in love, the younger boy puts a plastic bag over the older boys head and while he's doing that the girl in the car drives away. He ends up seeing the same girl at the motel. They are out sitting beside the pool talking and the boys dad comes along a pretends he doesn't know him, he's trying to help out his son with the girl but ends up talking like a peadophile. I definitely recommend watching this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VacationThe most important thing to remember when traveling with your family is to book separate flights.Unfortunately, the foursome in this comedy is confined to the same rental car.Desperate to bond with his wife (Christina Applegate) and sons the same way his father (Chevy Chase) did with him and his sister (Leslie Mann) when they were younger, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) plans a cross- country road trip to Walley World.Along the way, the brood encounters an array of characters (Chris Hemsworth, Charlie Day) and finds themselves in a number of outrageous scenarios that test their rapport.Featuring a cruder, more malicious Griswold clan than any of its predecessors, this continuation of the hapless Chicagoans lacks the congenial spirit of the slapstick series, save for a few glimpses of irreverence from its supporting cast.Incidentally, kids still play I Spy on road trips ? except now it's online, and for money.

		<fullReview>To begin with I always loved the National Lampoon films, they were just perfect comedies, and here comes "Vacation (2015)" which is sort of an addition to the story as the next generation of Griswold's take their road trip together. Typically when I am having a really rough day is it extremely hard for me to focus on anything, let a one a movie; I watched Vacation (2015) on one of my most horrible afternoons and I could not stop laughing. The cast for Vacation is perfect, the comedy, the story... omfg it was hysterical.In the beginning I had thought that Vacation was a remake (it is not), the team that put together Vacation didn't bother trying to remake the film, they made a great new film. It is funny, it's on going, and like the National Lampoon films; it stays comically correct. Love this film, great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy. Not Funny. Not a Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rusty (Helms) needs to take his family on a vacation to Wally World as he needs to reconnect with his wife, Debbie (Applegate) and his 2-sons.The music in the very beginning is a rap song and uses foul language and the words are clear. At the end of the movie the rap song comes around again and still uses the same foul language.What we have in here are kids using f-bombs, and spouting body sexual parts trying to be funny. And it's just not kids using foul language, the adults also have a hand in this. The main problem is that Hollywood doesn't know how to do funny: site gags or dialogues and they resort to bathroom humor thinking that is what everyone wants to hear. Really?Many may think that this Vacation movie will be the same as the original VACATION movie with Chevy Chase and will be highly disappointed. As I recall the original VACATION was silly and stupid enough, but didn't have the raunchy stuff and foul language in dialogues or in the music. (How did you get roped into watching something you knew was Raunchy?) I blame it on the promos as they don't show the raunchy stuff. I took a chance. Seems I never learn, but I keep hoping.Notables: Chevy Chase, Chris HemsworthI am convinced good humor is only in a drama whereby good funny lines have the desired comedic impact. The only way to stop the kind of abuse we see in here is for the professional Reviewers to let people know exactly what is in the movie. And this will happen when pigs fly. (1/10) Violence: No. Sex; No. Nudity: Yes, very briefly when Rusty and Debbie visit a location where one can have sex laying on 4-state borders at the same time. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't beat the original vacation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I myself prefers the old vacation, even though I'm 14 and this movie would probably have 'supposed' to make me like it because it's a newer updated version. I was already shown vacation long ago, the comedy in the original was fresh and slapstick with a side of genius, Chevy chase played a great crazy dad with a loving wife and two head-butting kids which acted fairly well and those actors have done great in their lives. This movie in all honesty was crap, and a embarrassment. Given, there was a few laughs I liked, but this was all based on immaturity and guidelines that the first movie had. Not even a slight difference guys? I mean even Chevy chase and Chris Hemsworth only got about 5-10 minutes of screen time in a 1 hour 30 film. Not good guys.</fullReview>

It's incredible how someone can approve this kind of projects. Obviously it's overrated hence the 7.x it got. It was so boring and stupid that I had to stop watching this, I just couldn't continue further. Take my advice and save some time by better watching something else. They totally missed the point of the "comic" genre. After watching this, there is no doubt some studios pay to inflate the rating and reach mayor audiences to get better incomes. Had better expectations for this one, unfortunately it became one of the worst "comic" movies I decided to watch, hence the advice to avoid watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scraping the bottom of the barrel of original road-trip humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacation is the totally unnecessary reboot of 'National Lampoon's Vacation', and the last attempt to benefit off the name of a dead movie franchise. It is yet another Road- Trip Comedy as expected, but this time around it is really scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of original road-trip humour. The film follows the same formula as pretty much every other dumb road-trip film in existence and offers nothing new at all in terms of humour or entertainment. The humour for the most part is terrible, the jokes are predictable and just downright unfunny. Half of the jokes are just dick jokes and poop jokes and another 40% of the jokes are awful running jokes that constantly repeat themselves and sequences that last for like 2-3 minutes each, ugh. That final 10% (and even 10% is generous) are the very few times they got me to kinda laugh a little. But you get one 3 second laugh every 20 minutes or so, meaning that the rest of the time you better be invested in these characters otherwise you're gonna have a tough time staying awake. And the characters were bad, not all of them were completely awful the whole time, but overall, they were all bad. The two kids for example, terrible..... absolutely goddamn unbearably TERRIBLE, everything those two little shits said past the 5 minute mark made me cringe. They have these recurring 'jokes' throughout the entire film and they were maybe a little funny the first time but they drove them into the ground really fast. And the parents also had nothing interesting about them, they were just generic obliviously dumb characters used to take the film to various locations for more crappy jokes. I obviously didn't expect fully fleshed out characters but they were just completely unoriginal and had nothing good or funny to say.I have to say, one positive is that even though the jokes were terrible in all the locations they went to, the film surprisingly didn't spend too long at each stop on the way to Wally World. Something went wrong, they spent like 10 minutes in a location, blurted out a bunch of crappy jokes, and then moved on. Other road trip films do tend to stick to certain locations for like 15-20 minutes at a time and it does drag on. But to give credit where credit is due, they did handle the pace very well. I also kinda enjoyed the 10 minutes they spent with Chris Hemsworth's character. He was actually a fairly likable character and did have all of the best and funniest parts in the film. So in the end, this really is close to the bottom of the barrel of road-trip films, both in terms of humour and originality. I don't remember much from the original 'Vacation' but from what i've heard and what i remember it doesn't do the film any justice. Want a good road-trip film? Check out Dumb and Dumber or even Little Miss Sunshine, just do yourself a favour and stay away from this. - 3.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could have been so much better. Not sure why people keep pushing for these R ratings. Throwing in a bunch of swear words, animals having sex, and shots of male genitals doesn't necessarily make a movie better. I honestly thought the best scene was the Rafting Scenes and that was all clean. It takes more skill writing a scene like that then some of this other stuff.The movie would have been so much better had it been written as PG-13. The bulk of what was in this movie could have stayed, it would have just been brushed up a little. Nothing would have been lost. There was almost enough here to make a good movie without the dirty stuff.Besides that, I would have liked to see more consistency in the characterization. For example, Rusty was not the same Rusty in the previous movies. Rusty was Clark, but played by someone else. Go back to Vegas Vacation, the previous movie of the franchise Rusty was not even remotely the same character. Same goes for Audrey, it was like they just redid everyone except Clark and Helen. Audrey was more like that dirty cousin (kid of Cousin Eddie) than Audrey.Speaking of Clark and Helen, any real fan of the franchise would have liked to see more than 10 minutes of them, but to a certain extent I understand as Chevy is a different person these days. Still I would have been OK with more.From what I saw here, not sure I am interested in another Vacation movie. It would have to go in the PG-13 direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'m not the biggest comedy fan and I never liked Chevy Chase, but the new Vacation movie peaked my interested because of it's star, Ed Helms. Helms is one of the funniest men in Hollywood today and never really gets the recognition he deserves, always being a member of the pack, but he truly shines in one of his few stand alone roles. Twenty years after the original Vacation, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) wants to relive his vacation to Wally World with his own family, and as expected, nothing seems to go as planned. Helms was truly hysterical and in my opinion easily outshines Chevy's performance in the original film, but Helms isn't the only star of note in this film. 11 year old Steele Steebins almost steals the show as Kevin Griswold. From beating on his older brother to his perfectly timed one liners, this kid was absolutely hysterical, and has a bright future ahead of him. Together with Helms and a classic story this movie had me laughing so hard, there were tears in my eyes. Often times when companies decide to remake classic films, they are little more than a farce of the original, but in the case of Vacation, the remake overtake the original by leaps and bounds. Simply put this is the funniest movie I have seen in a couple of years. I thought it would be good, but it went far beyond all expectations, and is now our latest must see movie!</fullReview>

I somehow felt Ed Helms was trying to be like Ben Stiller.Then there are the kids, whose purpose are somehow only to put a little mixture to the audience and try different fun or create another empty fun.I can understand for the older people watching this movie it can cause memories from decades ago be back.

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to Vacation treating it as a standalone comedy, mainly because I had never seen any of the National Lampoon Vacation movies. Comedy, like any genre, has evolved over the years so this entry in the franchise would surely be different to the one that kickstarted it all in 1983.Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is a man who lives the simple life with his family; his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate), and children, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Every year they take the same vacation to the same cabin and Rusty thinks his family enjoy it as much as him.When he finds out that they don't enjoy it, Rusty decides to take mix things up a bit, taking them on a road trip across country to visit Walley World, the theme park his father was obsessed with taking him to in the original movie.Along the way, things don't go entirely to plan and many misadventures occur.What struck me most about Vacation was just how lazy it was as a comedy. Some people were howling with laughter while others giggled more discretely. Of course, there were moments where I laughed but those moments were all too rare. Funny moments were outweighed horribly by some painstakingly unfunny moments. You know, the moments that make you question why everyone else is laughing and leave you feeling embarrassed for the actors. Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, who also directed this comedy, simply have to do a much better job with the screenplay of the Spider-Man movie heading our way in 2017.Coming to the performances, Ed Helms is so much better than this. I loved him in the first Hangover movie but he has never really found his feet since then. Here he is reduced to cheap laughs and some of the most unsubtle comedy I've seen in a number of years.Christina Applegate doesn't fair much better in Vacation. A talented comedic actress feels utterly wasted and doesn't really get anything to do except for moan at her husband. The kids are just as bad, Stebbins in particular as Kevin, who just does the same thing the entire movie in bullying his bigger brother, James. The trouble is that not of the Griswold is likable in any way, and this is the family you are supposed to be rooting for.There are some quite funny appearances by the likes of Chris Hemsworth and Charlie Day however, their small participation cannot hide the fact that Vacation really isn't that good a comedy.Finding itself quite far behind the likes of Spy and Trainwreck in terms of quality, Vacation is one of those comedies that will be forgotten in no time at all. Watch them announce a sequel now I've said that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Vacation' is contrived junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I walked out of the movie about halfway though. I came back for the end, but I'm just giving you context. That's about 70% of the movie.I thought 'Vacation' was terrible. The characters have no depth. The dad makes no sense. And the annoying little kid in this movie is so foul mouthed you'd have to drink a full gallon of milk to relieve yourself.Let me contrast two pieces of media. South Park, on the one hand, is extremely crude, but its jokes are usually very smart and make you think a little. 'Vacation' on the other hand is crude, but full of toilet humor, dryly acted "serious moments," and ridiculous scenarios that do not even make sense in the film itself. I felt like every joke was a contrived train wreck. The producers simply said, "Oh look. Let's throw this cheap joke here! That will make the audience laugh." And it did, but the jokes were so stupid and humiliating, I couldn't stand to be in the room.Don't get me wrong, 'Vacation' is very funny for some people. It is quite hilarious to see a family that doesn't get along with each other trying to get to a place where they don't want to go. You'll be sure to laugh a lot. The movie is fun enough. However, you must be ready for unnecessary cursing. Not for kids. On the other hand, if you are looking for an intelligent comedy or a satire that is meaningful...then you have definitely stumbled upon the wrong movie. The jokes are not meant to be intelligent. They are meant to get laughs. Would make for a good date night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie needs some roadside assistance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting off: I've had a couple friends tell me "well, compared to the original..." or "in the first one they...". I am a fan of the movie "National Lampoon's: Vacation", but I don't think it is fair to compare this new movie to the other. This movie is set for a new generation, with different writing, directing, and humor elements, and I will not be comparing it to the original.That being said: I've been waiting all summer for this movie, and seeing this movie opening night, I was pretty disappointed. The cast is pretty well put together. Ed Helms plays the roll of Rusty very well, bringing out his inner dad and husband, trying to spend bonding time with his children and spice things up with his wife. Christina Applegate does a good job as Debbie, and Chevy Chase brings a familiar face to the movie that people will enjoy. Character development wise, you grow to root for the family as they try to make their way to Walley World. However, there are some scenarios and side stories that you wish the writers would have summed up at the end of the film.The problem is with the humor of the movie. Very provocative, and adult rated. There's nothing wrong with that type of humor, but there needs to be some balance. Just dishing out F-bombs when a random encounter happens is not humorous. Also, there's hardly any build up with the humor. While watching, I felt like the joke had no journey to the punch line, and then once the first punch line was out, it was a constant bombardment of more punchlines that just dragged the joke out and killed it. All of the humorous scenes can be viewed in the multitude of trailers. The premise is good, especially since it's a relatable story (everyone's had a crazy vacation). And fans of the original are probably extremely excited to take their (older) children to see what they enjoyed years ago. The half morbid and offset, vulgar jokes, however, leave a bad aftertaste in your mouth, wishing the writers would have taken just a little more time with the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely awful. This movie is not only the furthest thing from funny, but is also completely disrespectful to the original. I want my time and money back. I know there is a minimum if ten lines to for a review, but I can't think of much more to say other than it's complete crap. I wouldn't of watched it if someone had PAID ME if I knew how bad it is. I don't understand how this is rated at 6+ on here. One would think that more effort would be put into a movie based on such a classic like the original National Lampoons Vacation. So... If you've seen the original, you will only be left in disgust IF you even make it through the whole thing without turning it off. f you do watch it, don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adult comedy that will only appeal to prepubescent teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just this week, I was reviewing Peter Bogdanovich's latest film "She's Funny That Way" and remarked how it was a rare adult comedy that would actually appeal to adults. Its manic sensibilities and frequently incorrigible characters didn't derail it from being a spirited film, but it did prevent it from being one that got caught up in such empty, dirty-minded antics that it forgot about the characters. Now here comes "Vacation," another sequel (I guess) to the long-running "National Lampoon's Vacation" franchise, which started all the way back in 1983 with future installments coming in the form of more theatrical films, direct-to-DVD projects, and even an extended Super Bowl commercial a few years back. "Vacation" is a film that, paradoxically, bears a hard R-rating, despite the fact that most of the film's jokes will appeal to those who cannot get into the film at the local multiplex without a parent or adult guardian (both parties would be far more enriched seeing something, perhaps anything, else playing in the theaters at this time)."Vacation" is the epitome of a lazy film, reminiscent of a sequel like "The Hangover: Part II" or even "Meet the Fockers," where the plot is a tireless retread of jokes that worked in the first film because they were fresh, but seeing them now, they are overdone and underwritten. Now, however, the stakes are higher and raunchiness is injected into the film's premise. The original "Vacation" film, while carrying an R-rating, still basked in the light of relatively jolly, upbeat humor and was a quietly crass take on the conventional family road trip. This film is a soulless project, so predictable and worn that it'd be a more pleasant endeavor trying to start and drive the Griswold's Wagon Queen Family Truckster from the original film.We focus on Rusty (Ed Helms), the son of Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo), who is now living with his loving wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two sons, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Rusty, who works as a pilot for an economy airline, notices a disturbing disintegration of his family, with his wife tiring of their love-making and her hatred for their yearly vacation to Sheboygan and the constant bickering of his two boys. In a spur-of-the-moment decision, Rusty decides to take his family to the fabled Wally World, the theme park where his parents took him and his sister when they were young.The Griswold's hit the road and, to everyone's surprise, a number of crazy circumstances come their way. For starters, they get a 2015 Tartan Prancer, "the Honda of Albania," so claims Rusty, with numerous buttons, two gas tanks, and an outlet to charge at any gas station. The comedic possibilities are already bubbling. Furthermore, the Griswold's decide to stop at a hot springs and take a roundabout way into the pool that results in them getting in a pool of raw sewage. This forces the gang to show up to Rusty's sister Audrey's (Leslie Mann) home, where she is married to a meathead (Chris Hemsworth) who loves to show off his six pack and his well-endowed package. Ho ho.The stench of desperation in the writing/directing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein's comic possibilities makes "Vacation" seem a lot longer than it really is, almost like a real-life family vacation for the viewer. The situations almost always lead to the foreseeable outcome, the jokes rely heavily on vulgarities, making them witless and unconvincing, and the characters carry a blandness despite bearing the name that's synonymous with family road trips, even in the modern day.Some of the most fun material of the film stems from the constant bickering between James and Kevin, with Kevin, the younger brother, constantly harassing James, calling him out when he's trying to talk to a girl and even going as far as to try and have him black out by suffocating him with a plastic bag. This darkly funny absurdity livens up the predictability of the film, but not in a way that can save the sorely lacking chemistry in the film (especially after Kevin ups the courage to defend himself in the face of James, resulting in an entirely laughless and downright bizarre scene)."Vacation"'s problem is its level of vulgarity and its comic setups seem to be ostensibly crafted from what a prepubescent teenager finds funny. While we have sporadic humor from the two kids, and Ed Helms is probably the only person who can play Rusty Griswold with such incorruptible positivity in the face of catastrophe, this doesn't disguise what "Vacation" is at heart - a poor cash-in on a franchise that takes a raunchy direction in the most contrived and facile way imaginable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vacation was a seriously hilarious movie for you comedy lovers out there and has made my top 5 comedies of all time. I'm pretty shocked at some of the poor reviews it has received from ignorant parents. First of all it's rated R, so that should generally tell you that it's not kid friendly. If you do take a mature child to see this movie, I assure you they will hear more offensive things at school every single day of their lives than in this movie, and I live in UTAH! Make no mistake, Vacation is raunchy. But it's hilarious from start to finish and the racy content just adds to the laughs. The film did a fantastic job of continuing the Vacation movies by bringing them up-to-date with modern humor and a great new cast. I truly look forward to any and all additional movies this group decides to put out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing that is going for Vacation is that it follows the rest of the National Lampoons Griswold series on the same old contrived adventures that never pan out. However, Vacation also takes on the trend of the series; progressively getting worse, more unfunny, tiresome and plain boring. The humor in this film is so over used, making it so dull and tasteless, that even within the first five minutes of this film you begin to query if this will get any better; it doesn't. If you've seen the Chevy Chase classics, then this will offer you nothing new. Vacation practically regurgitates what we have seen, into a more crude and pointless sequel that proves to be nothing short of disgusting and aggravating.</fullReview>

And kids talking about the F-thing all the time. Come on, Ed Helms! You can do better in selecting scripts... It's funny to see how blind people are to these problems in sick Hollywood flicks.

The plastic bag over the head is a recurring event. James Griswold's attempt at romance is sweetly innocent with the exception that his father, Rusty's, misinterpretation of a sexual term puts him in an awkward and embarrassing position. Rusty and his wife Debbie's efforts to rekindle the romance in their marriage are also innocent and humorous for the most part. A few funny parts, some nostalgic for the original Chevy Chase Vacation. Too bad Audrey and Rusty were able to bicker in the original Vacation without either of them coming across as vile as they made Kevin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen the many trailers you have seen most of the jokes. Some jokes work if you are into crude gross humor. There are a couple of shock crash scenes that somehow get a laugh. There's a cannibal reference to "Suddenly Last Summer" that will be missed by 99.9% of the audience.The problem with the movie is it doesn't touch the not so high bar set by the original "National Lampoon's Vacation". The original Griswold family had a softer more likable side. Here the message is, resolve problems with a good punch.This is a written and directed by writers that can't write female characters. Debbie is written like a fraternity guy. Leslie Mann is given nothing to say. Beverly D' Angelo could have been a mime. There are some laughs but way to few. It looks good on the wide screen and it is in focus. Some of the music works while some is just foul. The pictures during the end credits are actually better then the movie. Don't spend the money to see this in a theater, it will play well on less expensive platforms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever running jokes and overarching themes entirely elude this part-sequel, part-remake, 100% unnecessary reboot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the original "Vacation" (1983) may not have been the quintessential family comedy, the 2015 sequel aspires to be the polar opposite. Immediately embracing raunchy R-rated humor, the gags arrive swiftly and abrasively. And though some of the concepts are creative and evoke genuine laughs, the vast majority of the circumstances contrast caustically with the family unit. Patriarch Rusty Griswold endangers his wife and kids on numerous occasions with little regard or remorse, while mother Debbie indifferently engages in all manner of indecencies in plain view of her children. Even youngest boy Kevin barks obscenities for all to hear when he's not physically and verbally abusing his mild-mannered older brother.This newest generation of Griswolds has deteriorated into a monstrously dysfunctional household that bulldozes through scatterbrained activities with increasing detestableness. But it's all just buffoonish jokes perpetrated by caricatured protagonists - and not purely revolting atrocities inappropriately carried out by contemptible people moving through an itinerary of abhorrent filth. Right?Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) realizes his loved ones need a dose of adrenaline-pumping excitement to revitalize enthusiasm in their annual vacation. Forgoing their typical excursion to a dreary cabin in the woods, Rusty determines to drive his family across the country to renowned theme park "Walley World" ? of which he has fond memories with his father Clark (Chevy Chase). Initially reluctant, Rusty's wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two sons James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins) soon get on board with the idea to embark on the adventure of a lifetime. But it's not long before everything that can go wrong does, forcing the Griswolds to contend with angry truckers, a goading sorority, an incessantly malfunctioning conveyance, and plenty more.It begins with a skit on a plane, involving an inept pilot and the potential for some greatly offensive humor. Most of the following laughs are derived from situational gimmicks amplified by visually uncomfortable happenings - rather than wry conversations or comedy that will stick with audiences. Awkwardness in mundane activities, including desperate acts of fitting in, or a trod upon underdog pitted against musclebound hunks and bullying superiors, creates momentary amusement that immediately ends at the close of each scene. Clever running jokes and overarching themes entirely elude this part-sequel, part-remake, 100% unnecessary reboot.As a cross-country road movie, the film does succeed in mocking stereotypes, family dynamics, and the fictional Tartan Prancer minivan (providing an extensive amount of physical and mechanical stunts) as crazier sides of humanity (and a marriage) are exposed under duress. Brotherly bonding, risqué romancing, petty pranking, and agonizing adventure all manage to digress into worst-case scenarios, choreographed and arranged like something out of a cartoon. As expected, plenty of realism is regularly sacrificed for random, unrelated jokes.There's also no real focus on a plot, though the film does work silliness and crassness into every set, succeeding now and again with nothing more than its breakneck pacing. Over time, however, the humor gradually resorts to repetition, homages, obvious reworkings, and edgier sexual content (which is the only major element to change up the concepts enough to represent a thread of individuality). It's particularly unfortunate that an early, self-aware reference had to be made to the film's originality and ability to remain independent from National Lampoon's most famous entity, because everything following must take extra care not to appear completely derivative. In the end, this new "Vacation" does indeed stand on its own (though its intentions as a modernized rejuvenation over a standard continuation are substantial) - it's just not that good.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

Children should display a little innocence now and then.The brief scene with Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo was also disappointing.

		<shortDescription>Good Attempt - So-So Result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of reboots and remakes. It's such a hit and miss process; sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. I think it's too early to call "Vacation" a total bomb because while it fails on some levels, such as almost replicating the plot of the first movie, it does have some very funny moments. Ed Helms plays the fifth or sixth actor to bring Rusty Griswold to life. Not quite as delusional as his father, he is sort of a lovable doofus as he plans a road trip to re-bond with his family at Wally World before it closes for the last time. At least, that was the premise in the original movie draft before the movie came together. His wife is played by Christina Applegate of "Married With Children" fame, who does not look good in HD. Sadly, she's become a thin white shadow of Kelly Bundy. Their two boys are one of the best things in the movie. The older boy is a sensitive intellectual, and the younger one is a sadistic little brat trying to murder, kill or maim his older brother? or at least embarrass him publicly. Another funny part of the movie is the Albanian monstrosity that Ed rents to drive to Wally World. It's a huge ugly blue beast called a 2015 Tartan Prancer covered in numerous headlights, side mirrors and a power cord to an outlet that doesn't exist. It is also controlled by a on-board computer covered in symbols no one can figure out; a hilarious parody to all those endless new car computer enhancements which no one wants or needs in modern cars. Unfortunately, for every funny joke that works, there are a few that fall flat. For example, the movie has some weird penis fetish. The younger brother writes on his brother's guitar, "I have no penis." A giant penis is drawn on the car after its vandalized that Helms and Applegate try rubbing off, and when they visit Audrey in Texas, they're also introduced to her husband, played by Chris Hemsworth of "Thor," and his little friend from the previews. Another stop along the way is to Applegate's old sorority in Memphis where she tries to once again to channel her inner Kelly Bundy. What is supposed to be the funniest vomit joke ever is actually disgusting, offensive, disturbing and three minutes too long. The visit with Audrey is not as up to par as the visit with Cousin Eddie or the "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong" mentality in the original; it's basically a moment for Helms as Rusty to realize things are not happy at home as he thought before setting up for another tasteless joke concerning a cow being blown up by an ATV. Yes, it happens? Along the way, Ed has also his turn embarrassing his son in front of a girl, and in a return to the Grand Canyon, they meet up with a deranged Grand Canyon guide, but it's still not a sequel unless they steal one more scene from the original, namely getting lost in the desert after a mystery button to the car actually blows it to smithereens. Rescued by a phantom trucker that's been intimidating them through the movie, they finally reach San Francisco for the second to last references to the first movie, namely the cameos which every has been waiting for by Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. There's not a lot of heart to these scenes as much as one would think as much as it's getting the movie back on track by revealing the old Roadster once more which as you recall was destroyed in the first movie. I guess Clark loved it so much he bought a new one, but there's still one more joke along the way, namely the realization that all theme parks are badly staffed, their employees under trained and regular customers are often screwed over by pretentious jerks with gift cards even God can't afford. While the first movie reminded you of how horrible the car trip was, this movie certainly reminds you of the ugly truth of theme parks with endless lines and surly employees. Overall, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie. This is one of those movies I think the critics will hate but will still end up with its own loyal cult base of fans anyway. It doesn't have those memorable lines like "Getting there is half the fun. You know that." or "Real tomato ketchup, Eddie?" or "Uh, we like to send out a mailer." Uncle Stone's offensive little friend is no replacement for the metal plate in Cousin Eddie's head, but the frustration with the computer in the car is one of those nice little modern updates that make the movie worth enjoying and that in my book makes the movie worth it. It's dirtier, raunchier and more offensive when it doesn't have to be (Hard to believe parts of this movie was written by the guy who played Sweets on "Bones."), but at least it moves along at a quick pace without getting stranded on those less than stellar moments.</fullReview>

We need to be teaching young people that we do not tolerate this and decent people leave wherever this is going on and make a public rejection of the behavior.

		<shortDescription>This reboot/sequel pays homage to the original 1983 Vacation film in hilarious ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>VACATION (2015) review by Mike Smith Rusty Griswold takes his own family on a road trip to "Walley World" in order to spice things up with his wife and reconnect with his sons.I'm a big fan of the original films and seeing this next chapter in the Griswold story was laugh out loud funny. This reboot/sequel pays homage to the original 1983 National Lampoon's Vacation film in hilarious ways; the story is fun and it falls in line with the last 4 films.The cast is great, Ed Helms plays Rusty Griswold similar to the way Chevy Chase played Clark Griswold, which makes you believe he could be his son. Christina Applegate is a good counter balance to Ed Helms; Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins hold their own as the Rusty's sons but as funny as they are, I never believed they were a real family, although it didn't take away from the film. One thing I loved was all the funny and awesome cameos including Chris Hemsworth, Leslie Mann, Charlie Day, Ron Livingston, Keegan-Michael Key and my favorite cameo I don't want to give away. One awesome way to keep this film connected to the original is that they brought in Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo to reprise their roles.From start to finish this movie picks up and goes and it will keep you laughing hard the whole time. The story is a classic but updated family road trip film . . . just like the original. The only thing I'd like to have seen was a cameo from Randy Quaid.As a fan of the original films I wasn't looking forward to this one until I saw the trailer. I'm so happy they did this franchise justice. Cheers and remember life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch.9 out of 10 edited by Samantha Locke Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews twitter: @FatMikeTPK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I need a holiday after seeing this rubbish....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remembering fond, childhood memories of his trip to Walley World, Rusty Griswold surprises his wife and two sons with a cross-country trip to America's favourite fictional fun park. Following in his father's footsteps, Rusty and the gang pack up the car and hit the road for some much-needed family bonding. Soon, the promise of fun turns into one misadventure after another for the next generation of Griswolds and anyone who encounters them........Just like most films released today, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen all,the jokes that are in the film, just a lost shorter, and not dragged out within an inch of its life like in this maundering comedy.I don't know whether in the past couple of years I lost my sense of humour somewhere, but I haven't seen a comedy that's made me chuckle since The World's End, and that's been a while.It seems that with comedies now, the makers don't want to be clever, they don't want to try something that could make jokes go over a few heads, instead, they go for the perfunctory body part gags, gross out moments, and scenes that are supposed to invoke guilty titters, but instead, proceed to make your frown lines just that little more predominant.Helms once again proves that he's one of the most annoying people in Hollywood, and when the star of the film has a face you just want to slap, the film is in trouble. I was hoping for some sort of Chevy Chase type role, oblivious to his poor decisions and his family just putting up with it and shrugging their shoulders as if to say 'classic Clarke', but no, he's just a whinging little man who let's everyone walk over him.The rest of the family more than make up for Rusty's shortcomings, Applegate is easily the best thing in the film, and the chemistry between the brothers is pretty realistic.And that's the only positive thing I can find to say about the film. Hemsworth pops up for a few minutes in nothing more than a degrading role for him, Chase looks bored out of his mind, and really uncomfortable, and it all ends up with a slow motion punch up with Ron Livingstone.The original was a lot funnier, thanks to Chase and the wonderful way the nuclear family is depicted, sticking together through thick and thin. Here, it separates us from the family and goes straight for the poo gags.Poorer than Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddies Island Adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new "Vacation" lacks the heart and urgency of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the reboots and remakes being made today, a reboot of the National Lampoon's Vacation series is one that I would never expect to need a reboot. I love the original Vacation series, even the ill- received Vegas Vacation, and even though I had low expectations for the newest installment in the series, I was looking forward to a new Vacation movie. Boy was this a letdown. This time around, Rusty decides that he is going to take his family to Walley World before it closes forever, and Rusty promises that this time "will be different" than the first time he went to Walley World. They set off in their bizarre European car to the amusement park, and the usual Griswold madness ensues. While there are a couple of laughs to be found on this trip to Walley World, the new Vacation is just a raunchier and much more mean-spirited version of the original film, making for a rather awkward and sometimes even unpleasant viewing. A lot of the humor in the first movie was dramatic rather than situational. The jokes would happen while the scene played normally, rather than having scenes that only existed for the punch-line. It more closely resembles Adam Sandler's fun yet disappointing Grown Ups than any of the first Vacation movies. Probably the worst thing about this movie was that, in the first movie, Clark made it seem like Walley World was the greatest place on Earth, so there was a sense of urgency on the trip there, and it made us feel some sympathy for the Griswold's whenever something bad happened to them on the way. In this movie, the destination is never made out to be some spectacular place, which really didn't make me feel like it was that big of a deal when the Griswolds found themselves in a pool of human waste or going white water rafting with a suicidal tour guide. The new Vacation is much more of a misfire than a disaster, since it is a fun movie at times, but you won't find much to like about this movie, even if you're a die-hard fan of the other Vacation films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vizion Magazine's review of 'Vacation'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Griswald's are back! This time Rusty takes the wheel in this hilarious new chapter in the Griswald family vacations. After overhearing that his family is bored of going to their cabin in Charlevoix, Michigan, Rusty (Ed Helm) decides to take his family cross country to the theme park that started the whole vacation fiascos. Helm brilliantly brings the adult Rusty to life, as he tries to bring his family closer together by jamming them into a car for a week. To make matters worse, Rusty has rented a (very) foreign car to make the trip. Absurdly marked buttons make matters worse for the Griswolds, and funnier for the audience. From their driveway in Chicago, all the way to their destination of Walley World in California, the comedy is nonstop.Joining Helm, as his wife, Debbie Griswald, is the beautiful and talented Christina Applegate. Applegate's character of Rusty's seemingly straight laced wife proves she has some hidden secrets that are revealed in the sequence of the movie. The Griswald's sons, James and Kevin (played by Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins respectfully) are two brothers that constantly fight. But this dynamic is slightly different as Kevin-the younger brother-is always picking on James- the wimpy older brother.'Vacation' has many gags pertaining to the original movie. For instance, remember in the original movie when Clark is driving down the road and the beautiful blonde (Claudia Schiffer) is driving in the red convertible? The same gag is done with Rusty at the wheel. Some would say it is cliché and already done, but I think it is done very well, not to mention funny.In addition to the wonderfully hilarious storyline, including an appearance by the original Griswold's themselves, Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold and Bevery D'Angelo as Ellen Griswold. There are more wonderful surprises and gags throughout the movie, and you will get them if you are old enough to have seen the original movie.Due to sexual content, language, and crude humor, this movie is rated R. Even though it is hilarious, I strongly discourage parents from bringing children under the age of 16 to this movie.

		<shortDescription>best comedy I've seen in long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Almost as funny as the original. My girlfriend and I were laughing so hard it hurts. A must see..... Its very similar to the old movie where a Family goes on vacation and a lot of funny obstacles on the way to destination. the acting is really good mind you it could get silly in some scenes. Christina use to annoy me when she was younger but I didn't mind her in this movie. Ed Helms was as funny as in Hangover. I really enjoyed this movie and don't understand all the negative reviews. people should have more open mind. the kids in the movie are not known to me but they also did a good job acting. the younger brother is so funny and i couldn't stop laughing at his pranks. watch this movie you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting pedophile jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember I ever voted a movie 1, because I appreciate every creative effort anyone puts in their product, even if the outcome is not the best sometimes. But since I cannot tolerate jokes on pedophilia or raping or violent matters, I absolutely hated this movie. It was not only one or 2 jokes and references about pedophilia. The movie was FULL of it!! Sometimes you had to read between the lines, other times it was absolutely obvious. If I were a cop I would go right away and check the main creators' houses and computers for pedophile material, because I cannot imagine that a healthy, heterosexual man could ever come up with these kind a jokes. A healthy mind doesn't think about pedophile scenes and actions (or only with horror) and definitely doesn't joke about it or make it look like a natural part of life. As if it was some kind a simple, stupid, everyday stuff we can just have a good laugh at. And I absolutely liked Ed Helms... till yesterday, when I saw him giving his name and talent to this. I don't wanna indicate anything but can't help wondering why he thought this movie is something he has to stand up for.OK, I finish my complaints. There were some good jokes in the movie that lacked pedophile references and it was a professionally well-done, high-budget movie. But unfortunately, nothing can justify the message it wanted to spread subconsciously. All in all, I absolutely hated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awkward, Predictable &amp; Painful to Watch @ Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a few funny lines...but it was mostly bad jokes that lasted way too long. Very outdated slapstick humor, that you will swear you have seen a hundred times before. If it wasn't for a couple of cameos..I would have given this movie a 2. I went with my 13 year old son, we would get excited when we saw familiar faces playing small roles, but the excitement didn't last long..because those roles were so small. He was the one who insisted on seeing the movie...I didn't expect much, but was still let down. It doesn't take a psychic to predict every joke in this movie...and I do mean EVERY. Even though the jokes aren't funny to begin with, they insisted on running them into the ground...I remember thinking "enough already!!" multiple times! Chris Hemsworth is the highlight....and along with the cameos, the only saving grace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would of been funny, had there not be 20 different trailers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was beyond excited to see this movie. A huge fan of the original four, I wasn't sure it would hold up. When I saw the first trailer, I definitely laughed and became even more excited to see it... But then it happened, a different trailer came on TV with NEW scenes not shown in the first trailer. OH NO! THEY ARE GOING TO WASTE ALL THE LAUGHS IN THE PREVIEWS! I was worried that the 2 different TV spots I was seeing might have ruined 30% of the funny parts... THEN I couldn't believe it, as the release date got closer and closer- there was ANOTHER TV SPOT WITH NEW ADDITIONAL LAUGHS not shown in the prior TV spots. I am an average TV watcher and during the actual movie- I never laugh at the parts the trailer/TV spots have shown... That being said, I laughed twice during the whole movie. Whoever is responsible for editing and releasing trailers/TV spots- THANKS FOR COMPLETELY RUINING A MOVIE THAT COULD OF DEFINITELY STOOD UP TO THE ORIGINAL, had you not already given me my laughs for free. EDIT ONE, MAYBE TWO trailers and leave it!! When you have to cut it down from a 3 minute trailer to a 30 second TV spot... USE THE SAME FUNNY SCENES YOU HAVE ALREADY RUINED!!! Don't ruin more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mindless, over the top, and crude comedy. But a laughed throughout!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Griswold's in the 80s and 90s where a name each family member knew, the series of films about the Griswold family where hilarious family films, that have earned cult status since. But for the new gen x well for them they now have the new Vacation and instead of Chevy Chase we have his reel life son Ed Helms. But a very common question is then does this film live up to the old films. Well not really, the essence and nostalgia is kind of missing. And this film is far from a family film. Instead, the comedy here is mindless, over the top, a times i was saying wtf, but it works, and as standalone film Vacation works too, but its a far cry from a family film or Griswold film.The story is pretty much about Rusty Griswold and his family going on a road trip to Whalley World. The happenings on the road trip make up the story.Acting wise Ed Helms is good but sometimes his character is down right annoying to watch. Christina Applegate is good, but the two actors playing the male kids are the best of the lot. It was also nice seeing cameo appearances from a lot the A and b list celebs but especially Chevy Case .Overall Vacation can be pretty much bracketed in the mindless, ridiculous comedy section. The humour is crude, its over the top, but i wont lie i was laughing most of the run time. Meaning that i found its pretty enjoyable, but if you don't like crude humour, or your looking for a rehash of the old films you might be left disappointed.3/5* or 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like our own vacations, it has its moments of mirth amid the crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of Spy and Trainwreck this summer, the standard comedies are just not funny, until you take a vacation with the Griswold family across the country to Walley World. Yes, the son of the original Griswold is played with charm and spot-on timing by Ed Helms as Rusty. He takes the role played by his dad, Clark (Chevy Chase), and makes Rusty more loving and vulnerable with a real heroism, not just slapstick goofiness.The comedy is best called "American absurdism" as it presents outlandish setups that also bring their wisdom once the family goes through them. In fact, they deal directly with "crap," the real stuff, after which we all will be wary of strangers bearing directions, especially from Arkansas (no, not Bill Clinton but an allegorical interpretation along those lines wouldn't be too absurd).This being thoroughly American comedy, the subtext of family unity is ever present. The clichéd adolescent boy and teen brother, both bored and rebellious, morph into kids who can take the licks and actually grow from the experiences.As to the foul mouth of the young Kevin Griswold (Steele Stebbins), I have trouble with his repetition of "F" bombs?I don't think the kid in Bad Santa uttered one. The use seems to me at the very least uncomfortable, in bad taste even for an absurd production.The other subtext or secondary theme is the parents' need to grow up in their love: Rusty and Debbie Griswold (Christina Applegate) are constantly working at their marriage, not in an absurd way but as adults who don't yet get what a wholesome marriage is. Not unlike the triple corkscrew ride at Wally World, they have some potential dangers to their happiness.Because a comedy like this is mostly set pieces, I am reluctant to mention too many, like an over informative trailer. I will say the Hot Springs scatological swim will make you squirm and at the same time you'll be able to find the allegorical importance for the film immediately. The shootout at the four corners of states out West is one of the wittiest of the film, displaying hostilities among states and the never ending cycle of state independence struggles.It's not the greatest vacation, but like our own, it has its moments of fun.</fullReview>
