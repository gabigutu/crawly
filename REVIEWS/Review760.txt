		<shortDescription>Very romantic story about the president and his first lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer a few mouths back I knew I had to see it. It was just about a random women preparing to go out with a college from work, then you discover she's Michelle Robinson and her colleague is Barack Obama.It was the best first date every caught on picture. I like the fact that I feel I did not learn anything new about the President of the United States. Southside with You has taken the man I've seen for the past 8 years and put that personality on celluloid accurately to what I already know. There was no surprise coming as Barack explain to Michelle his anger towards his father, his upbringing before college, and where he wants his life to go. Brilliantly played by Parker Sawyers, Barry O is easy to parody, but Sawyers was able to really capture the man without doing that.What I also liked about the movie is what it told me about Michelle Robinson, a strong black woman also trying to find her way in life. Not satisfied with where her life is going and knowing she wants more out of it. Tika Sumpter did a good job show casing a career orientated woman focus on being more than just the black woman at her law firm and feeling a relationship with Obama would change that. Making her stand offish at first to his natural charm.It's funny. It's a tale as old as time: boy likes girl, girl's not having it, boy tricks girl into date, girl keeps saying it's not a date, and boy has to put on the charm in order to win girl's heart. However, the two people they chose to tell this tale on bring a flavor to it that's uncanny.Very quiet, but well structured. Not nearly as impactful as the two people it's about, but real good portrait of a iconic love affair.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Date Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this movie so special as well as so difficult to execute is the singular nature of the compressed timeframe in which the show encompasses. Unlike the real-time effect of the breakout television series "24" that had the advantage of being an action series, Southside with You has the difficult challenge of being an actual "date" movie about what is supposedly a "date" over a period of a single day depending on who is telling the story. Another surprising element of this movie is the personalization of two major real life people, supposedly which the American public should know a lot about, but apparently they don't. This sometimes slow, cerebral but relational and topical movie allows the audience to discover along with the actors themselves on screen personal information as they disclose fascinating tidbits for the first time. The overall experience is amazing in that audience members get to experience a personal visceral date-like emotional event that is often left out of most romantic drama films.Southside with You is filled with a sometimes stinging parley of dialogue between the leads, a subtle physical attraction, political commentary, as well as speech-making in difficult times and places. The movie portrays both human uncertainty, dating qualms, innocence, doubt, and divergent conflict and reconciliation. This movie humanizes people often portrayed in black and white as impersonal politicians. In some ways, Southside with You offers a similar presentation about first time relational meetings as A Long Way Down (2014) that focuses on an ensemble cast in a drama dealing with a singular concern about suicide over a short period of time, an action thriller with John Cusack and Malin Akerman in The Numbers Station (2013) told over two day period or even Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in the under-rated action drama Gigli (2003) that took place in a day or Audrey Hepburn's performance in the suspense thriller Wait Until Dark (1967).Perhaps an even closer fit to Southside with You might be the childhood classic Stand by Me (1986) or even Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in the award-winning lighter fare of Roman Holiday (1953) or Bill Murray's more isolated experience in Lost in Translation (2013). What is spectacular about this movie is its ability to reveal the dramatic highlights of one of the most innocent moments in two people's lives that intersect for their first real interactions on both a physical, mental, and spiritual level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forgettable Fluff Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The benefit of making a biographical film about a long deceased statesman or woman is we can lionize them at will without having the propensity of sounding political. Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), Wilson (1944), John Adams (2008) all concerned themselves with figures that were long-gone and if controversy was to be had it was a low murmur at best. On the opposite side of the spectrum there are the maladroit political screeds. Your Iron Lady's (2011) and Primary Color's (1998); movies which are to varying degrees satirical admonishments and ad hominum attacks.Southside with You covers a third category which is exceedingly rare, especially in today's culture of "kill your Gods". The film takes place over a day in the life of a young Michelle Robinson (Sumpter) and a young Barack Obama (Sawyers) as they go on a first date. During their courtship they take in a community organizing event, an art exhibit, multiple walks through the park and a movie. While doing so they get to know about each other and plow through their insecurities, their family lives and their plans for the future. That's basically it; our first film fictionalization of President Barack Obama is not some big epic nor a under-the-radar satire. No, this film is basically Before Sunrise (1995) without the sexual tension.As our two leads, Tika Sumpter and Parker Sawyers are dead-ringers to the current occupants of the White House; down to their mannerisms, speech patterns and general way about them. As actors they are both reliably charming, have great chemistry together and evoke sympathy with very little coaxing. I genuinely felt compassion for these characters and the layers of social and emotional pressures they face.Which is just as well because the script is about as heavy-handed and clunky as a Sunday school sermon. Within the first five minutes we know that we're going to spend our time with interesting people because their resumes were pretty much announced like they were on a dating show. Here's Michelle Robinson who matriculated from Princeton before getting her Junior Doctorates from Harvard Law. Her brother is a basketball coach at Brown and her dad has MS. Young Barack is a young summer associate who is going to Harvard Law and was born in Hawaii. He briefly worked as a Gardens community organizer while going to Columbia and for a young man he's surprisingly well traveled. He likes pie and hates ice cream.As they get to know each other, the poorly concealed wounds of an absent father and a bi-racial upbringing keep the drama alive though for the most part writer/director Richard Tanne goes through great pains to make Obama look like the patron Saint of Chicago's southside. Granted even terrible people put their best foot forward when on a first date but man this guy lays it on thick. Every time Michelle meets one of his friends they keep nudging her and saying "he's a keeper". She replies "We're not dating," because of course she would. Cue the heartfelt speech about working together and not judging people before you get to know them; and kiss in three, two...Now apparently a lot of the events of the film are true to life. Barack Obama was a summer associate at the law firm Michelle was working at and Michelle did initially refuse to go on a date with him. They did in-fact see Do the Right Thing (1989) and did in-fact go get Baskin Robbins afterward. Yet if these two characters were purely fictional, chances are you'd be bored out of your mind watching this movie. If ever there was an example of a true story that isn't interesting enough to be a movie, this is clearly it; especially given the "will they or won't they" tension that actually makes movies like these bearable is absent.Southside with You is an innocent, easily digestible and easily forgettable puff piece on the level of a Teen Beat article asking Sasha who her favorite One Direction member is. That in itself is not the worst thing in the world, but given that the real life Obama is still a lightning rod of controversy, this film is quite the letdown by comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save your money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie 3 stars for the handful of facts that I learned about the Obamas that I thought were interesting. That being said, I remember watching an Asian film in college where the story followed an old man and a boy, with no one speaking the entire film; that was way less boring than this film. There is so much that I wanted to learn about this couple and their family that the film leaves out because it only tells the story of their first date. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I hope this isn't the last movie about the Obama family, because this one doesn't allow the audience to get to know very much at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After meeting people who actually grew up with the characters and hearing what their lives were really like, this was 100% fabricated. Not at all believable. I would not waste my time or my money. I cannot figure out why any producer would place their money on this movie. It was sappy and unreal in almost every way. The characters did not accurately portray the real people in any way. Not physically, not in gesture or in persona. It was so fake and so phony it almost appears to be political propaganda material. I prefer to watch biographical movies that are at least based on some sort of reality. If I want to watch fiction, I will go to a fictional movie. We had to leave the theater before it was over. Truly horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie......OMG!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was prepared for so much more in this film and there was not. It was a first date that I could have missed. I love the couple (fictional and non Fictional) however the movie was uninteresting. I could have wait for the DVD. THUMBS DOWN! I can't wait to view Don't breathe And Ben- Hur, Im sure I will be much more entertained. Love ya TIKA but this film did not make a splash with me. I did like the way they made sure to remind us of the nasty habit that our President use to have with those cigarettes, they made sure to put one in his mouth more then often. The car was the high light of the film really because it reminded us that he really was Southside Chicago. And at one point one could walk the southside streets. My cousins and I did when I was coming up and would visit every summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modest, honest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director Richard Tanner is largely responsible for creating this biography-drama-romance. A small conversation piece taking place on a single afternoon and evening, depicting a "first date" of an attractive couple who happen to be working in the same office during the day. The dialogue is constantly engaging and the characters, highly polished and professional, relate their respective backgrounds and life views to one another. What makes this couple extra special is that it's our now-still-current U. S. President and the First Lady, long before either seriously considered a career in politics. There's nice Chicago 1989 atmosphere throughout, and the two leads are engaging and fascinating as they strive to learn more about one another. I found myself in rapt attention and enjoyed the eighty-four minutes spent in their company. Both Tika Sumpter is as Michelle and Parker Sawyers as Barak give natural, relaxed characterizations. It's a unique project conceived by Mr. Tanner and well executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World's Worst Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking to flush $10 down the toilet, this is the movie for you. The producers of this film attempted to make some sort of valentine for their favorite lefty liberal Barack and fell far short of the mark. You want to know what is ironic about this movie? The name of the movie is Southside With You, and since Obama's soft on crime policies, no one in their right mind would ever think of walking the streets on the Southside of Chicago any more. Just the other day a couple of Obama's buddies murdered Dwyane Wade's cousin when she made the mistake of walking the streets of Southside Chicago. Before he leaves office, Obama will probably pardon these two thugs like he has pardoned a thousand other criminals during his time in office. If the producers of this dreck really want to do an expose on Obama's dating life, maybe they should tell the true story of Barack Obama and Larry Sinclair. Larry Sinclair has told the world that he had two homosexual liaisons in 1999 in Chicago with Barack. I wonder if Obama took Sinclair to the Bascom Robbins ice cream store, because Sinclair said there was a lot of licking taking place during their date. As far as the movie goes, it is just a retelling of the first date of Barack and Mochelle, yawn. All in all, just do yourself a favor and skip this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Propaganda Film wrapped in a love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that was made....well, God only knows why. To try and make a couple look better than they really are I guess. This was nothing more than just a fluff film that was so heavy on the fluff it's just not worth the effort. If you want to know all about Barack Hussein Obama mmm mmm mmm and the first "lady" (that's a stretch) I suggest you watch Dinesh D'Souza's Obama's America. Don't waste your money on this, go buy a bunch of lottery tickets, you might as well and then you won't feel like you wasted two hours of your life you want back by watching this Hollywood butt kissing montage. Better yet, go watch Dinesh D'Souza's latest film, Hillary Clinton's America, The Secret History of the Democratic Party, that will give you a much better character overview of the Obama's instead of this contrived load of bovine excrement that SouthSide With You is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally like biopics of living subjects as I think you have to let time pass to truly measure a historical figure, but this is not a movie about Barack and Michelle Obama, the president and first lady, it is about a pair of young unknown young professionals making a go of it in Chicago and trying to squeeze in romance while trying to climb the corporate ladder. Like them or hate them, it was hard to not identify with some of the awkwardness that is typical of first dates and find humor in some of the situations that we have all found ourselves in - except this is the future president. It was great seeing them at the beginning. I am not sure they should have had the scene of them standing close to a flaming trash barrel in the winter in Chicago warming their hands over the copies of the constitution and American flags they kept tossing into the flames as some people might get the wrong idea. I also think maybe they should have not had the future president lighting up the blunts as he walked on water and tossed rotten tomatoes at the Israeli consulate. The part of Obama explaining away the actions of the Islamo fascists in Iran was also enlightening however. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a movie which only represents a day, we witness a small page of an epic love story which not only succeeds in being cute, but a little thought provoking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Characters Worth NotingMichelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter) | Barack Obama (Parker Sawyers)Main Storyline On a warm day in Southside Chicago, a persistent young man named Barack Obama tries to win over his adviser named Michelle. She is intrigued by him, maybe even romantically interested, but worries about increasing the burdens she already has to face as both a Black person and a woman at a corporate law firm. So, for one whole day, Barack fights off every doubt and any reason Michelle can come up with to deny that their time together isn't an actual date.{Commentary}I have no idea how many creative liberties were taken with this film, but allow me to say that if this is the relationship Barack and Michelle have, let the world be jealous, envious, or whichever word fits best. Now, let me admit, in the beginning, I wasn't comfortable with Barack's persistence. If only because we are in a time in which Michelle establishing boundaries, verbally telling Barack why they can't date, and being firm about that, should be considered the end of his pursuit. Yet there comes a point where you are left wondering if this should be written off as how dating once was or if Barack was just lucky Michelle didn't give him a look and walk home. But despite that minor red flag, the rest was just a dream.I mean, it was a thing of beauty watching them ask questions about each other, be in awe of one another, challenge one another's points of view, and just see this type of chemistry which is purely romantic and not tinged with something sexual. Which isn't to say Barack was some innocent intern with a crush, but unlike many a romantic film, the film didn't seem like it was building up to them having sex. Instead, it was about two people becoming comfortable enough to open up about their personal life and be willing to listen to criticism and not take it as a personal attack, but rather something to reflect on.Then, even when you take the romance out of it, what I like is that we are given the sense that Michelle is more than Obama's future wife and Obama is so much more than our current president. Michelle is Ivy league educated and while we don't get to see Michelle in action, her work was talked about in such a way that it was established that she had a life before Barack, could have one without him, and she would thrive either way. Switching to Barack, again we are given a full view of the man. Be it the issues he has with his father or his exotic upbringing, again we are given the idea this person didn't just magically appear. They had a life and all they are trying to do is share it with someone they admire and hope will find them worth spending time with.But lest I forget, the topics are what I most admire. Whether it's race, how a person's upbringing affects them, or my favorite which is based on Barack's feelings of his father, the questions and answers feel rooted in untangling one's own perceptions and judgments of another human being. For example, my favorite deals with Michelle telling Barack the reason men have sons is because they are incomplete and she related this to her grandfather and father. Her grandfather feared debt so he put no money toward his son's schooling. So, his son did what his father wouldn't. Because his father was incomplete, as a person and parent, he made sure he had the smarts to go college and the offer of financial assistance if needed. Making it so he could not only be better but a more complete man and father than the one he knew. Which, to me, with conversations and topics like that, made this movie more than a sendoff to perhaps one of the most famous Black couples of our time. If anything, it feels like the start of a franchise you never knew you could have wanted. Review SummaryHighlightsThis was a movie about a genuine romance and not just because it featured real living people, but because it felt like Barack's only agenda was winning Michelle over despite all her fears, doubts, and what made her apprehensive.Also, you have to admire a romantic film in which the two sides aren't your usual broken people who either use the other person as a crutch or a means for a life lesson. Yes, Michelle and Barack had issues, some they are still working through, but that wasn't the sum of their person. They had different views on life, the company they worked at, and even each other. But through conversations, ones in which they challenged one another, they fall in love and you are left wondering why they didn't follow this love story to the White House?On The FenceIt is made clear by Michelle on multiple occasions where her boundaries are, what Barack should expect, but he keeps trying to push her into changing her mind. In some ways, that taints the romance if you are of the mindset of political correctness and a staunch view of feminism. Yet, somehow, and it is hard to pinpoint how or when, Barack gets back on your good side. Is it because you believe he genuinely likes her and isn't just being nice for another notch on his belt? Could it be their chemistry is just too good? It is hard to say but even with the excuses you can come up with, a part of you may be left feeling a little uneasy with Barack's persistence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Awful Disgusting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have given a zero if that had been a choice. This piece of crap drivel is so obviously made by some Limo-Libtards in Hollywood who voted for Obama not just once, but twice. They obviously do not know that he is a Muslim terrorist and his partner is a man. They obviously do not know that Obama was born in Kenya, and raised a Muslim in Indonesia. Both Obamas have always hated Americans who are white, and are racists, even though Obama is half white. He rejects his white Mother, and lies about everything in his past. There is no mention in the movie of the vast left wing conspiracy that hides his education and social security records from the public. God help the USA if Obama is made a Supreme Court Justice by a President Hillary Clinton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, my review is little biased for the reason that I live next to the Baskin Robin at 53rd street Hyde Park, Chicago where this story happened decades ago (Baskin Robbins is now replaced by a subway sandwich shop). Watching this movie brought me closer to the life of Mr. and Mrs. Obama, the beautiful couple. This Movie gives you a very good touch of the south side of Chicago. A pleasant feel of romance that just began. A must watch if you like movies with deep real life conversations. I am a fan of Before sunrise series and this movie falls very much in the same league and so I loved it too. PS: There is a small rock landmark with a picture and autograph of the Obama couple right at 53rd where the kiss happened. The marker says "On our first date, I treated her to the finest ice cream Baskin-Robbins had to offer, our dinner table doubling as the curb. I kissed her, and it tasted like chocolate."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet little film that sneaks up on you and warms your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Richard Tanne's "Southside With You" is a sweet, wonderful, and romantic first date film. Yes the characters are iconic, but they're written in such a way that their life and struggle resonate with any two people just trying to get to know each other. Great performances by its two leads, Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter, "Southside With You" is a rare gem.The story loosely recounts how Barack and Michelle Robinson first met in the summer of 1989. Barack Obama (Parker Sawyers) was just a young law firm associate and Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter) is a tough lawyer who's supposed to mentor him. But Barack has an agenda, he's trying to woo Michelle who herself is not interested in the prospect of dating, she has ambition career. But the long day of them hanging out together from the art institute to watching a movie ultimately leads to their first kiss.One of the many things I love about this film is that it feels so disarming, so relaxed, your guards are down because you don't have to expect some big spectacle to show up from around the corner. It's just two people walking and talking, like Richard Linklater's "Before Sunrise," and so you're invested in the characters, you get to know them just as they themselves get to know each other. There's some big themes tackled in "Soutside With You" like Michelle Robinson feeling angry because the fact that she's a woman and she's black may give her obstacles in her career, and Barack is angry at her biological father having left him and his mom, so there are deeply rooted personal issues that audiences can relate to, which makes these iconic characters all the more human, and writer/director Richard Tanne approaches in a calmed, subtle yet firm and profound manner. And part of its success is also because actors Tika Sumpter and Parker Sawyers are more focused on creating the characters written on the pages of the script as opposed to mimicking, so the result that you get is the embodiment of these character's essence, not impersonation, not caricature. And I love how it doesn't fall into the generics of Hollywood rom-com where there's usually lots of gags and other attempts that try too hard to make you laugh. "Southside With You" is just a sweet little film that helps you breathe, you watch it and your stress level goes down. Despite your political views or what you may think of President Obama's administration, when you watch "Southside With You," I guarantee you'll fall in love with it right away.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>
