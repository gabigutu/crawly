		<shortDescription>Are Your LIGHTS Still ON ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to watch Lights Out last night at PVR. Lights Out proliferates scares, shocks and screams, with an entire audience squealing and squirming in their seats, screaming out loud, talking back to the screen at several sequences. Cinematography, script and direction are equally fine. The VFX added up to bring a lot more reality on screen. Right from the first scene to the very end little Gabriel Bateman steals the limelight and our hearts with his endearing acting. Teresa Palmer is absolutely great, no glamour or make-up, just top- notch acting; she is completely immersed in her role and her performance in Lights Out will take you on a scary ride. Overall the movie was shot well with great background sound effects that managed to spook audiences. The rest of the cast have done complete justice to their roles. Those who stay alone in secluded places and try to sleep without light after watching this movie I don't know how do they overcome their fear of staying at home alone at night or sleeping alone without light !My verdict here: 10/10Lights Out was without a doubt one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally think this movie is one of the greatest horror movies ever! Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman's acting is very good, absolutely credible, almost like Rosa Byrne's performance in Insidious, which was flawless. The cinematography was good, dark scenes pretty clear, intense sound effects well achieved.If you go to the cinema with your childhood fears, you will really enjoy this movie. It's full of scares and if you put attention to them, they are the kind of scares that you really fear when you are a kid.I don't understand why people cannot leave their critics-attitude at home and simply enjoy this movie or any other movie. If they do it, you'll enjoy it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Re-birth of Horror Genre!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I expected much less than what the typical horror movie Genre is today in this generation. Well I will be damned!!! I had tickets to go see an early screening of this movie and let me tell you from Men to Women everyone was tense in the audience. Lots of people jumping in their seats and screams as well. This movie hit the spot from the acting which was sub-par from the evil entity. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Most people should really give it a try it is worth the money for sure. The film is only 85 minutes which was a downfall but I will take it versus a 2 hour horror movie that is boring till no end. If the media is calling Conjuring 2 horror then Lights Out must be in a different horror category because it is def. SCARY!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very scary and well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights out really is a great modern horror film. It offers great thrills and also offers wonderful acting. Every actor did their job beautifully and the characters they portray are well constructed, they are not just surface level, cardboard cut out characters. The visuals are good, the darkness and the creepy eeriness effect of a lot of scenes work very well. There are some scenes that may even be somewhat hard to watch because of the utter creepiness. Diana and the visuals that make her up are done very well and the horror is real here, it's not cheap or cheesily boring. The opening of the film is also very effective in its attempt to be truly scary. This movie isn't very gory or overly grotesque either, it has a minimal amount of blood/gore, and some violent images, but not a whole whole lot, which it good and a wise decision by the filmmakers, because if a scary movie is too gory or overly disturbing, then it can be distracting from the plot. You want people focused on the plot of the movie and on what's going on, not on the ridiculous amount of gore. Lights out receives an 8/10 on my scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will get your pulse up fast, revealing the "horror" very early on. Interestingly enough, it keeps that pulse up throughout the movie despite revealing a lot in the beginning. The concept of something that can only appear and be seen if it's dark (and with a somewhat supernatural ability to destroy light bulbs) is bound to lead to a jump scare or ten whenever it appears. Towards the end you've almost gotten so used to it that the scare effect wears off a bit, and is one of two reason I don't rank this a 10.Characters in this movie is also really good, well written and performed, and with a young boy that if not before, totally kick started his future acting career with this movie. The plot has some weight and emotion to it, and with a solid ending that works great.The other drawback with this movie for me was mostly because of unrealistic behaviour from our main characters at times. Like when miss heels from Jurrasic World is worried that when she releases T-Rex it won't be able to follow her if she runs, so she waits for it to come close, walks for a bit, then runs. Those kinds of unrealistic bahaviours. But I've seen worse, so I suggest you just put this on and roll with it!All in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with Lights Out, with a good plot and good actors that deliver, and a scare factor we all can relate to. You might not be so happy with turning of your lights going to bed later that night, so if you have a weak stomach you might wanna sit this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but very effective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what horror films should be like - focused on the scares, has really effective jump scares, even a few humor thrown in, and a not complicated story line that is very easy to follow.This is very much a very "popcorn horror movie" where it delivers the right scares &amp; thrills. Maybe it was a little too short, but that's okay compared to long horror movies that don't really work.I found myself jumping/shouting/screaming a couple of times watching this in the movie theater and I assure you it was not because I just wanted to do it or due to the influence of peer pressure of everyone in the theater also jumping. And it has also impact beyond that, because you'd be thinking about this movie when you get home and you have to turn off the lights.It's a very entertaining horror film and in my opinion, what horror films should be like (especially PG-13 horror films). "PG-13 horror films" can indeed be very effective in the right circumstances. Those people who are saying this is "only scary" because of the "jump scares" don't understand effective jump scares when they see them.So bring your friends along with you and watch this in the cinema and you'll be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights Out takes some queues from Japanese-styled ghost stories, so it will be attractive to that audience. It has a strong chill-factor but a somewhat average formula, and it could have used fewer back-story explanations to make it more mysterious, especially since those elements did not feel original. Based on chill factor alone, it ranks higher than Dark Water, The Forest, Paranormal Activity, The Others, The Babadook, and The Boy, and lower than The Ring, Ju-On / The Grudge, and other Japanese-styled ghost stories, as well as any horror James Wan himself directs. Comparing it to masterpieces like The Exorcist and Poltergeist has no value. I would say its chills rank somewhat evenly with The Woman in Black and It Follows, without being as original as the latter.The ghost itself is creepy enough, but the overall movie didn't have the creative twists that we enjoyed from movies like The Boy, The Others, The Sixth Sense, and 10 Cloverfield Lane. It also didn't have the storytelling chemistry of James Wan's own Insideous or The Conjuring movies.I am a fairly difficult person to frighten. I have been seeing horror movies at the theater since the 70's, and I am usually only interested in the ones that have a supernatural or fantastical element to them. So I am very critical of them, and the only ones I collect on disc are either fun (Tremors), scary (the Grudge), or both (An American Werewolf in London). I will collect this one.Ghost stories are done to death. It is very difficult to come out with anything scary that is original. I think Lights Out could have used the guided hand of a third-party master horror writer, mostly revising the back-story revelations and using the character relationships to build suspense and mystery surrounding what is going on. Then, perhaps working up to a punch line at the end so that suddenly the back- story rushes in on the audience in one moment, with one simple revelation. It is very difficult to think of how that can be done, but other movies have done it, and the payoff is huge. I think Lights Out tried to do that a little but got confusing in the attempt. But all-in-all it's a nice little scary movie with a smaller production value but a satisfying ghost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Clever, and Unnerving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights Out, is quite possibly one of the most visually and mentally scary films in the last two years. The film is yet another in a string of horror movies that uses diseases as allegories for its premise, and this premise alone is genius. Lights Out is often unnerving and sometimes terrifying, dark in look and tone, without feeling recycled or derivative. The biggest strength of the film is that the story is constructed in a way that the audience is always wondering if something will happen.The most genius element of the film is the look of the creature that haunts this movie "Diana." Diana is an all-black figure that lurks in the dark, and kills whoever threatens it. That being said throughout this film the audience has to fear that this character could pop out of any dark space at any given time. At 81 minutes, not a single second is calm or peaceful, because the mere sight of sight of this creature is unnerving. However, the writers and crew deserve credit for conceiving the idea of the film having a lot of darkness in it.We often say lighting is a storytelling device, but in today's films it's become less true the more formulaic films get. In this film lighting is very much a storytelling device, and it is used perfectly. Every scene in this film contains, just the right amount of darkness and light, almost as if there are safe areas, and areas that characters should stay away from, and they're often changing. The dark look and tone of this film, create a very unnerving atmosphere, because one of the most common fears is a fear of the dark, and more notably a fear of the unknown, which exists in the dark.The film really hit a note with me personally, because I have had nightmares in the past about all dark figures living in the dark, so the film felt that much more personal to me. That being said, the film really doesn't feel all that derivative of other recent horror films. A few moments, and scenes did feel familiar (Diana as a child), but those were few and far between. Even those moments that are a little familiar, are constructed in a way that they are still very scary. The film does what The Babadook did a couple of years ago, and uses depression as an allegory for the creature in the film, which is turning into a very cool concept. The film is one of the few films within the system that uses lighting to tell the story, and does so in a way that is clever and terrifying at the same time. The film is admittedly dark, and relatively humorless, and not really for children, but that kinda goes without saying. For those horror buffs looking for a good scary movie, this may be your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this if you want fun &amp; scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw a screening of it. If you like horror I'd say go see it. It is a jump scare movie but there's some depth and story to it. Character development was great, actually get to care about them and want to see them make it out. Acting was pretty good. F/X were good. The only part that I didn't like was they did the explanation of the backstory by one character explaining it to another. I always hate when they do that, just seems lazy.The audience really got into it with a lot of people jumping and then a lot of giggles at themselves and others for jumping. Oh and in our screening the comedic relief of the big guy down front yelling "oh s**t" every time Diana jumps out. It reminded me of when I was a young teen and we'd get a whole group to go see the newest horror (F13,Halloween etc)You can't take it too seriously, just sit back and enjoy it.Overall I'd give it a 8/10 which is pretty good for a horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great. It immediately engages and then keeps the audience's attention. The story is compact, the acting strong and ending plausible. Perhaps the strongest performance is that of Marie Bello, who plays an emotionally disturbed woman. However, all of the performances are outstanding. The movie succeeds in creating a mood of foreboding as all are engaged in a fight for survival against an unknown malevolent force. The movie avoids the pitfall of becoming just another scary movie with contrivances that inspire laughter. Instead, it succeeds in telling a story and building the tension to its inevitable climax. That is the hallmark of excellent story telling and why this movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid scare machine with an excellent finale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>84%Despite my enjoyment of the original short, I was not impressed with the trailers for LIGHTS OUT, which made it look like just another jump-scare laden, run-of-the- mill, exercise in mediocrity. To my surprise the pre-release buzz was overwhelmingly positive, and since I got chance to see it for free thanks to a screening pass, I had nothing to lose, and as it turns out Lights Out is one of the biggest surprises of the year. Is it still filled with jump scares? Absolutely, but these types of scares are not of the cheap variety. And what's most impressive is how debuting writer/director David F. Sandberg is able to repeat essentially the same scare over and over, but keeping each one fresh, exciting, and inventive. Save for many that have been spoiled in the advertising, it's the many more that haven't been shown that are the cream of the crop. Lights Out got me to scream out loud on more than one occasion, something The Conjuring 2 was unable to do. Ironically, Lights Out is produced by James Wan (director of The Conjuring franchise) and Sanberg outdoes him again and again, both in legit scares and intensity, a perfect amount of humor sprinkled throughout that isn't cringe inducing, and a visual style all his own that is at times flat out dazzling. Even if the film hadn't been as successful as it is, the technical aspects are faultless.Still, there are some flaws to be found. It's increasingly apparent that the frightening set pieces were at the forefront of importance when the script was being written, with the character and story depth taking a back seat. Though we do end up caring for these characters, it's mostly through their convincing performances rather than the writing itself. The origin story to the antagonist Diana feels rushed and a bit confused. We understand that something 'very bad happened' to her, and that there was some kind of accident. But unless I was zoning out, we don't get enough explanation as to what exactly happened and who she was, or why she turned out the way she did beyond the bare-minimum. The attempt at strained familial bonds and mental illness reminds one of The Babadook lite at times, but unfortunately Lights Out never reaches the level of that film's' thematic weight (save for a rather unforeseen turn at at end).Essentially, the story is nothing more than a clothesline to hang upon what the audience came for, the horror and thrills. These aspects certainly could have been a lot worse, and they don't necessarily drag the film too far down, but a second draft and more fleshing out would have been welcome.With that being said, Lights Out plays for a while as a solidly executed, entertaining, if not quite extraordinary horror for its first two thirds. Entertaining enough, but aside from the opening and a few scenes here and there, I was wondering why the film was being so hyped up (as of this writing it still holds a 100% score on RottenTomatoes with 13 reviews and counting). But the best is certainly saved for last. The final sequence is where the goods come and where the film raises itself up on onto another level. I'm telling you, it is absolutely RELENTLESS in it's escalating insanity, genuine suspense, thrills upon thrills upon thrills, and some great moments that had me both laughing and jolting in my chair. It's nothing short of exhilarating, and seeing it in a packed theater only adds to the fun.This finale is where the director finally goes full throttle and doesn't let up until the final shot. It makes a good film into a damned near-great one, especially for horror fans. The use of lighting is also tops, as the vicious monster can never appear in light, the different sources of light- from a lit candle, a fluorescent black light, head lights, flashlights, even gun shots- are all used ingeniously. The same goes for the darkness, as every time a light bulb flickers, or we are suddenly thrown into pitch black darkness, all one can do is hold their breath and grip their chair. As you know some bad news is about to go down. It really dives into that primal, childhood fear of the dark and may conjure up a few bad memories or two. I can't express it enough, the finale is worth the price of admission alone.Ultimately, while it may not be on the same level of my favorite horror films of the year (The Neon Demon, The Wailing, The Witch, to name a few.) Lights Out is pure popcorn munching horror fun. Ridiculously entertaining, gorgeously executed, and just a great time at the theater. Time will tell if it holds up on repeated viewings, but for now I definitely recommend every horror fan to give this one a watch opening weekend, preferably at night, in the most packed theater one can find. I eagerly await whatever David F. Sandberg does next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic jump-scare flick, nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights Out doesn't break any new ground, nor does it really attempt to. 81 minutes of PG-13 jump scares and basic horror tropes in the vein of The Grudge. Not bad for a summer fright fest, but don't expect more as you won't find it here. Technically it looked and sounded great, with a notable crazy-mom performance from Maria Bello. If you've seen the director's original short you've basically seen this movie already, however if you're looking for a quick scare without a lot of substance this should do the trick. For a good storyline with stylish direction look elsewhere, as the missed opportunities pile up rather quickly with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and pleasant to watch Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing LIGHTS OUT in the theatre. I'm always interested when an amateur director of a promising short is offered the chance to make a feature film out of his neat, little idea. For anyone who hasn't seen the shortfilm LIGHTS OUT by David F. Sandberg on which this movie is based, go check it out, it's on Youtube. It's funny and creepy at the same time and develops quite a charme in just 3 minutes.However, i have to say, when it comes to the full lentgh version of the film, it is simply not more than an above average horrorflic that definitely shows a potential in a young director who hopefully hones his skills in his projects. Compared to most other horrorfilms of late, LIGHTS OUT is definitely better than works like ANNABELLE, OUIJA, THE WOMAN IN BLACK 2, SINISTER 2, INSIDIOUS 2+3 or THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, but sadly this doesn't say all too much. Those Assembly-Line-Horrorfilms simply suck. It is also not quite on the same Level as 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE, THE BABADOOK or IT FOLLOWS, let alone the cinematic powerhouses of the last century.What I liked about the movie is the cinematography and the building of tension. The camera work isn't very dynamic, but the scenes are always crisp and clear. The angles are well chosen. The play with light and shadow is very creative and leads to moments that are tense as well as funny, e.g. in the scene where a red neon light is shining in intervals through the window of Beccas bedroom and the creature only shows itself when said light is switched off. All the horror scenes are well directed and even the occasionally thrown in jumpscares suit the situations mostly well. It's a constant back and forth between the chilling, tense absence of the creepy creature and the terror that unfolds when it finally shows itself. The horror aspect of LIGHTS OUT definitely works.However, the framework that holds everything together is simply underwhelming due to a boring script and a lack of experience when it comes to direct emotionally charged character interaction. The characters in the film are likable (especially Beccas boyfriend, who's struggling hard to convince her to open up to him and is very sympathetic in his clumsiness and earnestness) and we spend quite some time to just learn about them, but the movie doesn't do much with it. Especially when you consider that the movie is about a terrifying monster that comes across as scary and brutal in the well realized opening, the rest of the film is simply too harmless, undisturbing and shallow. Everything boils down to a very simple family drama without ever delving too deep into the regions of mental disorder or the disruption of family ties upon which the film touches. Also, for the most time, everything that the creature does is nothing more than a clawed hand shooting out of the dark and grabbing at one of the protagonists.Additionally, the creature seems to be quite stupid. It's motivation is - as is revealed about half into the movie - to be left alone. However, when it seeks out Becca in her apartment, revealing its presence to her and even scratching its name into the floorboards, it does provoke exactly the opposite. Also, the backstory of the creature is delivered in rather lame exposition and is overall pretty messy. The script could have done a way better job at presenting an engaging mystery here.So overall, LIGHTS OUT manages to provide short, effective and tense moments of horror and develops at least characters that are likable. That makes it entertaining to watch but overall pretty forgettable. It's never really bad, but also lacks moments that are really memorable (apart from the scene with the car keys, that one was awesome). Thus, I enjoyed it, but I probably do not have to see it again anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst horror flicks i've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Lights out is one of those movie concepts that sounds really interesting on paper, but falls flat on its face and breaks its nose as soon as it starts moving.It's a jump-scare filled slug that fails to impress, featuring a boring cast with no real personality, illogical decisions to try and make you jump, and a monster that doesn't even follow her own rules.The massive problem is the star of the movie itself: Diana. She's an evil woman that follows the mother of two kids, and relies on the mother suffering to survive her self. The problem with Diana is that she breaks her own rules all the bloody time. One moment she needs people to open the doors for herself, the next she's teleporting around like she's a god. In the next moment she might disappear when you flash a light at her, or she might decide to stand there and burn while screaming her lungs out.Diana herself doesn't seem to have any real goal other than being a jerk. She needs the mother to be depressed or she disappears *supposedly* but then decides to hunt her kids when they're trying to avoid her, which in theory she should be grateful for.Diana is also about as subtle as a Train wreck. Whenever she appears the music blats your ears in an attempt to scare you, but when you close your ears *since it's always easy to predict where she will be* and just look at the scene, you realize Diana is about as scary as Mickey Mouse with fangs.Characters also do the stupidest of things, like walking TOWARDS where they know Diana might be, instead of staying in a lit area where they're safe. And the excuse "they don't know better" is not valid, since the entire family knows Diana is real, and has multiple scars and wounds to show from it.In conclusion, Lights out is a poorly thought out movie that would have been better off staying as a short film. The only real good thing about the movie is that none of the "living" characters are inhumanly bastards. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giving it a back story and more detail made it feel cheapened.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't until I checked the credits that I realized this was based off of the short film by David F. Sandberg. I knew the lights off/lights on shadow figure thing seemed familiar. While I really loved the short film, I don't necessarily agree that it needed the full length treatment. I feel like we see this a lot - capitalize off some popular internet thing that, when extended, loses some of what made it special in the first place. The short film was unsettling and creepy as it was; giving it a back story and more detail made it feel cheapened. I'm not a huge fan of "BOO!" gotcha horror movies, though; I come from a generation that was raised on the original Halloween and, for me, that is the apex of subtle, creepy, slow burn etc - everything that makes one get enveloped in a movie. When there are two many jump-atchas, it is jarring and does not make for high replay value (for me, anyway). I thought the mental asylum backstory was so played out; I feel like maybe that trope should be burned alive. We get it. Although that's kind of how I also feel about kids being creepy (or "troubled"), too. There's just so little variation in horror these days. Not all bad, though - I feel like the choice of Teresa Palmer as Maria Bello (Sophie)'s character's daughter was a fantastic choice. I not only enjoyed her performance but I feel she looks the part; she looks like a younger version of her.</fullReview>

For starters the acting was really good from the entire cast, so many horrors of late have felt like school projects in the acting stakes, but this was excellent, Teresa Palmer was fantastic in the lead role of Rebecca, and very well supported, Alexander DiPersia was very good as boyfriend Bret, but get a hair cut! The scares were constant and instant, no boring introduction or time for the first scare, it kicked off as it continued through to the end, some of the scenes had the entire audience jumping, it was brilliantly made. What I'd class as the perfect movie to go to the Cinema with friends.Loved it, 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one for the cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so glad that I read the reviews on here, they made me want to see this film even more and I'm so glad I did, I thoroughly enjoyed! Superb acting, great story and plenty of scares from the offset! I'm pretty hard to scare, but quite a few times throughout I jumped, and it was at parts that I didn't expect. I love the fact that it just got on with it, there was no dragging it out and the story was explained and really well thought out. It makes the dark even scarier now and I didn't think that was possible lol! It was refreshing to see something different for a change, without the usual clichés. It ended perfectly, I highly recommend 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights Out wasn't a bad film, and it's always nice when a horror film comes out that has some scary moments and is only PG-13. Usually I go into PG-13 horror films with low expectations, which allowed me to enjoy the movie for what it is: a bunch of jump scares. The short film this movie was based off was simple, and effectively scary. By adding so much to the concept, it threw off the pacing. This film tried to be more than what is was. It tried to explore a deeper meaning, touching on mental illness and family problems (think The Babadook but not nearly as good), but it only managed to scratch the surface in a pretty shallow and uninteresting way. This was only accentuated by sub-par acting from quite a bit of the cast.However, the film succeeded in making Diana frightening. By not ever showing her real form for much time outside of the shadows, she managed to be pretty horrifying. Definitely a creature to inspire nightmares when you turn out the lights.Overall it was fun to go see in a theater filled with jumpy teenagers, but not really worth a second watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I was kinda hyped for this movie, since everybody was like "see this if you are not easily scared".They forgot to add "because you will get a yawn fest".I have to admit the movie looks pretty. It is really pretty. The cast are pretty, the sets are pretty. The light is pretty, the intro is pretty. After the intro, the movie is pretty...... ..dumb.And not "horror-dumb" kind of way, rather dumb in a "this is plain dumb" way.The decisions the characters make, the lame and way-too-much-straight-into- your-face expositions. The jump scares that made no sense. The lack of character development. It all made me yawn at about 1/3rd of the movie. And later on was only worse. The dialogues, the music/sound effects, the monster, the reveal, the lack of character depth made me wish for them to die, rather the opposite. The ways to fight the monster back were ridiculous. And the ending? The dumbest ending I have seen in a long time.Christ, this movie made me angry. So promising and yet - ultimate letdown.Rent it. Or not. Better not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleeping with the lights on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this short horror, viral video a couple of years ago as it was scaring people, including myself, across the web. Coming from Swedish no-budget horror short-filmmaker David F. Sandberg, otherwise known as Ponysmasher on YouTube and other social media platforms. I'm assuming Horror director/producer James Wan (Saw, Conjuring, Insidious) watched the original video and had to back Sandberg's work and develop it into a full feature length film. It always pleases me to see something like this happen, like Kung Fury and Hardcore Henry. It's shares a few story elements from other existing horror films like The Ring, The Grudge and Insidious and whilst not entirely unique, it is superbly done and quite unpredictable. The trailer doesn't give too much away as it might suggest. They've kept it simple and it works, trying not to stray from a working formula. Aussie model and actress Teresa Palmer, who looks like a younger Naomi Watts, takes the lead as she tries to consul her younger half-brother Gabriel Bateman, who incidentally already has a list of horror film credited to his name, even for his age. Credits such as Annabelle, Outcast and American Gothic. He's having issues at home with their mother, Maria Bello who seems to be having a some sinister kind of relapse, something Palmer is familiar with. But it's this Diana that the story is all about, who can only get at you in the shadows. Diana herself (played by stunt double extraordinaire, Alicia Vela-Bailey) is a great creation even if not solely original. Her hands, her stance and her voice work perfectly well and actually preferred the silhouette and glinting eyes over seeing her in the flesh. The rest of the cast does just as good as the leads, especially devoted, needy, boyfriend Alexander DePersia who I at first look, mistaken him for GoT's Daario, Michiel Huisman. Good to see Brit comedienne Andi Osho and it's a nice touch to see the original victim from the short, Lotta Losten who also happens to be Sandberg's wife. Only downside is that it's not that scary, though that doesn't mean it's a write-off, it's tense in parts with a good modern spooky score from Benjamin Wallfisch, but there's no great shocks, in fact, there's some comical bits which gladly, doesn't ruin the film. It's a great all-rounder horror film and fans of the short should enjoy. It certainly reminds of when you were once afraid of the dark and might have you sleeping with the light on! Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 6 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being a great extension of the short film. 79% 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may want to keep the lights on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror movie that is not actually a sequel (surprisingly), Lights Out is about a family who are experiencing a supernatural presence that can only stay in the dark as they go through a difficult time in their lives. I remember when the initial trailer came out and everyone's minds were blown, a horror movie that looks refreshing and scary. Is it both of those things? For the most part yes. Lights Out was actually legitimately unnerving mostly due to the refreshing gimmick it uses:&nbsp;keep the lights on. It was a clever move to use&nbsp;the fear of darkness and turn it up to the maximum level of "good luck getting any sleep for the next 2 weeks!". But even&nbsp;more clever and surprising was that it was a horror movie with great acting and a good story. Teresa Palmer and Maria Bello are probably the more famous actresses in the movie, and they were convincing (especially Palmer, finally a film she can actually show some emotion). Heck, even the on-screen boyfriend had depth and was likable...that never happens in horror movies. The story between mother and daughter and the sorrow and anger they both feel due to past incidents was conveyed excellently, makes the characters much more investing and relatable. Sure, the creepy ghost girl is creepy and the darkness is dark and the jump scares were jumpy...but the movie was so much better due to the acting. The lighting in this movie was consistently appropriate, not too dark you cannot see anything and not too bright that it loses the atmosphere. The only flaws with this film were that it was ridiculously short, at 1 hour 21 minutes this was close to being straight to home media. They could easily have prolonged the chemistry of the family or added in some more fresh gimmicks and the film would've actually benefited from it. Some key plot points of the film were predictable, but it's very rare to see horror film that is unpredictable so this was to be expected. Overall, Lights Out was a refreshing horror movie with a fresh gimmick and quality acting even if the runtime is ridiculously short.- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Novel idea but needs more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights Out is an interesting stab at a horror movie based on a 2013 short film of the same name. The movie's novel concept is a creature that can only be seen and manifest in the dark. Turn a torch on, and it disappears. Naturally, this means that a lot of the movie is spent in the dark but this works well.The use of lighting is one of the movie's strong points and allows for some creative, and occasionally funny, uses of torches, candles and even car headlights. This technique generates a lot of the scares and atmosphere and given the movie's title, this is a must. Definitely top marks for the director on this part.Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman do well in the lead roles as the unfortunate kids with a crazy mother, played by Maria Bello. The problem with the movie is that apart from its main concept, it doesn't add much else. Clichés abound and yes, there is the mandatory dark basement (groan). Most of the scares are jump-out-at- you shocks and it's all been done before. Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to use psychological horror and churns out movies that are just twists on the same theme. This is probably a bit harsh as the movie is enjoyable enough and it's well-written, but I long for something new that isn't so long in the tooth.The supernatural horror is effective and does elicit a genuine threat to the characters. Maria Bello, in particular, does well to ramp up the threat levels and makes you wonder who is going to make it out alive. As already mentioned, this was based on a short film and it really still is, coming in at around 80 minutes. Perhaps there wasn't enough material to make a longer movie but there's a feeling that it ends just as it gets going.Lights Out is a decent film if you feel the need for a dash of supernatural horror but don't expect anything stand-out; it just doesn't deliver enough of a impact to make it memorable. It's good for what it does but don't buy too much popcorn as you may not have time to finish it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - don't think too deeply; predictable and daft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High anticipation around Lights Out - some people calling it the best horror in years. That it ain't. It cleverly uses a common childhood fear, darkness, and turns it into something surprisingly mediocre.On the plus side, most of the performances were great - Palmer plays the (now standard) attractive young feisty blonde, who despite her own childhood issues tries her best to save her younger brother (fantastically played by Bateman) from this mysterious menace. Her boyfriend (DiPersia) does well at balancing being just outside the family but still being supportive, not quite believing it all but trying to help. Bello as the mentally-impaired mother though was off and on - some moments had deep emotional impact, but others just looked hilariously awful.But a horror movie is only as good as its fright. The nemesis, Diana, makes no sense whatsoever. The characters delve into her history and the film tries to offer explanations which really don't fit together ("there's no such thing as ghosts"). Despite having a creepy non-appearance, I never felt she actually posed any threat to the protagonists, and the more they tried to explain her, the less compelling and scary she was.As always the soundtrack is ridden with jump-scares. It's a shame really because Wallfisch's score is really emotive once it gets going (like in the end credits), but is completely underused in order to have the quiet-bang gimmick. The movie starts with some well developed tension, but by the end it just became predictable and scare-less. Visually it does work quite well - Spicer's cinematography is great, and there's good use of light and shade (the black-light scene looks fantastic!).Promising opening, but fell apart later on, Lights Out isn't the movie I was hoping for, but still one that's entertaining enough for its pretty short run time. Sandberg's finally broken out of short movies into features, let's hope he does more with the Annabelle sequel next year.3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this knowing that it was rated above average for a horror movie and came out feeling like I am on a totally different page. It contains all the clichés of a typical, low budget horror movie with one-dimensional characters, a loose plot, weak acting, glaring stigma towards individuals with mental illness, and more. The fact that it is unable to hit the 1hr 30min mark should have warned me there was little substance and I did not find myself invested in the characters or the unveiling of the truth behind the situation. On a sidenote, there was not much to look forward to with the scariest moments already portrayed in the trailer as well. Terribly mediocre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights Out has everything you wish to see in a horror movie. But there are instants herein that stop it from reaching petrifying levels of a great riveting horror flick. It doesn't retain the flair of a slow paced scare. However, within its nimble charisma lies its true heart throbbing dread.PLOT OF LIGHTS OUT The video project of the same name that had gone viral three years ago, has been finally moulded into an artistic piece. Augmenting it further is a thrilling story to tell an imaginative tale that walks on a thin edge of palpability. Still the magic works! After making a series of shorts, David F. Sandberg finally gets a fully-fledged project under the aegis of James Wan. What's reassuring is that he delivers too. He includes Lotta Losten to the tale giving her a cameo of sorts, trying to revive the lost lights out video and then furthers the tale with new elements.DIRECTION OF LIGHTS OUT MOVIE David F. Sandberg's inexperience transpires at a lot of junctions, wherein you could point, "He didn't think this through!" It is like you can almost taste the lack of percipience in his work. There is passion in his job alright, the love for horror so loud and clear, that you can find it lurking at weird corners. But there is always a sense of thoughtful trepidation missing from his cinema that seemed to have primped down his work into a mere 1 hour 21 minute affair.You can feel as if he was on a constant canter to reach the end. Maybe the short in him will take some time to wear off. Even though his direction barely reached the levels of horror veterans, he still manages to weave out something above mediocrity, and that is what counts.CHARACTERS AND SPOILERS IN THE DARK AHEAD Sandberg's entry into the horror world receives three cheers from people all across the globe, owing to his unpredictability. He breaks horror clichés in many ways.The first coming straight from a character like Bret. Alexander DiPersia who plays boyfriend to Rebecca, cannot be simply ignored. Breaking banality profusely the character fits like a rare gem in the movie. He isn't a hero exactly, and yet he survives Diana's attack on three occasions with sheer presence of mind. We generally tend to think boyfriends die first, because they are not important to the tale, but Sandberg decides to break the chains of platitude by keeping Bret alive and breathing.The second most important character is that of Rebecca played by Teresa Palmer. She has this constant confident mien that she wears like a pro at odd hours. The only problem is that she condescends and patronizes Bret beyond limit, so much that you begin to wonder why Bret's with her in the first place. Yet she packs in an uncommon poise that seems to fill you up with pluck too.Martin, played by Gabriel Bateman, her brother isn't a wuss either. He is scared, terrified, but he always comes around. He has peerless tricks in his pockets that he comes up with to stay safe.Billy Burke has a small cameo too in the prologue of Lights Out Movie.SHORTCOMINGS Apart from the directorial issues Lights Out had, there were other things that don't go ignored either. Screenplay of the movie was terrible. At one point Martin drops a truism as if it was jostled out with originality. It seemed kind of stupid and forced needless to say.When Rebecca is engaged in a face-off with Diana, she asks Bret to take Martin away. But when there's a gunshot you see Bret still holding onto Martin unperturbed by what's going on in the house. There was a gunshot for crying out loud. Why didn't he come up with dozens of searchlights, or even better if he was short on time, light up the car lights and point it towards the house so there was at least some light that could save the inmates.Another question that miffs you is how come Diana plays with lights sometimes moulding them to her will, and then sometimes forgets to switch them off. The constant disconnect in the plot like that makes Lights Out like a sieve of implausibility.Also, you cannot completely overlook the fact that despite knowing that Diana is in the house, characters give in to sleeping in the house with Sophie. They were all so unprepared even though they knew the truth. That was a tad too much.THE FINAL VERDICT Darkness has forever intrigued us. There is something about its still aura that has us questioning us our sanity. A topic that will forever haunt us, just by its sheer fancy. David F. Sandberg milks the fact enough. I am afraid, not properly but he still manages to fabricate us a good horror flick.If we don't look in the direction of the downside-darkness of the Lights Out movie we still have something that is way above thousands of pointless horror movies. To that we nod him welcome.A must-watch horror fans.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry but they milked the concept a bit much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The short is a fantastic example of a clever and well executed idea. It just works, so good, and I was super excited about the feature. So it hurts to say that the feature is far from the clever short. Why? They milk the concept bone dry in a couple of minutes. You get it all in the intro and everything after the title is just a downward spiral with a bunch of desperate attempts to keep it going. I hoped this could be a great feature version of the weeping angles from Doctor Who. If you haven't seen that you should watch the episode "Blink" right now. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000252/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2Some of my favorite horror movies are the original Chainsaw Massacre, Blair witch project and The Evil Dead. What do they have in common? They leave a lot to your own imagination. You get bits and pieces of explanation but they never give too much. They let you fill in most of the blanks. Lights out wants to explain all of it and centers the whole story about that explanation. In that way they miss the thing that made the concept so good. The fear of the dark and the fear of the unknown. When they take that from us we're left with jumpscares and predictable story lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lights Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 3-minute short horror film of the same name, it is a very simple premise, only seeing something evil when it's dark, the trailer for this certainly looked worthwhile. Basically in a mannequin warehouse, co-worker Esther (Lotta Losten, star of the original short) sees the silhouette of a monstrous woman when she turns the lights off, but sees nothing when the lights are on, she warns owner Paul (Twilight's Billy Burke) about what she saw before leaving, Paul encounters it in the darkness and is killed by it. Rebecca (Warm Bodies' Teresa Palmer), Paul's stepdaughter, lives alone in an apartment, away from her younger brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman), and her mother Sophie (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello), who suffers mental illness and depression that has resurfaced. Sophie is apparently communicating with an imaginary "friend", Martin starts to suffer insomnia from fear seeing the apparition with his mother, his teacher Emma (comedian Andi Osho) calls Rebecca and tells that Martin has been falling asleep in class. Rebecca takes Martin home, but following a fight with their mother, for his protection she takes him to her apartment, but that night she suffers an attack herself, the silhouetted woman appears in the darkness, but Rebecca makes it disappear turning the lights on. Rebecca finds a scratching on the floor, the name "Diana", she recalls her experiences from her childhood of an apparition frightening her. Martin is with his mother for a movie night, but she frightens him talking about her imaginary friend, she tells him a story about Diana (Alicia Vela- Bailey), who she met in the mental institution she was in, Diana had an unusual condition that made her skin light-sensitive. Martin is attacked by Diana, who throws Sophie out of her way to get him, but he escapes to Rebecca's, she meanwhile finds documents in Paul's office with information about Sophie, and finds Diana was a mental institute patient experimented on by doctors, she was killed by overexposure to light, Diana has manifested as a vengeful ghost and manipulated Sophie that they are friends. Rebecca confronts Sophie about Diana, but she denies the accusation, so Rebecca, her lover Bret (Alexander DiPersia) and Martin decide to stay overnight to protect Sophie. During the night Sophie secretly passes a note saying "I need help" to Rebecca through her bedroom door, before being tugged back, Rebecca realises her mother is being controlled, and turns all the house lights on to keep Diana away. Diana knows the intentions of Rebecca, and lures her and Martin to be trapped in the basement, Bret is attacked and goes to get the police, while Rebecca finds that while Diana is invisible in light, she can be seen with a black light. With the black light Rebecca also finds scrawled writing across the walls, explaining how Diana will not let Sophie be taken by anyone, and Diana reveals that Rebecca's father did not abandon them, she killed him. Bret returns with two police officers, but they are swiftly killed by Diana, Rebecca sends Martin out to Bret, while she goes back in to rescue her mother, Diana grabs Rebecca and is about to kill her, but Sophie arrives holding a pistol to her head, exclaiming that she would not exist in the human world without her, to save her children Sophie shoots herself in the head, causing Diana to burn and disappear. Sophie's body is carried away by the police, while Rebecca, Martin and Bret reunite at the ambulance, as they calm down and vow to stay together the ambulance lights momentarily flicker, but it is all over. Also starring Rolando Boyce as Officer Brian Andrews, Maria Russell as Officer Gomez, Elizabeth Pan as Nurse, Ariel Dupin as Young Diana, Amiah Miller as Young Rebecca, Ava Cantrell as Teen Diana and Emily Alyn Lind as Teen Sophie. Palmer is alright as the concerned teen, and Bello is fairly convincing as the mental unstable mother, it is essentially a "now you see it, now you don't" formula, the story of why the ghost exists just about stays interesting, there are good amount of sudden loud noises and the terrifying ghoul suddenly appearing that get jumps, a divisive and effective enough supernatural horror. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roller-coaster of jump scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights out? an eerie silhouette of a human-like creature loiters down the hall. You repeatedly blink in an attempt to mould its blurred lines, but the dishevelled contour of the unfathomable spectre remains absolutely motionless. Lights on? nothing there. Lights out? it's moved a couple of inches near you, and your breath starts to come in short gasps. Lights on? a tinge of stinging pain strikes your bloodshot eyes, and sweat covers your petrified face. You hesitatingly move your fingers upon the switch and take an abrupt stop in the middle to wonder what will happen the next time the lights go out. Well, let's see. Lights out? perhaps, you shouldn't have been so curious.In 2013, Swedish filmmaker, David F. Sandberg, put out one of the most iconic horror short-film experiences that the internet had ever experienced. By that time, all the corners of the virtual realm were awash with the amateurish spine-tingling stories, and the emergence of urban legends, such as The Slenderman. They galvanised aspiring writers to leave their marks on virtual forums, but a selected few decided to take their projects to a whole new level by transferring them to a wider scope.Lotta Losten, who played the nameless main character in the short-film version, enacts a below-par reinterpretation of the same scene, which filled our hearts with sheer dread on Youtube. This time, she plays a woman who works in a mannequin warehouse, and, while clocking out, happens to have a ghastly encounter with a ghoulish presence; However, she's able to sheer away from a gruesome fate. Subsequently, she warns her boss, Paul, about what she saw. He doesn't seem to give much thought to it, but later on, while walking down a dimly lit hall, he comes across a monstrous apparition, which drags him into the darkness, and mauls him to death.The story follows the brothers, Martin and Rebecca, trying to fathom the depression episodes of their mother, Sophie, who happens to have an unexplained connection with the same demonic entity, who attacked Paul, their stepfather. Rebecca is the typical rogue girl who's then telephoned by the school, where her brother studies, to talk about his sleeping in the class, of which he attributes to the same entity which happened to haunt his sister. Rebecca feels beholden to become his responsible guardian, inasmuch as her mother is not of sound mind to look after the boy, and that's when the very same monstrosity that traumatised her childhood, decides to lurk in the shadows of her bedroom one more time.Unfortunately, the adapted version falls short in offering an immersing narrative compared to the original one. The short-film is well-off for uneasiness. It relates to the blood-curdling sensation of going to the kitchen, in the middle of the night, to get a glass of water, and feeling that, at any moment, a gelid hand will sneak up on you. The foundations of the original piece are the imaginary phantasmal beasts, which are masterfully woven due to mere creaks and noises.The experience does not establish a favourable pace in order to evoke a heartfelt sympathy towards the characters. The film doesn't take too long to showcase its premise by walking us through its mechanics. A glowing lamp pops up in the screen signalling its importance in the narrative and it appears that the whole story is used as a mere background for its successful jump scares extravaganza. 'Lights Out' didn't seem to have inherited the same traces that its predecessor could have bequeathed, instead, it limits itself as a roller-coaster filled with jump scares that do not allow the viewer to take in the events. Notwithstanding, it does not entirely fail to regale us. The formula can be categorised as hackneyed, but gets its message effortlessly through to us by simply saying: Grab a torch and give darkness a wide berth. Lights Out? enjoy the ride.Verdict: 2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even though it mostly relies on jumpscares, the creepiness still stands.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A recently fatherless son couldn't sleep because he is afraid of the creature that talks to his mom every night when the lights are out. He calls in for his stepsister to help regain their mother's sanity. Terror and emotions starts to unfold as the truth about the family's dark past begins to uncover itself.Lights Out is adapted from a very simple gimmick short film: about a creature that appears every time you turn off the lights. The creators realized that the premise would run out of ideas very quickly, so they decided to shoehorn every jumpscare they can. Luckily, it worked well.However, there are so many negative aspects to pick off. The common horror trope characters, the weak script, the actors' measly performances, and weird pacing makes the movie seems a bit stiff.If you're looking for jumpscares and general creepiness, this might be a good movie for you. If you don't, it will still be worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is pretty good, i just saw the movie today. Diana(The lady ghost/evil) is kind of scary and terrifying. Consider this is a short movie so yeah, it is pretty great.Teresa Palmer also did a really great job in her character and also the mother. But what makes me laugh is Rebecca little brother, Martin, had a really kind of funny expression.There is this part where Martin was supposed to be scared but his expression its looked like someone who is mad, i don't know, maybe that because he still a little boy and still learning.I'm giving this movie 7/10 because even though i think the movie is pretty great, it just that they need more some fire to the movie. The story line is somehow too simple i think so the movie it just seems casual.my friend was shocked for couple times, but i only shocked and scared once. But if you are not a really horror fandom but curious about the movie, i suggest you to watch it:) it still worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look I'm a fan of the genre and it's always great to see a small budget film get made in the United States and get a big release and make money.I'd love to say the film deserves all this success, but I was let down by it. The writing is pretty poor--the "ghost" is explained in several talky scenes in a row--making for a dull section of it right when it should take off. One scene involving a recorded audio flashback is unintentionally funny.The whole idea of a ghost that can exist only in the dark you'd think would lead to unexpected scenes or the lights going out or the ghost finding ways to put the humans in the dark, as in DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK--for instance. But instead these scenes just randomly happen and, in a real horror movie cliché, characters are constantly wandering off on their own to put themselves in trouble and then not much real trouble ensues anyway. Once you've seen one such scene in this movie you've pretty much seen all the rest of them, and there are a number of them. None of it builds in pace of suspense of horror.Sure it could have fallen in for a cliché ending, but they fall into too many traps from other films and it's not well enough directed or acted to overcome predictable stumbling around in the dark sequences--of which there are many more of then there are scary pay offs. No one scene in this film is as good as the cheap short from which it was expanded.It's relatively bloodless on all levels. If you think this is a great horror movie you really need to spend some time tracking down the truly great ones, cause this ain't in any of those league.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the trailer for this movie, I almost didn't wanna watch it, as it just seemed to be another jump scare heavy movie. Granted, it does have those moments, but aside from a group of four girls in the cinema ruining some of the tension and a big moment later on through constant chatter, this film was good. I like James Wan, who if thoroughly believe is this generations Wes Craven, but he only had a producer role in this movie. It is directed by David Sandberg, who also directed the short film, that inspired this film, and I have to say it is very well directed. This film is about a family haunted by a girl called Diana, who surprisingly had an interesting backstory. The trailer does spoil a few plot elements, but far from spoils the tone of the movie. In the early stages, there are obvious jump scares coming and you just have to groan, plus a slight poke at the stereotype of rock and metal fans, was a little annoying. But, this movie turned those predictable jump scares and stereotypes on there heads, as not only are the characters well developed and not shoe horned in just to be there for killing, but the jump scares, while they do happen, do allow you to see whats there to scare you before the loud noise happens, and half of those noises are just amplified screams of someone being attacked, so they are far from the cheep jump scares we have come to hate in horror. When there is a jump scare, it's because there is something to be scared of. There was several times in this film where I was thinking 'oh here comes a cheep jump scare, but alas they don't. So, kudos to this movie for building tension naturally, and making me care for every single character. The ending did become predictable when a certain thing becomes established, but that doesn't take away from the performances. Maria Bello, who plays the mum, is fantastic in this movie. The lead Rebecca, played by Teresa Palmer does a solid job, and while she does have a couple of far away looks and acts a bit off character for the situation at times, for the most part does great. Alexander DiPersia who plays the boyfriend, is a likable character, and has stuff to do, and act's like a boyfriend should, which is rare for horror movies where usually the main characters other half is just there to be an idiot and/or die. Also the kid actor, Gabriel Bateman, is great. Kid actors get a lot of flack but this kid acts superbly, carrying scene's when its just him and Diana, and while maybe a little to mature as a character, does match up to the fellow actors around him. Diana has a good back story, and its a very intelligent plot as horror's go. The design is a little clique, and brings nothing new to the table, but her presence is felt even when she isn't there, and the reveal of her, when she's not just a shadow, is very well done, if only the group sat in front of me hadn't talked about the big reveal scare for five minutes after, I may have appreciated it more. Yes the characters do have their 'dumb character' moments, but it isn't on a frustrating level. I was surprised by 'Lights out' and I hope to see the actors and director got on to bigger and better things. This is a good horror movie. 2016 seems to be the year Hollywood is getting it's s*it together, and treating horrors seriously. However, we still have 'Don't Breath', 'Rings', and the new 'Blair Witch' to come so we shall see. All in all 'Light's Out' is decent, with a few cliques, predictable jump scares and ending, but has a good plot, great character development, and does build the tension well. All in all a solid 3.5/5 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent horror debut from a new director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do like the horror genre and whilst plenty of horror films are made it is slim pickings when it comes to ones that are good. There's only a handful (if that) each year that stand out. 'Lights Out' thankfully is one of these.The film is as generic as a horror movie can be - Family in peril, check. Ghost/Monster/Creature terrorising, check. Jump scares/Death. Obligatory backstory reveal to said Ghost/Monster/Creature, check. End fight/battle, check - which is not a bad thing at all because most horrors work from this formula. It is how this formula is presented and what new ideas are brought which makes or breaks whether a film is good or bad and new to feature film director David F. Sandberg shows that not only has he a couple of new ideas to bring to the table but he knows how to work the formula to keep things tense and scary.Running at a short length of 81 minutes the film throws you straight in for a scare ride, introducing Diana straight away as the malevolent character which can only be seen when the lights are out. The use of this idea is simple but very effective especially in scenes where characters are turning the lights on and off. There were people sat in the cinema who were genuinely hiding away from the screen because they knew something was going to happen when the lights went out. The acting was believable and the kid who played Martin did really well at actually looking scared and run down. The story went by at just the right pace and some of the transition shots between scenes by the director were really refreshing to see as it stood out (well at least to me) rather than a traditional editing between scenes.Overall this was good film, well scripted and shot and fun for a few scares. I'll be keeping an eye out for anything else by David F. Sandberg</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very difficult to make movies about schizophrenia, let alone anything that is vaguely entertaining. It's even harder to do so without portraying the schizophrenic as a psychopath, so it's remarkable that Lights Out manages to (in its subtext) be a drama about schizophrenia, mental illness and suicide.The protagonist Sophie suffers mental illness, at first revealed to be depression and whilst at a psychiatric institution as a child manifests a malevolent persona who is scared of light. The malevolent persona later kills her husband and anyone who tries to make her go away.Sophie's daughter Rebecca is the principle character in the movie and must return home to face her demons risking her own mental health to save her brother and her mother from this evil using its Achilles heal, its fear of light, as her only weapon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandberg and Wan prove that when it came to making an effective horror, the lights were definitely on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer James Wan continues his winning streak of supervising a slew of successful - both critically and commercially - horror releases with this feature-length adaptation of director Sandberg's spine-tingling short film.Preying on the audience's primal fear of the dark much like Dead Silence did the act of screaming, Lights Out is a thoroughly simple premise with plenty of window dressing. While so many of the standard genre tropes are present and accounted for that it would be forgivable to consider the film generic, it is under Wan's guidance that these elements take on some form of originality, however small; there are numerous innovative moments of misdirection that set the film apart from the rest of the mould. The door creaks, the lights dim, but what happens next always seem to have been thought out, rather than phoned in. Teresa Palmer supports the fantastic Gabriel Bateman as siblings who witness their mother fall foul of a parasitic spirit named Diana. While the narrative clumsily stumbles over her origins and motivations (which, given her nature, is especially disappointing), the mysterious being is refreshingly novel and unnerving as a result. Complementing this are the effective character dynamics which strengthen the viewer's investment in who lives and who dies, who succeeds and who fails. It's not as profound or well-handled as the maternal conflict seen in The Babadook, but the struggles of a broken family still deserve recognition here for their bearing on the plot of a mainstream studio horror film.While Lights Out does falter at many hurdles, including poor justifications for many of the questionable actions its characters take, it chills for a solid hour before racing towards its relentlessly tense finale. It is so easy to criticise horror nowadays as us having seen it all before, but the truth is that we have, and that the solution is merely a clever twist on our expectations. Sandberg and Wan prove that when it came to making an effective horror that surprises more than enough, the lights were definitely on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, unnerving and brilliantly executed. 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was surprising to me. I was expecting more generic horror providing jump scares, amidst an ocean of cliché. However, this was certainly not the case! Horror is always cliché to some degree, but this film did it's best to bring something new to the genre.Lights Out doesn't waste time getting into the action, but does well setting up the plot and characters quickly. Lights Out also does well in providing audiences with enough information, but without giving away too much too soon. The characters are interesting, and I almost immediately was invested in their story.The film was full of great performances from all actors, including good chemistry between the daughter character and her brother. The relationship with the mother is also very interesting. The scares are good, and the villain is creepy and original. The whole idea that this entity can occupy any dark space keeps the audience on edge through a good portion of the film. The story elements are original, interesting and well established; providing a bit more substance to the movie. Although it is a great addition to the genre, it's hard to be surprised by a lot of the elements at work here. Other than the bittersweet ending, we know what is going to happen before we see it, so I can't give a score more than 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it suffers from some glaring narrative issues and it isn't all that scary, 'Lights Out' is still an enjoyable film that is visually interesting and well acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Lights Out' is a horror film directed by David F. Sandberg, based upon his original short film of the same name. The central premise is that there is a creature which can only manifest itself in darkness, so as the title suggests it is only visible when the lights are out. This is a really cool and creepy idea, one which taps into a fear which almost everyone will have had at some point in their lives - a fear of the dark. The concept is by far the strongest point of this picture, it's just a shame that it isn't utilised to its full potential. There are a number of contrivances and plot-holes which dampen the overall impact of the piece, and the final product isn't really all that scary. However, it is well-made, entertaining and has some unique imagery as well as some interesting set-pieces. The primary issue with the film derives from the script, with a large number of inconsistencies and absurdities that feel especially prominent upon retrospection. True, in the moment a lot of these issues weren't all that obvious or intrusive, but there were a few that stuck out immediately and all of them were prevalent when given more than a second's thought. There are several moments which completely betray the concept, moments in which the film breaks its own rules. There is confusion created about what happens to the creature when it is in the light, whether it is merely rendered invisible or completely disappears, and also confusion as to whether it is constantly a grounded presence or can hop impossibly between sections of shadow. It's these inconsistencies that dampen the effect of both the premise and the villain; it seems as though Sandberg couldn't maintain a persistent concept for a feature-length outing. It's a shame, as the film suffers greatly for this apparent lack of attention. The other trouble with the creature is that it is given a thorough back-story relatively early on, which eliminates any mystery and is actually rather disappointing. It's honestly quite unbelievable and, again, lessens the impact of the antagonistic being. This isn't helped by the fact that its actual design is fairly generic and not really frightening; the creature in the original short was much creepier and much more affecting. The villain is also tied directly to the main characters and is thus not presented as a possible threat to the audience; it doesn't have the impact of something like 'It' from 'It Follows', a creature which is passed on by sex and therefore could be easily passed onto you, or even the staying power of the concept behind 'A Nightmare On Elmstreet', one which is sure to haunt your dreams, though it should have as darkness is all around us.The creature is visually interesting in terms of its silhouette, movement and the shots it is contained in. It always feels tangible and like a palpable presence within the scene, meaning that the director's choice to do as much in-camera as possible clearly paid off. The actress portraying the entity, Alicia Vela-Bailey, does a good job of selling the creepiness and unhinged nature of her character. The cinematography is also great, coming across as crisp and not too dull; the lighting is a huge part of what sells the effect of the creature, and it works perfectly. The overall effect is believable and interesting to watch, so even when specific scenes clash with the general premise they are always engaging and different. There's some great direction with little shaky-cam and clean framing, as well as a variation of shots and engaging blocking. On top of that, there are some really neat scenes featuring the creature, focusing on the interplay between shadow and light, and some clever moments that were genuinely inspired. My main issue with the direction is that there are several 'jump-scares' that are only even remotely effective due to an increase in volume and intrusive music; the sound becomes insanely loud to try to trick you into being scared, but the visual ends up being marred by this as the audio is very distracting.The script in general was good, aside from the narrative issues, and the flick does have a decent family drama at its heart. The focus is always on character and luckily the majority are good. Teresa Palmer is great, portraying fear convincingly and creating a rounded character with some interesting issues. The young Gabriel Bateman is also fantastic, managing to not only keep up with the other actors but sometimes surpass them. He hit all of the emotional cues well, and was very naturalistic. The boyfriend character, played by Alexander DiPersia, was more competent and useful than usual and I wasn't annoyed by him at all; Maria Bello does a good job in her role, too, but she is oddly side-lined at times. Overall, 'Lights Out' is a generally good movie that unfortunately suffers from some narrative and concept issues, as well as not being particularly scary. It is well directed and visually interesting, the acting is top-notch and it is enjoyable throughout: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warner Bros. Is The Modern 'Hammer Productions', Temporarily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lights Out", the second horror film most anticipated of the year (undoubtedly, the first was "The Conjuring 2") lands in midsummer with an unimaginable reception at the box office, but with unequals from specialized critics. It's not perfect, and despite it being favored with the production of the horror master of the 21st century, James Wan, it is distant from the works of the producer; nevertheless, gives some well made scares and a few drifts of the conventional decisions in the genre, although, as it is recurrent in the summer, all that promise disappears when they turned on the lights.As happened with the selfsame Wan at the beginning of the decade with "Saw" and Andrés Muschietti with his short film "Mama", talented Swedish director David F. Sandberg managed the support of New Line and Warner Bros. to adapt his short film from 2013, in a lucrative film of 81 minutes runtime. There have been several cases in which Hollywood accepts the original ideas from shorts (especially, relating to the horror genre) to take them to the big screen; nevertheless, it is complex and expectant the process to extend a simple plot of three-minute into a solid story line for more than one hour. Sandberg knew to create an gloomy atmosphere and in constant movement, but he neglects worthy treatment to a promising premise complicating the solidification of a real modern classic, even so, it is a delight enjoy of the darkness of his invention.Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) is a young woman who is determined to move away from her home to leave behind inexplicable events that happened in her childhood on account of the psychological disorders of her mother with her imaginary friend, Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey). However, Martin (Gabriel Bateman) replaces the role of his elder sister in house of his mother, experiencing the apparition of a woman with creepy appearance as soon as lights switch off . Rebecca decides to confront her atavistic fears from childhood and save her family, inquiring into the origin of the mental problems of her mother, Sophie (Maria Bello), uncovering the tragic roots of the supernatural manifestations that haunts them, Diana was a marginalized girl with psychiatric problems due to a skin disease with contact of the light, now, she is an aggressive supernatural appearance in search of a weak mind, unfortunately, she has found a home inside a family that was nuclear.In addition to each one of the aspects that adorn films of Wan, one of the essential elements is to create strong characters that worry us, characters with credulous foundations; one simple plot, but with heart, with expectation and above all with intense shocks. This lack is present within the film, Palmer and Bello are not light the spark in screen with their performances. The story takes reminiscences of the genre and it is unable to establish the limits of Diana, nevertheless, some of the sequences more stressful are based purely on these.With multitude of resources such as the setting ( interesting fact: I'm pretty sure that the interiors of the house of Sophie where they filmed "Lights Out" are the same used in Universal's "Ouija" in 2014, with minor modifications; pay attention to details inside the house), lighting and the soundscape manage to hook the audience in a dark spiral to their deepest fears, the cupboard, the blackness under the bed, a bleak basement and of course the universal fear of the darkness.We are exhausted of diffuse plots that does not lead nowhere, the argument is elementary and simply effective. A narrative that combines with the haunting soundtrack and the admirable cinematography, obtaining sequences makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end during all runtime. With appropriate 81 minutes, it is slips gradually giving clues and delivering cheap jump-scares with an ending belonging to a family drama, nothing suitable for the purpose of the film, but at least, it was decent."The Ring", "Dark Water" and even "The Conjuring" are rough references in the movie of Sandberg and even though in occasions he become stagnant to project scares that we already have seen, he provides certain scenes that explore the places more recondite of your mind and they will overwhelm you, until you are under your bed sheets at the midnight. The intermittent light red in the apartment of Rebecca, the confrontation between Diana and Bret and the last thirty-minute take advantage of the resource to the maximum; the film is more than keep you on the edge of the seat, the film stays with you until the darkness of your bedroom and oblige you to remember Diana, unavoidably."Lights Out" is the dreamy debut of any director and fulfills with generate excitement about what will deliver David F. Sandberg with Annabelle 2. In a period in where horror films are having a boom spontaneous, the last project of New Line does not exceed the level reached by previous films of the movie producer, nevertheless, it entertains, frightens and even paralyzes. The only function of "Lights Out" is to nurture even more the universal fear to darkness and, Yes, I always switch on light more than three times to assure me that I'm completely alone, however, the silhouette of Diana always is there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was looking forward to this as soon as I saw trailers &amp; posters for it! I even remember a 3 minute version back in 2013 under the same name, but never knew they were going to make a feature length version until earlier this year which is by far epic!The film is basically about a family who are tormented by a demon who lurks in the darkness &amp; attacks those when there's absence of light, but there's more to the story as the mum knows who this demon is &amp; why her previous 2 husbands (including her first) who died under mysterious circumstances! The film was edge-of-you-seat scary! I knew it was going to be a great horror flick as it was on my Must-Watch List of Horrors this year! The jump scares added to the film's nerve shredding terror &amp; dread! This film also had some pretty creepy &amp; terrifying visuals too! Along with a bit of blood &amp; gore which I was also surprised to see in this film!The story was great &amp; the back story was really good! It really had a good chunk of explanation to the demon &amp; why it targeted them etc, etc. I won't give too much away as you must see this for yourself, it was truly an epic film &amp; just really well put together! The actors were good &amp; believable! I was pleased to see Alicia, the stunt woman who was in The Purge (2013) as the axe wielding purger! That was great too as she was scary in The Purge also!The only slight downer on this film was the ending which I felt was somewhat bitter sweet &amp; could've been executed a bit better than it was, but hey it wasn't a bad ending!I'm also pleased to see that this film is getting a sequel, let's hope that it gets made as this film was bloody great! Really nerve shredding &amp; tension gripping!I give this a 9/10, an epic film I enjoyed to the full!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep the lights on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Lights Out (spoiler free)4* Cast: Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello, Alexander DiPersiaPlot: Rebecca (Palmer) a woman who left her home because of sick mother is stalked by a dark entity so she tries to save the day and her mother Sophie (Bello); however things aren't what they seem as this being only appears with the lights off. As she tries to discover what this being is her family is in constant danger but what will she do? Will she save the day or run out again?Everyone's done it. Every director has done a horror which will make you scream then turn the lamp on with fear of something appearing in the shadows. Essentially that's what this horror is inspired by, David F. Sandberg's, feature length horror started its life as a viral Youtube short which had the same type of creature and the same terrifying aspect, so it's easy to say this is based on a short. The initial idea of this film is Lights out ghost appears, lights on its gone but it's done on such on such a gigantic scale much like the Babadook that is a little of the same as what this is, a terrifying creature from God knows nowhere and terrorizes a family just trying to get on with life. However this movie not only has a pretty good story to it but also delivers a plethora of scares for 80 memorable minutes. It's impressive that an original horror this short can be done so well. There is a lot that can be said for the shadow-dwelling creature calling itself Diana a lurking silhouette with glowing white eyes and Nosferatu claws with a punishing back-story to justify the malevolence.Although influenced by J-horror and the slow-creep style of producer Australian horror maestro James Wan, Lights Out could be this years Babadook: there's a memorable monster, peek-a-boo scares, but, crucially, a spiky emotional turmoil that feeds the fear. However Sandberg's human touch also shows with the characters, they are flawed but they are lovable Teresa Palmer plays Rebecca a woman who abandoned her family home after her mother Sophie, (Bello) went crazy, that had a huge effect on Rebecca. The movie conveniently is very blasé when it comes to its theme it promotes mental illness and it shows that when you see something lurking around in the shadows you would go crazy. Not only does Sophie go crazy but the rest of her family are borderline insane, even Rebecca's, brother who spends his time with Sophie so he sees the terrifying that resides in their home with them. But this dysfunctional family copes with their problems however Diana makes them worse. Another good thing that this film adopts is that the story never falls flat as the story goes and it will never fail to scare either. David Sandberg's debut feature is deeply impressive and delivers full blooded frights without even a pipette of gore. So this is a horror not for gore goers, not necessarily a bad thing because frights are the full blown mechanic of this directorial debut. Relying deeply on practical FX and ominous lighting design, Sandberg has a fiendish gift for ambushing audiences with jump scares out of the whazoo (there are at least nine jolts within the first 40 minutes) ? as she stripes from dark to light, Diana's attacks are like being subjected to a slow-motion strobe. All of his characters are battling internal demons but they're too: the fact you're rooting for them rather than cheering on the malevolent Diana makes the ordeal cut all the harder. But a good horror that will damage you internally you don't need hollow jump scares it also needs a terrifying demon and that is exactly what this fear-of-the-dark horror has done, it's added a creepy new demon that could be added to the ongoing list of horror demons that have scared audiences in the past. Granted, some of the dread leaks out when things get silly in a frantic third act, when those jolts turn into full blown frights guaranteed to scare the living daylights out of you. And it does begin to turn a little bit predictable but also not a bad thing, besides the frantic third is nothing compared to the ending which is a little weird but you go with it because it has a sense that the ghost is just in Sophie's, head so she does something to shock you but it all adds to this well made horror that could even be counted as one the best ever horrors, and also one of the best films this year. In conclusion this terrifying horror will give you all your money's worth and then some you may even want to keep the light on when you sleep, because it will probably make you scared of the dark again. Definitely worth a watch. VERDICT: A lean, mean scare-machine, and a surprise contender for horror of the year. A memorable monster and a plethora of scares what's not to like about Lights out, but if something does appear in the shadows then, for God's sake, buy a bedside lamp.8/10 One of the best ever horrors.</fullReview>

Heroine boyfriend character was well made. Surely movie can be watched once, not more than once.If you watch the movie for second time, Sure you won't feel good , since you know all the scenes from before . Last 30 minutes of the movie is really well made , with lots of goosebumps . There were some hilarious moments also in this movie which makes you laugh and give applause in some time like BRIT showing mobile light to that creature . At that time , audience were clapping and giving cheers for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Horror Films of recent years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright. A Comedy film intends to make you laugh, as an action does to make you feel thrilled. And a horror film intends to scare you. And that's exactly what this film achieves. It is scary. It's not Psychologically scary like Silence of the Lambs or Psycho. And it isn't a scar-you-for-life scary film like The Exorcist. Its simple, classic jump-scare scary. The Kind that Shaylman dreamt of bringing back to the silver screen for years. If there is one thing you can be sure of, it it is that you will get your money's worth of entertainment after sitting through this.Last year, our horror film and film debutee Robert Eggers made a surprise in Hollywood with his hit "The Witch". This time another first time feature film director makes his mark. David Sandberg adapted his own short film into this feature length thrill. And he delivers. The reason why this film succeeds as a horror film isn't the jump scares- any old hack can make jump scares. The reason why it works so well lies in the pacing-Sandberg knows how to relax the audience before scaring them, before building a Hitchcock like suspense, only to be broken, then rebuilt back into a scare. The monster effects are like a leaf out of Guillermo Del Toro's book. I was genuinely convinced that no one else in Hollywood or the Film World could make a scary creature like Del Toro. I was deeply mistaken.Rather than Steal(although according to Tarantino, stealing from other films makes a better artist...)Sandberg borrows techniques and ideas from many a horror filmmaker. There is Hitchcock in their, with the long takes of suspense and the build up, there is the M.Night Shaylaman Jump Scare and The Del Toro Monsters. There are also undertones of the Poltergeist and The Babadook in there, with the latter obviously being a key to adapting this into a feature film. Sandberg then takes a little bit of everything and puts all the well known techniques into play, except this time the concept is completely original(Not counting the short film) and the style is adapted into modern standards. All in All, this film is a must see for horror film geeks. Its great entertainment and you definitely get what you payed for. Now its time to turn the lights out on this revue.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the disappointment of conjuring 2 i was reluctant to go for Lights out, but i was pleasantly surprised by the direction and story flow in Lights out. Most horror movies have a slow beginning as they build the story up, but lights out does not give you a moments rest. From the first few scenes you are pulled in by the scary scenes as the story builds quickly. Some good acting by Teresa Palmer(Becca) and young Gabriel Bateman(Martin) adds to the quality of the movie. At times certain scenes are easily guessed but still give you a scare. Overall a good horror flick which is a must watch for every horror movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for a stolen idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a good movie. However, I liked the original creepypasta version "The Abstergo Man" that was created by a youtuber called CreepsMcPasta."The Abstergo Man" was posted back in October of 2013 and a few months later Sandberg posted a "Lights Out" short which copied quite a bit from the prior story.There are some changes done to the story line in the movie, but for the most part it is a complete rip off. It also does not help that the Sandberg admitted he got ideas from creepypastas. Listen to "The Abstergo Man" and see if this seems like too much of a coincidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good B-level horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights Out benefits from being two things primarily: a) it's a streamlined narrative focusing on only a small group of characters (a little boy, his sister, their depressed/crazed mother, and the sister's boyfriend, and at the start of the film the boy's father is there but dispatched pretty quickly), and so the filmmakers have as their task to get us to care about these characters only, and they do that through some tight writing that doesn't waste time and Maria Bello in a strong performance as the mother (Theresa Palmer is also quite good as the sister, showing some surprising range, and Gabriel Bateman as Martin the little boy shows some restraint - refreshing after seeing something like The Darkness earlier this summer). And b) the scares, while occasionally of the 'Jump' variety, are well parsed out and there's a conceit here that has a whiff of Nightmare on Elm Street in a good way: you see the characters, mostly the boy, being worn down psychologically and physically (i.e. lack of sleep from not being able to close ones eyes when it goes dark since that's where the ghost-demon whatever resides). This comes from a short film of the same name and I'm pretty sure the filmmakers just translated that to a larger canvas. And they take their time with their set pieces despite a short run-time (it's right under 80 minutes, if anything it could've used a couple extra scenes).Along with the Elm Street comparison (the older generation brings its demonic BS to the younger generation, though at least here the adult has to reckon with this being, I won't get into plot details here but it suffices for a set-up for this "Diana" ghost being), if anything at its strongest this could serve as a B-side to The Babadook. It's never as impactful as that as far as the psychology of the characters goes and it starts to rush into certain things that are revealed that can combat the ghost in the last act, but there is that feeling of it being more personally related, that because it boils down to how terrifying a parent being a menace to their child is you can feel the dread whenever the children step into the house that is constantly in darkness (when they walk in during the day I mean, part of the subtle cinematography that builds to the last act).So among the crop of mainstream horror this year it's in terms of craft and intention a cut above some of the others (Darkness, The Forest) and has some work put in to the script. Where it lets down a bit is that it sets up something key in the final minutes about how the characters can combat the ghost and then it ends in a... surprisingly dour and melodramatic fashion. Perhaps it makes sense far as a character arc goes (or maybe not, I may need to process it more later on), but it feels as though the filmmakers are just leaving things open for a sequel, and not in a subtle way - it's like, 'well, that happened, and the ghost of Diana is gone... for now... wooo'. So it's not satisfying entirely as an ending, but thankfully what precedes it is chilling and exciting as a modern horror with very minor Dumb Character Moments (in capital letters).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unstitched story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THis has god little thrills, but story is a big drawback. The director is known to be behind many horror short films that you can watch on youtube. And this film is just another long "short film". What i mean by that is story is not written well, and it is not well stitched. Just to include a horror element, they tried to plot the story which is not conceiving too.I can rate it only 6 which is more than what it deserves. If you really have not watched horror movies since a long time, you can to this film to get a taste of it. That's all. But there are better horror films which has nice story narrated behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard many good reviews for this horror movie so of course I checked it out. From the very beginning everybody in the audience were whispering excitedly. The beginning of the movie set the tone for the whole movie, which was horrifying since it was in a shop full of mannequins. I also enjoyed when the police officers were at the scene where the monster was and one of the officers tried shooting the monster. After every round went off in the gun, the light would hit the monster causing it to go away and come back in a split of a second... Spooky!Some dislikes were that the backstory was a little confusing, but hey most horror movies are. Another one is that I wish there were more scary scenes of the monster torturing the main characters, because that thing was creepy.Overall this would be one of my favorite horror movies I've seen this year, it's one of those scary movies you like to tell your friends just to have them creeped out! It was also believable thanks to the extraordinary acting. My lights were definitely ON after I saw this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a big fan of horror movies but still, this one works. Thanks to the acting. As the writing can be pretty predictable.Rising star Teresa Palmer is Rebecca who left home after her father walks out or so she thought. And her own estranged mother, has a mental illness leaving her unfit to take care of Rebecca's youngest stepbrother Martin, played by scene stealer Gabriel Bateman.As Rebecca's past comes back to haunt her and Sophie talks to herself, not all is what it seems. And it frightens young ten-year old Martin. As Rebecca wants to take Martin out of her own mother's frightening reach.It is a scary movie if you can take Friday the 13th and Halloween. But still Palmer carries the film well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting concept, terrible execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Lights Out' is the feature length adaptation of a similar short film created by David F. Sandberg starring Maria Bello, Alexander DiPersia, Teresa Palmer and child-actor Gabriel Bateman. In this film we follow a disjointed family that is being haunted by an evil being. At it's core 'Lights Out' is not a very unique movie as more often than not the recent horror movies feature a monster haunting a family. The movie does however use an interesting concept for the implementation of the monster. When the lights are on the being is powerless, however in the dark it can move around and do whatever is necessary to torment the family. This concept is certainly put to good use as it does feature some interesting scenes, sometimes though it seemed as if the creators forget about it as often times certain events happen that could not have happened since all the lights were on. The concept could've have provided for a very good psychological horror movie, though sadly almost all of the scares are nothing but jump-scares. These jump- scares are for the most part fairly well executed however, though when you've seen a few they all kind of look alike.What the movie does not do well however is the dialogue as almost all conversations feel unnatural. Sometimes characters will make weird decisions that are only there to setup a scare later in the movie. The different subplots and the main story itself is not all that interesting and when the movie reaches it's ending point it is very predictable what is going to happen. I must commend the movie for at least trying though as most horror movies recently tend to forget an accompanying story altogether.Another aspect of the movie that is not that great is the acting. Not one actor portrayed their character in a convincing manner. Maria Bello's performance as the crazy mother was downright laughable, Teresa Palmer's character often spoke as if she was developing a sore throat and the child actor Gabriel Batemen never really seemed honestly scared. Had the acting and dialogue been a little bit better 'Lights Out' would've been a pretty decent horror movie. As of right now however it is a sub-par horror movie and a downright terrible movie on it's own.My rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the billboard for this movie in Paris metros...The title is Dans Le Noir ( In the Dark) in French and they mentioned some of other horror movies I have loved beside the title, so I was impatient to see it. After 2 weeks of waiting I gave up and watched a cam version. I did not understand or hear 30% of what they were talking, but I got the whole picture.The film is not bad. But it is not brilliant either. For me, it was not really scary and somehow the 'evil shadow' was kinda familiar. I mean, I know that there can not be many variations when it comes to evil things/people in horror films, but ... I do liked the background of the evil creature but I believe it should have been much more exploited. The film is very short so they could have add several minutes of that story somewhere. I think it would be more exciting.The actors were good. The film is entertaining. Maybe if I watched better version, my opinion would have been better. All in all, seven from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very over-hyped. i left the theatre unimpressed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>lights out was a film I was looking forward to. described as being one of the best and most well rounded horror films to come out in recent years I was definitely intrigued. so I went to the theatre with high expectations.so lights out is a film with a very cool concept that if done right could end up being something very scary and chilling. but, instead we get something much much less that that. this film from beginning to end was so anticlimactic, boring and generic. I will try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible..the beginning scene is extremely anticlimactic. the director does a great job of building some solid tension and some genuine sense of unease with this first sequence but the pay off was such a major let down. a character is pulled laughably into the darkness. unfortunately this is the only scene that built any tension at all. for the entire duration of the rest of the movie there is no tension what so ever. every "scare" is predictable and laughable. characters who know and have known for a long time that you have to stay in the light to escape this ghost foolishly hold their lights in front of them. pointing the light away from them rather than holding the light above their heads. so many scenes involved characters surrounded by darkness, holding a light in front of them and backing into the darkness. so anticlimactic and boring to watch. this ghost has the power to rip someone into the darkness and do away with them immediately.. so why does it not do this to these characters that it wants out of the picture. instead it chooses to show up and grab their shoulders, or stand in the doorway or something equally as ridiculous. for one half of the movie the ghost instantly disappears when the light hits it. but in the third act suddenly for no apparent reason at all the light burns her? there was no explaining this is just suddenly happened. the characters have the opportunity to delve into their past and really develop and maybe even have an arc. instead we get generic characters with minimal motivation and a very very vague and uninteresting back story. the exposition in the film is also ridiculous. there is a scene where Rebecca walks in and just meets this lady for the first time in her life and within seconds she says something along the lines of "stepfather not my father. my father abandoned me." who says that? who says that within seconds of meeting someone? it's like the director has such difficulty introducing us to these characters and their back stories that he writes them with out any thought or any heart. I will not reveal much about the story but I will just say it is the most generic story-line possible. the potential was there to write an interesting mystery but instead the ball was dropped. we get a generic, mom met a girl. the girl died because of some unjust cause and now the girl is back in ghost form. nothing interesting and you see it coming from a mile away. the acting is awful. I couldn't take anybody In the movie seriously. the interactions between characters all seem so forced and unnatural.there really isn't anything about the movie that was redeemable. I went into it hoping i'd like it. but no. the only thing I could give it as a positive would be the fact that it's well made. but the budget was obviously the reason for that. if somebody gave me millions of dollars to make a movie i'm sure it would look and sound just as good.it had a pretty good concept but unfortunately the ball was dropped. nothing interesting or even slightly different was done and the film ended up being a stale and boring one.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2.9 of 10. If there was a ranking of horror film categories that are the worst types of horror film, this wouldn't be the worst type, but it would be in the top 3. It's about as scare as a child sneaking up behind you and yelling book as you walk into a dark room. That's also pretty much the extent of what this film does, and thus the film title, which is the best part of the film.Imagine you use your smartphone camera to film your son/daughter/little brother/sister wearing a long-haired wig backwards while they sneak through a dark house and wait for someone to turn out the lights and go to bed. Then they walk into the room as you hit play on a boombox with a loud, disturbing sound plays. Well, you'll get more entertainment out of that then this film, and that's pretty much all you can expect from this film, without having the benefit of having an amusing home video to play back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More funny than scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it funny. I totally agree that some of the scenes were gripping. On on such point, the whole theatre screamed or gasped. Also, the characters in the movie were not at all dumb which is rare. But, there is no denying that this movie is easily forgettable. There was nothing memorable about it. It started off with a pace and managed to maintain that which was impressive but it was not a very fast one to start with. The climax was funny! Yes, everyone in the theatre was laughing hard. It is not that there were many scenes where they put funny scenes in a horror movie to lighten up the mood, the backdrop was pretty tense, but we were laughing. This is not a good sign for a horror movie because nowadays, people are not scared by ugly scary faces, they are actually scared when the movie has a scary tone throughout. Teresa Palmer and Maria Bello were okay. The ghost, have to say is something I have never seen before. So, I would say that it is entertaining, but do not expect from it that it will scare you much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the movie hits on what most of us were (or are?) afraid of, darkness. The scares are mostly expected if you're a fan of ghost movies.What I find unsatisfying about the movie is Diana's logic. (Spoiler) If she disappears right when there's normal light (not the 'black light'), say Bret's scene where he turns on his car's headlights, then why was she trapped at the door by Rebecca and being hurt by the strobe light?If you have not seen the short version of the movie, I recommend you to see this.

		<shortDescription>Lights Out, Fun but Not Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an American Horror film written by Eric Heisserer about a family haunted by a supernatural being. The film was based on the original 2013 short film of the same name created by the director and pretty much took the same premise from the short and applied it to a feature length running time.So how does Sandberg's debut stack up? The cinematography was decent, with some great little transitions between shots and scenes here and there, and the lighting, with some particularly clever attention to detail with shadows to highlight the tension and sinisterisim of the darkness (even if it wasn't the big baddie) was particularly clever.The acting gets a bit of a nod for a few, such as Gabriel Bateman as Martin who pulled off what he could for his character with his child stoicism and terrified out of his little gourd combo without being annoying. And there was also Maria Bello as Sophie, who did a decent job of coming across as pitiable and mildly creepy at the same time.Then of course there is the strongest element of the film, the scare.Practically every 5 minutes there was a jump-scare (escalating in the end), and unlike many other movies or television shows out there, they weren't all predominantly fake-outs. In fact, there was perhaps only one fake-out out in the entire film.Each scare fulfilled on its promise of something outright scary or occasionally mildly creepy. It was its complete and utter focus on jump scare and lighting combination that carried the film, and made it surprisingly fun to watch.This movie does unfortunately have a bushel of weak points that stick out regardless of the fun experience, weak points that popular sites like Rotten Tomatoes dubs as strong attributes: The Characters and the Story.First are the characters: This is not exactly a strong pool of dynamic personalities. Most of the small pool of characters isn't given enough of an identity, interaction or development in this film that you actually forget the name of most of them from time to time.They rely on a few handful of moments in the film that could be attributed to the action or mood of a particular scene as needed, such as the boyfriend's entertaining confrontation with the creature, the opening scene with minor characters Ester (Lotta Losten, who was from the original short) flicking the light switch, and Paul (Billy Burke) trying (and failing) to not be killed, and Martin's apropos responses to Diane.Speaking of Diane, she was creepy (when not under a blue light) and her movements were just the right amount tension building, but the antagonist suffers as a weak point as well as her backstory was half-arsed, a little implausible in parts even for a horror film, and the connection between her and Sophie was not given enough development. The story itself was of course the other major weak point.There was no overarching mystery or any other narrative hook to keep you gripped, with everything about the creature was summed up early on and floating undeveloped relationships such as the mother and daughter falling out never being expanded upon, and there was hardly enough chances for breath in the film for the necessary character developments.When there were attempts at the actual story it read like the amateur writing found in the dollar digital bin at your local Amazon site.What could have helped the story was a better written history between Sophie and Diane. In fact, it might have gone stronger if Diane was actually a mental projection of Sophie's depression, or perhaps something she created to deal with the death of her friend, or a combination of both. The possibility to utilize this example was there in the vaguely explained connection between them.You can tell the film's origins from its short counterpart, as the elements that worked here were what made the short strong, and pretty much was the entirety of the short. But unfortunately, the attempt to translate the short into a feature, you do need a decent combination of story and characters outside of the scare element.Though this could be read as utilizing the formula of the slasher film, which in the case of those films was very much about the present experience of the audience, appealing to the squirm, blood thirst, and gross-out with a lack of much story and purposeful blank slate characters to better facilitate the audience overlaying themselves into the experience.In this case, if you replace the element of "Slasher" with jump scare, you would have something very similar, though whether this was the purpose of the film's construction it's hard to say.Overall this was a movie that you watch in the dark with your friends once or twice and enjoy it for the scare and not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mediocre horror flick. It has some decent chills - all of which were shown in the trailer - but it's kind of maddeningly straightforward, like it was a student's first draft in a screen writing class taught by a hack, and he only got a C+ with a note on the last page that said "Good skeleton but needs some flesh." The dialogue in particular is clunky and overly expositional. None of the actors sound very good reading it. To add to that, the whole shadow ghost (but a metaphor) thing has been done plenty, and the film comes off as the dufus little brother of Mama and The Babadook. It is only 81 minutes, though, and it would probably look decent enough compared to a lot of the horror films I'll watch in October.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Lights Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While attending a screening for 2016's Lights Out (my latest review), it felt like I was watching a student horror film or should I say, one of the greatest student horror films ever made. With a tiny budget of $5 million, only a handful of characters, and some efficacious jump scares (despite the fact that they were a bit familiar), "Lights" director David F. Sandberg makes this cinematic debut stylish and rather unsettling. He makes it his own.For what's it worth, Lights Out is old school, nuts and buts movie-making. Its eerie, first 45 minutes reminded me of the fright fandom of yesteryear. Containing a simple concept in which a disturbing, Medusa-like apparition only appears in darkness, "Lights" is for the most part, effective until its novelty loses steam in the final, underwhelming act. This nifty little scare-fest is invariably small scale, a one-trick pony, a ghostly canard. I'm going to recommend it and also praise the raw performance of Maria Bello (a Chicago Film Critics Award winner) which elevates the acting cred of "Lights" to an even higher level.Containing a twist ending I didn't see coming (it all made sense though) and produced by Saw man James Wan, Lights Out introduces us to a new breed of spectral villainy named Diana (she's played by Alicia Vela- Bailey). Diana is a back from the dead mental patient, a unpleasant imaginary friend, and when the lights are off and it's nighttime, she kills people by throwing them around like a sack of potatoes. Throughout the film's short running time (an hour and twenty-one minutes plus credits), Diana terrorizes a small family (Maria Bello as depressed mother Sophie, Teresa Palmer as her daughter Rebecca, and Gabriel Bateman as her son Martin) until they can find a way to stop her.Director Sandberg taking cues from 2013's The Conjuring, plays with his audience by not letting them know when to flinch in their seats or not. My favorite scene overall (spoiler), is when Diana takes out two L.A. cops with loud gunfire blazing. It's something else. Also, I liked the way the actors/actresses reacted with fear in "Lights". I don't wholly agree but most troupers say reacting is even harder than actual acting.Now if I had to pick one flaw in Lights Out, it would be the notion that "dirty" Diana can turn any house light off with her supernatural powers but can't blow out a candle or suck the life out of batteries in a flashlight. Huh? I expected more from a ghoul who speaks like she's smoked four packs of Lucky Strikes, moves from one dark room to another with lightning speed, and hasn't had a manicure in decades. Ha-ha. Anyway, "Lights" isn't the scariest movie ever made but if you're game, it may do for incandescent lighting what Jaws did for not wanting to go in the water. I wasn't entirely affected after I left the theater but as a ten-year old, it would've given me massive nightmares. Rating: 3 stars.</fullReview>

All the actors played their characters well, especially the little boy, which surprised me. The premise of the "monster" in this film is so simple, yet it works. It's full of jump scares yes, but not the "best friend falsely scaring you" ones. I was never once bored in this film. The only real problem I found in this film were the rules sometimes being broken. Something'll happen like a door being shut when the room clearly has lights in it and just small things like that that can be a little distracting while watching it. Despite this though, I had a blast with this film and I recommend you go out and see it, especially since it's rare to see a good horror movie these days!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Lights Out" goes back to the simple pleasures of a scary movie, the way they made them long ago. You put people in a "haunted house" where inexplicable events are happening, but instead of being all scattered and having all kinds of things flying around the place, trashing the furniture, and killing everyone off, leaving a big bloody mess behind, this film focuses on one evil entity and a family in distress.A family has falling into emotional turmoil, with a mother experiencing psychological stress and causing plenty of anxiety to her two children. The younger sibling, a boy, refuses to stay with his mother. She's unstable and weird things are happening in the house, especially when the lights go out.Most of us can identify with his troubles.. When we were young children, one of the scariest situations was going to sleep in a place that was dark, with the worst ones being the areas in the closets or the space under the beds. Most interestingly, the film is relatively quiet, using good use of creaking sounds, doors slamming, thumping noises. There is no unnecessary rain storms, crazy animals or anything of the kind. The camera follows the kids as they try to escape the attacks of Diana, the mysterious entity.There's a connection to their mother, and it is explained during the mid section of the film. It really becomes secondary to the development of events in the house, as more truths come out, and evil keeps intensifying her attacks.The resolution might not please all of us, but it has a definite end, and the film is short, movies quickly, always hitting the right notes for a good, frightful time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights Out is not the most original horror film, but what it does have is a premise that sets it up to be a great compilation of jump- scares, and it achieves just that. So rare it is to find a cliché horror film with the absence of some of the genre's most annoying clichés; there is no stupid character that causes the deaths of any of the other characters, the kid is finally believed by his adult counter-part from the get-go, and the heroine actually feels like someone who you'd want to be beside in a dark room. Overall, Lights Out is a fun and enjoyable horror film, however, you will find little to no substance with the story or expect it to break any new ground in the horror genre. Just gather a bunch of mates, eat some popcorn, and make sure the lights are turned all the way on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Light's Out" tells the story of a family coping with their mother's mental problems and a creature that might be responsible for them. When Martin (Gabriel Bateman) starts experiencing fear out of his mother behavior he calls for help from his sister (Teresa Palmer) who has to step up for her family with her little brother and fight the demons of both past and present.This is one of the best horror films to be released in recent years, it is horror done correctly, it is a film that treats audiences with respect and scares them deeply with unsettling and intelligent imagery, whilst maintaining a high sense of narrative drive and dramatic pathos that ultimately overpower what are the film's minor flaws.What struck me deeply about "Light's Out" is its thematic core. There seems to be a resurgence of motherly fear as a theme in horror movies recently after "The Babdook" brought it back so brilliantly and for now it has worked very well with interesting and original insights in all the movies I've seen touching the subject, this one being one of the very best, with Maria Bello bringing to life some harrowing moments of despair for a mother's call for love from her siblings.But even more than motherly fear, this film is about depression and might I add how genius it treats the theme. The symbolism and metaphoric nature of many elements of the film might be even too explicit, but they never are heavy handed or dull. The filmmakers craft a narrative with deep implications in the theme and what comes out of it is a film that touches the viewer deeply not because of the scares, but because of how truly you feel devastated by what the characters have to go through. It is a deep study of depression and mental illness, it is a fantastic look at how people cope with such things in family and society, but most importantly is is a surprising and brave take on the subject matter, which takes twists and turns without ever loosing you and always maintaining a thematic undercurrent that is riveting and worthy of much reflection.Naturally this is also made possible by the very good characterizations the film has, none resulting banal and someone resulting even surprisingly good: Bret played by Alexander DiPersia isn't your classic dumb boyfriend character, he is injected with an honesty and rawness that isn't unfortunately found too much in horror films which makes it even more pleasant when seen unfolded on the screen. Moreover, all of these people aren't dumb and act like real human beings in the face of such a tragedy. Palmer and Bateman play off each other very well and result really genuine as a brother and sister trying to reconnect.The film could be accused of having a little bit too much to do with jump scares, but one that gives it this critique should first understand how jump scares work and how they can be inserted into a film. David F. Sandberg clearly knows this and he uses the scares not as a gimmick, yet as an intelligent tool to build suspense, scare the characters and so the audience and get under your skin.Where this film has flaws is in its mythology, whilst a lot of it is saved by the thematic undercurrent that explains it, a lot more is simply out of place and the creature haunting the family doesn't end up having any kind of coherent way of being and whilst it remains scary for its psychological effect, the film did cheat the audience multiple times and didn't get away with it.Overall this is a very scary film that had already left deep seeds in my brain, if you want to see a true horror movie I strongly suggest this one over the very underwhelming "Conjuring" franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Expected But Still Just Another Jump Scare Movie At It's Core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to horror movies I personally prefer more psychological scares/thrills rather than movies that just constantly try to get a cheap jump scare out of you. I thought "The Ring" was pretty OK but after that came a string of poorly done (mostly remakes of Asian films) PG-13 Horror films that all had similar stories and similar clichés. For a while we saw a decrease in these types of movies, but recently they have made a comeback and "Lights Out" is one of the newest releases in the "Jump Scare-athon" Genre. Surprisingly though this film actually does do some things very well and managed to exceed my expectations (they weren't really all that high though).I was a big fan of the opening scene, it is spoiled a bit by the trailer but it still did a good job of packing a pretty brutal punch for a PG-13 movie and getting me immediately interested in the movie. From there the pace continues to move very quickly, they do not hold back from showing the Shadow'd baddie multiple times in the first fifteen minutes. The fact that they showed her so often early on did make her less scary but it also made the movie much more entertaining in my opinion. As the story began to unfold I was actually fairly pleased with it, it's not a extremely original story but it does have more depth than stories in these kinds of movies usually do. Then we are introduced to the movie's first big problem, the main character Rebecca (played by Teresa Palmer), she is just so bland and mono toned through out the whole film. Just about every other character in the film is more interesting than her yet she gets the majority of the screen time/lines. Usually in these kinds of movies it's the young child actors who ruin it but honestly I thought the character Martin (played by Gabriel Bateman) was actually done pretty well and succeeded in not being too obnoxious or annoying. The kooky mom (Maria Bello) and the picture perfect boyfriend (Alexander Dipersia) were so-so characters, didn't really add much to the film but also didn't really take anything away from it. Aside from a super bland main character another big problem that the film had was it's pacing. As I mentioned above it does pace itself very well in the beginning, unfortunately from there we are treated to some very long, drawn out, uninteresting scenes that felt unnecessary. The first fifteen minutes are good and the last fifteen minutes are great, however in the in-between was a bit lackluster. The movie is at it's best when Danielle (Shadow'd baddie) is going after people and wreaking havoc, however instead of making those scenes the key points of the film we instead have to sit through a lot of meh jump scares and shotty attempts at character development. Had there been more victims for Danielle to go after I think the film would have been much better, an R rating wouldn't have hurt either. All in all it's really not a bad film for what it is, it does stand out from the other jump scare movies by having some very well done scenes, a pretty OK story, and a few brutal moments for a PG-13 film. But was definitely held back by it's rating, the lackluster small cast, and too many boring scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights out is a refreshing, and imaginative new take on horror that I would recommend to any fan of the genre.Part of what makes this movie scary is how it is all based around a very primal fear ? the dark. The dark is the basis for every scare of the movie, and I would be lying if I said I didn't feel uneasy during my midnight run after the film.Something that this movie does different than many other horror flicks, is that for most of the scares, there is not a lot of build up. A lot of the time, a scene will drag up for so long, building tension, that the scare becomes too predictable. This movie often skipped building up high- tension situations and went straight for the punch. The origin story for Diana doesn't really make to much sense, but it is a horror story, what do you expect? It is not focused on heavily and isn't essential to enjoying the movie.My biggest complaint about the movie is the dialogue. Often a great scare, or a dramatic moment would be ruined by really cheesy, straight forward dialogue, especially coming from the mother, or boyfriend. Sadly this rings true during the peak of movie, with some silly lines coming from the mother ruining what would have otherwise been a clever ending to the story.What I loved most about this movie was how they took from their original short film and built on it so well. The hallway sequence from the short film is used within the first ninety seconds of the feature length film. They expand on this concept creatively using a plethora of devices to ward off Diana throughout the film. One particularly creative moment happens as Diana is approach someone firing a weapon at her.Despite some cheesy dialogue, and weird dramatic moments, Lights out is still a creative and fun new take on horror. I would recommend it to any horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Fun than Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights Out is another example that horror movies today are getting effort again. Yeah, The Conjuring, The Babadook and a few indie horrors have already proved that, but Lights Out would have been just a throwaway concept. Except it fully utilizes its idea and the characters are worth rooting for and actually smart. The allegorical core feels underdeveloped in spite of spending a chunk of its plot devoted to these backstories. The villain isn't so interesting, apart from her abilities and shortcomings. But the final act is worth the payoff. Maybe not much for the ending. Overall, it's a lot of fun than it is scary. For just another trip to the cinema, that's all you need to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light Out Review: Scarefest of Mental Illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights out Directed by David Sandberg is a feature length adaption (or extended version) of a short movie directed by the same man in 2013. Produced by the the one who is the big name in horror industry right now, James Wan. It is easy to identify his influence over the movie, with the use of lighting and slow tension done just like Wan would have done Himself. But The Director cannot reach the boundaries pushed by James Wan with Conjuring and its even better sequel released earlier .That in no way means that the movie is bad. The movie has a couple of brilliant moments when the movie scratches that line of greatness that every horror movie aspires to cross. But if you want to be blown away by the movie, you will be underwhelmed. As the movie is like every other psychological horror movie and gives out nothing new and groundbreaking like The Witch did earlier this year.Lights Out Follows a family in turmoil, they are going through difficult phase, with the mother having continuous bout of depression and after the death of the father, Martin (Younger Son played by Gabriel Bateman) soon finds out that his Mother-Sophie- is not good mentally and she is talking with someone in the shadows. Meanwhile Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) the elder daughter of Sophie (Played by Maria Bello) from his first husband (Who left them) finds out about Sophie's extent of illness and unearths some dark past of his mother. OH and yeah, the father was killed by a monster who lurks in he dark, who cannot enter areas which are lighted and who is also the one responsible for many things.The interesting thing about the movie thus is what i proved above, the monster or the women is a part of the movie, but if you remove the monster you will still have a decent Drama, tackling family issues, Mental Illness and Medical Depression. In an Interview with Screen Junkies last night the cast of Lights out was asked, which movie would 'lights out' would come close to, each cast member answered the same thing- The Babadook. Yes it is blatantly obvious that the Director has tried to make another Babadook, but could not even touch the mark.The direction is to the point and in some scenes quite remarkable, using flickering lights to increase the tense atmosphere and in one scene using flashing neon light to illuminate the dark. The movie is well shot with some beautifully lighted scenes that take you inside the screen. But the movie could not skip from the clichés of horror flicks like the dumb characters, who even after knowing that darkness is where the monster is, will walk into dark corners without doubts. The point that the ghost is affected by a particular frequency light elaborates the nonsensical points in the movie. In some unimportant scenes we can hear sounds coming from brightly lit places, how would she do that if the place is lit like Christmas. The actors has done a decent job, Teresa Palmer and Bateman giving marvelous performance.In the end Lights out is a scary movie that will give you shudders in moments but you would not get feeling of closure. For a horror fan, it is worth it, to watch it with lights out, because it will amaze you . Whether you look at the movie as a metaphor to depression or just a straight forward horror movie, it scratches the mark of greatness, but rests in the 'good' range of horror movies.at www.filmicsite.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many scenes not spent with the threat makes it even less scary than it already is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family is haunted by a "terrifying" figure that only appears when all the light's go out.Notice the word terrifying in the plot summary for this review. Notice how it is in speech marks. Notice how it gives a sense that once again not even I of all people found this horror movie scary. And I didn't, and I don't think anybody in the screening room did either. In total I think there are about two jump scares which are only just effective are barely successful and the reason none of the intended scares are scary is because they are all so predictable and you can see them coming from a mile off. The main threat in the film doesn't actually seem to be very scary and all I could think of when it came on screen was that it looked like a female version of Gollum just with a less extreme hunchback... It's not scary and the same can be said for the film itself. The acting in the film is good and adds a bit of realism to what is a very unrealistic/ dodgy film. One reason that the film isn't majorly scary is the fact that the majority of it is spent away from the scenes of horror and in other places trying to figure out what the actual threat is, where it came from and how to get rid of it, yes some of these scenes are slightly interesting but they go on for too long and just make the creature that is haunting even less scary than it already was. So in the 20 minutes spent in the dark with this threat there are only about two jump scares which are slightly scary despite still being predictable. It just makes it more of a Godsend that it's a short film at 81 minutes. At least it's not as bad ,to the point where it's almost not even laughably bad, and over two hours like this years earlier horror release The Conjuring 2.It's not scary and the threat is like a female version of Gollum with less of a hunchback and the majority of the film is spent in a non-threatening/ safe environment. At least it's not as bad as The Conjuring 2.** &lt;-- Two Stars (Out Of Five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had great potential but didn't live up to the short film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge horror fan and the original Lights Out short film really scared me so my expectations were high - And with James Wan as a producer I had even higher hopes for this one! But unfortunately I don't love this movie as much as many others seem to do.The good things first: The acting is great and so are the characters and the story was pretty good. But this is why I am disappointed: It felt unfinished. I think it would have been great if they had chosen to dig deeper into the story of the Diana character, but the run time of the movie is pretty short and it became a bit rushed to me. The "creature" was also a lot scarier in the short film which disappointed me a bit, but I suppose that's a matter of taste. It seemed like a movie which didn't really know what it wanted to be ? did it want to be a psychological drama with horror elements or a horror movie with a family drama in it? I think if they had chosen to go with the psychological thriller-drama with horror elements it would have been better, the subjects dealt with in the movie are very serious and it would have been interesting to see what they could have done, somewhat like the atmosphere of a movie like The Babadook which is one of my favorite horror movies. To wrap it up ? it's a fine horror movie with lots of potential and some good elements, but it's not great, nor did it scare me that much. Even though this wasn't a favorite of mine I am interested to see more from Sandberg in the future, considering that his shorts films are really creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights Out tells the story of Rebecca(Teresa Palmer) &amp; her younger brother, Martin(Gabriel Bateman). Rebecca finds out that, Martin experiences the same terrifying occurrences that used to haunt her, when she was a child. She is determined to uncover the truth. Rebecca finds out that, there is an extremely dangerous entity that has a connection to her mother, Sophie(Maria Bello). Lights Out is a brilliant film. I am glad director David F. Sandberg made a feature film, based on his excellent short horror movie of the same name. There are quite a few superbly executed jump scares in the film. This movie is engaging right from the word go. The script by Eric Heisserer is very unique, in this age of horror sequels, spin-offs, reboots &amp; remakes. The last half an hour of the film is its highlight. The climax of the movie, will blow you away. The crisp run-time of the film, ensures that the viewer never gets bored. One flaw in this movie is that, there is no suspense element in it. Performance-wise, everyone has done a good job. Teresa Palmer is outstanding as Rebecca. Gabriel Bateman is spectacular as Martin. Alexander DiPersia is great as Bret. Billy Burke is impressive as Paul. Maria Bello is fantastic as Sophie. The supporting cast is awesome. Lights Out is a must watch for all horror movie buffs.

		<shortDescription>Not quite a masterpiece, but genuinely frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As any seasoned fan of fright flicks will tell you, the downside of loving horror is that after a while nothing scares you anymore. You feel like you've seen it all. You roll your eyes when someone goes into the creepy old attic to investigate that strange noise. You're barely even startled when they the medicine cabinet and then when they shut it someone else is in the mirror. When they start walking backwards you just know that someone is going to suddenly appear behind them. Ho-hum.What sets Lights Out apart is that you know things like these are going to happen, and it still scares the life out of you. And scare you way more than anything else you've seen lately. You might not think a movie built around a concept as simple as our natural fear of the dark could be so frightening, but this one is. (How frightening, you ask? Normally when I sit at my desk and write on my Mac I like to have the lights off. Not tonight - all the lights in this room are burning bright!)That said, it isn't just mirrors and lights that make this film such an intense experience - it's the characters. Anyone who has sat through a slasher film learns quickly that if you don't care about the characters, you don't really care if they get cut to pieces. In fact more than once you've probably rooted for them to die ? the stupid jock, the cheating girlfriend, the snooty preppie. They're cardboard characters and there's no love lost when they finally bite the dust; there's no investment.That is definitely not the case in Lights Out. These characters are genuine, flesh-and-blood people; people you've probably met at some point in your life. At its core, this is the story of a troubled family that is one step away from coming apart at the seams. In that regard it reminds me of Stephen King's The Shining (i.e. the novel, not the Kubrick film.) Both works center on families plagued by the all-too-real problems that touch all of us in one way or another during our lives. In King's novel it was alcoholism, while in Lights Out it's mental illness.That's another thing that elevates this film above the rest. Thematically, there's a lot going on underneath the surface: guilt, unresolved trauma, selfishness, alienation, using people to hurt others, poor communication, the stigma of mental illness. This is what really gets under your skin, and all the elements come together in a hurricane of fear in the final act. To be sure, the film is not perfect. After a promising first reel, the story struggles a bit to find its footing. The editing seems a bit jerky; I got the feeling there were scenes left on the cutting room floor that would've made the narrative flow better. That's why, as much as I enjoyed the movie, I settled on a 7/10 rating. Even so, these flaws are forgotten once the film really gets moving.Put another way, Lights Out is like a freight train. It starts off a bit slow, gradually picks up momentum, and then suddenly it's barreling away at full speed. Before you know it, you're holding on for dear life; you know what's up ahead at that next bend in the tracks, but you're powerless to stop it. And worst of all, it's coming at you so darn FAST.This was the first time in a long time that I have been genuinely scared by a horror film. Last year's It Follows was a creepy good time, but its scares were, well, more of a creeping terror. If that film was a firecracker, Lights Out is an M80, just waiting for you to light the fuse. Even if you think you've seen it all when it comes to horror, you'll want to see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jump scare, decent story but cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer horror is scarce, and James Wan dominates it, producing this jump-scare flick directed by David F. Sandberg. The story strays away from the issue of mental health though it skirts around it, and pushes more towards the gimmick scare of the dark. The issue with a film that relies on darkness is that viewers still have to see it, so the screen can never go pitch black leading to some confusing. Martin (Gabriel Bateman) is a young boy stuck with his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) as she copes with her manic moods. Bateman delivers the best performance as a young actor, he's the smartest character and shares his terror with the audience. The older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) is dragged into the family's traumas and she starts to investigate her mother's strange behavior with the help of her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the concept of the movie 'Lights Out', but the way the story was told was a bit unfulfilling. I don't particularly care much about the characters. Not enough time was spent on telling their back-stories, so I wasn't really emotionally invested in them. A snippet of how the entity came about was too short and not explicit enough to have an impact on me. For a good horror flick, I need gory details, which this movie is lacking. And the suspense wasn't long enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. It did have some jump-scare moments, though. A better director or screenwriter would have done wonders for this movie.I do like the ending. It was touching and sad. I wish there were more moments like that throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short and sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By horror movie's standards, I think that's the best way to sum up my experience with this film.They really shaved any corners that were needed to beef up the time. Keep in mind that doesn't just make it an extended version of the short; there was an actual story in this, and I think that's what made this movie good. Compared to my favorite PG-13 horror film The Ring, they try to establish a connection between the main characters and the mystery at bay, and for the most part it works very well to mold a relationship that we have with the characters and they have with each other. Though if I were to compare it to The Ring, it doesn't touch it for one big reason, but I won't get into it for spoiler reasons.It's funny though that most horror movies have their scary parts happen when it's at night or darker... and obviously this movie is the closest to not being an exception that you can get. As you know the one- trick pony that this movie relies on for scare tactics. It is not always jump scares, but they are pretty effective nonetheless. They almost become a bit redundant up until one seemingly very long and drawn out scene where "build-up" is the scare name. This is by far the best scene of the film, as it is about 25 minutes of pure intensity. Before you know it, just when you might feel the movie is only halfway over, it finds a way toward a conclusion, and gets you out of that theater. I think in this case less was more, and it ended at the right time. If they want to do more with it, they can save it for a sequel (though I wouldn't really advocate for one).I don't normally think we have to qualify actors in horror movies for Oscar awards, but I didn't think the child actor was very good... I don't mean with being scared, I mean when speaking in general. It looked like he was acting, basically. I liked the main actress though (Teresa Palmer). Looks like a pretty version of Kristen Stewart, but seems to limit her range to that stoic kind of low. It seemed to work for this flick. I'll have to see her in more films. At the very least, I cared about them. They all seemed like "smart" characters too, not doing too many stupid things where you have to talk to the screen (outside of the occasional "Why are you going TOWARD the creepy noise??" instances).This movie is swimming pretty around 80% on RT for a reason: the critics liked it more than they didn't. It was a fun concept, and as I said it took the original short and maintained the brevity for the feature film as well. It's by no means of the scariest movies I have seen, nor will it make me be afraid to turn off my lights at night either. Also, if anything this movie's evil spirit really wanted to spread a message about going green! :p Anyway, probably more of a rental than shelling out your hard-earned money for, because you're not missing out on anything that you haven't seen from a horror film before, other than doing it right and often during its own run time. Don't expect anything after the credits either. Last thing to mention: for a PG-13 movie, it was able to get away with a couple of graphic moments. Nothing too unsettling, but I was surprised all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent little horror film with heart and a solid message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 has been a great year for first time directors. Earlier this year, Dan Trachtenberg brought us the brilliant, suspenseful thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane (whilst the ending of the film is debatable, the rest of it was an amazing, character driven piece), Tim Miller delivered the goods with a certain potty-mouthed anti-hero which grossed north of $700 million worldwide and Ilya Naishuller directed the superb Hardcore Henry which was vastly underseen (go out and buy the Blu-Ray, seriously. You've never seen Sharlto Copley quite like this and it was the most fun I've had in at the movies since Mad Max: Fury Road). I'm pleased to say that Lights Out director, David F. Sandberg joins this mob of directors and has brought us an excellent, tense and thriller film with Lights Out.The film follows Rebecca (played the beautiful Australian actress Teresa Palmer) and Martin (played by the excellent Gabriel Bateman) attempting to understand why a demon keeps pursuing them and to get to the bottom of their mother, Sophie's (Maria Bello) depression. The film does a great job of delving into the dangers of depression whilst also delivering some genuinely creepy scares. I've seen quite a few horror films and can confidently say this this film features one of the most frightening ghosts in a long time. To be fair, the trailers made the film look like your everyday, generic ghost story, but Lights Out uses the ghost as a metaphor showing the audience the type of darkness that can manifest within the mind of someone dealing with depression. The cast are all excellent, with Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Batman getting the lion's share of screen time. Bateman in particular is an excellent child actor - after last years "Room", it's tough to beat Jacob Tremblay but Bateman comes close. Sandberg frames the film pretty well, utilising the genre tropes to maximum effect. That being said, it is obvious that James Wan has had quite an influence with this film. Being the Producer of the film, there are signature Wan techniques such as creating a tension filled atmosphere and the excellent use of lighting.However, the premise of the film is confusing at times. The rules created within the film are that the ghost, known as Diana, cannot appear in light (it is revealed later during the film that when she was alive she suffered from a rare skin condition which made her extremely sensitive to light). During some moments, there are scenes where she appears within barely lit rooms or lights are illuminating her. It begs the question, at what point is it too dark for her to appear? This might be a minor gripe, but the film plays a little too fast and loose with the premise. Another downside is one of the genre tropes - where horror film characters continually make illogical decisions. As I said before, Sandberg uses the tropes well, but this is a negative trope which is hated in most horror films. For example, characters are constantly wandering into dark rooms without turning lights on, knowing full well that there is a spectre out to get them or, as another example, when a character gets trapped in a room and her only source of light is out, she doesn't attempt to open the curtains (it is established that it is daytime). Little things like these are minor annoyances in an otherwise excellent film.Lights Out is a brilliant little horror film which may be overshadowed by the bigger horror film on the block this year (The Conjuring 2). However, this is a horror film with a message and some genuine scares with terrific performances. I give Lights Out a 7/10.</fullReview>

I don't enjoy most horror movies but this was definitely an exception. You can read the movie and predict what parts will scare you but this movie will keep you guessing how you will be scared. This is one of the best scary moves I have seen and is probably the second best horror movie since The Conjuring. James Wan, who directed the Conjuring, is a producer on this film. The film is well directed and is the type of scare that will make you jump out of your seat. Absolutely worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few bad elements spoiled an otherwise decent horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***I hardly ever write reviews, but when a movie has promise but is largely spoiled by a few avoidable details, then I hope that the feedback is somehow noted by the screenwriter and director. The film has a fair premise that an evil entity can only be seen and harm others when the lights are out. The acting is primarily good and characters such as Martin (the little brother) and Bret (his sister's boyfriend) are quite likable. There are suspenseful moments, but for me the scary tone of the movie was spoiled by silly elements such as the voice recording of "Diana" in the mental institution as a young girl. During this recording Diana has a masculine, guttural, demonic voice, which just seemed ridiculous, given that she was supposed to have been a young girl with some type of porphyria and severe behavior problems. I guess the implication is that she was already possessed, but this same over-done voice is used in later parts of the film and always seemed to ruin the tension for me. The "treatment" attempted at the mental hospital apparently electrocutes and kills Diana, and now she can only live through mentally ill Sophie (the mother played a touch over-dramatically by Maria Bello) with whom she formed a connection when Sophie was also placed at the institution as child. Adult Sophie continues to experience bouts of depression, delusions and hallucinations, during which Diana is able to manifest in areas of darkness. The movie lost more credibility during the scene in which big sister Rebecca has a flashback to her childhood and remembers Diana stealing a picture she had been coloring of her family. The fact that Diana took a black crayon (or charcoal), scratched out members of the family, drew herself in as a stick figure and wrote her name in, just seemed absurd. Anyway, it appears that Sophie's mental state must have improved for a while, because Diana disappears for a prolonged stretch of time until Sophie's next extended episode of psychotic symptoms. In the last portion of the film, Rebecca is exploring the dark basement of the family home with a black light and discovers tormented messages that Diana has written on the walls in what I am assuming is some sort of other-worldly ectoplasm. This seemed to be a poorly executed and unnecessary attempt to explain Diana's emotional state to the audience, just in case we hadn't picked up on it already. OK- we got it. Diana is angry that she is trapped in darkness and wants to get rid of Sophie's family so she can be with Sophie all the time. I will give props to the Director for the gutsy ending, instead of neatly allowing everyone to survive unscathed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché But it Gets the Job Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lights Out is a horror film based on a video short written and directed by David F. Sandberg. In the film a family is stalked by a ghostly entity seemingly made real and deadly by the deteriorating state of mind of the family's matriarch (Bello). In desperation, the young son, Martin (Bateman) recruits the help of his long absent half-sister in order to simultaneously save their mother from madness and put an end to the specter dubbed Diana.The film is a compendium of clichés all sprouting out of the haunted house genre complete with jump scares and a bad case of BDS (Bad- Decision Syndrome). What makes Lights Out a cut above some of this year's lesser horror flicks is it's ghost or rather the rules in which it functions and operates. Unlike other specters that creep into the dark recesses turning over candles and books, this little nasty can come out and grab you though only under the cover of shadow and darkness.Under such restraints (or excess depending on your disposition) the film succeeds in snatching a few choice scares from its audience. Gabriel Bateman does a commendable job as the scared but sincere pre-teen whose nights have been haunted by her mothers "friend". Maria Bello is equally solid performing the thankless, uphill bromide that is the over-broad psychotic who is just barely keeping together. I feel like it's become a sadly common trope to have talented actresses no longer "in their prime" make appearances in horror movies as the plucky haunting victim or the brittle waif turned bloodthirsty doppelganger. One need only go back to the recent The Babadook (2014) to see what I mean.Teresa Palmer and Alexander DiPersia fair poorly however as the main protagonist and permanently sidelined boyfriend. DiPersia, while proving at various times to be resourceful as a character, can't help but feel like an out-of-place amateur among actual actors. Palmer has the opposite problem; she can act but the story gives her little to do but change the curvature of her brow from one of fright or one of indignation. We get very little in the story to get us into the character's head space. There's animus between mother and daughter but we never really know why; there's a reluctance to closeness but we never know why; there's an Avenge Sevenfold poster in her apartment, but we never know dear God, why!Yet the million dollar question at the end o the day is, does this film work as a horror film? In other words, does it scare? Yes it does. Sure it's not as intellectually stimulating as The Witch (2015) and sure it's littered with clichés. There are a few indulgences of modern horror that can be irksome: unearned jump scares, a stentorian score and a third act that paints itself in such a corner that it literally writes plot reveals on the wall. Yet Lights Out ultimately works. It slides by on its creativity, its economy and moments that are not just spooky but heart-in-your-chest level scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly executed, gimmicky horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>016 seems like the year of gimmicky horror movies. We had 'Hush' where the main character was completely deaf. Than this one, where the antagonist can only move in the darkness. And later this year we'll get 'Don't Breathe'. Which has the villain be completely blind. I'm not calling out the concepts of these movies because I think these ideas are pretty cool. But so far both 'Hush' and this film were very poorly executed movies. But lets talk about this movie. It follows one family that seems to be haunted. A women that lurks in the shadows is antagonizing this family but, again, only the shadows. She can't go into the light for some reason.The film tries to explain her behaviors in a way that would make sense and not be overly confusing yet it ends up being just the opposite. It's an easy concept to get behind for sure. A lady that can't movie in light. Okay, that makes sense. But then the movie breaks those rules. Over and over again.There's a scene where we hear a knock at a door and when it's answered, of course, there's no one there. But the hallway was totally lit, so how did she do that? Than in less than ten seconds we hear scratching in the closet inside our main characters apartment. But the apartment was completely lit, so how did she get there?How was she able to get all the way through the well lit apartment and into the closet? We see that she is basically omnipotent and can manipulate her surrounds to her will. So why didn't she just turn the lights in the apartment off and then go into the closet? After seeing the film it still doesn't make any sense as to why she is there in the first place, but this would at least play along with the rules set up by the universe.I mean there's literally a scene where she shuts the lights in an entire house off all at once. I wouldn't be focusing on this so hard if it weren't a major factor in the movie, but it is. Aside from this overly confusing and needlessly convoluted monster there is virtually nothing else in the movie. We learn a little about this families back story through a few mindless exposition scenes but thats not character development.The only thing we know about our main character is that she is a metal head and has a boyfriend. And she's our main character. If the person taking up nearly all the run time is this two dimensional and uninspired how can the side characters get any decent treatment? But the real shining moments of this movie are in the third act. When the crap hits the fan.That is where we realize that the films gimmick is not actually scary at all, it's hilarious. Not only does it makes no sense but the villains back story and motive is completely ludicrous. No spoilers but I guess the way she became the way she is, is by her exploding or something and being really really clingy. That's pretty much it for our central antagonist. Considering the short that this film was based on and that the same director did both, this should have been far better. The short was unique, original, and pretty effective for only being three minutes long. Aside from the gimmick, this movie is so sub standard and cliché that it was impossible to get invested in. Not one single moment landed for me at all. Not one single jump scare in this jump scare heavy movie landed for me at all.It may have a couple great performances and a few cool moments, but this is one of the most tired horror movies to release this year. It's overly cliché, two dimensional, totally incomprehensible, and uninvolving. If you want to see a good horror flick just forget about seeing this movie. Rewatch 'The Shining' for the hundredth time, just steer clear of this pile of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Creepy Things Lurk when the Lights Go Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When things go bump in the night and the amount of light is limited at best, your imagination plays tricks on you. Often we perceive the worst thing lurking in the shadows, waiting to wrap its tendrils, claws, or whatever appendage around your body and finish you off. Well a short film project by David Sandberg laid the groundwork for a major motion picture that plays off of that fear. Welcome to another Robbie's movie reviews and today we focus on the latest horror film to grace the theaters entitled Lights out. Lets get started!The GOOD: ? The story ? Teresa Palmer ? The creepinessSurprise, surprise, we actually have a horror movie with a plot this weekend. Lights out writers were able to craft a tale that had a little more depth than some of its fellow scare thrillers. One part digging into the past and another part progressing forward, Lights out does a nice job of balancing both sides of the coin during its short ninety minutes. The pace of the story is set nicely for most of the movie, though it does skip on the details sometimes that added the corny edge to it. For once, I wish the movie was a little longer so that we could explore a little more into the past (primarily Rebecca's story). Those details could have added a little more depth and uniqueness to the tale and perhaps robbed the cheesiness we saw. Fortunately, the lovely Teresa Palmer's acting enriches the story. She hasn't had the greatest roles, but this movie worked with her. Her edginess, sincerity, and attitude all mixed well to craft a character that was easy to latch onto and root for. Yeah some of the writing was a little corny at times, and her tough girl attitude was cute to see as she took on the spirit. Regardless, she played the mature, older sister very well and carried the movie. Her supporting cast only further supported her talent with Gabriel Bateman and Alexander Dipersia making an excellent pair to bring the tale to life. In regards to the scare factor though, Lights Out's strongest aspects is the creepy level. The trailers speak the truth when it says it makes your nightmares come to life. For me the shadows and feeling abandoned in the dark were the biggest thing to freak me out, especially in the realistic environments this movie takes place in. Seeing Diana (the ghoul in this movie) emerge from the shadows in her misshapen form only further sending a chill across my skin. All these factors build an epic suspense and heighten your fear of what lurks in the dark. But?The BAD ? Lackluster Scares ? The endingDespite all the build up and being stuck in the shadows, the actual jump scares were lacking for my friends and me. Most things involved the abrupt start of music and became very predictable in what tactic they would use. Perhaps it was due to Diana not doing much, or maybe they just couldn't keep things fresh enough, but the scares were missing in some sense for me. Therefore, those looking to have themselves frightened to the point of peeing their pants are out of luck. Oh well, the creepiness will linger in your mind longer to tell the truth. And despite all the good of the story, there were still some things that needed a little tightening up to get the full effect. As mentioned the pace is a little rushed, the background stories are lacking, and the lines are cornier than a maze in the fall. However, it is the ending that made me sigh in disappointment. After a prolonged, semi-exciting battle against Diana, the ending occurs rather bluntly. Yes it had some emotional fervor behind it, and it will make my more dark hearted audience members reel in delight. I just wish it had more kick behind it instead of the compromise we got. My guess is the fast pace led to the abrupt ending, either that or they couldn't think of anything to finish out the fight in that epic manner (a.k.a Star Wars Episode III). Whatever the reason, the ending wraps things up and could be vague enough to allow for another sequel to grace the screen. The Verdict:Lights out is certainly not the most original ghost story we've received. However, it still has the edge, presentation, and story to put this movie on an upper shelf of horror quality. In terms of scare factor, again the creepiness will leave you afraid to venture into the dark, but its not going to leave your hair white anytime soon. However, in terms of intriguing tale it definitely gets points in this category for me. Is it worth a trip to the theater? In my opinion?not really, and your money would be better spent on say Star Trek this weekend. My scores are: Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid debut horror flick, with some strong concepts and a somewhat scary creature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lights Out" is a horror film directed by David F. Sandberg, and is based on his 2013 short film of the same name.In a suburban home, a boy named Martin is threatened by a supernatural presence that keeps him up all night. His older sister, Rebecca, visits after hearing from his school about problems he says he's having at home, where he lives with their mentally unstable mother. Martin tells of a strange creature that only appears in the shadows, and shies away from any lights. These events lead Rachel to believe that the monster she saw when growing up might have been more than just a figment of her imagination.Director's Sandberg's first feature film is a decent enough horror picture. What distinguishes it from other "boogymen" pictures of this variety is the attention he gives to crafting solid scares for the audience. The movie doesn't rely too heavily on cheap jump scares, but instead goes for more thought out ones, though the creepiness of the creature can become a bit tiring as the movie goes along, since we're explained the concept of monster from the get-go, so any mysteries that are revealed about its origins are more like interesting tidbits, that aren't anything really revelatory or shocking. The family relationships between the mother and her two children provide some interesting dynamics, with older daughter Rebecca leaving her home to get away from Sophie because of mental illness (convincingly portrayed by Maria Bello), and possibly her careless parenting. Teresa Palmer is a fine young actress, as is Gabriel Bateman, who plays young Martin. The movie also does well to play against typical horror tropes. Here the boyfriend character isn't just a accessory to the protagonist to just end up getting needlessly slaughtered early on, like in other pictures. Alexander DiPersia as Bret, Rebecca's boyfriend, is supportive, and actually helpful when things get awry. A refreshing change of pace, all things considered.The concept of "Light's Out" may have been better realised in short form, but David F. Sandberg is a director of great potential, especially if he can make more interesting ideas like with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ugh worth watching! The begging was great. A ghost stalks a guy at work, and the special effects create a good fright. The characters of Rebecca and her boy friend are like able, but dysfunctional. One understands the dysfunctional characters more as the movie dives into the mentally ill mother and the father which left. There is a hint of a social commentary/theme of the missing male in the house. Lights Out starts great but becomes another evil spirit attached to the victims movies. The characters have to discover the past and how to ex-spell the evil. Predictable by the numbers ghost story. Ugh okay to watch, but not a great film. Six out of ten screams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic horror film with some added fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this really has spoilers exactly but I'm putting up the warning just in case. So I can't hold my opinion down too much as I constantly kept yelling at some ten year-olds who distracted me from this film quite a bit. However from what I took it wasn't bad. Keeping this short and simple. The acting; I loved, absolutely. When characters actually gasp or jump at things that characters in normal movies don't, just shows that the actors and writers wanted the characters to feel real which made the film feel more real. The film editing, color, transitioning, just everything was good. The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the story. Truthfully most horror films have so many of the same clichés. This film had the scratching on wood, door handle being shaken violently, fear of the dark, fear of under the bed, slitting up, walking backwards into an unseen darkness, and so forth. I've just seen too many horror movies to find this one scary personally.Along with the story I did try and figure out who would die and things of that nature and I was wrong which I liked. Also that people did die considering it's a trend for pg-13 films recently. It's not that people need to die for a film to be good but it adds that intensity and nervousness that the characters on screen are actually in some amount of danger. But again the film was good. For most people I would imagine it's scary. My wife is the biggest chicken I know and she was certainly scared. The story was kind of basic in my opinion but good acting glues a film together. I would say this is worth the ticket price. DON'T watch the trailer first if you haven't already. Always makes the movie better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lights Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film about a family stalked by a vindictive ghost? Yawn. But... one moment! Lights Out ended up being better than the average. The situation is established with quickness and eloquence from the prologue, in which we see the main character's father facing an entity which only appears in the dark. Director David F. Sandberg earned fame with the short film Lights Out, and he expanded it to a full-length movie with the support of the studio New Line Cinema ("the house Freddy built"). I found the result very entertaining, despite some arbitrary rules from the ghost and its moderately confusing origin. Besides of its creative concept, the main pro of Lights Out lies on its gradual increment of tension and anguish, along with the solidly written characters, something which is complemented by the credible performances from the whole cast. Sandberg generates good levels of suspense, and he employs frights which are consistent with the premise of the film; in other words, Lights Out is full of "jump scares", but they are an integral part of the story, instead of desperate tricks to simulate fear where there isn't. I also have to mention Marc Spicer's "real" cinematography; despite many scenes in almost total darkness, everything is perfectly clear thanks to the visual style and the ingenious effects of the ghost. So, in conclusion, Lights Out isn't a great movie, but I liked it pretty much, and that makes it worthy of a recommendation. By the way, Sandberg has other short films published on his Vimeo page (I liked Closet Space very much), and I wouldn't be bothered to see them adapted into full-length movies, as long as they also display the same care to respect the basic requirements of the horror genre: good handling of the fear to the unknown and pleasant characters accompanying us during the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you loved Conjuring, if you love Japanese style horror flicks this is the one for you. The best horror movies are the ones where you don't actually see the ghost. And that's where this movie strikes. It was s**t scary for most of the people I went to see the movie with. A very good script, very good acting, nice VFX adds to the pros. Only con I would point out is a bit unnecessary use of sounds to give the pang. I feel it would have been better without.Overall a very nice ride for the ones looking for textbook horror movies.P.S. It is high time scriptwriters should understand that ghosts aren't electrical engineers. They make me feel I have studied all in vain. :p</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>be afraid of the dark when the lights go out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of those movie freaks who cuddles up and cajoles a valiant effort especially from new filmmakers. David Sandberg is one of them. When I came across this movie and got to know that there was a short film already on that I immediately watched it. And I knew the world should welcome this talented filmmaker with open hands. I lived what James Wan did with insidious and conjuring series. And he should be appreciated for realizing the potential of Sandberg and he doesn't fail to live up to it.I will come right to the point just like David did with the movie.Lights out has wonderful casting. Teresa Palmer probably has the role of her lifetime. Not only effortlessly pulling off gorgeous looks, she does also while being this tender, caring sister and daughter with a tormented past. Bateman though keeps a same expression whenever he sees the ghost and while being terrified. But he is apt. Maria Bello with those dark circles underneath eyes as psychologically influenced mother of two again with a troubled past soars above rest in whatever screen time she gets. DiePersia as Bret again keeps company with Palmer in a blink and you miss moments role. He gives the much needed comic relief throughout. And finally as Diane, the light fearing demon, played by Alicia Vela-Bailey (a stunt actress), is athletic to say the least if not as intimidating while looking in light than when lights are out.Above Palmer, who is there right throughout the movie, Sandberg manages to tell a metaphysical demon's story and the family it troubles and scares the living daylights out of them in a most frightening and shortest way possible without compromising on any of the commercial elements required to relax the audience. For me the greatest joy was watching the movie in theater with an audience who shrieks, shouts, gasps and haunted by the ghost and its activities and applauds and shouts out to the smartness displayed by the cast, especially in the second half. Credit goes to Sandberg again for engaging with the audience and keeping them on the edge of their seats. Despite taking inspiration from The Babadook, Mama and Hollow Man, Sandberg's story feels very original and the plot as intriguing as it should be for a horror movie. No wonder the makers of Annebelle 2 have entrusted him to be at the helm. With Eric Heisserer who himself has an impressive CV with the likes of The Thing and A Nightmare on Elm Street to his writing credits and an excellent cast (that probably trusted the director, a rarity) Lights Out does the act that is lost with horror genre, a self sustaining drum roll finish to an excellent prelude. A blip or a downfall, I could point out is the demon itself. Biggest plus for the movie is its biggest minus. Blame it on the make up or the utter negligence, Diana looks yuck while watching under lights. Without it, she is something else. However, David treads the line carefully by just showing her in the shadows and let our minds conjure up the image. Which brings me to the technical aspect of the film. Marc Spicer cradling the camera shows obvious experience after working with Wan in Furoius 7 (Wan has really lent his everything to this movie). Benjamin Wallfisch providing the most important aspect to horror movies, the background music. It is just where it is required. I really loved the BGM when Rebecca (Palmer) encounters Diane under the neon lights in her room. Small things like these go a long way in making a movie that really depends on technical and directorial skills and cast performance and not much on backstory and explanation.I would give a solid 8/10 to Sandberg's first full fledged movie and while expecting similar goose bump and jump from seat ride. After Lights Out I'm more intrigued to watch Sandberg other short films (Attic Panic, Closet Space)and only wish there will be production houses will come out with grander versions of it, with him at the helm only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights Out (2016): Dir: David F. Sandberg / Cast: Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Alexander DiPersia, Maria Bello, Billy Burke: Like The Conjuring and its sequel we are given another triumphant horror film where good vanquishes evil. This one regards facing fears and stars Gabriel Bateman as a young boy startled at night by demonic images as well as his mother talking to her unseen friend Diana. Teresa Palmer plays his grown half sister who arrives to pick him up when another episode occurs. Before long she to is faced with blackened images of Diana who seems to haunt wherever and whomever comes between her and their mother. Palmer believes Bateman because she saw the images when she was young and it resulted in the death of her father. The film opens effectively with Billy Burke playing step-dad who is mangled by Diana at work. Diana's secret is that she needs the dark and fears the light and can apparently make lights turn off. Maria Bello plays their mother who has a past of mental illness and depression. She is affected by Diana after they initially hooked up at a hospital. She is estrange from her daughter but wants desperately to connect with her son but Diana does not like to share. Alexander DiPersia as Palmer's boyfriend is a surprise in the sense that he is written totally opposite then what our first impressions might be. Director David F. Sandberg makes creepy use of lighting while the bizarre image of Diana add to the tone. In the end it is silly but fun leaving viewers with their lights on and eyes open before that dark shadow looms any closer. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality scares.. but that's it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason my rating is higher than a 5/10 is because of the scares this film delivers. Sandberg has created an idea that most of the audience can relate to, and that's being afraid of the dark. The main antagonist, Diana, only shows up when there are no lights on inside the homes of Rebecca and Sophie. The film has you holding your breath whenever the lights go out, expecting the ominous, breathtaking creature to show up somewhere in the room. As an audience, we don't see much of Diana's actual appearance until the end of the movie. Hiding the details of her skin kept us on the edge of our seats, for we didn't want to see what she actually looked like.As for the acting, mechanics, plot line, and execution, Lights Out didn't leave a lasting impression like other great horror films. As each incident occurred, we don't see true terror in the eyes of Rebecca and Martin, as if they expect everything going on and are just caught off guard when Diana comes around. We see our three characters near the end of the film; Rebecca, Martin, and Bret, walking around in the threatening shadows of the house without much fear.All in all, this film deserves a sequel because of the scare tactics. Hopefully some of the other problems are cleaned up by the time the second movie is released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'LIGHTS OUT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Supernatural horror flick; about a violent spirit, which can't survive in the light, that's stalking a young woman and her brother. The film was produced by horror master James Wan, and it was directed by first time feature filmmaker David F. Sandberg. It was written by Eric Heisserer, and it's based on Sandberg's 2013 short film (of the same name). The movie stars Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello, Alexander DiPersia and Billy Burke. It's surprisingly received (mostly) good reviews from the critics, and it's also performed admirably well at the Box Office (so far). I enjoyed it.The movie tells the story of a young woman, named Rebecca (Palmer). Rebecca learns that her unstable mother (Bello) is off her medication again. Her brother, Martin (Bateman), is struggling at school because of it; due to the fact that he's getting very little sleep. Rebecca brings Martin home to her house, and she soon learns that he's being haunted by an evil spirit; which can only survive in the dark.The film is a little clichéd, and routine (in story); but it's also really well made, and filled with great haunting imagery. The concept (of a ghost that can't survive in the light) plays out really well, in frightening imagery. The film is scary, and the performances are all decent (except for maybe the young boy). The fact that the script, and characters, might be a little poorly written, doesn't effect the suspense quality of the movie. If you're looking for good scares, that's probably what you'll get.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally!A really enjoyable horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We haven't had anything like Lights out in recent years. Sure we had some great horror movies, but those were either much more dramatic (The Conjuring) or much more like a dark fairy tale (Crimson Peak), rather than a good, "just-for-fun" horror movie.Lights out is exactly that. It does not take itself too seriously, and bravely balances on the edge of horror and comedy, just like Drag me to hell did a few years ago.Of course it has a dark backstory about a girl, Diana who died a terrible death, and now came back to h(a)unt everyone who tries (or at least she thinks that)to separate her and her bff,a little lunatic mom who is portrayed by Maria Bello. The main characters are her children, Rebecca and Martin, who are Diana's No.1 targets for the main part of the movie. The young actors are great, and the characters are likable, finally you will actually care about them instead rooting for the bad guy (or girl, this time) to kill'em all.Do not put your expectations too high though. You will have a great deal of fun, but do not expect a movie that will overwrite the whole genre of horror from the basics.One jump scare follows the previous one, and sort of that's about the scary part. You almost saw them all in the trailers already, still they work as they are done very well. Do not ask yourself why people will click the lights over and over again until the creepiest thing of all times will jump on them, instead of running. Do not ask how Diana, who suffers from the smallest light can approach Becca's apartment at the end of a well-lit corridor. Really just lean back and enjoy the ride.Aside of the well choreographed jump-scare scenes the film's atmosphere is not dark at all, it is full with heartwarming and even funny little moments.All in all, Lights out is not an instant classic, but is very good, and one of the most enjoyable horror movies of recent years. Go for it! (and borrow some reflectors from Batman, just in case)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>impressive fx make for freaky film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a supernatural film worth watching and worth making it to theaters. For starters I'll say I am a horror fan even though Supernatural films typically bore me with their usual dark spirit trapped in our world cause of unfinished business crap. Anyway having said that, this is another ghost unwilling to cross over tale. I'll assume you know the summary so I will say I did think the backstory behind Diana was a little lame. The condition she had was known as porphyria or the "vampire disease" where those who suffer from it receive skin blisters from UV light. Which begs the question why would doctors want to expose her to more light to "cure" her? It's not like in Darkness Falls where the kid was afraid of the dark so the therapist said let's put him in the dark so he'll get over it. Her condition was physical not mental. Though I did think it was a nice touch as to why she doesn't like the light. It's never explained why Diana becomes obsessed with their mother or why for that matter if she was a child when she died why does she appear as a woman now? Also why does their mother need to be off her meds for Diana to be there it makes her seem schizophrenic which she is not since her kids see Diana too so that was a bit off. But really you can't deny the impressive effects of this film. I've never seen anything like it and I have to admit when I got home the first thing I did was turn on the lights. I think it's the best horror movie I've seen in quite some time especially out of the ones actually making it to theaters like The boy and The Forest to name a couple which were both incredibly boring with crap story lines so although lights out had some story flaws it had some undeniably scary moments that I very much so appreciated. I don't scare easy but this creeped me out. Also obviously if you've seen Darkness Falls and liked it you'll like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made horror film with an original plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was walking into the theater I had high expectations of or this movie, the thing about Lights Out, is they start the action way too early. Within the first five minutes of the movie people in the theater started to jump. Lights Out also relies on jump scares to scare the audience.One thing about this movie is it does have an original plot with hardly any clichés, and that's what drew me to this movie it wasn't some shitty slasher movie that had already been done thousands of times.This move is mildly violent and pretty terrifying for small children, so if you're kids are fine with scary movies they should be able to watch it because the violence really isn't an issue. there is one scene where you see a bong in a woman's apartment, but a 10 year old kid won't even know what that is. They say b**ch and sh*t once in a while, but that's pretty much it the language isn't really an issue. Don't listen to the crap on common sense of media that says you should be 15 to watch this movie. I think you should be 10 or 11 to see this move if you are fine with horror.One of The only big things wrong with this movie is the fact that they rely on jump scares to scare people, a good horror movie stays with you once you levee the theater</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Child fears in a new "light".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the short film by David F. Sandberg "Lights out" is a fun summer time-waster, or at least that's what i thought it would be. The story is a bit hard to understand and follow at the beginning of the movie. We are introduced to the "remains" of once a healthy and happy family that is now terrorized by one of the family's members past. The main perspective, that we witness, is mainly by the children Rebecca and Martin and their struggle with the family problems and the horror that surrounds them. Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman played their parts equally well and i did feel for them, which is a great start for a horror movie.The whole scare effect is pretty simple. The light is your friend. An idea that we are familiar with since little. This movie brings exactly that inner horror of what is in the darkness. What we cant see but it is there. The movie had some chilling moments playing with shadows and lights. The balance between those two was very intense and to be honest surprisingly creative. There were a couple of jump scares in the movie, that were nothing unseen before and i think that the movie knew this and did not capitalize on them a lot.The monster/creature had a riveting story but i felt that it needed a bit more clarification in some aspects. What was given as an explanation was enough to continue the development of the plot and keep your interest.I liked how the characters in the story were not helpless and actually thinking about their well-being. They knew what was happening and had an idea how to protect themselves. Those are some simple survival mechanics that made the experience more engaging.Intriguing plot. Great ambiance. Good performances by the actors. Thats all you need for an entertaining horror movie. If you are a fan of the genre i strongly recommend you to see "Lights out".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . Warner Bros. has released an easily deciphered warning concerning America's 2016 Election Cycle. LIGHTS OUT tells us that we have "nothing to fear but fear itself," as the Good U.S. Political Party has been telling us for nearly a century. But the Rich People Party has succeeded in ruling through intimidation, fear-mongering, and tall-tale telling. This has caused nearly all of their weak-minded dupes to be driven beyond the Edge of Madness, becoming pill-popping, gun-toting Crazies, just like "Sophie" (Maria Bello) in LIGHTS OUT. (Boot camp graduates are particularly susceptible to this, as the two Real Life mass-shooting cop killers so far this summer were both decorated U.S. "war heroes.") Sophie proves her Evil--which also kills a couple cops--was all in her head, as every threat is neutralized when she blows her brains out. Warner clearly is urging America to lock up ALL the fear-driven, gun-toting, Crazy Trumpsters BEFORE Election Day--and, Heaven Forbid, DON'T LET THEM VOTE! Otherwise, we're all doomed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im convinced that some people need massive amounts of gore to enjoy a horror flick. This one isn't too gory but still manages to turn out with a good result. Its refreshing to see a horror movie that isn't overdone with cheese, gore or special effects. The majority of the previews are in the first 15 minutes of the movie. After that first 15 minutes, I was wondering if the movie would be cheesy, but to my pleasant surprise, it was really good. I took my wife and 2 teenagers to see it, the wife left claw marks in my arm and my daughter jumped a few times. My son or I didn't jump but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie.Lights Out is well made. Beyond the first 15 minutes, it is well set up, acting is good, the bf is a little annoying (what man wears multicolored socks?) but overall I enjoyed the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights OutA woman that will claw your face and body but only in the dark. She disappears when there's light out and reappears in dark places. She can hide under your bed, in between doorways, inside your closet. Even if you turn the light on in the closet that doesn't mean she can't reappear right behind you. Oh and if you shoot at her the bullet goes through her. Not to mention the flash of the gun makes her briefly go invisible.Rebecca is the main character played by Teresa Palmer, who you might remember her from Warm Bodies, but I like to think of her as a more attractive and expressive Kristen Stewart. She gets a call from CPS that brings her back in touch with her estranged family. Tossing her into the mess.Sophie is Rebecca's mom and from the trailer you know that she's the reason that all of this is happening. She's played by Maria Bello who also played Anna Del Amico in ER. She does a convincing job and I haven't had many complaints with the films I've seen her in.David F. Sandberg wrote the short film that this is based off of and with James Wan producing him and coaching him on direction you can easily see him becoming a bigger named director. He'll probably get picked up by a major company at some point.Verdict: The ending can leave some speculation as to the likelihood or not of a sequel. I'm voting for a sequel. Go see this in the theaters. It's meant to be seen that way.</fullReview>

His timing and when he decides to have you no the edge of your seat and them to jump is really awesome!Acting was good. The pace of the film was fine. It didn't drag on too much. Teresa Palmer played her role brilliantly. How could we forget the one and only Diana? She was terrifying. The whole theater was spooked whenever she appeared on screen! All in all...it is worth seeing. We(The Autistic Reviewers) wanted more. It does end fairly quickly. But, at the end of the day I guess there's not much more you could with the film. Want popcorn, a packet of Mars Bars, a big Coke, and an edge of your seat experience...go and see Lights Out! 7.5/10. 4/5 stars. Autistic Reviewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked it's fresh take on the horror genre as a whole, but I don't think it made me even think about keeping the lights on as I sleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you seen the trailer, then you get the tone of the movie. It's a ghost story about a ghost who can only appear when the lights are off.The film preys on that fear of the dark too. Very little it's around the corner, it's moving objects or it's making all sorts of noise to frighten you. When the lights are off, the ghost appears, and is there in your face until you find a source of light.I don't know if this genre of movie is called a Ghost story, but this movie does have the basic outline of movies such as the Conjuring 2 or Insidious that really focus on what can get human beings jumping out of there seats.Although, this did not work as well as it should in Lights Out. The ghost was creepy and it's aggressiveness was disturbing, but they may have showed too much of the ghost this time. It was literally there when ever the lights were off no matter what and after a while, it lost a little bit of it's haunting and the natural fear it has on it's prey (Us as the viewers). Plus the visual effect of the ghost was a one trick pony. What you see in the trailer does not evolve from there in the movie.But where the ghost is weak, the movie makes up for in who it's haunting. Maria Bello was great in this film as a psychotic mother of two who technically is the one the ghost seems to be bothering the most. I was very convince from out of the park that this woman was driven crazy by this experience. Great acting job.The two kids in the movie, Rebecca, a rebellious, not easily scared women who moved out cause she got tired of her wacked out mom, and Martian a tween who can't sleep at night cause of what turned out to be a genuine fear of the dark, made for great satire of the horror genre. When Martian realized that the person his mother would talk to at night was real enough to hurt him, he did not hesitate to the pack a bag and to go and stay with his sister.It was bits like that and others where the main characters did not easily fall into the cliché traps of every horror film (especially good and very fresh to portray smart blonde females in a horror movie). In fact the dumb bimbo role actually went to Bret, Rebecca's plaything desperately trying to get promoted to boyfriend.So the movie was fresh and amusing and perfect to watch on the big screen or with others ready to be scared, but as it turns out, their attempts to be more smart and less cliché makes for a monster not so good at making you jump out of your seat and spill your popcorn.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=49</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary movie but......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I will first start with the cast and their individual performances. The star of the movie was Alicia Vela-Bailey (Diana), that was a fantastic performance as a ghost, scared the hell out of me every time Diana appeared. Gabriel Bateman (Martin), the kid was really adorable and great acting from this kid! Teresa Palmer (Rebecca), Alexander DiPersia (Bret) scored a great marks acting wise! Maria Bello did an OK job but not too great! Now with the whole, the movie starts with the scares just like The Conjuring 2, it will make you glued to the seat scared. But the ending was a real let down for me, didn't expect such ending since whole movie was good (could've been more 5-10 minutes long as the ghost died easily). But anyways this movie is not a total let down. Go watch this movie, it is scary and amazing. I will rate this movie 8/10 (-2 for ending).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Martin (Gabriel Bateman) lives alone with his mom Sophie (Maria Bello). His father has just been killed (in a truly unsettling opening sequence). He also realizes his mom is talking to an unseen friend. He's creeped out and can't sleep at night. His older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) finds out what's happening and remembers that she went through the same thing as a child. She tries to discover what her mom is talking to and where it comes from.The story is kind of vague but it works while you're watching it. It's well-directed and has OK acting by the small cast. It zips along and runs only 81 minutes. There are more than a few scary sequences and it all leads up to a violent and frightening final battle. Also the climax actually surprised me and was quite effective. And there's no room left for a sequel! Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why am I a bit of disappointed about this movie for being so short? Just because it's a good movie, a good movie that needs 2hrs for me to be satisfied. Watching a lot of horror movies, Lights Out somehow deserves my 10 rating, to be simple, I enjoyed watching it. There's no boring scenes and it has a great concept. Plus the people inside the cinema were screaming so loud, we even applauded the scene of Rebecca's boyfriend. I just wish that this movie should've focus on the psychological side, it would have been better that way I think. I really felt that they rushed the movie to be short. There should have been more scenes to support what we have watched at the trailer, that made us to expect high to this film. But overall, this movie standout and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lights Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lights Out" had potential to be a really good horror movie, since it's monster is really just a metaphor for the mother's depression and mental illness. The topic it deals with is something that is real and important, and it isn't unsympathetic toward the mother, but, unlike the great "The Babadook", "Lights Out" throws away a good setup to be just another stereotypical horror film that happens to be dealing with something serious. It has all the trademarks of a modern day horror film. It's "horror" comes strictly from sudden loud noises which are all expected since the music cuts out right before, and it ends up being a dud when it comes to actually scaring you. It also often treats it's antagonist as a typical supernatural villain towards the end scenes, even showing the monster outright. When I saw the trailer and I saw the cliché jump scare involving turning the lights on and off and seeing whatever boogeyman the horror movie is against this time, I felt this would turn out as "just another modern horror film". I decided to watch it when I saw promising reviews. Too bad I was right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Wan is one of my favorite filmmakers. All of his movies gave me goosebumps while watching them. After watching Conjuring 2, I had a lot of expectations with his new flick Lights Out. Despite the fact, he was just a producer of this movie I was expecting it scary and creepy. But all my expectations were flushed into the gutter after watching this 1 Hour 11 mins bogus drama. The film was completely predictable from the beginning to its end. There are no other extra horror material in the movie than we saw in its trailers. Watching this movie is same as watching an hour long horror drama series on TV. The plot was incomplete in many ways and there were no relations between the sequences in the film. The only good part in the movie was out-standing acting of the cast and the background score. This film could be better if it had any flashback sequence of the story. Nevertheless I would rate it 5 because of excellent performance of the cast and background music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great premise ruined by pathetic scripting/writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw David F. Sandberg's original short "Lights Out" I was, like many others, impressed by the simple yet entirely effective and atmospheric take on the short horror film. The idea that something horrible and terrifying could be lurking in front of your eyes only to become visible as a shadowy figure when the light was switched off brings the viewers imagination into play, prompting childhood memories of hiding from shadows under the safety of blankets and sheets. That terror manifests in the mind as well as on the screen makes even a three minute film feel personal and enveloping.Unfortunately for the feature studio film of the same name, and by the same director, that personal and enveloping feeling of terror is washed away by shonky writing, laughable dialogue, wooden delivery and confusing plot building.It's a real shame, if not totally unsurprising, that something which so many of us could relate to was buried with as many Hollywood horror clichés as could be squeezed into 80mins.For a movie to be truly scary, the audience needs to feel some kind of connection to the characters portrayed within it, so that when they are threatened or conveying emotion, we feel or relate to them. The movie starts off with young boy (Martin) chatting to his late working Dad about coming home to stop Mummy (Sophie) from talking to herself. The fact that Daddy never makes it home due to a horrifying and tragic demise seems to make no impact on this little family and serve only to introduce us to the entity known as "Diana". Not only are Martin/Sophie shown to be more or less unaffected by the loss, but there is no relevance to having the father in the movie at all(the assistant could have just been killed off and had the same impact). Estranged early 20s daughter, Rebecca and bf, Bret, are then introduced and due to the fact she wont let Bret stay over or even keep any of his personal items in her apartment, there's a feeling that she may have more to hide than it first appears. But it never eventuates. The opening exchange between them is awkward and lacking any real chemistry and never really grows from there.He remains the unquestioning, supportive figure throughout and may or may not only exist as body fodder for later. Either way, we don't care.Rebecca barely cracks a smile, furrows a brow or even blinks during her entire screen time and delivers her dialogue in a flat unaffected way that never translates the horror/terror/insert adj here that should stem from the events surrounding her.Martin is the standard borderline mistreated kid. He's shown no affection during what would be, for any other 8yo, the most emotional part of his life. Nor does he seek it.Sophie is Crazy/Not crazy Mum in denial. Perhaps shes emotionally suffocated by Diana but we never really know for sure. Her final part in the film makes sure there's no chance at reconciliation for either of her kids.The main part of the story is so unfocused that I can't even put it down into a couple of sentences. I wanted to say that Martin and Rebecca are trying to figure out how to stop their inattentive Mum from descending into madness, driven by her conversations with the shadowy Diana. But, to help her they really don't do anything. There's some half arsed detective work by the wooden Rebecca, who is as unaffected by the events surrounding her and Martin as Martin was over the death of his Father. Piece by piece she uncovers tidbits of info that point to "mental health care" "experimental treatments gone wrong", "rare skin condition accounting for light aversion" and an entity that exists because "she gets in your head". It's all a bit pointless in its delivery because it's never expanded on any further than that. At 80 mins it's not like we couldn't squeeze it in somewhere and build the back story a little more.What there is a dearth of is gimmicky, uninspired jump scares at almost every scene commencement. The house is squeakier than an alvin and the chipmunks movie marathon. The repetitive nature of the scares is tiresome after the first three times, while the decisions of each and every character to "investigate that noise" or "Check basement/upstairs/any darkened room" is just plain lazy writing. There's so many cliché moments here that it almost becomes an in game movie to see which ones you can notice. Call it Cliché Bingo.How many "it's behind you!" moments can you seriously write into 1hr 20m?? The movie doesn't even follow it's own rules! For most of the film, Diana is unaffected when the lights come on. She cant enter the light and simply disappears when a light comes on. Fine. But In the final scenes, when Diana suddenly becomes susceptible to light (gets burnt) and no longer vanishes in its presence we are left scratching our heads.It's never even clear what Diana is. If she's dead then why isn't she a ghost or specter linked to some kind of trauma relating to the asylum? If she's not a ghost then why can Sophie project her as a physical entity who she can impact on the ones she loves most? For a premise that held so much potential as an original movie idea, this feature debut is left flailing and faltering all the way to its merciful end, which, by the way, flickers (literally) at showing that there may still be more to come (is Diana really gone?) before answering with a flat "yeh, that's it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film about how the mental illness of a parent affects a whole family, told as a horror. That's how they should have gone into this. A ghost effectively jumping out and saying 'boo' will only take you so far.The 'boos' are very effective, don't get me wrong. But they start big and right away. I thought that was strange. And there were lots of things that didn't make sense - having seen the ghost, they all seemed quite happy to, you know, go back to bed. I couldn't understand how the ghost could find Teresa Palmer at her flat. Lots of set ups not paid off - the boyfriend being kind of a douche, but then okay. Probably the most unsatisfying was the back story of the mother and the ghost, nothing was fully explained.Teresa Palmer is incredible in this - there are moments when she looks absolutely petrified and puts you right in the scene. A lovely understated performance from Maria Bello and the kid was great.Well worth it if you like well executed jumps and bumps.</fullReview>

If you're expecting to jump out of your seat, not happening BUT it will keep you on the edge of it! Just when you think you know what will happen, you're wrong. I am a horror movie buff, having seen everything from the WORST Independent films, to the biggest B and to the drag you off of your chair horrifying! This is none of the above. It is certainly NOT a B but it is not horrifying, either. It keeps you thinking and most definitely keeps you entangled. If you are afraid of things that go 'bump' in the night, you might want to pass this one up because it will not help! It was fun and entertaining and I will buy it when it is out on DVD. My daughter and I enjoyed the fear factor and the acting, which, by the way, was dead on! (No pun intended) With all that being said, I would suggest you make a matinée of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Lights Out", starring Teresa Palmer-Point Break_2015, The Sorcerer's Apprentice; Billy Burke-Zoo_tv, Ladder 49; Maria Bello-The 5th Wave, The Mummy:Tomb of the Dragon Emperor; Gabriel Bateman- Stalker_tv, Annabelle and Alicia Vela-Bailey-she is a stuntwoman that you might have seen as an actress in Spy or The Purge.This is a horror film that is based on a 3 minute 2013 short film and both were directed by David F. Sandberg. This is his first feature film. One of the producers is James Wan, who directed the Conjuring &amp; Insidious movies as well as the first Saw. FYI: James Wan has just been announced as the director on the upcoming Aquaman movie. Back to this movie, Billy and Maria are a married couple with problems; Maria's first husband left home under mysterious circumstances-Just up &amp; left with no explanation. Billy is husband number 2. Teresa is the daughter from the first marriage and she left home too, because of abandonment issues from her daddy. Gabriel is the son from Billy and Maria and he gets to see Billy leave the picture and Maria go to pieces-Hey, Maria has now lost a total of 2 husbands. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Maria spent time in a mental hospital-as a young girl-where she met Alicia, a girl with a rare skin condition that makes her sensitive to light. The doctors tried to cure her condition but..well, let's just say that things didn't work out like they thought they would and Alicia is now an apparition. As an adult, Alicia has grown overly jealous of anyone getting close to Maria, and when they try to, Alicia gets mad. One thing good is that Alicia only comes out in the dark so any kind of light is a good deterrent and the film makers do come up with some inventive ways of using light sources. Another thing I liked was that they also used more real, practical effects instead of a lot of CGI-in real life, besides being a stuntwoman, Alicia is also a gymnast and can move her body in weird positions. After seeing it, you just might find a new reason to be afraid of the dark. It's rated "PG-13" for terror, violence, disturbing images and drug content and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 21 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watch this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie filled with loads of jump scares and a totally original plot. The only thing wrong with it is that they rely on jump scares too much, and that they also start out the action way too early, but other than that, it is an amazing movie. It is totally appropriate for kids if they are OK with horror, don't listen to the crap on a common sense of media that says you have to be 15 to watch this movie. I watched it with my dad in the theater, and he loved it as well. I am 11 years, old and I absolutely love horror films like this one. This is an outstanding suspense/thriller/horror film, and I highly recommend this movie to horror movie lovers like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lights Out - Review: Crafty Psychological Ghost Sh*t</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was introduced to this through a very interesting short movie of the same name, it scared me, and I liked it. When I heard that they were going to turn this into a full length movie, I was skeptical. When I saw the first trailer for Lights Out, I thought it was absolutely garbage.I was never excited for this movie's release, the trailer would make me laugh every time I watched it. I was going to avoid this movie at all cost because I had a sinking feeling that it would suck.I saw this movie with completely low expectations, I walked out thoroughly enjoying it.The acting and characters are believable. Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello, and Alexander DiPerisa all deliver good performances.The story-line is sharp and clever; This movie could easily be a physiological drama if you take out all the ghost stuff. I found myself emotionally invested in each character's journey as the story progressed.The directing is exceptional, there are quite a few shots that are considerably outstanding for a low budget horror movie, and I don't think I've seen horror directing this good since the first Conjuring movie.The scares are fine, I feel that I'm becoming tired of ghost stories, and I'd rather I've something that is more reality based. There are jump scares present, the scares have a Grudge movie feel to them, and I believe that they're pretty effective, but they ultimately fall short because all it is is jump scares.The ghost or whatever it is has a backstory, but there's no real overall purpose for it to exist because I believe that it's never explained.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie for its psychological aspects, but this ghost story sh*t is becoming lame in my opinion, and this movie would've truly been better if it were purely a psychological horror drama, which it is, but you've got to take out that ghost sh*t.Finale Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Lights Out" features old-school scares and a deceptively simple plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2001 horror film "The Others" starred Nicole Kidman as the mother of two children who have an unnamed disease characterized by a dangerous hyper-sensitivity to light. The horror flick "Lights Out" (PG-13, 1:21) has a similar issue at its core, but takes its story in a very different direction. "The Others" is basically a ghost story about a war widow and her children dealing with a mysterious household staff in an isolated mansion in Great Britain during World War II. That film was a combination of a Gothic supernatural horror film and a psychological thriller. "Lights Out" is simpler in its approach to horror, appealing to fears that most people have at some point in their lives ? or even throughout their lives. Based on his 2013 short film of the same name, David F. Sandberg, in his feature film directorial debut (with a new script by Eric Heisserer) gives us a deceptively simple, surprisingly entertaining shreikfest.The main characters in "Lights Out" are haunted by a barely-seen but frightening specter named Diana who can only exist in shadows. Whether Diana is real or imaginary and on what plane she might exist is an open question throughout the movie (and a matter for debate after the closing credits) but she manages to terrify and harm the living regardless. Diana can be seen by the story's characters but their personal relationships to Diana vary widely, and the film gradually reveals her identity and background.Diana "lives" in the home of Sophie (Maria Bello), an unstable widowed mother of two, only the younger of which still lives with her. Pre-teen Martin (Gabriel Bateman) is increasingly upset at his mother's odd behaviors ? and increasingly frightened by Diana's appearances ? to the point that he can't get any rest at home and is falling asleep in class. Martin's older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) has an apartment in town and is more-or-less estranged from her family, but responds to a call from Martin's school nurse.What starts as a struggle for Martin's well-being soon goes much deeper. Rebecca is at first reluctant to get involved (referring to her mother as "crazy" and accusing her of being off her medication) but soon takes action to safeguard her brother from whatever is going on at home. With the guidance of a social worker (Andi Osho) from Child Protective Services and Rebecca's kind-of-boyfriend (it's complicated), she's forced to deal with her mother directly ? and confront haunting memories from her childhood.Bret (Alexander DiPersia) tries to be supportive, but doesn't understand what's going on. As the situation becomes clearer to all involved, Sophie, Rebecca, Martin and Bret (and anyone else who's unfortunate enough to become involved with this unusually dysfunctional family) find themselves in a fight for survival and a struggle to protect each other from someone/something that they can barely see and who is scarier, faster and more powerful than anything/anyone any of them have dealt with before.Horror movies are most effective when they play upon common fears and "Lights Out" does just that. In its plot and overarching themes, it deals with fear of abandonment, fear of mental illness and, especially, fear of the dark. In doing so, the movie doesn't get fancy, but keeps its plot simple and earns its scares the old-fashioned way ? by startling us and goosing us out of our seats. Some might call these cheap thrills, but they are thrills nonetheless ? and "Lights Out" delivers them very effectively. Sandberg employs very little CGI and makes great use of music, sound effects and different lighting situations. The layering of deeper psychological and emotional fears with the even more common occurrences of being spooked by what we cannot see and our discomfort over what might be lurking in the dark makes for a relatable story ? and a fun hour and a quarter in front of a screen ? with all the other lights out.

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a PG-13 horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly satisfied with this flick. 'Lights Out' is possibly one of the best (and I use "best" lightly, do not get up in arms) PG-13 films I have seen in awhile. Normally, you see some spooky jump scare trailers and the PG-13 tag and would immediately (at least I would) slate this off with the high chance of failure. Two things kept me from doing that; 1. Tagging James Wan as the producer and 2. Making it about something people are genuinely afraid of. Let me explain that one a bit. How many of you ever had that fear of running up your steps from your basement because the creepy monster was coming up behind you? How many of you closed your closet doors at night because of the spooky ghosty that would come out if you did not? 'Lights Out' brings that popular fear of when you turn the lights out, a being is there, but when you turn them back on? It is gone. Truly terrifying for some, genius in regards to the creators. Concept aside, 'Lights Out' did jump scares impressively well, and that is me saying that. For an hour and twenty-one minute long movie, the plot creates detailed characters with deep stories and also throws in a solid plot-twist that some may not see coming. My own major gripe though? The classic horror-stupid decisions. It is common knowledge that the IQ of the typical human drops ten-fold in horror movies, well this film proves it. All in all, 'Lights Out' is a satisfying horror film, and quite possibly one of the best PG-13 ones I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended and good luck sleeping at night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shallow movie of a jump-scare after jump-scare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, it was decent. I'll start with the good things: it had good acting. Nothing remarkable, but the I could say a bit above average. The idea and concept is good and interesting, a demon that can come out only in the dark. Sadly they didn't do that great job with it.The problem is, that it's just 80 minutes of jump-scares: the plot is shallow and predictable - explaining the backstory by a character in a dialog to another character is lame (why not make some cool flashback? Hospitals can be creepy).Overall it's okay, but maybe a bit boring - there was no tension and excitement in-between, just jump-scares to jump-scares, like so many movies before this, which I got tired of after the first twenty minutes. The constant squeaking and scratching got actually quite annoying too at some point.In short: it isn't creepy and scary, it's got few scenes that will make you boggle, but that's it. There isn't just anything new or amazing in this movie: I recommend you to wait til it's on Netflix, watch it from there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Expectations Exceeded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with low expectations for this movie. There really aren't that many good horror films out there. Considering that this movie is PG-13, it was pretty good. Unlike many actors in other horror movies, these actors presented really well. Not even ten minutes in, the horror" started. I thought that was pretty unique. I enjoyed the movie, but I feel that it climaxed too soon. I wish would have dragged out the plot ine a little longer. It seemed as if a lot of backstory was left out, there was not really much of a backstory at all. Overall good, not great movie. I'd watch again. There were some comedic parts, but unlike MANY other horror films, they did not distract from the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is another film, similar to this year's earlier, The Forest, where I'm not sure that I can write a review of it, because I'm not entirely sure I watched anything.The movie wasn't scary in the least, to the point where it could have been given a PG-rating, as we wade through a dozen jump scares of this demon chick jumping at the small cast. Is this supposed to be a haunted house flick, or a possession story, or a story about madness and insanity, where the ghostly images are only in the lead character's (the mother's) mind? If the ghost is only after the mother, why does it kill the two other characters in the first scene? Even with a scant 80-minutes-long run time, the film still feels padded and stretched out, despite barely being feature length. It's almost like they took the full story's second act and stretched that out to eighty minutes.The cast did well, as well as anybody could have done with this material, but there is just so little to work with here. I liked the two leads, I thought they worked well together, and they got a few chuckles from me in the opening scenes, but after that, an overwhelming feeling of "What the hell am I watching?" entered my mind, and stayed throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and well-directed horror films in such a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler Alert: Some things in here are spoilers) The incredible filmmaker David F Sandberg debuts his first horror film. This movie is called "Lights Out". In this film, the cliché moves aren't really present. The characters make decisions that are smart and beneficial to their own safety. For example, when Bret (Alexander Dipersia) was being chased by Diana, he used his brain properly. He used his phone as lights and even used the lights in front of his car. The characters are picked perfectly especially Maria Bello who plays as Sophie or the mother of Rebecca (Palmer) and Martin (Bateman). You can actually see through her as she acts so genuinely and into character. Teresa Palmer is perfect too. She nailed the "bad girl" vibe that is supposed to be in her character. Gabriel Bateman as Martin is also perfect. You can see him trying to get a grasp on the character he is portraying and of course Alexander DiPersia, "bad boy" vibe was perfectly done and the chemistry between him and Teresa was there. The "monster" Diana, played by Alicia, was perfect. The gestures, the body shape, the scare factor is so present that sometimes you wonder "Is she really not a CGI-generated character?" The scares were actually used a few times over and over but something about it is so suspenseful and so scary that it keeps you every single time. The stories of these characters are very unexpected and very unusual starting off with her mother. Her mother was in a mental hospital back then when she was still a kid. The voice of Diana also added up to the scariness in the film. Diana's voice reminds me so much a demon-possessed person. The family problems were also laid out quite properly. They presented us with the statement of Sophie " she left me when things got hard" and "she acts like she's strong but she's really not." A dysfunctional family with the headmaster dead and a mentally-ill mother. Even though it is such a short movie, it still makes up with the fun ride and the scary phases that you are left to cope with when you watch it. Others may find it "stupid" but for me, it is a milestone marking the rebirth of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I can remember being this scared. The ring was probably the closest thing. The entity coming at you in the dark is just spine tingling. There were a few funny parts. I was sure the boyfriend was a goner. He tells the cops they need a flashlight more than a gun. Of course they don't listen. The scariest for me was when she figures out the black light works to see the entity so they can be harmed. The ending came a s a shock. Worth a date night. I had a nightmare after seeing this movie.I turned the lights on real quick when I got home too. Had a lasting impact. Definitely recommend to anyone who likes scary movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LIGHTS OUT - I knew the fact that if i want to review more and more movies , i have to start watching movies alone. Because i will not be getting company from someone every Friday. But i was ignoring this fact and skipping movies. Yesterday lastly the LAZY PERSON inside me get defeated by THE MOVIE LOVER inside me. so i decided to watch movie alone. Then i thought if there is nobody to say that he can not watch two movies one after another them m free for it . So i decided to watch two movies one after another i.e., LIGHTS OUT &amp; MADAARI (which i will be reviewing next) as per the schedule. Two other movies which i had to left for today due to conflicting Showtimes are KABALI and STAR TREK BEYOND. I Haven't said this before but its true that m not a very good person to review HORROR movies. There exist a different group of viewers who eagerly waits for Horror movies. I personally don't know how their mind works. I mean what they want in their Horror movies. Because Horror movies are constantly rated low but always become blockbuster. So i think i would like to start it with comparison to CONJURING 2 , which i liked a lot but many have complained that they don't like it because they didn't get scared (i want those persons to list the movies which made them getting scared not in their childhood but in their adulthood. Because i really want to know what are the benchmarks for them to decide whether a horror movie is good or not) . So for a start both Conjuring 2 and Lights out are WARNER BROS product , but they both are different in many sense . First Lights Out is a really less expensive movie , i.e., 4.9million$ which is 9 times lesser then the budget of conjuring 2 which costs 40million$. That doesn't mean that Lights Out looked cheap. Its a well made movie as long as production design goes. But the biggest difference between both the movie is that , Conjuring 2 was a wholesome movie(which i prefer) , it has a lot going on with the sub plot apart from the ghosts and because of that it was more entertaining for me in its 2hr and 14mins running time. In comparison LIGHTS OUT is a very direct movie with no subplots , concentrating just on single plot , very tightly edited (1hr and 22mins only) and made solely for Horror movie fans. That can be a reason for Horror movie fans liking this movie more then me. But i cant say about their point of view. But i can definitely say that there is nothing in this movie for the persons who are not Hardcore horror movie fans. Story is very simple , ghost is haunting a family which consists Mother , Son , Daughter and Daughter's Boyfriend. All the actors have done a really good Job. Teresa Palmar as the Daughter was nice . The newcomer playing the Son was great child actor given a strong character. The concept of Ghost scared of Light and can only appear when lights are out was nice actually. And the concept really kicks in the last 30mins when the ghost tried to kill everybody and everybody tries to save himself with the help of light. The movie is very dark , its hard to believe that how can be any person can live in a home with so much dime yellow light in Los Angeles. It was an ideal how for a ghost. Production design has definitely save a lot of money from not using enough lighting. But yes for its short length , the movie never bores. Actually it finished with the blink of your eyes. With the tight budget in which it has been made , i think it would be a blockbuster too. But at least its a good movie to become a blockbuster , so i am happy for WARNER BROS.. 6.7/10.

		<shortDescription>Good, not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters are likable, the premise frightening, and the storytelling good enough to keep people entertained and scared for an hour and a half.My only real complaint about the movie is that it doesn't leave a lasting impression. Everything feels like it's missing a crucial ingredient that could have turned this from a good film into a great film. The characters don't feel fully fleshed out. Ya, some of their backstories are kind of told, but they feel rushed and forced in in some cases. The ghost woman is great, but she shows up too much in the film. By the time it's over, your used to seeing her and expect her to pop out in every scene like a jack-in-the-box. And probably the biggest issue is that the ghost shows up right from the get go. There's no build-up to her reveal, no real questions about whether she exists or not, she's just BAM right there.But in the end these are minor complaints. I definitely enjoyed the film a lot more than I expected and would recommend it to any horror movie lover. I just wish it had a bigger impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think any horror fan who thinks LIGHTS OUT is a great horror movie, should have their fandom questioned. This is one of those movies that's just so bad, in every aspect, you end up laughing the entire time, hell you might watch it again because it's funny, you treat it like a comedy now.I think the only thing that LIGHTS OUT has going for it is that it's produced by James Wan. Wan has become a big brand name in horror, and rightfully so, I think he's a skilled storyteller, and so his name is what the producers and filmmaker hope would drive audiences to see LIGHTS OUT and they're going to use Wan on every poster and trailer, they're going to market his name, but if you think that the film going to be close to being as decent as anything Wan has actually made, you might want to lower your expectations.LIGHTS OUT marks the feature film directorial debut of David F. Sandberg, who directed the film from a screenplay by Eric Heisserer ("Final Destination 5"), based on Sandberg's own short film. Teresa Palmer plays Rebecca who left home and her childhood behind, but now her little brother, Martin, is experiencing the same thing she went through as a child which are unexplained terrifying events that seem to happen whenever the lights go out. Turns out, a mysterious entity has been attaching herself to their mother all those years, but as Rebecca gets closer to unlocking the truth, the more resistant and dangerous this entity becomes.It has an interesting core concept, I give them that, the concept that the demon can only attack you in the dark; that any type of light (doesn't have to be UV, this is not a vampire story) would scare her and ultimately harm her. So yes the concept is interesting but perhaps Sandberg should've left it alone as a short film. LIGHTS OUT is just so poorly executed, and it insults our intelligence, not to mention how the demon originated, old photos of her when she was a little girl, the way she looks, the way the backstory is told, it just doesn't get more generic than that, the whole thing feels like a parody or as if you're watching another installment of that "Scary Movie" franchise. Let's just put it this way, if you're easily scared and you enjoy watching low-rate dreadful films like "The Grudge" and "The Eye," then you wouldn't mind LIGHTS OUT.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

Directors master plan is to make a good trailer, making people rush and watch the movie. But in the end, is a poor mixture of great old horror movies and only few people enjoyed, just a little bit, who have no idea of the old horror movies.One last thing.
