		<shortDescription>The greatest visual experience that my eyeballs have ever witnessed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw a screening of Samsara at the TIFF, at the brilliant TIFF Lightbox theatre. Wow.A film that took 5 years to make and co-ordinate. Shot in Panarama 70mm, across 26 countries, needing major government and regulatory clearances, having to wait for certain seasons or lunar phases to get the light to hit the way director Fricke wanted...carefully strung together with a massive 7.1 surround sound design and music score from Michael Stearns, Marcello de Francisci, and Lisa Gerrard (of Dead Can Dance).The 70mm negative has been digitally scanned and oversampled at 8k resolution (much like the 'Baraka' Blu-ray); the TIFF Lightbox theatre installed a brand new Christie 4k projector (Christie Projection Systems rushed the projector before its release to the market specifically for this event) making it the first true 4k screening of it's kind. From sweeping landscapes to time-lapse sequences of the night sky and from exclusive looks into the processing of food to the consumption and effects it has on the human body, Samsara is nothing short of astounding. Modern technology, production lines, and human robotics are juxtaposed against a backdrop of deserts, garbage mounds as far as the eye can see, and traffic congestion in modern centres. The time-lapse footage is simply transcendent. In fact, I caught myself questioning the reality of some of the landscape vistas and night skyline montages...they looked so hyper-real that I thought they must have come from a CG lab somewhere. Simply astonishing. The richness, depth and clarity of colour and image achieved within the processes utilized gives birth to the most beautiful visual meditation that I have ever witnessed.As one film journalist noted, "That Samsara is instantly one of the most visually-stunning films in the history of cinema is reason enough to cherish it, but Fricke and co-editor Mark Magidson achieve truly profound juxtapositions, brimming with meaning and emotion. It sounds preposterous, but it's true: In 99 minutes, Samsara achieves something approaching a comprehensive portrait of the totality of human experience. If you're even remotely fond of being alive, Samsara is not to be missed."If you ever come across the chance to see this film in a decent theatre, run, and let your eyeballs (and earholes) feast upon its brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A warning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have found reviewing this film in detail to be futile. Instead, I will offer my own thoughts.Whereas 1992's "Baraka" contemplates on humanity in a dream/god-like manner, Ron Fricke's "Samsara" is more intense and solemn in its tone. From the birth of civilization, mankind has used its gift for intelligence for nothing but progress, and now, today, we have either reached or gone over the tipping point. There is no where but down this time. Humans work mechanically in a clockwork fashion, consume everything in their path, and leave the excesses behind for others to scavenge. Eventually, all will collapse, leaving nothing behind and returning the state of civilization back to ground zero. And the wheel turns on. Is this what "Samsara", Frick and co-editor Mark Magidson is trying to say? Or did you experience a completely different interpretation? It is up to you to decide.I will not ponder upon the technical details. The cinematography and editing is flawless; the music and music arrangement - simply mesmerizing. A work of art, like life itself, on this planet, in our cities and homes, in the desolate plains and mountains; they are shown in all its beauty, splendour and spectacle. Our planet is truly beautiful.I will end my review with this note - you owe no one but yourself to see this film. Every man, woman and child should see this - regardless of their personal preference of culture and entertainment. This film is a message to all of us. A warning.Overall rating: 100%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My boyfriend and I went to see this at the Cinerama in Seattle. For those wanting to see this movie, I highly recommend seeing it in a theater, if possible. It's one that needs to be watched on a big screen with a great sound system to add to the amazing visual and auditory impact. It was also thought provoking and gave us plenty to think about and discuss afterward.Visually, this movie is one of the best I've ever seen. The time lapse photography as well as the vivid colors and detail... I don't even know how to describe it, as it was like nothing I've ever seen before.This film screams loudly, despite the fact that not a single word is spoken. It's a journey around the world, showing the immense beauty and the grotesque horrors of humanity, interspersed with stunning natural landscapes and the fallout of natural disaster. Nothing is held back from us and, rather than make a specific point, each viewer is able to take from the film what speaks to them. The filmmakers were able to show some incredible juxtapositions and contradictions, calling into question much of what we take for granted and don't bother to contemplate. On more than one occasion, I was moved to tears, either by the sheer beauty of the scene or out of pure disgust.The score was so perfectly matched to the scenery that, in some places, it was impossible to believe that the music was not present when the scenes were filmed.This is definitely a must see and I sincerely hope that we'll be treated to another installment from the filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It took years to perfect and an instant to ruin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samsara is a depressingly accurate account of shallow human materialism, the widespread ungratefulness of our culture, and the incredible arrogance we continue to proudly possess. It features images too powerful to be computer generated and humanity too sincere to be fiction. Even though not a word is spoken, the film's images pack well over a thousand words, making Samsara, hypothetically, the longest work of poetry ever written.The film chronicles the living conditions, the activities, and the day-to-day routines of many different people across twenty-five different countries. We never do get a true answer where we are at, which works as a method by the filmmakers, I assume, to prevent assumptions and judgments on the places and the people. We are shown many things in these evocative, unforgettable one-hundred minutes, and more depth and enigma than many will experience in their lifetime.Shots are presented in crystal clear 70mm (if you're lucky enough to find a theater with the proper projector, but regular theater projectors should work efficiently enough), and we get a beautiful look at life in the slums, life in mansions placed delicately on the coastlines, and living conditions in countries such as Ethiopia and the United States. We see early religious rituals carried out, such as Tibetan monks engaged in their prayers or youthful baptisms, as well as contrasting lifestyles that involve dance mobs, suffering, and habitat destruction.Director Ron Ficke's imagery and global cinematography is gripping and astounding, with long shots centered on characters, groups of people, or sometimes, aerial shots that feature a wide coverage of the surrounding land. My favorites are easily the time lapse sequences, sped up to breakneck speeds, sometimes showing haunting images of uncertainty or simply the fast paced nature of our world.There are two sequences in particular that are the most haunting, and describing them will be no easy task. One involves a man sitting behind a desk, who begins to smear modeling clay on his face, before grabbing a tiny paint brush and stroking black and red paint all over himself as well. He begins to vigorously do both things at once, ripping clay off his face only to smear it back on, throw dust in his eyes, stick pencils in his face, etc. The long-shot becomes faster and faster, while jolting music plays in the background. The scene alone is more horrifying and surreal than anything I've seen in 2012, with the exception of Battle Royale.The other lasts about five or six minutes, involving a barn full of chickens helplessly being sucked into a large, ominous tractor that will kill them and prepare them for tomorrow's meal. From birth to death, they live their entire life in fear and darkness, barely being able to move due to their heavy breasts and increasing plumpness. We too get a look at pot belly pigs, also too heavy to move, as they lay still and allow their piglets to drink milk from their nipples. We then see those same baby pigs hanging from a long line in the air at a condensed factory, being prepared into the bacon you will eat tomorrow for breakfast.These images are nonetheless painful, but it all resorts back to what I called Samsara in the first paragraph - depressingly accurate, more haunting than fiction, and silently nudging us when we're left agape, saying, "hey, we're to thank for this." And we are. One of the final shots involves a beautiful mural of tiny colored specs being swept away in seconds by men brushing the table it is on. We are stunned that such a beautiful thing would be carelessly wiped away, but it all returns back to the idea that we were too given a beautiful slice of life and the world and we took it for granted and nearly destroyed it. We weren't able to take a second look.Fricke paints Samsara, which is Sanskrit for "the ever turning wheel of life," as a film that sometimes can laud human activity and then turn around and condemn it. It is predominately a loose picture, that wants you to search for meaning in its images, but unlike Jean-Luc Godard's Film Socialisme, a horrible exercise in a similar field, we can see the images represent something and there's enough ambiguity that we are able to extract many different messages from the source material and are able to provide sufficient evidence to back up our claims. To put it simply, this is one of the best, most intellectually stimulating films of the last ten years.Directed by: Ron Fricke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful companion to Baraka, and compellingly different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baraka was a film that left me dazzled and mesmerized. Walking into Samsara, I was nervous that my expectations were simply too high, and that the film would too closely mimic its sibling. I can confidently say that by the end of Samsara, I once again experienced the flick of a light switch in my mind. Everything I am was completely put into perspective. As a result, I can promise that Samsara will leave you both awestruck and completely terrified. Samsara struck a very personal chord with me. Much of what is shown exists because of people like me. The film is an unfiltered walk through the things that I try my best to ignore in daily life. I'm not sure how to reconcile the imagery of Samsara with how I live my life. I'm also not sure that I want to. It would mean giving up the vast majority of my creature comforts, even though I know those comforts come at the expense of other people, animals and the planet. The fact the film allows me to think about these things, in a way that I normally wouldn't, means that it worked. 4/4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic experience that you should give yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across the trailer for Samsara having never heard anything about it before, or the filmmakers involved, but the trailer alone made me want to check it out. I got to see it in IMAX and I'm glad I did as, as everyone else has said, visually it is stunning, so the bigger the screen you can see it on the better.I have never seen Fricke's previous work such as Baraka so I had no idea what to truly expect when I sat down before it started. I see people have mentioned they got bored after 30 minutes due to the lack of dialog/narration and that overall it's too long but I couldn't disagree more. From the first scene to last, I was totally engrossed in the visual and audio experience. The juxtaposition of concepts and themes worked, I got to see places and activities I didn't know about in a way I have never seen before. The soundtrack is spot on, capturing and switching the moods perfectly. It moves you.I see critics have said that the message of Samsara isn't clear but I don't think it needs a message. Seeing Samsara has enhanced my understanding, and appreciation for, the way our world is and works, and what really matters most to us. How many times can you go to the cinema and come out a more knowledgeable person?Samsara is quite simply a work of art and, like all great art, you interpret it in your own individual way and it makes you think. Do yourself a favor and experience it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go See This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>S A M S A R A (my little review)Ron Fricke, creator of the films Chaos and Baraka creates a tour de sympathy with his third, evocative, deeply stirring, film Samsara, a movie that points directly at personal responsibility, empowerment, and the price of thoughtless consumption, attachment, creation of ideologies to supplant a close relationship with life, but also a sort of raging against the dying of the light... and those who pay the price in society... the spirit of man, the animals we share this planet with, women, children and nature itself... First off I would recommend this movie, this beautiful movie shot in 70mm full of color and feeling, that traverses the globe, and one's own heart. The film makes a Tibetan sand mandala of us all, blossoms a petal of truth within, then wipes away the dross... I believe there is not only a definite thread to follow, but it's rather like seeing a natural singularity becoming split into the myriad activities of all humanity, the occurring entanglements, and then how it comes back together into the singularity within the heart, the seat of the soul. We always have a choice to diverge or to return to the inlet of our spiritual sea, the remembrance of our natural state as humanity... I believe the movie gets this across in such a beautiful and simple way that it's life changing. I don't think everyone will get it in the moment, I believe a seed will be planted in some, watered in others, and blossom in others, but for each where they stand, the movie will meet you where you are if you are open to its message.Go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Gazes At You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has tremendous power, not just from camera technique, but from the simple device of a human face steadily gazing at you. Time and time again humanity intrudes its collective face on you as life plays out across the Earth. Acceleration contrasts with contemplation; Earth rhythms overshadow human activity; no one seems to notice. Samsara is beautiful, bizarre, and unforgettable. As the film progressed, my convictions as to what is 'for real' began to weaken. We may really be stuck in the same dream state. And always someone 'sees' back at you. Or is Samsara 'only a movie'? This is not to say there is one correct way to experience or interpret Samara. Your reaction will reflect you only. At times uncomfortable, viewing Samsara is an experience worth having.</fullReview>

Can totally believe that it took 5 years to complete the picturization. Every second spent on creating this visual symphony is worth it. Real impressed with the production team's reach. They even managed to capture amazing sequences from within a jail in China.Now I need to find a way of watching this team's 1992 movie 'Baraka'. I sincerely hope that it is commercially successful so that, we can see more from this amazing team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a disappointment for me, especially considering how much I loved Baraka (the director's other film which is very similar). I could go into many details about what I disliked about it, but the main points are these: 1. It's not nearly as groundbreaking as you might think. Why? Well, first of all, although the cinematography and scenery is indeed stunning at times, technically speaking, it's no step up from Baraka which was made twenty years prior to this. They were both shot on 65MM (released in 70MM) film. Essentially, nothing has changed in Fricke's filmmaking techniques. He repeats many of the same or similar types of shots from Baraka. We get the people staring into the camera who must feel awkward and are usually not smiling. (How is this better than just a photograph, by the way?) We also see more time-lapse photography of cities and factories and lots of people moving about; again, this is nothing new. 2. There are too many stereotypical travel sites/sights and clichés. If you like travelling at all and have read or seen any travel magazines, or even if you've been watching a lot of films and documentaries for a while, then you should already be quite familiar with many of the places and images shown in this film. The opening shots in Burma, while admittedly amazing, are not much better than what has been seen in Lonely Planet guides and National Geographic magazines. I could say the same for typical scenes of African tribes and even the poverty (again, stereotypes of Africa - they must be all poor or savages, right?). Then we have the Hajj in Saudi Arabia which has been seen numerous times in other places. Same goes for the geishas and Torii gates in Japan (plus freaky robots and sex dolls - Japan is always either high tech and freaky or traditional and quaint), and the ladyboys of Thailand. And lets not forget the scenes in famous American National Parks which have been done to death already. There is virtually nothing original or different here. About the only thing that stood out to me was the incongruous performance art scene which felt out of place and designed to shock more than anything else. 3. The most important reason why this film fails in my opinion is that while it seems to have some kind of agenda, it can't really make up its mind what it is. Whatever message we are meant to take away from it isn't clear. There is no real discernible structure to the whole work, which is essential to have without any kind of narration or dialogue. At first it seems to be a Buddhist film (and the title certainly implies that), but then why all the scenes of churches and Muslims? Doesn't really fit to my mind. And there seems to be more pessimism here than in Baraka; Samsara is more in line with the earlier Qatsi trilogy that Fricke was also involved with. But then you see great scenes of beauty. I suppose you could argue that Fricke is just trying to show life in its entirety - that there is suffering as well as beauty in this world. In that case, you might say that he is successful. But it has been done better before by other filmmakers and even by Fricke, in my opinion. This is a largely redundant and superficial project. It seems to want to be deep, but it really only skims the surface.Lastly, although I sound pretty harsh in my assessment, I do want to note that this is a film to see on the largest and best screen possible. If you only care about pretty images (along with a few ugly ones), then you may get more out of this than I did. But I'd still say you'd be better off seeing Baraka again or for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like flicking through a Technicolor encyclopaedia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the strangest films I have ever seen. I'm not sure it even qualifies as a film in the traditional sense. Could it be classed as one of the very few silent colour films? Whatever it is, I was impressed. It's like flicking through a Technicolor encyclopaedia.Developing themes from his earlier 'Baraka', Ron Fricke's documentary uses 70mm film to show mostly a series of still images, with some motion shots. Entirely wordless, except for an Enya-esque soundtrack, 'Samsara' (Sanskrit for 'cycle of worldly existence') is more accessible than Terrence Malick's 'The Tree of Life', which it resembles pictorially and, to a lesser extent, conceptually. Wikipedia describes this film as having no narrative. I think that's wrong. The heterogeneous images of various cultures and vistas, culled over five years from 25 countries, from America to China, Israel to Indonesia, aren't random. They link to form a point: that the world is wonderful, horrible, spectacular, confusing and beautiful ? and will be ad infinitum. The first half contains scenes of the natural world, while the second half deals (with more than a hint of a religious bent) with man and all that he does to undo nature. I was struck particularly by the 'consumption' sequences, showing the mass-slaughtering of animals followed by shots of people happily devouring them as junk food. At 102 minutes this is Fricke's longest feature, and I did feel it was overlong. No impact would have been lost if this was as short as his other films. The frequent use of time-lapse photography was a noticeable distraction, for no other reason than the images remained more or less constant throughout the jumps. The way people and landmarks are filmed is interesting. The camera gazes at subjects, and captures landmarks at uncommon angles. It's as if we're discovering these spectacles for the first time. I'm sure I haven't quite conveyed my point, but if you see this visual feast, you'll see what I'm trying to say. www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its message comes across as confused, but its beautiful visuals make it a film worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samsara (Tibetan word meaning "the wheel of life") was an attempt to capture the images of today's so-called globalized word, which by the way is fading away. Yes, after 20 years of seemingly unstoppable globalization, or should I say Westernization, this economic and cultural process is coming to an end. But this is another matter. The question is does the film succeed in making sense of what's going on? No, it does not. If compared with the best works of its genre like Man With A Movie Camera (1929) and Koyaanisqatsi (1982) Samsara lacks intellect and purpose. Still, I can't deny that the 65mm stock images captured by director Ron Fricke are mostly impressive. Most of the film is beautifully shot and accompanied by a suitable score by Michael Stearns. It's certainly an absorbing motion picture. However, I'm not an admirer of Fricke's work because of his choice of locations. Why, for example, devote so much time filming in Asia and Africa? There are other interesting places in the world, like Russia and even the United States. And why does the film have to have these somber messages about globalization and nature? One can easily find a lot of beauty in the world too. And even in the Americas not everything is about guns and slums. One can easily find a lot of beauty there. For example, Koyaanisqatsi wasn't all about nature contrasted with industry. It also featured beautiful city scenery, and its message came across much better. Still, Samsara is a fine work. It features some remarkable images, including Muslims visiting the holy city of Mecca. It's not a classic but it's worth recommending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant, but difficult to explain why. No plot, no acting (well, except for one scene, but I'll come to that). So, it's a documentary then? Yes, sort of, but there is no narration, nor captions, nor even tags to let you know what or where in the world you are looking at.In essence, it's a visual documentary on the modern world. Initially it just seems like National Geographic without any commentary: beautiful scenes of temples, nature and places you might want to go as a tourist. However, 100 minutes of random places and things could be boring after a while. Just when you start to think that might well be the case, themes start to emerge: nature, buildings, opulence vs poverty, guns/military, livestock. Pretty much everyday things, and how they are connected.It is basically a 100-minute stream-of-consciousness exercise, using amazing, totally natural visual imagery (ie no CGI). Enjoy it for where it takes your mind, or just for the images and the drama of everyday life.Only negative note is the one scene that isn't candid: a performance artist. Very pretentious and pointless and prevents this movie from being perfect.</fullReview>

This is just concatenation in void context; all significance has been driven down to zero by the silent treatment.If you've got a story to tell, tell it. Use language and planning.After watching the film the first time, I read well over 50 reviews of it. In almost all cases, the review consisted of interpretations from experiences and axes to grind from outside the film. Frankly, it looked like stretching in every case. Watching the film again reinforced this opinion. Documentary films, by and large, have issues to raise and things to say about those issues. This film has images to present, but no point of view. The reviewers I read loaded in their own POV, whereas I'd say this film is just "I've collected a number of high quality images."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Immense! This movie shows us things we're familiar with and things we have never even imagined, and yet it all comes from somewhere in our home, on our planet, within our environment. Framed by Buddhist philosophy and art, we have a god's-eye-view of all continents, all classes, so many cultures and vastly different terrains. We see the endless desert- scape, we see Cairo, the United States, China, Tibet, indigenous peoples of South America, the architecture of Rome, the worshippers of Mecca. We see various trades, the wounded, the dead, families, contrasting political and social agendas. We are left with a feeling of bittersweet grandiosity, the way that Buddhism leaves its adherents. Pain exists, we may never get rid of it. Maybe violence cannot solve violence. Maybe the path of progress is a lot slower than most of us think, maybe the only solution is to take on this weighty all-encompassing compassion that this movie offers up, and pray that it spreads by example and because it is the most virtuous and inevitable way. That's the magic of this movie, that it does not look down on anyone, it seeks to document everyone as they would be documented, and yet there is editorializing, however subtle it is: that we all have the nobility of consciousness, and we are all each as consequential as a fleck of sand upon the Sahara.</fullReview>

Without the use of any verbal articulation, but images, not only does Samsara do an unreal cinematographic job at capturing magnificent time-lapsing skylines and beautiful human architecture and cultural customs, but it eloquently juxtaposes its scenes to create epiphanies in the viewer. From musing at how infinite and beautiful the universe is, to examining the roots of human insecurity and the inherent angst of the industrial/corporate mechanization of humans and animals, Samsara takes the viewer on an existential journey through the mystery and experience of a conscious being on earth. If only a small time capsule of earth's memory should live on without us, this film should be included. Alien scholars would revel in their discovery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mouth-Wateringly Beautiful, Samsara is a Real Workout For Any Home Entertainment System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dialog-free vistas and stunning panoramas from the makers of the equally-minimal HD heavyweight Baraka. It's a visual revelation - a shifting, stirring, breathing case study for motion photography - and the kind of cinema that Blu-Ray was born for. As the direct successor to the aforementioned Baraka, though, direct comparisons are both inevitable and often unfair. In some lights, it does manage to surpass its predecessor, particularly in its series of jaw-dropping long exposure landscapes. That's a surface that was merely scratched before, and Samsara's renditions are a jolting evolution of the format. In the cases of musical accompaniment, deeper meanings and sheer variety of subject, though, it falls a few steps short of the bar. This kind of picture isn't for everybody (in fact, it put my family to sleep) and if this is your first rodeo you'd be far better served with Baraka or Koyaanisqatsi, but seasoned fans should welcome the new material... even if it's not *quite* as grand as previous entries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visual imagery to great perfection and detail. The whole experience is spirit lifting.There is no dialog, no story, no characters and nothing is indeed defined. It's a collaboration of images and great images I must say. Wow, it's one of the best blue-ray's to be released in recent times. The perfection in each frame and the details captured beautifully make this one a great compilation of visuals. But, I doubt if anyone would undertake an ordeal of near 100 minutes with emptiness so to say, there is no word spoken and we have is fragmented images of scenes ranging from Buddhist monasteries to the skyscrapers to so many elements of nature, be it a volcano or a forest.So, it's a kind of complete focus on what we see and completely devoid of any dialog but music plays a pivotal role in helping us a great deal. If we close our eyes and listening it's like listening to trance music that varies from slow serene music of Chinese to the chaos of the traffic, everything is amalgamated and shown how is our world "SAMSARA".The interesting aspect that drove me to this is the title SAMSARA itself. It is derived from Sanskrit word SAMSARA meaning, the Universe. And after tying up myself to the chair to have a juice as company and to see this 100 minute visual poem was indeed an overwhelming and great experience. It reminded me of "The Man With the Movie Camera" that is another film of 1929 based on images purely.Now, since this is great visual imagery, I will give 5/5 for cinematography and there it goes, because there is nothing but cinematography here. But since it's not everyone's cup of tea, because it's completely devoid of any movie genre, I will make it a 4/5. It worked for my eyes and try it with huge amount of time and patience and it may work for you too. So a 4/5 for this. This film is not for all though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samsara (Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson, 2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in glorious Panavision Super 70 (65mm) 'Samsara' is another one of those wordless pretty-picture films that works in various modes that as an overarching theme basically has the impermanence of everything. The tranquil start juxtaposes human achievement (culture, art,...) with a tumultuous nature (volcanoes, erosion,...) provoking the question of how we can exist let alone be creative in a world that doesn't give a sh!t. This section at some point becomes about the interaction between human art and what you may want to call natural art with images of ancient constructions being transformed by nature over time which has a beauty all of its own.Then things get more lively (including the music, of course) as the film goes into "Mondo Cane" mode with cultural weirdness from all over the world like a corpse getting carried over a cemetery and buried in a coffin in the shape of a gun. Other coffins on display have the shape of fish and airplanes. The film visits various slaughterhouses (pigs, chickens and cows all get the automatized Ax) which leads straight to humanoid robots and to sex dolls whose faces are juxtaposed with those of dancing ladyboys in a Taiwanese club with interconnecting footage of plastic surgeries.The third mode is that of crowds and how they act in union like tens of thousands of people praying in Mekka, running around that stone, kneeling, standing up, etc. There are the dazzling lights of a metropolis from the bird's-eye view and thousands of prisoners dancing in formation to a sweat-inducing dance beat. In the end 'Samsara' comes back to the images of the beginning with monks who painstakingly created a picture made of sand looking at the picture for a few seconds and then wiping it off the floor again and collecting the now multicolored sand in a bowl. The last image is that of dunes shaped by wind, the fate of everything on this planet.No matter if 'Samsara' uses a stationary camera, a steady camera or helicopter shots; no matter if it focuses on details, on individuals or on crowds; no matter if it uses high-speed photography, time-lapse photography or plain normal speed; it is always great-looking due to the high resolution and most notably due to the staggering ever-present smoothness of motion that gives a true impression of not just a floating camera but maybe even of a floating world without ever having to leave the Earth's atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feast for Your Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, its important to outline that Samsara is not your typical movie, at all. At first glance, this film looks more like a screensaver than a feature length film. However, this film is much more than that. Ron Fricke uses incredible precise and elegant Cinematography to capture the story behind an array of Landscapes, Environments and Characters, and the end result is simply breathtaking. This is not just a film, it is a visual masterpiece.Every scene captures something different, something spectacular. From sophisticated yet entrancing time lapses, to immersive and emotional portraits, every shot is careful and masterfully planned and preformed. Every shot is different, yet all of them fit together in some sort of massive jigsaw puzzle, which is the real beauty of this film. There is a story within Samsara, yet its not one the director is shoving down your throat. The story that arises from this film is created by the audiences own interpretation, something that many movies struggle to do today. The message drawn out of Samsara is present in every frame, yet Fricke spends just enough time on each shot to keep the audience engaged, before transitioning to another frame, another shot, another message. The soundtrack in this film is also praiseworthy. It works hand in hand with the visual element, adding more context to the film, and only serves to strengthen the mood and impact of Samsara. Its nothing to rave about on its own, but its incorporation with the rest of Samsara is definitely an honorable achievement. And thats about it, there really isn't anything else to this film, and there doesn't need to be. These two elements, the masterful cinematography and the excellent use of the soundtrack are not just the strongest features of this film, they are the only features worth mentioning, and thats not a bad thing, at all. Indeed, this film is not for everyone. If you watch this movie asking for a narrative, a plot, or anything resembling a blockbuster film, you will be left severely disappointed, and very likely bored. However, if you seek a feast for your eyes, incredible cinematography, and a visually stunning experience, then this film is exactly what you want. It will keep you entranced, excited, and wanting more. I highly recommend this film for any aspiring film-maker, lover of film, or even if you are someone who can get lost for hours in your local art gallery.</fullReview>

The music absorbs you in it up to a level that you don't know you were watching it on screen. You start feeling like you are dreaming it. The locations chosen are mesmerizing. And religions have been depicted so greatly with so little of the information but conveys what religion is all about very comprehensively.Now Spoiler Part: It shows a very well presented scene from Makkah Soudi Arabia. Kaaba on the screen. The largest of the religious gatherings, all steps happening in unison. And sound of most famous of Azaans(Call for prayer) so perfectly blended into the rest of the music that I almost didn't catch it the first time. But watching again I noticed azaan could have no music in background and still it would have made it a perfect scene, or perhaps a more attractive and likable one.</fullReview>

The movie embraces on the daily routine of several people across different countries with different cultures. It is a very good experience for the first timers who watch a film which involves no voice.The movie starts with the worship of Tibetan monks and their rituals and the movie continues with the beauty of nature and how the present world is ruining it. There was a scene for about 10 minutes that shows how the world is treating other species and most importantly animals for our meal. One should have a lot of courage to make a movie like this.

		<fullReview>"Samsara" was shot on the highest film quality possible (70mm), and outputted to digital format. I don't know why I put off seeing it for so long, unfortunately it was one of those films in a long list you'll just eventually get around to seeing. Within Buddhism, "Samsara" is explained as the repetitious, but continuing cycle of birth and death. The process of cycling through one rebirth after another, is figuring out whether it was a psychological experience or a physical one.And I thoroughly enjoyed it. "Samsara" takes about 10 minutes to really warm up, and when it does it's an utter spectacle of both cinematography, editing and narrative. Master director Ron Fricke's efforts have been thoroughly constructed, and transitions flow seamlessly. It's gorgeous to see sands in the desert move like the ocean, and shadows sweeping mountains from dusk to dawn revealing rich unearthly colours. Monk's craft heavily detailed mosaic's with sand, and cultures from both sides of the world are uniquely different and humorously not so different after all.There's not much to say, other than the movie is a wonderful experience. In the age of the Internet and cheaper travel, Mr. Fricke's previous outing "Baraka" has aged terribly in my mind. "Samsara" feels like a conclusion, but more "Quasi-remake" that just flows better in comparison.Final Verdict: Highly worth your time. It has its darker moments, but to have not included them would be a disservice to the picture. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reflection of the poetry, tragedy and wonder to be found throughout this world, finding coherence within the disorder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The universe is full of things that are bot infinitely varied yet profoundly the same. From every galaxy, to every grain of sand, to every life there is, has been, and will be; each one is simultaneously somewhat uniform yet entirely unique. The complex web of factors behind the diversity appears almost chaotic, but scratch beneath the surface and patterns, formula, laws can always be found if you go deep enough.And that's what I took away from Samsara. It's an exquisitely shot and deeply moving piece of work In 102 minutes Fricke and Magidson do a heck of a job in presenting as systemic a picture of the diversity and complexity of our societies and the Earth system processes they find themselves within whilst also hinting at the commonalities to be found everywhere also.It seems as if the media are being especially bleak at the moment. And being so incredibly moved by a film that couldn't be any more non-fiction provided a strong beam of optimistic light in the encroaching darkness. The level of connection to this planet and the people on it which Samsara can stimulate is truly something.After watching it, I returned to a YouTube comment that stood out for me. It said: "the feeling of awe is almost the ultimate antidote against existential despair. It's beautiful how they captured these everyday wonders that we are culturally conditioned to ignore". In a world showing worrying signs of tipping points, collapses and risks of futures that are incompatible with a civilised global community, Samsara is a reminder that it's the diversity of our cultures, our loves, our very existences that may ultimately unite us. If only we'd let it. Watch this film.</fullReview>

It just shows you strange things, without a hint of judgement. It is so visually overwhelming and varied, you do not get bored.It was filmed all over the world showing dramatic landscapes, architecture or human activity.It has a sound track, but no dialogue or narration. You are not even told where on earth you are. You have to figure out everything for yourself. It raises so many questions and gives you no way to answer them.It has a few clichés.1. showing a scene over a day in stop motion so the shadows race across the ground.2. showing people just quietly staring at the camera doing nothing. You get to study them.3. alternately showing opulence and desolation.What is the point of this movie? Showing you what a mind-blowing place our planet is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewers who have enjoyed Ron Fricke's work in the past know what they're in for, and "Samsara" delivers the goods. For people not familiar with his prior works: His films contain some of the most perfect cinematography ever put to screen, from a technical as well as aesthetical POV. The images are breathtaking and often provocative. Decay and bloom, culture and nature, quiet and loud, slow and fast - this film centers on strong contrasts, in cinematography as well as motifs. Scenes of beauty are in juxtaposition with ugliness and cruelty, and every few minutes people are staring at you with questioning eyes, daring you to construct meaning.If this film doesn't get 10/10 from me, it's because, as good as Fricke is from the technical POV, I would like his images to be a bit more adventurous. What we see here is extremely classic photography and cinematography, with very balanced screen layouts and contrasts and motifs - there's nearly nothing here to surprise me, nearly no frame that hasn't been shot before in a similar (if technically inferior) manner. Still highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful stream-of-consciousness documentary that explores the world inside and out even if it's sometimes too obvious and sometimes too ambiguous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samsara, Ron Fricke's spiritual sequel to Baraka 20 years later, is much of the same style with a wordless series of beautifully shot images set to a world music soundtrack. I saw Baraka a long time ago on perhaps a far too small screen and I can't remember it much, but I did think it was good even if it doesn't stand up to the similar Koyaanisqatsi, 10 years prior. Baraka was showing off the camera and perhaps required a cinema viewing and I'm glad I managed to see Samsara on the big screen. It has more of a purpose expressed through it's stream of consciousness style. Through the editing, many parallels of aspects of culture around the world are made, particularly in the contrasts with contrived reaction shots showing Fricke's opinion. Sometimes it is too obvious, and sometimes it's too ambiguous but sometimes it's very powerful and the image itself stands alone. While it has profound and therapeutic moments that are reminders of our place in the universe, it does focus on some unsettling sequences, such as an art drama scene with a man repeatedly covering and removing his face with clay, farm animals being harvested and sex dolls and robots up close.There's a distinct theme of eyes, both human and drawn, looking directly into the lens which while it gives the film a sense of intimacy, it adds to the unsettling nature as the film observes the audience and provokes reflection, even if that requires more staged moments than the natural spontaneity a documentary of this nature should have. Although the film lacks definitive structure, I was very glad to see that it returns to some of the things in its opening minutes later in the film. The time lapses and use of a crane were the best moments, especially when the styles were mixed up such as showing statues of human statues and the night sky revolving at exactly the right pace to get a sense of time. Samsara is a very passionate and patient film, though as we now live in an era of television with highly produced nature documentaries on everything imaginable, it doesn't particularly say anything that hasn't already been explored but it's always refreshing to feel a connection and a perspective on life around the world.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the past few years, I became quite excited to see Ron Fricke's latest film. Having previously seen his beautiful cinematography in the Qatsi trilogy and Baraka, I figured that Samsara would at least offer a splendid and visually stunning experience. I was just a little worried that the film wouldn't deliver on the same level as Baraka.Even though many viewers seem to favor Baraka over this, I found Samsara to have enough strengths of its own to stand out. I'm still trying to figure out which of the two films I enjoy better.On its own merits, Samsara offers a unique visual experience, as it explores many different countries and captures a plethora of exotic, unique, and inspiring sights. The film takes us through temples, mountains, volcanoes, cities, factories, nightclubs, a prison, and other interesting places that I'd probably never see in a lifetime. As usual, the film uses very solid, steady, and smooth photography to capture the settings and its people immaculately. Some shots are quite impressive; one such shot that stood out to me occurred when the camera flew over a cityscape, while it was being time-lapsed, so it showed the city lights and cars moving really fast with smooth streaking lights, while the camera moved and passed over the skyscrapers. There are plenty of other shots that utilize the time-lapse method, showing a sped-up view of things that makes the ordinary suddenly seem extraordinary.What really pushes the film above and beyond for me will be its occasional moments of weird, wild, impressionistic imagery. Key scenes that stand out to me include the shot of a man, shirtless and covered with tattoos, cuddling a baby gently and doting on him. There's some startling imagery of patients at a cosmetic surgery, juxtapose to scenes of a Japanese sex doll factory. There's a wild and energetic scene of Filipino prisoners doing a dance routine in the prison courtyard. There's a shot of some woman with a weird face mask and weird-looking eyes (just one of many odd portrait shots throughout the film). The one key scene that really propels the movie above and beyond in my viewpoint would be the scene about forty minutes in: in a nightmarish fashion, a man behind a desk suddenly smears clay all over his face and daubs himself with ink, until he appears ghoulish. It's odd stuff like this that not only invokes an emotional reaction and stirs the spirit, but also reveals the wild and unusual things in our world that we may or may not even be aware of.At first, I really wasn't sure what the point of these images was. As it goes on, the film does string up some common themes of death and rebirth, and of human civilization. It does so quite sublimely by putting the images together in a way that will make the audience put two-and-two together. The title Samsara is Sanskrit for "continuous flow," and that's pretty much what the film does: it continuously flows from one scene to another to allow for a continuous flow of thought and feeling.With its expert craftsmanship, exotic subject matter, and a wonderful music score, Samsara is a strong piece of work, and is definitely worth a look.5/5 (Experience: Very Good | Content: Very Good | Film: Perfect)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Samsara frequently juxtaposes contrasting images related to religion, birth, death, and transcendence. Each image, be it of pagodas in a mist or a baby's toes, could be right out of a splendid coffee table book of National Geographic pictures.So, this lyrical documentary can be appreciated on several levels such as photographic excellence, the ironies of nature, or the complexity of humanity. The decimation of the Ninth Ward in New Orleans can contrast with the beauty of a colorful sand Mandela carefully constructed and destroyed by Buddhist monks. The evanescence of human constructs and the permanence of Nature can further be highlighted by shots of the stone monuments in Arizona and Utah.Director Ron Fricke of Baraka (1992) teams again with producer Mark Magidson to employ Super Panavision 70 and time-lapse photography for jaw-dropping images in what Magidson calls "guided meditation." Although nonverbal, the message is clear: Man has yet to create enduring structures such as nature's, but splendid Mont St. Michel and the Dubai Tower are pretty good attempts.The multi-limbed goddess of Balinese dancers is both precious and colorful, a moving image of man's beauty that promises immortality. A flash-mob-like dance in a Filipino prison is as powerful an evocation of the contradictions in human nature as any of the monolithic constructs of nature.If you like cinematography, and even if you don't like heavy-handed messages, this film will give you beautiful images that you can see nowhere else, even when you see them in person?that's the magic of movies.</fullReview>

We had seen previews and knew what to expect but even then we were both mesmerized by the avalanche of extraordinary visuals that we saw. There was no dialogue; there was not plot; there were no silly Hollywood shootings or deaths; there were no massive car chases; there was no talking or silent humanoid animals making dumb wisecracking asides trying against all odds to be funny. No it was a visual display of what it means to be human and that is all the beauty that was required.The sheer technical aspects of making a film of this kind are quite staggering because of the amount of travel necessary to complete the project let alone considering the amount of research needed just to find the locations as well as selecting the shots and editing editing the monumental amount of visuals obtained.Viewers must be particularly judicious regarding their personal standards because some of those visuals are hard to digest (no pun intended.) The breadth of travel over the planet or at least the breadth of shot-selection will impress any viewer I am sure. If you are a humanist you owe it to yourself to attend a viewing; if you are a Christian (trust me they are different animals) then there is much that will upset you in this documentary/film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "point"? Life may not be futile but its purpose remains elusive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said about the breathtaking photography, spiritual overtones and mind-opening vistas offered by this truly majestic presentation. As other commentators have mentioned, to do it justice, Samsara really must be seen in an appropriate theater with high- definition projection and suitable sound equipment.I've just come back from the Bell TIFF complex (which provides all of the foregoing amenities and superbly comfortable seats as a bonus) where, with two friends, I saw the film immediately after which, while walking home together, we all speculated as to its 'point'. Many here have expressed their views some of which are interesting, insightful and even captivating. What follows is my take on Samsara:William Craig wrote a book some time ago about the absurdity of life in the absence of the existence of God. If everything leads to death with nothing beyond in a spiritually bereft universe, then what is the point of trudging along from day to day? But we humans are desperately indefatigable in our belief that, in one form or another, we are transcendent and at one with a Divine purpose.And so, as the movie so gorgeously demonstrates, we build ancient temples, adorn magnificent churches, wail at the wall, suffer the indignities of abject poverty in the midst of over-population and perhaps eke out a living plucking chickens and gathering salable waste from others' garbage - all because next to nothing will permit us to accept the notion that the breadth and depth of our experience begins and ends with our own lives and that there is absolutely no point nor purpose to our infinitesimally insignificant lives beyond what we choose to make if it whilst alive. For me, the movie's point was to remind me that while not all my life's efforts are futile ? beauty, peace and love can be ends in themselves ? life's purpose remains as elusive as is our comprehension of our oneness with the cosmos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incomparably powerful, a visual poem about humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond its visual glory, or its inspiring adaptation of the moving portrait, Samsara is a powerful visual poem on humanity. I felt extreme terror as well as wonder while watching this film, and eventually, I had made new realizations about the human condition, something which was clearly was an admirable goal of the directors.Man man seems newly enslaved by a society so rapidly evolving that it efficiently directs the imperfect behaviors of humans towards a collective goal, such that we begin to function as cells do in the human body: as the expendable building blocks of an unsympathetic and greater whole.If slavery and life are intertwined through the struggle against death, where then, is freedom? Idyll? No, that is impossible. Whence man could do something for nothing at all. Endless rows of factory workers performing the same rote task ad nausea represent a failure to achieve this. However, the contrasting images of enormous crowds of Muslims encircling the Kaaba, also minuscule cells in a larger construct, or of the group of monks who work tirelessly on something only to later destroy it, present a solution: freedom is merely the freedom to choose your own form of slavery, rather than be subject to one forced upon you by an external force or by laziness.I believe Ron Fricke was trying to communicate this, but that by ending the film with more of my favorite shot from the film, that of a pristine barren desert, wind echoing the silence of it all, he was also trying to take a step back form the overwhelming beauty and horror of life on this Earth and offer reconciliation: all we are is dust in the wind. One can fall back into the eternal caress of death, where even the suffering of an entire species can seem distant and unimportant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Samsara picks up where filmmaker Ron Fricke left off over a decade ago with his landmark Baraka, and is arguably every bit the equal of its esteemed predecessor. Before you wonder at the apparent mismatch between this comment and my rating indulge me...Both Samsara and Baraka contain haunting imagery. In the former case, whether it be a human swirl in Mecca, the clash of modern and primitive of African tribesman staring into the camera with an AK47 in hand, or, best of all, a nightmare-inducing performance by artist Olivier De Sagazan, parts of it will stay with you for a long time. On the whole, nobody can fault the visuals, largely justifying their rare and unforgiving capture-format, not to mention the ordeal it must have been to plan this multi-continental shoot.Sadly, Fricke fails to make it all amount to something intelligent. We've already seen odes to nature in the wake of destructive industrialization, most effectively in the Fricke- lensed Reggio-Glass Qatsi films. The argument was already rather simplistic then, it is dangerously muddled now: Fricke seems very partial to the beauty of nature and tribal ritual (with a strong positive bias towards Buddhism) and dead-set against modern isolation/Western industrialism. Yet some of his finest images contradict his own values: in the aforementioned case of bushmen holding machine-guns, which part of the image is meant to horrify us? The modern weapon ravaging a "pure" culture, or the idea of humans living in such prehistoric squalor and superstition in the 20th century? And are the monumental swarm around the Kaaba or the indulgence-sponsored interiors of the Vatican meant to be celebratory or cautionary? These questions might be provocative, but then that means doing the heavy lifting for the filmmakers. It all amounts to a collection of first-rate images, each of which asks an often interesting question, edited into an often confused and immature muddle. But is it worth seeing, if only once? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expecting no dialogue whatsoever and an apparent reliance on visuals obviously created sceptical feelings for me. I'm not particularly into what I can essentially describe as 'nature' documentaries, yet, I wanted to see this film... predominantly out of curiosity as providing absolutely zero dialogue throughout seems like a truly risky move. After somehow sitting through the approximate 102 minutes of beautiful cinematography and some captivating segments, and allowing a few days for this film to sink in... I'm still finding it hard to form a proper opinion. However, it is safe to say that I do seriously appreciate 'Samsara' - what it manages to achieve within such a small budget and an elaborate filming process spanning over almost five years is truly astonishing.There is no doubt about it; the cinematography in this film is practically flawless. Every single shot is evidently crafted with masterful precision, accompanied by a beautifully fitting soundtrack throughout, and edited to the highest standard making the whole film flow nicely with its diverse range of settings and locations. In addition to this, it was truly fascinating to see more of the world - Fricke seems to construct these aesthetically pleasing shots with subtle meaning and undertones, and once again, it's all accomplished in a smooth manner despite the constant change of locations and thus colour palettes. The entire film just flows so nicely, exhibiting parts of the world and allowing its spectator to be educated in the most subtle yet profound way imaginable. The most captivating segment to me personally was the sequence involving Tibetan Monks, as I don't take a particular interest in learning about other cultures... this segment essentially opened my eyes to how delightfully diverse the planet earth actually is. The film does also of course explore the negative aspects to our world, and the pure subtlety in which everything is presented makes it all the more intriguing.Sadly, I must admit that getting through 'Samsara' within one sitting and no breaks is somewhat difficult, and at times makes the film transition into a 'snorefest' of sorts. The best way I can describe my viewing of this film is to say I have 'experienced' it, I appreciate everything it showcases and how it is constructed. However... it is not exactly a film I would call "enjoyable", "entertaining" or even "exciting". I'd recommend to view it in segments with subtle breaks, in order to completely absorb every gorgeous image and its tone. 'Samsara' is undoubtedly an achievement in film-making, and I applaud everyone involved in the process of creating this enchanting piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without interest, but vastly inferior to its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1993, filmmakers Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson presented a deeply moving portrait of features universal to all human societies, warned of ecological collapse, and depicted how technology was changing our lives in BARAKA. Shot on 70mm film, this was one of the most visually impressive films ever made, and its lack of any dialogue or narration allowed viewers to engage in their own individual reflections about the panorama on the screen. Two decades later, the team returned with SAMSARA, a sequel that wasn't really necessary.One reason that SAMSARA is not very good is that it often seems a shot-for-shot repeat of BARAKA. The filmmakers revisit many of the same locations (such as Thai prostitutes, a chicken-processing plant, home appliance factories, landfill gleaners). Again Buddhism, the Ka'aba and high church Christianity are depicted, but because the film does not go on to any other religions than what was on BARAKA, these rituals feel this time like cheap exoticism instead of unquenchable anthropological curiosity. SAMSARA also lacks the dramatic arc of BARAKA, coming across as a random succession of images instead of the journey from sacredness to horror and back that we found in its predecessor.That is not to say that SAMSARA is completely without interest. There is an astonishing clip of performance artist Olivier de Sagaza, and the freakish Dubai landscape is depicting in a detail that few (even those who have been there) have seen. SAMSARA is all in all a darker film, and while depictions of the wreckage of Katrina, a Wyoming family that are proud to own an arsenal of guns, and a wounded veteran may fail to really shock viewers in the West who have already been exposed to such images for years, scenes of garish funerals in Nigeria and Indonesian men making the rounds in a sulphur mine (even though they know it is killing them) are stirring and memorable. Of course the visuals are rich, and in Bluray format on my HD projector the film is just as stunningly detailed as its predecessor.However, SAMSARA lacks enough new things to say, it surprisingly doesn't offer continual rewards on rewatching, and just by the fact that it exists out there it potentially dilutes the impact of BARAKA, once a singular film. I was entertained enough to give this a 3-star rating, but I would still recommend BARAKA, and even for those who have seen and loved BARAKA, I would not recommend moving on to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>essence of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried watching this documentary when it came out. I somehow couldn't. A few days ago I came across it again and started watching it, but stopped after just a couple of minutes. I realized I needed full concentration &amp; total attention. This wasn't just another documentary movie you watch while you do your crosswords or paint your nails. This is a real thing! If you watched Ron Fricke's famous 'Baraka' this one will remind you of it, but while the first one is more civilization-oriented, maybe even old-fashioned nowadays, in the years of the peak in robotics and genetic engineering, the second is more culturally focused and it deals with social differences and issues that many who are busy running through social media life may foresee, or don't know. This film will make you wish you didn't skip your history and geography classes. It will make you wish that you are a billionaire with freedom to spend his entire lifetime on traveling to distant places, breathing into the unbelievable scenery and unimaginable products of human brain. It will also make you feel very grateful because you have a nice home, warm and cozy bed and cooked dinner on your table. Its scenes will make you want to be terribly angry at times because the world is a cruel place, not immune to the rules that belong to animals only, as some think. It will make you feel powerless, yet trying to grasp why such opposites are necessary. It will make you question do you really need one more pair of jeans, new mobile phone or should all that you invest in be your knowledge at first and foremost. Scenes will changes quickly and each will make you want to hit pause and just think about it, discuss, investigate and you won't be alone -its music will be guiding you to a long, deep meditation but without trying to avoid bad, uncomfortable feelings or visualizing reality was different, because it is not. Beauty and essence of life are in the polarities.But, if you want instant opinions and observations that somebody chewed for you, you will soon come to understand that the true magic of this magnificent film begins once it is the end and you get a strong urge to begin talking about it with others. We are all 'Samsara' and we are all here for a reason. If this movie made you accept, no matter how hard it was, that life is like a sand that only revives when the wind starts to blow and swirl, then it means you passed your test of mindful, purposeful and conscious living on this earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that's absolutely necessary in today's world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An important work of art that needs to be seen, not so much for the enjoyment factor but as a reactionary piece. No matter what you or I think about this collage of sight and sound?whether positive or negative?the fact that we react at all is what matters. Ron Fricke is able to comment on the current state of humanity more effectively with his images and the way they are presented than narrative alone ever could. Everything throughout the running time unravels very slowly, even when Fricke uses time-lapse photography to speed everything up. While being an extremely good technique for lulling the viewer into the film's pace, it also seems to be saying, "Slow down. It's okay to step outside of the constant overstimulation from living in just about any modern western society and breathe for a bit. There was a time before life was this way, and it still exists in the world."I went into this expecting something akin to Godfrey Reggio's Qatsi Trilogy, but Fricke can be much more confrontational at times. The imagery can jump from the serene to the surreal with no warning, which makes the latter scenarios all the more frightening when you realize that this person staring back at you might actually be looking at you. The phenomenal sound design adds to these bizarre moments, which reach their apex when performance artist Olivier de Sagazan does what he does best. An amazing scene that's more than just a little unnerving.There's so much to take in upon first viewing that I'm sure I'll dive into this again soon. Perhaps visiting Baraka before coming back would be a good idea. Either way, it's clear that this is an important film, one that I believe can be very beneficial to anyone who is willing to open up to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot accurately describe everything that is communicated from viewing the film but that perhaps is the point of it all. There are no words spoken here, only observations--of humanity and our obliviousness to the intricate Samsara that has taken place throughout the history of this universe. It is shown that mankind is no better than the creatures that it dominates, that we are not supreme beings of intelligence - that perhaps we are simply fatally flawed to repeat the mistakes of our ancestors whether we realize it or not. Yet that does not mean we are doomed to a reality of meaninglessness; instead it might suggest that our lives are canvases which are blank and completely up to us to fill as we so choose to; and that our choices and actions all contribute to the final story that our completed work expresses. Movies like this wake you up to the possibility that through consciousness we can perhaps become each of our own individual masters--by using our lives to tell beautiful stories of meaning and free expression, rather than the opposite which to me this film cautiously warns will happen if we collectively live consciously unaware.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Depth of this Film is Not Immediately Apparent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samsara in ancient Sanskrit means something like "the cycle of death and rebirth". It has also come to mean the cycle of suffering and attachment to the world of outer form in some of the Buddhist traditions. In this film we see incredible, endless hyper-vivid images of every facet of life on planet earth. One is left with a sense that it is all kind of crazy, all arising and passing away endlessly. It is fascinating, beautiful, ugly, banal, comic and tragic at the same time. Endless creations, endless struggling, toiling, consuming, creating, packaging, separating, putting back together. Samsara shows the whole big mess, although I felt it could have gone much farther showing the violence, destruction, depravity, gluttony and endless consumption. But if it had gone farther it may have made people too uncomfortable and alienated part of its audience. On the whole is played an artful boundary between engaging our sense of the aesthetic and showing us the unconscious, ever-churning patterns that direct movement on the planet. When we become aware of these patterns, they are no longer unconscious.... they are now a choice.</fullReview>

Emotions such as sadness, peacefulness, joy, amazement, disgust, confrontation, confusion, compassion, sensuality, but most significant of all; my insignificance in the sea of humanity.I went expecting to see a film that was a celebration of the pure beauty that can be found in the range of cultures and experiences that makes up our present humanity. That profound beauty was there but also there was the ugliness of humanity as well.A movie to see alone or to see with others.I think everyone who sees it will come out with their own interpretation and experience of the movie depending on their own personal journey and experiences to that point in their lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this movie on Blue Ray and Im wishing I had watched it in the theatres. The images and cinematography in this is stunning. Absolutely brilliant camera work, the camera angles, perspectives, colours, the time lapse photography etc.This movie is like a "yin and yang" of the world we live in. The images flow from one to another showing that there is two sides to everything. An example would be scenes of big modern cities and factories followed by scenes showing the overcrowding and pollution. Wealth and poverty. 2 scenes come to mind, prisoners in a Phillipino prison performing choreograph dancing in the exercise yard but under the watchful eyes of the wardens. The dancing prisoner's smiles contrasting with the sober faces of prisoners in their cells. Anotherscene is that of robots with human features, a sex doll factory and ladyboy dancers.Some parts of this movie touched me with it beauty, others shocked me and some saddened me. Incredible for a movie with no words.Even if you do not like documentaries or the subject and flow of the narrative, you will appreciate the skill involved in making this movie. This is ART.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life's a Colorful Cruel Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Film captures exactly the great practical joke that is the Human condition. There is just enough beauty to hold the ugliness in check. Life offers an enormous amount of unnecessary suffering and despair only to keep depression at bay with doses of beauty and charity and sacrifice.Watching this enormously engrossing visual landscape the heart is both warmed and broken. The extremely insensitive and uncompromising modernity, all destined to disintegrate into the sands of time. The Film lays out the beautiful coating of our Planet, but its underbelly is a constant and bizarre barrage of destruction and decay, some natural, some not so. It is a superficial existence with a lush and plush feeling, but also with a nagging reminder that things can get really ugly really fast.This can be a hard watch, at times, and that is ironic because of some of the sumptuous images. However, it truly and without apology, offers those breathtaking portrayals along with the other side. That offensive, disturbing, and unattractive side. It seems to say, it's a colorful cruel joke this here Life, and the Filmmaker is in on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The use of speed to hasten and slow down the objects, events and processes documented guide the viewer to really both objectify and acknowledge what's being recorded: whether it's the sun across the Methuselah Tree or the butchering of pigs in an Asian slaughterhouse. While it wouldn't be accurate to say Samsara hasn't got an agenda, the viewer is nonetheless forced to respond by the absence of voice over and any kind of titling. While a feast for the eyes and ears, its experiential interface is quite blatantly in each viewer's own mind and heart, in the midst of his or her own values and prejudices and must be likewise responded to internally. I would say that no two people would respond the same way to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing eye &amp; ear candy, but......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really wanted to love this movie. Decades ago I sat mesmerised by the power and beauty of Koyaanisqatsi in '82, followed by the various "qatsi's" over the next few years (that were good but never quite hit the mark like the original). Then in '92 there was Baraka that finally rivaled and frankly bettered Koyaanisqatsi in many areas. When they restored Baraka recently, watching that film was like watching a new movie. Absolutely stunning.I heard amazing reviews of Samsara, and perhaps that was the problem - I came in expecting something that built on what had come before, taking the experience to a new level..... instead, what I found was a set of sometimes disjointed images. Frequently I felt as though I was looking at a stream of some absolutely stunning computer wallpapers or screen savers, the only thing linking them being the music backing.Don't get me wrong. This is a beautiful film. I am definitely going to watch it again. The cinematography is generally flawless. The quality of many of the images are absolutely stunning. In this respect it matches - and possibly is better than - Baraka. The audio side (music etc) also is excellent. Just - in my opinion - it is possibly the least coherent movie of these non-narrative documentary films. If you loved this film, and haven't seen Baraka (or haven't seen the restored version), put it down on your 'must see' list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed something peculiar about the dozens of theatre audience members I saw "Samsara" with. During the end credits, most of them didn't leave right away. Some people left, but when the credits were over, there were still a lot of people, including me, of course. Is this normal? Isn't it usually the opposite where many people leave a theatre during a film's end credits with maybe some people staying until the credits are over? My best guess is that these people who saw "Samsara" with me were deeply moved by the film like I was. Maybe the people who left during the credits were moved, too. Whatever people generally thought of the film for that screening, their behaviour at the end was unusual."Samsara" is a perfect example of how powerful a film can be without words. There almost aren't any here. It relies on camera shots, editing, and music. They go together like bread and wine. Ron Fricke documents various countries on the planet like China, Jordan, and Brazil. There's lots to see. Factory workers, dancing prisoners, marchers, big cities, custom-made coffins, etc. People sometimes look at the camera like in my all-time favourite film "Koyaanisqatsi", another documentary which is similar to "Samsara". Ron Fricke also had a big hand in it.What does the title mean? According to the Free Dictionary website, it means, "The eternal cycle of birth, suffering, death, and rebirth." I see how it ties into the film, such as the scene of children being baptized and the aforementioned coffins. One of the coffins looks like a friggin' gun and is used for a funeral. Guns and bullets are shown in the film, as well, which is also connected to the title. However, if we take away the title, would I still be able to identify themes from the film? Probably. Before writing this review, I admittedly didn't have much of an idea as to what the film is trying to say and I didn't know what the title meant. Maybe the film is trying to represent this planet. I like that idea.It goes without saying that I watched "Samsara" in awe. My eyes were open wide. I nearly cried not near the end, but near the beginning. I wanted to reach out to the screen. Hell, I wanted to be in the film. I really don't think it's heavy-handed. It's rather subtle. As I wrote in my review of "The Tree of Life", I don't often have an extremely mesmerizing cinematic experience. Well, I'm incredibly thankful I got to have it again.</fullReview>

Buddhists meticulously draw pictures with grains of sand then sweep them away, showing that the world will pass on, as it always does, over and over. We see lots of sad staring faces, people who look beaten, and the only ones who smile in the movie are Buddhist children.A performance artist creates a clay face over and over again, attempting to create a new identity or self, or perhaps being reborn, and always ending up with the same thing, an ugly, horrid facsimile of a human being which is torn away to create another ugly, horrid facsimile of a human being..Does it matter what else is shown from our world? Most of it is depressing and sad. We see the bad side of our existence, the good side, the fun loving side, but through it all there is a sense that it's all wrong somehow. That the fun parts are superficial and robotic, and that the bad parts are permanently ingrained in society and only destined to get worse. The message is simple, we have failed, and now rebirth is inevitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"With no spoken dialogue throughout Samsara is a documentary met to show the audience all the beautiful imagery that exists throughout the whole entire world" Sometimes I believe that we as a civilisation living on this planet take for granted all the natural beauty that exists but we never look for. The film is a documentary that was filmed over the period of five years. The film does not have an aim of story to follow because with no spoken dialogue in the film they point of the film seems to be showing the audience the changing landscapes and beauty in even the smallest things around the whole entire globe.The film as I said contains no narrative as we are transported to the world as we have never seen in before. Some of the imagery presented in the film is large landscapes which look like the ones on postcards, then these landscapes are changed by the light reflected on them but also by time of day the camera is filming these landscapes. Every scene in this film seems very photographic but then the picture will move slightly showing us more to admire. The film also focuses on people looking straight into the camera and these people have such power in their eyes as they display their emotions through their eyes. The film does contain many scenes that move quite quickly as we see many workers working in places. These shots could only have been achieved by many hours of filming only to become faster for the film.Most of the imagery in the film becomes forgettable quickly only because another one is about to come onto the screen. The main image that was hard to watch in the film was a part in the film when they showed factory life which included the killing of many animals but also how they achieved the processed meat that most people would buy at their locals stores. The images moved fast which was good but still watching it was hard to see. However their were some strange images which came mostly from the people in the film which included a man painting himself in his office, many African people who were painted and a flash mob in a prison as we see the cramped spaces in there too.The film moved slowly because we saw so much. Even if the film was as great looking it still lacked for me only because with some standout images came some other ones that I have such a hard time remembering.MOVIE GRADE: C+</fullReview>

It juxtaposes ancient and modern cultures, it juxtaposes urban and rural wonders, it juxtaposes the achievements of civilizations across the continents. All that being said, it has a musical score that tends toward the spiritual/new age/minor chords for the majority of the film. It would be a different viewing experience listening to more upbeat music or even music in the major chords. I am not saying throw away the total score, but shift 30% towards a lighter sensibility.

		<fullReview>There is no doubt Samsara is visually breathtaking. But it is not only about nice "pictures" or the good and bad face of humanity. The logic of this movie follows the rules of the classic fascist aesthetics. It is about greatness in every level, a totally megalomaniac scale on what Mr. Ron Fricke thinks about the world. Come on, who the hell believes that the US is only about buying, eating and guns? who thinks that in certain communities there are no bad things, like the scenes in Nepal or with the Maasai people. Only the innocence of the children and the sacred art. South-America is about the favelas and trash collectors? It is a tradition in Europe(US as well) that people are looking for untouched lands and holiness in the Far-East, but come on, it is obviously a lie. Without a "script" it works only as a photo collage, not more.I cannot believe that Fricke sees the world in that simple way. Our information about the world is more layered and more complex, than guns and McDonalds are bad and Buddhism is good. How they connect the scenes is also a bit clumsy. After the industry of weapons we can see a dead man, who is buried in a gun shaped coffin. So the message of the movie is equally deep like a summer blockbuster and they even doesn't let you think about it, they make it so obvious for you, that you only have to accept their ideas. That is why I say that this is an old fashioned propaganda movie. Luckily it doesn't serve any ideology, but it could have been an amazing experience...what a pity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a picture is worth a thousand words, Samsara will take a lifetime to read</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A common quote I've heard several times before is "A picture is worth a thousand words". It depends on what picture you're looking at but if you're watching Samsara then its images will take a lifetime to read.Filmed over a period of 5 years in 25 countries, Samsara transports us to disaster zones, enormous cities, and natural landmarks as we get to witness breathtaking imagery.This movie is unlike any other film I have ever seen. It has no words, no plot, and no characters. Its only purpose is to present us with dozens upon dozens of overwhelmingly beautiful photographs featuring many wonders around the world. Just about every single shot is masterfully filmed. I could take almost every single photo from the movie, hang it on a poster on my wall, and admire it for years. This movie displays some of the most beautiful images I have ever seen before.The music is also great too. But most of the time, you won't notice it because you'll be distracted on a great shot. However, the music is just noticeable and quiet enough to give you a good feeling and you'll find that it immerses you even more into the film even when you pay more attention to the shots. It works with the movie very well and it engaged me even more.I really want to give this a 5/5 but there were a few sequences which bugged me. One of the scenes contained a group of female strippers dancing around in a circle. The other one contained a slaughter house and it showed us animals getting turned into food (don't worry, it's not too graphic). There were also a few other scenes which didn't interest me. Those scenes kind of took me out of the experience for a bit because I didn't feel that they looked as dazzling as many of the other scenes in the movie. Fortunately, there were only a few of those scenes in the entire film but it did annoy me a great deal when those sequences happened.Despite the few weaker sequences, I for one extremely enjoyed the film. I can safely say that I've felt more engaged in this movie then almost every other film I've ever seen before (even some of my top 10 favorite movies of all time). If you're a fan of photography then this is definitely the biggest must-see film ever. I might check out Ron Fricke's other 2 films (Baraka and Chronos) sometime in the future to see if they can match up to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samsara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the photo arsehole that I am, enjoying pictures at jaunty angles, my girlfriend bought me the remastered version of the 1992 film 'Baraka'. Featuring some of the world's beauty spots, and America, as well as (in)famous religious and political landscapes, the film is a documentary-like collection of lingering shots and sped-up scenes of the world as it rotates.Remastered, the shots look stunning, despite being originally released at the same time as 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York', and is a feast for the eye and mind. Twenty years on, 'Samsara' (Sanskrit for 'to flow on') is a follow up piece, shot by director Ron Fricke.Again, probably shot over a number of years in a number of different countries and locations, 'Samsara' is very much more of the same from where 'Baraka' left off. Similar shots of a sped-up night sky over desert rocks are used, as well as various different religious figures going about their daily business. Having watched 'Baraka' only days before seeing it, you can wonder what the need for 'Samsara' is.But while 'Baraka' focuses mainly on landscapes and geographic elements, its successor looks much more to human geography and images of modern humanity. This is probably where the film lacks a little, as shots of tattooed-up, LA gangbangers, the dancing Filipino prisoners of Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC) or the Ladyboys of Bangkok are neither new nor particularly that interesting. Rather than capturing people in more natural states in 'Baraka', here it feels like there are too many staged dance routines, performance art and a slightly forced image of a geisha shedding a single tear.There is still room for the juxtapositions of those in one part of the world creating a vice for those in another: those in South America making the cigarettes for those in Japan to smoke becomes Chinese and Danish factory farming feeding obese Americans. Again though, these are not particularly new concepts or ideas ? a difficulty when shooting a film over a number of years. Images of Chinese factories seem almost purely recycled from 2007's 'Manufactured Landscapes' and only add to a sense of 'it's been done.'But having said that, while 'Samsara' is no longer as original as what has come before it, it is still a good cinematic experience to see some of the more interesting spots on the planet shot from increasingly jaunty angles, and show that to make a film look superior all you need is good cinematography and some creativity?though I do still feel that my camera-work at Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto is much better, as does everybody else.www.politic1983.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing image of our consumer loop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot hide my obsession with Ron's movies. This is only because he is one of the greatest directors ever walked the earth. Samsara is a step above Baraka. Yes, you could experience some reminiscence from old images, and maybe one day you'll understand why. And then - oh snap, this is even greater movie than I thought. The old scenes are enriched with the human impact in them, converting all in life, death and rebirth (even God) in a consumer product which can be bought for a prize. Consumerism turns your existence into Samsara.I felt strong criticism in this roll. I know Ron and Mark are way beyond this, but I felt it personally. The "Corporate Horror" scene deeply shocked me; the thousand hands shot was simply out of this world ? the girl came from another world and woke up into ours, just to remind us that we are creatures, we could create such beauty in our life too, not to consume it ? then left again. Even Batman is there to give justice again, but seems not successfully for everyone.However, anyone will find his scene in there, I can assure you that! Samsara is for those who are ready to travel beyond different understandings and visions for existence, ready to quit the consumer loop. For these who are currently consumed by life, death and divine ? Ron left a tic-tac's. They'll turn into pumpkins with the time.Ron's movies will walk with you throughout your whole life. Some scenes will flash into your memory once you wake up into your reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Wheel of life' make eyeballs spin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Samsara' which means wheel of life gives a holistic view on birth, life and death. It broadly puts light on our existence in the modern world and as Ron Fricke says the film is 'a guided meditation'. It's a visual poetry somewhat similar to the direction style of Terence Malick.A religious aspect in Samsara Samsara explores a belief present in many of the Asian religions and other beliefs such as Scientology that, life and birth is a continuous process wherein the soul is transferred from one body to another. The movie also highlights belief of life after death in some of the scenes such as the sequences of gun manufacturers, gun shaped coffin and infant being baptized. It also depicts a religious belief of 'karma' meaning action, present in Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Buddhist religions, which causes entire cycle of cause and effect.Fricke's earlier works like Koyaanisqatsi, Chronos and Baraka are hard to forget and this movie joins their legacy. Ron Fricke fans will definitely await to see the next one in 3d.For complete review which may contain some spoilers(no major plot details) visit our website..!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful! I love a movie that leaves me feeling that I have experienced and connected with part of life. I loved every bit of Samsara... I slowly slipped away into the ethereal world-music soundtrack... scenes bringing me awe... many scenes a bit of sadness, humility... and the reality of human affairs... appealing to my sense of responsibility and compassion... It was so creative... and so varied... evoking so many emotions... as maybe one would expect from a movie called Samsara... which denotes the circle of life... the flow of time... death... birth... death... and the return and interplay of the seasons. As I mentioned earlier... it left me feeling as if I had experienced a part of life... more life... and connected with more life... realizing more my part... my very humble role in life... and the power of the human spirit... the irreverent forces of nature... and the sublime beauty and sometimes beautiful sadness of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly was the only person in the theater possibly because it was an afternoon performance and thus I had no annoying distractions that one usually encounters at the movies. I found the scenes absolutely stunning, sort of reminded me of National Geographic photos. My problem, and it was major, is that I mostly had no idea of what I was looking at. Some narration or on screen writing, like they do for subtitled films,would have been greatly appreciated. Stayed until all the credits ran just to get some idea of what I had just seen and where it all was filmed. The scenes were mostly powerful and maybe a world traveler would have enjoyed it more. Highly recommend just for the almost meditation type religious feeling of the work visually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is way out there. It's long and it's raw, but it never bores. It can sometimes force you to question the sanity of the director, but it won't allow you to question his ethics. If beings from another world were to wonder about life on Earth today, this would be an excellent introduction to the dominant species.Still, I'm certain that this movie could have lasted twice or thrice the time and never do more than scratch the surface of the topic(s).You MUST see this movie, if only to get a fleeting glimpse at other cultures and other places.I'll give you no details. You must see this with no prejudice at all.WATCH IT! NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flow of life on this planet, both for better and for worse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have been told that there are six degrees of separation between us and every other person on this planet. The census conducted in 2000 revealed that our population had passed 7.4 billion. That is a lot of sixes to divide up. If you are in doubt about that theory, all you need to do is seek out an extraordinary new film named "Samsara", a wordless, sight and sound documentary from filmmaker Ron Fricke that was shot on 70mm and features hi-def images from over 70 countries, shot over 5 years in an effort to capture the flow of life on this planet, both for better and for worse."Samsara" follows in the footsteps of Fricke's two previous films, "Cronos" made in 1985 and "Baraka", made in 1992. His mission, in all three films, is to capture glimpses of humanity without auditory comment. He wants the images to speak for themselves. Like the other two films, this one also contains a musical soundtrack that comments on the images we are seeing, not just background noise but an emotional backdrop. Try imagining if National Geographic conducted a symphony and you've got the idea. "Samsara" contains no dialogue, no actors, no story. It simply takes us around the world to different and often very remote places and reminds us that even in the hyper-active information age of the 21st century, there are still places on earth untouched by bulldozers, strip malls, parking lots, Starbucks or McDonald's. There are still natural wonders to behold. There are still grand religious rituals that take place. There is still great pageantry to the world. The film opens with a ritualistic dance featuring three Cambodian girls with very bizarre looks on their faces. We are privy to a group of Tibetan monks making sand sculptures. Those scenes are a wonder to behold, while others like a bizarre lingering shot of a performance artist who rubs clay on his face brings the movie to a dead stop.The rest of the film is astonishing. What seems to be just a travelogue of images actually has a buried, message. With "Baraka", Fricke attempted to visualize the evolution of man. "Samsara" seems to have a much darker message. He begins with magnificent shots of God's natural beauty (mountains, deserts, waterfalls, volcanoes) juxtaposed with man's religious architecture (The Vatican; a Burmese pagoda; a Tibetan temple), both show us beautiful monuments but none-the-less prove that God still has the better paintbrush. The point is to show the flow of nature and how it effects and inspires man.Then the movie moves into a series of scenes that reveal another purpose. The mechanized world (seen with the camera sped-up) is viewed through man's dependence upon machines. One series of images begins in a computer factory in China where the pieces are assembled; then we move to the check-out line of a discount store in America, where we see thousands of electronic gizmos being purchased; then we see a garbage dump in Brazil where poor peasants risk vermin and disease to pick over a garbage dump of parts we've thrown out. This is all done in fast motion and the effect, along with the message, is astonishing.There is a short but devastating sequence in a factory that processes chickens. We see the process of manufacturing those McNuggets that we had probably hoped never to see. That's followed by a sequence involving cows hooked up to a milking machine on a conveyor belt that looks like something out of "Logan's Run". The message is that something in the flow of nature has gone off the rails. We've upset the balance of our natural world with conveyor belts, stainless-steel chutes and rendering plants. The movie wants us to understand that our modern conveniences outside of the natural order have consequences. Take, for example, a scene in a factory that makes handguns and rifles. We see the weapons being manufactured, then cut to a trio of gun nuts proudly holding their rifles aloft. That's followed by the image of a badly scarred soldier who might want to have a chat with them.That is minor, but the message is made clear. The other striking continuity of "Samsara" is its focus on women. There are more women in this film than men, mostly seen in close-up. We see lots of women in religious dance, in tribal rituals and on the job. Many times we see women with their children as motherhood becomes a buried theme. You don't notice it at first, but there is a contrast here between the giving of life (mother and child) and the taking of life (the guns and the chicken factory). One of the first images is of a baby in the womb, and there is a sort of celebration of the fact that the woman's body is a temple from which life is created. That is juxtaposed with the man made intention of turning women into sex objects. We see dozens of women in a club dancing in bikinis with numbers on their hips, almost like cattle. What is suggested is that the leering quality of sexual promiscuity seems to break up the greater purpose of the original reproductive order.In spite of all the buried messages and the images of life and death, you walk out of "Samsara" feeling that you have experienced the world in a fresh new way. The film represents one of the great pleasures of breaking away from simple-minded Hollywood event films. This is a film that no only entertains you (oh my does it entertain) but it also gives you something to take with you when it is over. Just as with "Baraka" you walk away with a strange sense that you have a different view of the world around you and a better appreciation of the simple joys of being human.**** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film released in 2012 - no question!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may very well be the worst thing I will ever write: a completely artless review with no sense of direction or control. It will not come anywhere near doing justice to the extraordinary film it is praising, and so any kind of forced rhetorical flourish here would be perfunctory and out-of-place. So I apologise in advance. I can only do my best.'Samsara' (which, if IMDb is to be believed, is a Sanskrit word meaning 'cyclic existence') contains almost not a word of dialogue, and certainly not in any kind of 'narrative' sense. It belongs to a very small niche of films, often given the name of 'pure cinema'. The only films I can even compare 'Samsara' to, however, are a select few that our director, Ron Fricke, has previously worked on: those past masterpieces 'Koyaanisqatsi', 'Chronos' and 'Baraka'. All are utterly distinctive pieces of cinema in their own right, and this new release is no different. How can I describe 'Samsara'? In cliché, as a profound visual experience? I may have to resort to that later, to even give an inkling of how powerful this film is. As a compilation of stunningly photographed images and sequences, set to a haunting, disconcertingly calculated soundtrack? I refuse to describe any of those images here; it would be a betrayal on my part. They must be witnessed for themselves. Maybe then as a philosophical work? Indeed, I cannot argue with the fact that the philosophical issues it raises are some of the most important facing mankind. I do not and will not pretend to understand everything shown in 'Samsara'; I firmly believe that a viewer cannot actually understand the entire film in any concrete way. That is not to say that, throughout much of the film, we are not intended to feel shame, or guilt, or awe, or reverence. Ron Fricke is not a man without an opinion, and this film is underpinned all the way through with the wealth of emotion that this person feels in considering the world we live in. But he does not preach. His choice of images is subjective, but he raises questions. He does not give answers. 'Samsara' is a film of vast ambition and deep humility. Its aim is no less than exploring the blunt fact of human existence on a wondrous Earth with a selective, but passionate and observant eye, and the societies we have created and separated into, the effect our existence has on the world around us. Yet even this description is reductive. The film's profundity lies in its interaction with the audience. It is a film from which you take away what you have put in. The richness of your experience when viewing 'Samsara' relies heavily on how willing you are to go along with it and recognise what Fricke is trying to show us. Your reaction to it is your own affair, but you will have a reaction. The accumulation of these emotional responses is what makes this film so utterly unforgettable; and indeed, perhaps this is the real reason that this kind of movie is considered to be 'pure cinema'. Because, after all, film (usually) succeeds when it successfully provokes a series of emotional reactions in an audience, and their accumulation. Rarely has a film so perfectly and forcefully played on that fact than 'Samsara'. It has taken five years of painstaking work to make this film. The love and passion that has gone into its production pours from every image, every carefully composed shot and forcefully edited sequence. I have never sat in a cinema before to watch a new release and witnessed the reaction that 'Samsara' provoked among a cinema audience. The screen went black, the credits began to roll, and the room burst into applause. How could it not do? I sincerely doubt that such a disturbing and rapturous meditation on our planet has been produced before now (and here I consider Baraka, Chronos and Koyaanisqatsi as companion pieces to Samsara, even though they retain their own remarkable individuality). I came out of the weekend screening of this film knowing three things. The first, that this is the reason I go to the cinema ? to witness and experience emotions like that, to witness the reaction of an audience completely bowled over by what they have just seen, especially when we believe we have seen it all, that cinema has nothing new to offer. The second, that I would be paying to see it again on Tuesday. And the third? That 'Samsara', without a shadow of a doubt, is the best film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual but Slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful camera work is the good aspect of Samsara, while a scattered, sometimes tedious unevenness of absolutely no dialogue make this film a long viewing. The opening and closing segments are my favorites; a line of Asian women, front to back, in bright yellow costumes, dancing in synchronicity like a flower with their arms creating a breathtaking flow which is something to see. The problem is the strange jump from one quick theme to another seems quite random. A line of people all dressed exactly alike go into a factory where each is seen assembling part of a finished product. We later see a huge garbage dump, where it eventually ends up. The consumer society is now global. Another interesting part is in the Middle East, as Arabs recite Muslim prayers and Jews pray at the Wailing wall with the same intensity, each to their own particular god. Overall, it is a view of the world from many different perspectives. This should be watched on a big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like watching a 2 hour screen saver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a start my favourite genre of film is documentaries, they are informative as they are entertaining, something of which if done correctly is very hard to produce.Having not seen this at a theater as the directer would have wanted me to (to produce a cinematic visual experience) I chose the next best option via a 50" high def with blue-ray and 7.1 sound.Yes at parts you can understand why you need to see this as the directer wanted you to but come on do you really need to see thing's like a man in a suit rub mud on his face for 2 mins in HD 70mm film, or what about people stacking toilet roll, blank expression face's (about 20 of them throughout the film), people stuffing their face's with burgers, the list goes on and on.Documentaries are meant to be informative yet this film is silent apart from the monotonous soundtrack on repeat. The only score that was slightly engaging came from Lisa Gerrard and that did not last long or placed in the correct part of the film (during people foraging in a rubbish dump). Due to this you did not know where the film was shot and you would have no idea where in the world this was unless you have been there. You learnt nothing from it and most locations have been seen a million times before on national geographic however you learnt something from them. This was just like a 2 hour long screen saver from a well know search engine.I have been fortunate enough to visit most of the 25 countries that were shot during the 5 year making of this film yet for me not the best shots were chosen. I have seen the sun rise on top of an Inca temple, this is something I will take to the grave with me yet it was never shown. Dubai has some biblical landscapes yet these where hardly shown, a slight shot of the burj khalifa was far from eye candy yet the editor thought the audience would rather see two woman walking in the Emirates mall shopping??. Badly shot Palm Jumeirah and the unfinished world project?The only award this film won was from the Dublin film awards, not exactly Cannes is it and for fair reason. Having watched it for myself I can only give this film a 3 out of 10, and that was for some of the epic shots. Must try harder next time!</fullReview>

Spoiler Alert! An African woman mean mugs a camera for 2 minutes! A white guy in a suit and tie rubs clay on his face, and plays with permanent markers! Fascinating!..that it took five years to piece together a bunch of RANDOM eye catching images. In the last 20 minutes, this is whats crossed my screen. Pigs, cows, and chickens being processed, a fat guy gets a line drawn on his belly, a room full of inanimate sex dolls, strippers (not stripping BTW) and more sex dolls. Figure that out! Mostly what you get out of this is "look at these weird people". Other than that the only message you could take from this ass of a movie is purely cynical. If you really enjoy judging people by their appearances, this is the movie for you! GAHBITCH!</fullReview>
