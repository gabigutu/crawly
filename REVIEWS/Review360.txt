		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Feel Good Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Hairspray the movie at the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle--the same theater where Hairspray the musical premiered five years ago. It could be that I am just dizzied by the dashing good looks of Zac Efron, but the magic that was produced on stage by the original Hairspray cast has transfered flawlessly to the big screen.I couldn't have asked for more. Nikki Blonsky premiered beautifully as the spunky and voluptuous Tracy Turnblad. John Travolta delivered. Christopher Walken was charming and hilarious. Queen Latifah was "big, black, and beautiful." Michelle Pfeiffer--perfectly obnoxious...the list goes on.The candy colored costumes and thrilling choreography were so enjoyable, and even the more serious parts of the film (though there are very few!) were touching and sincere.The only thing I wished had been included was the song "Mama I'm a Big Girl Now." While it would have been a great addition, other big song and dance numbers carried the film along just fine.I caught myself smiling like a buffoon more than once. A must see for musical lovers--or anyone who just likes to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viciously satirical, deeply irreverent and wonderfully fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had it not been for a free pass to an advance screening, I must admit that my friends would have had trouble getting me to see 'Hairspray.' I don't mind musicals but 'Hairspray' didn't seem like something I'd enjoy. Not for the first time in my life was I wrong.'Hairpsray' is about tolerance, integration and acceptance of others. The film uses the racial divide between blacks and whites but the subtext of the film is Heterosexuals and Homosexuals. 'Hairspray' viciously lampoons bigots and reserves specific devastation for Ultra-conservative religious zealots, figures of authority and WASPs. The satire is white hot (Alison Janney steals every scene she is in), the music catchy, the movie's spirit is irreverent.I had no problems with the cast and their performances. John Travolta isn't bad and when he gets his chances to dance he's great fun. Christopher Walken and Travolta have a song and dance number duet that rates among the best moments of the film and isn't to be missed. Queen Latifah adds some dignity and balance while Michelle Pfeiffer plays a terrific screen villainess. Amanda Bynes has few lines to deliver but gives perfect comic deadpan when she does for excellent comic effect. Keep a sharp eye out for the hilarious John Waters cameo during the opening number.Of recent major movie musicals, this is easily better than 'The Producers,' (better comedy and music) and last year's 'Dreamgirls' (weaker songs but better pacing and strong beyond the first half). Although it doesn't have the star power or scale, I also prefer it to 'Chicago' -- 'Hairspray' takes itself less seriously and not many movies have me laughing and smiling from start to finish. If you're looking for a little pure counter-culture escapist fun, 'Hairpsray' is your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the stage musical, I was worried that the film might not measure up - but they hit this one out of the ballpark! Bright, bouncy and joyously hilarious! A big smile hit my face as soon as it started and I didn't stop grinning until the end of the credits.I haven't heard a press screening audience applaud after musical numbers since "Chicago" - and they cheered! The huge cast is uniformly terrific. Travolta, Pfeiffer and Walken are a hoot and Nikki Blonsky couldn't be more perfect.The performances, script, lyrics, sight gags and costumes wage an all-out assault on your funny bone. Even the set dressing gets laughs!This is the movie musical that Grease, Rent and Dreamgirls should have been.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that I'm surprised that I liked it but yes that I liked it as much as I did. Keeping some of the lovely John Water garishness but mainstreaming it enough to make it mainstream. John Travolta in the Divine part is truly divine. He went for it and played it for real. I thought it was actually moving at times and the illusion works, beautifully. Michelle Pfeiffer opening a new chapter in her career, the thin as a rail, gorgeous, middle age bitch. Great fun to watch. Christopher Walken, adorable. I had hoped a bigger splash of a dance number between Travolta and Walken - after all they were playing husband and wife in a musical and when are we going to see that again. Their moments together are, how can I put it? Nice, very nice. Nikki Blonsky inherits Riki Lake's oversize heroine with gusto and lots of energy. Allison Jenney, as usual, steals every moment she's in. Alas, far too few, and John Waters plays a quick cameo as a Baltimore flasher. What else do you want out of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Joy to Summer....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far I've seen this movie twice and both times the audience was involved 100%. "Hairspray: The Musical" is the definition of a feel good movie.The storyline has been tweeked a bit from the original film. Whereas the original film had Sonny Bono's Franklin Von Tussle as the main antagonist, this one has Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Phieffer) as the head adversary; now seen as the station manager for the TV station airing The Corny Collins Show. Velma's goal is to ensure that her daughter, Amber stays Miss Hairspray in the face of the rising success of Tracy Turnblad (played wonderfully by Nikki Blonsky).The musical numbers are fantastic, and while there's less of an emphasis on the dancing which was a big part of the original film, it doesn't detract from the wonder of the musical sequences.Other differences is the take on the individual characters. Whereas Ricki Lake's Tracy was brash and confident, Blonsky's Tracy is more subdued. John Travolta, as Edna gives the character the sensitivity that wasn't evident in Divine's portrayal.Although still done in connection with John Waters, it does lack Waters edginess, making an already mainstream Waters film even more mainstream for family audiences. However, the cast and the direction more than makes up for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, cheesy fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously a big-budget, flashy musical remake of a John Waters film is never going to be as subversive or as comically edgy as its predecessors, but one of the good things about HAIRSPRAY is that it never intends to be. It fully embraces the cheesy, over-the-top aspect of a movie musical from frame one, a trait that most other current films of its type try to avoid. In a welcome change from the summer drudgery of explosions and CGI, this film is a pure feel-good crowd pleaser where excitement and energy rise above all.Everyone in the cast gives able performances; even Travolta who, in drag and a fat suit, seems at first off-putting, beginning a one-joke "hey I'm a man in a dress!" performance, quickly grows into his own as Edna does, becoming the most crowd-pleasing character by the film's end. It's a pleasure to see a former GREASE-r returning to what made him famous, but Travolta proves surprisingly agile in the comedy department, especially during his song and dance numbers.The real enjoyment here, however, and the truly great performances are given by the younger members of the cast. Every single teenager in the film, from the leads to the chorus boy in the back of the room are injected with an unshakable, undeniable energy that reaches through the screen and captivates the viewer. This rings true especially for the film's two major finds: newcomers Nikki Blonsky and Elijah Kelly. Both of them have that instant star quality, a charisma and charm that make them instantly likable. Kelly displays simply astounding singing and dancing skills, while Blonsky easily carries the entire film of her shoulders, becoming the heart and soul of the movie with one hip thrust.HAIRSPRAY has nothing much to offer besides two hours of entertainment and escapism, but it offers it in spades. It is a pure joy to watch from beginning to end and a welcome change of pace from the big-budget action film that surround its release. Yes, it's a musical and yes, it's over-the-top, but the audience is sold on that point from the first moment Tracy opens her mouth and the audience cannot help but be sucked in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not CINEMA and it's not ART ... what is, however, is the most fun I've had seeing a film in I can't remember how long ... a totally incredible, wonderful, feel good, and so glad you went experience.Oh, and the performances were overall excellent ... with some stand-outs - Travolta, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Queen Latifah, &amp; Michelle Pfeiffer (perenially under-rated on account of "you can't be brilliant and that beautiful?") ... and there were no clunkers - the rest of the cast provided able support to the "stars." The music and the dancing got you bouncing up and down in your seat. And finally, the racial and weight discrimination issues .. the whole "you don't fit our skinny, white, young, &amp; whatever is currently hip stereotypes ... were handled with humor and without being patronized or trivialized - not easy to do in a musical romp. The pride and self-confidence of those who were subject to this discrimination came through as unyielding, unwavering, and solid as a rock ... just like Tracy's hair.DON"T MISS THIS MOVIE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A GREAT Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I just went to a sneak peak of Hairspray this morning and was I pleasantly surprised. As a huge fan of Hairspray the stage show and of music theatre in general, this could be my favorite movie musical (Chicago, Rent, Phantom, Dreamgirls). The cast was for the most part quite stellar. Nikki Blonsky was one terrific Tracy. Very surprised and impressed with Amanda Bynes as well as Zac Effron. Elijah Kelley was impressive as Seaweed as well. John Travolta was very funny and was a great dancer (even in heals). Love Christopher Walkin's performance as well. Michelle Pfeiffer was a great evil Velma (although her singing was the weakest of the movie). Queen Latifah was PERFECT in this role, got to love her! The story lines altered from the stage show some (don't worry I won't spoil anything). But the differences were not distracting; the movie still made wonderful sense and had a great flow. Although I was bummed that several songs were cut, the ones that were kept in were sensational. Of special note were "I Can Hear the Bells," "Welcome to the 60's," "I Know Where I've Been," and "Without Love." These movie musicals just keep getting better and better. I can't wait for Sweeny Todd this Christmas!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from the premiere and this was an amazing movie. I wasn't expecting it to be comparable to the Broadway but it was amazing. The casting was really well done, the sets were very well decorated. Costumes were impressive. Travolta was an excellent Edna. It is definitely worth seeing. Laugh your head off funny. Music and performances had everybody in the theater dancing or tapping their feet. If you want to have fun, go see this movie. You will dance all the way home. I think this will be one of the better movies of the summer and definitely deserves a few awards. I can't wait for it to be released so I can bring all my friends and family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Musical HAIRSPRAY is Fab, Full-Figured Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My family and I saw the movie version of the Broadway musical adaptation of John Waters' 1988 comedy HAIRSPRAY on its opening weekend. It's unanimous: this HAIRSPRAY is a big, bright, joyful 1960s song-and-dance extravaganza, and we all urge you to run out and see it right this minute! Go ahead, I'll wait right here... :-) My little girl loves music and dancing, but she still tends to like animated films better than live-action films, so when she got into HAIRSPRAY from the start, dancing joyfully in her seat to the Phil Spector-style opening number, "Good Morning, Baltimore," I knew this movie was truly something special. Lest you think this HAIRSPRAY has forgotten its roots, the opening number also features Waters in a hilarious cameo as a flasher. Also, watch for Ricki Lake, the original HAIRSPRAY's original Tracy, as a talent agent in the climactic "Miss Hairspray" sequence, as well as Jerry Stiller, Tracy's dad in the original, playing The Hefty Hideaway's head honcho. HAIRSPRAY is the kind of movie musical that GREASE should have been back in the 1970s (yes, it was a huge box-office hit, but I always thought it had a cold, calculating air to it, plus it was so obvious that the teenage characters were being played by stars pushing 30), making it all the more appropriate that John Travolta should carry on the Divine tradition of a man playing mama Edna Turnblad in drag, without *being* a drag. Travolta is great fun to watch, a delightful surprise with his sensitive performance (even if his Baltimore accent is a little off ? but maybe that's just because Baltimore is played by Toronto :-)) as insecure caterpillar-turned-butterfly Edna; this is no cheap, brassy drag-queen turn. The very convincing fat F/X makeup and prosthetics (Edna may be overweight, but she's got womanly curves in all the right places) don't get in the way of fleet-footed Travolta's fabulous dancing. Adorable newcomer Nikki Blonsky lights up the screen in all her scenes as Tracy Turnblad, the perky dynamo who won't let her plus-size body or the sneers of Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) and the other so-called cool kids keep her from dancing her way onto Baltimore's American BANDSTAND manque, THE CORNY COLLINS SHOW. Tracy and her shy bud Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) become socially aware as they befriend the black kids from the "wrong" side of town, fighting against bigoted station manager and stage mother Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer, having a blast slinking around making trouble) to integrate the show instead of relegating their new friends to the program's monthly "Negro Day." The plot's serious aspects, with its foreshadowing of the era's more sobering issues, are woven deftly into the movie's high spirits. The jubilant dance numbers, Marc Shaiman's catchy music and Scott Wittman's snappy lyrics are performed with bubbly abandon by each and every cast member. As the Dick Clark-ish Corny Collins, James Marsden proves that Hugh Jackman isn't the only X-Man with range and musical talent. I've never watched HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but it's easy to see why Zac Efron, winning Tracy's heart as Link Larkin, has won audiences' hearts, too. Efron is alluring enough to make teenage girls squeal while coming across as wholesome enough not to panic parents, plus he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously. Indeed, there were Zac Efron fans in our theater who shrieked and giggled with joy every time he appeared on screen! Christopher Walken reminds us that before he was an eccentric Oscar-winning character actor, he was a hell of a dancer. As Tracy's supportive joke-shop proprietor dad, Walken has winsome chemistry with Travolta in their duet, "You're Timeless to Me." (You haven't lived until you've seen Walken and Travolta make like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers!) The funny, endearing Bynes is better served here than she's been in her previous movies; maybe she should seek out more ensemble pieces like this one. Bynes also has terrific chemistry with Elijah Kelley as Seaweed, who combines Denzel Washington's playful side with James Brown's moves; I'd love to see Kelley get even bigger and better roles. As Seaweed's mom, Motormouth Maybelle, Queen Latifah is saintly yet sassy, gliding effortlessly between belting out "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful" and bringing tears to my eyes with her soulful ballad "I Know Where I've Been" during the protest march. BTW, Bynes isn't the only Nickelodeon alumnus in HAIRSPRAY; director and choreographer Adam Shankman also choreographed ROUNDHOUSE, one of our favorite Nick shows from the early 1990s. Leslie Dixon adapted Waters' original screenplay, keeping the sly, subversive elements while also keeping things bouncy and upbeat. HAIRSPRAY is a great big sunny summer movie that'll put a smile on your face, a song on your lips, and a shimmy in your shake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked at how much I liked this movie. When I first heard about it, I wasn't too excited. I'm not a big fan of musicals and I didn't think this would make me warm up to them. But I really loved this movie. It was absolutely fantastic. I was forced into seeing this movie and I didn't expect it to be that good.My sister asked me to take her daughters, Jacqueline and Emma to see the movie and I was a little reluctant to at first, but I eventually agreed to go. It wasn't as good as Transformers, but it was a ton of fun! My nieces were smiling to the whole movie and so was I. It was just very funny and extremely enjoyable.The whole cast was absolutely superb. Nikki Blonsky has talent. She pulled off the role of Tracy great. Amanda Bynes was great as Tracy's pal, Penny. I like Amanda, she is a funny girl. John Travolta as Edna, Tracy's mom. Wow. Pretty good. Michelle Pheiffer and Brittany Snow play snotty mother and daughter, Velma and Amber Von Tussel. They were pretty funny. Christopher Walken is excellent as always. Queen Latifa as Motormouth Maybelle was pretty damn hilarious. Zac Efron as the dreamy Linc Larkin. He was pretty cool. Elijah Kelley as Seaweed was just awesome!The script was pretty awesome. The songs were good and you may find yourself tapping your feet to the music. The dialogue was fun and absolutely hilarious. The characters were very, very likable. You may even grow attached to the antagonists. It was very well written and the cast proved that even more.If you want to have a fun time at the movies, I really recommend Hairspray. Even the guys will love it. The songs, script, and cast were all excellent and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Even though I loathe musicals, this one was great. Go watch it. It's very entertaining.Cast: 10/10 Songs: 9/10 Choreography: 9/10 Writing: 10/10 Characters: 10/10Overall Score: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Summer Movie So Far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came back from an early screening of Hairspray and i must say i was blown away. I was a fan of both the original movie and the Broadway show. I wasn't sure what to expect from the director of such cinematic wonders such as "Brinin' down the house" and "Cheaper by the dozen 2"...not. From director of those i was expecting crap. Boy Was I Wrong! The movie is nonstop fun from start to finish. From the beginning when cute Nikki Blonsky begins singing the opening number till the cast sings and dances their way to the ending. Nikki Blonsky was the perfect choice for the bubbly Tracy Turnblad. John Travolta was A Riot as Edna Turnblad. You love love love Edna by the end of the movie when she dances her way across the stage on the CC show. Elijah Kelly was perhaps one of the most impressive in the cast. His constant energy was so entertaining. I wasn't sure i'd like Amanda Bynes, but I Loved Her! She was perfect for the role, they couldn't have chosen anybody better. Queen Latifah and James Marsden were absolutely amazing as they host the Corny Collins Show. Queen's show-stopping number had people in the audience applauding enthusiastically. Michelle Pfieffer and Brittany Snow presented the perfect villains. Christopher Walken was, as usual, hilarious! Those in smaller roles such as Taylor parks and Allison Janney all shined in their specific moments.All in all this movie is Amazing! 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing journey for this property. From the original low budget film, to a glitzy stage musical, to this phenomenal motion picture. At each stage creativity and pizazz was added to a solid story. I've seen it twice, and enjoyed it just as much the second time. Wanted to applaud several times, and threw my lot 100% into the plot. Life's too short to not enjoy such perfection. I was never a big fan of Travolta, but that he would even attempt such a role -- and pull it off with aplomb -- moves him way up on my list. Other veterans and newcomers shine. Can't wait to buy this one on DVD, but please pack it with extras and interviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, great casting, great music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw older versions of the movie and also the play (in both pre-Broadway and Broadway versions). As great as they all were, this 2007 movie was even better! The audience in my movie house certainly seemed to agree. Virtually everyone in the theatre applauded when the movie was over (unusual here in subdued Seattle)and about a dozen people actually gave the moving a STANDING ovation (I can't recall seeing that here). I would highlight a specific performer, but it would be very difficult since they were all terrific, from the leads to the smaller role players. The music was sensational (I wanted to buy a CD, but the theatre said they had sold out), and there wasn't a dull minute in the movie. I'd put this movie right up there (and in my opinion a bit ahead) of other "classics" of this genre like "Grease,""Bye Bye Birdie" and the more recent "Chicago" and "Dreamgirls" (all of which I thought were excellent). We went with 2 other couples, the men of which told me they "hated musicals," but they loved this picture and they actually raved about it the rest of the evening. I'd really worry about someone who didn't enjoy and have fun at this "Hairspray!" I'm serious!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so impressed with this movie!!! I mean I'd heard of Hairspray the musical 2 years ago when I got the soundtrack from a friend and from then on I was in love!! When I heard they were making a movie last fall I'm like I have to see this!! I nearly drove my family insane by being so excited and checking this IMDb often. Finally tonight I got to see it and the wait was worth it!! Perfect casting!! John Travolta was the best Mama and he sure danced up a storm. Another thing - the choreography was perfect too - absolutely amazing on everyone's part. A couple of the songs weren't how I pictured they would be in my head but they still worked out amazing. Now cutting a musical down to a movie means there has to be some song cutting but I think they did it in an effective way and a couple of them appear in the credits and on the soundtrack from what I understand. The movie kept me laughing the entire time, except during one song(which I won't say here) made me almost come to tears. A really great movie that I can't wait to see again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Hairspray' is perhaps one of the most spirited energetic musicals of recent time. Right from the beginning till the end, it's all energy. There is not one boring moment. Actually there is no time to be bored. Shankman does the admirable task of directing the film AND choreographing the dances. The film's also a treat to watch. It's very colourful and reminds one of the 60's glamour. The songs are of the foot-tapping and head nodding sort (pretty much any upbeat song of the 60's has this kind of effect on me).The cast is splendid. The actors do the multiple task of acting, singing and dancing. It's quite obvious that Travolta's Edna is played by a man but his acting isn't bad. He manages to emote well and his dance number with Christopher Walken is hilarious. He does get into the skin of the character if not entirely the gender. Walken excellently plays the loving kind-hearted, slightly naive, father. Here one will see a different Christopher Walken. This is Michelle Pfeiffer's second negative role this year (the other being her character in 'Stardust'). The role was originally played by the famous Deborah Harry and it's noticeable how they eerily look alike. Pfeiffer both looks and acts the part of a skinny manipulative obnoxious bitch, making it her own. A lesser actress could have easily messed up the part. James Marsden is spot on as the host of a 60's musical show. He keeps proving his versatility. Amanda Bynes is adorable as the daft and supportive Penny. Allison Janney is a fantastic scene stealer. Jerry Stiller, who played Wilbur in the 1988 version, makes his presence felt with just one scene. It's hard to picture anyone other than the divine Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle. Elijah Kelley dances well and Zac Efron's acting is wooden but his dances are okay. However, the 'Hairspray' rests on newcomer Nikki Blonsky. Not only does she hold her own among a host of incredibly talented actors, she bravely carries the film.Next to being a wonderfully entertaining film, 'Hairspray' also brings forth some issues such as acceptance, tolerance and integration of people no matter their gender, race or sexuality. This is what the film is essentially about and it is brilliantly interwoven into this musical extravaganza. I wasn't expecting much from the film but right from the opening sequence it absorbed my attention and I was completely into the energy of the film, forgetting everything else around me during its 2 hours. A great experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the original film, and I enjoyed the songs from the Broadway musical, but had real qualms about what was done to the plot. And unfortunately the film bears out my fears: this has to be the sloppiest, most incoherent plot ever put on celluloid. The lapses in logic are appalling: "Robot Monster" makes more sense! Characterization is beyond minimal, it's practically non-existent. The characters of Link and Amber barely exist; at least Link has a song or two, but they aren't character songs. Amber has, what, five lines? Some of these are problems carried over from the show, which is a shame, since the songs could easily be plugged into the original with little adapting (except for cutting that lousy "Miss Baltimore Crabs" number). A missing song, "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now," would have given Amber and Penny something interesting to do. One nice change was made to the finale, but generally the song's impact is dissipated by dialogue interruptions and pointless, unfunny slapstick. John Travolta is practically unintelligible, Christopher Walken is inaudible. Direction is scattershot as well, and the choreography is not up to snuff.It's too bad, because this really is a pretty good cast (Travolta aside). Some of the antic joy that is a musical comedy comes through, and that's about it. I just hope that Waters's original doesn't disappear under the avalanche of hype this movie comes equipped with. If you haven't seen the original, run out and grab it! It's a joy. Who'd have thought that John Waters, of all people, would create one of the more heartwarming fables of the latter years of the 20th Century?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the Toronto premiere last night, and i was amazed! I'm just gonna give an analysis of some of the main actors Nikki Blonsky (Tracy Turnblad) - A brilliant debut, her enthusiasm makes u feel all excited, and it may seem that her attitude in the film is rather corny; you can't help but feel the same way when she sings. Her infatuation for Link Larkin (Zac Efron) was adorably and cheekily cute (and I think any teenage girl such as myself, would agree that he is rather cute :P) John Travolta (Edna Turnblad) - An amazing return to the musicals for Travolta, especially in drag! Edna's side-splitting obsession over food is hilarious to watch, and you will be in stitches just looking at his posterior, amazing acting by Travolta! Michelle Pfeiffer (Velma Von Tussle) - Great acting as the "baddie" of the film, her rising anger is so funny to watch, and her wickedness draws you into her character so much you can hardly believe it. Brilliant! Amanda Bynes (Penny Pingleton) - great role as the lead's best friend, her growing relationship with Seaweed Stubbs is hilarious and her innocence is so striking you can't help but fall in love with it and the rest of her lollipop-sucking character Zac Efron (Link Larkin) - the heartthrob of the movie can really make you fall in love with his charm, trademark hair, wink and dancing. You also love his good nature, as he favours the segregation protest for black people. Seeing as Efron is extremely popular with young women, casting him as the heart-throb of the movie pulls off really well. Falling in love with Tracy Turnblad is a rather cheesy storyline, yet it is still believable enough and this blends in well with the nature of this film. Amazing acting by Efron, he was cast so well for this film and this will ensure his future in film will be extremely successful (besides...he's hot :P).On hearing him say the word "ass" in this film removes his vulnerable High School Musical teen aspect, and makes him a real man, brilliant acting from him :) Overall, a brilliant film to watch, I'd definitely recommend it comedy/musical fans. This feel-good film is a MUST for anyone &#x2665; :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As originally created by John Waters in 1988, HAIRSPRAY was the tale of an overweight 1960s teenager who successfully crashes a small time T.V. dance program--only to find herself in the midst of a battle between segregationists and integrationists. In 2002 it was transformed into a Broadway musical which in turn became this big screen musical in 2007. But where the 1988 film was hilariously subversive, the 2007 film is akin to watching re-runs of The Lawrence Welk Show while snacking on white bread and mayonnaise.A big part of the problem here is the screenplay by Leslie Dixon, best known for such "goody-goody gumdrops" films as PAY IT FORWARD, and who seems to have been hired primarily to remove absolutely everything from the original that made the story interesting in the first place. If there was anything anywhere that had an edge, Dixon blunted it and producer-director-choreographer Adam Shankman, a mediocre talent if ever there was one, did the rest.The absolute best thing that can be said about the 2007 HAIRSPRAY is that has a fairly consistent energy level, largely thanks to Nikki Blonsky as the teenage Tracy Turblad. The rest of the cast, however, is really more miss than hit. Both Christopher Walken and Queen Latifah manage to find a few moments, but the rest of the players range from dire to horrendous. Michelle Pfeiffer once more goes out of her way to demonstrate why she should never be cast in a musical and John Travolta resembles nothing so much as a giant 'possum in a big wig and an unattractive dress. Given that the producer, director, and writer have worked so hard to remove the original film's "camp" factor, one has to wonder why they bothered to continued the tradition of casting the role of Mrs. Turnblad with a male actor anyway! All of this might be overlooked and even forgiven if the musical numbers were knock-outs. Unfortunately, the songs and dances are merely adequate and nothing more. You aren't going to ohhhh and ahhhhh over the dance numbers and you aren't going to walk away from the film humming the melodies. It's not that they are bad--they just aren't memorable or impressive in any way. When all is said and done, the musical version of HAIRSPRAY is a movie for people who thought somebody should have toned down HIGHSCHOOL MUSICAL.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just try to watch without smiling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Hairspray for the first time tonight, and I wanted to get up and dance several times. This movie is so happy, so catchy, and so feel-good that you'd have to be physically dying not to enjoy it. It has a lot of positive messages -racial harmony, love, following your dreams- and the music! This is, in my humble opinion, the best soundtrack since Moulin Rouge! All the cast did a great job, and I found myself forgetting that Edna Turnblad was John Travolta. The duet with Christopher Walken is comedic brilliance. (And guys, Amanda Bynes looked GOOD!) I left the theater a half hour ago, and I'm still smiling. I recommend this film to everybody. If you are having a bad day, Hairspray will make you feel brand new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hairspray" celebrates diversity and individuality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grease" star John Travolta follows in the footsteps of comedians Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, and Tyler Perry in his movie "Hairspray" by dressing up in drag to portray a mountain of a matronly mom in a comedy. Unlike Murphy, Lawrence, and Perry, however, Travolta plays wife and mother Edna Turnblad with sincerity and restraint. Of course, it's an audacious joke bordering on bad taste that Travolta would spend four hours a day climbing into a latex fat-suit to pull off this obvious female impersonation act, complete several wardrobe changes and dancing numbers. Nevertheless, Travolta doesn't treat his character as a joke. This reverence for Edna gives Travolta's performance, if you can call it that under all those cosmetics and appliances, a greater sense of depth and aligns our sympathy with shy, overweight Edna. When Travolta isn't turning heads, the rest of the cast, particularly newcomer Nikki Blonsky as Tracy, Edna's chubby daughter, makes a memorable debut. Mind you, "Hairspray" is a remake of director John Waters' 1988 movie that cast real-life drag queen Divine as Edna and gave Ricki Lake one of her earliest high profile roles as Tracy. Meanwhile, in director Adam Shankman's lively "Hairspray" remake, Travolta and Blonsky aren't the only two delivering stand-out performances. "X-Men's" James Marsden turns up his wattage as a TV dance show host, and slinky Michelle Pfeiffer as a haughty TV station manager Velma Von Tussle seems to be channeling Glenn Close's "101 Dalmatians" villainess Cruella de Vil. "Hairspray" celebrates diversity and individuality. Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Bonsky) lives, breathes, and dreams about becoming a dancer on the popular local TV show "The Corny Collins Show." Moreover, she is head-over-heels infatuated with handsome young Link Larkin (Zac Efron of TV's "High School Musical") a dark-haired teen who attends her high school. Tracy inhabits a world of illusion and innocence. She sees everything through rose-colored glasses. In other words, reality hasn't yet put a pin in her bubble. Every morning Tracy wakes up and warbles the anthem of a local Baltimore TV Morning Show from the moment she rolls out of bed until she misses her school bus and catches a ride?singing along the way--atop a garbage truck. In a sense, musical comedies are a genre all to themselves where characters do strange things. Everybody is oblivious to Tracy as she sings her way to school. One day, Tracy's imperious teacher writes her a detention slip for "improper hair height," meaning, the boy behind her could not see over her poofed up hair. Like everything else in this funny, feel-good, but campy musical comedy, detention amounts to more of an opportunity than a penalty for Tracy. Presumably, Baltimore area schools were integrated as early as 1962, because Tracy finds the detention room thriving with African-Americans gyrating to their own musical beat. Just as these kids are about to dismiss Tracy as just another accommodating white girl, she impresses them, especially Seaweed (TV actor Elijah Kelley), with her own snappy dance numbers. Link is walking down the hall past the room when he hears all of the commotion and peeks in to see what is happening. He is almost instantly captivated by Tracy. Meanwhile, Tracy realizes where she has seen Seaweed. She saw him on "Negro Day," an African-American dancing show, and she loves Seaweed's rolls and rhythms. Tracy adores their once-a-week intrusion into white TV programming as heaven sent. "I wish everyday were Negro Day," she clamors with na?ve sincerity. Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer) doesn't share Tracy's sentiments. She cancels "Negro Day" and sends the host Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah of "Set It Off") packing. Velma defends her action; she contends that "Negro Day" doesn't draw the ratings that "The Corny Collins Show" pulls. As far as that goes, Velma isn't enamored with Corny Collins (James Marsden) because he wants to integrate his own show. Integration is inevitable, Corny warns conceited Velma, but she turns a deaf ear to him. Afterward, Motormouth decides to protest Velma's decision to cancel "Negro Day" and rallies her friends to march with her on the TV station. Tracy commits herself to Motormouth's cause without a second thought, but image conscious Link backs out. He fears that his participation in a racial protest may jeopardize his career. At the same time, Tracy convinces her seamstress of a mom to venture out of their apartment and take the time to savor life. Initially, Edna is reluctant to leave the family's apartment, until she realizes that she has a voice of her own and decides to exercise it. When the protesters approach the TV station, Baltimore's Police Chief (Bruce McFee of "Land of the Dead") confronts Motormouth and orders her to disperse her group of marchers. Tracy smacks the Chief from behind with her protest sign, and everybody scatters with the authorities launching a manhunt for Tracy. Tracy wrestles with her dilemma. She knows that if she remains in hiding that the police won't find her. However, she realizes that she will have to endanger her freedom in order to win the Miss Teenage Hairspray crown from three-time winner Amber (Brittany Snow), Velma's stuck-up daughter.Although "Hairspray" champions equal rights between blacks and whites and hallows integration over segregation, this lighthearted musical isn't so much concerned with clobbering moviegoers with its racially tolerant message as it is at making them feel good about a bygone era. At no time does "Hairspray" point fingers at either whites or blacks or take its racial themes as seriously as he could have. Vintage automobile enthusiasts will drool over the classic cars that cruise through the outdoors scenes from the 1960s. This cheerful 115 minute trip down nostalgia lane vibrates with one upbeat bubble-gum song after another, though some aren't as inspiring as others, with nary a downbeat moment. "Pacificer" director Adam Shankman, a former stage choreographer, keeps things humming throughout this PG-rated nonsense with its predictable ending. "Hairspray," like the product that it parodies, holds up under pressure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Casting!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a fan of the original John Waters movie and I was dubious when I heard they were making it into a Broadway musical. Then I was lucky enough to see the play on Broadway and became an instant fan, so I was again, understandably doubtful about a new movie version. After all, the Producers, another movie to musical to movie translation did not quite work out.Am ever glad I was wrong! Nicki Blonsky is what every fat girl wishes she was. Unselfconsciously herself as Tracy. John Travolta as Edna captures the reality of what it is to feel fat and ugly and insecure. As a result, his Edna has a depth that even Harvey Fierstein lacked on Broadway. Christopher Walken, to be honest I was a little frightened when I heard of his casting, but his Wilbur was so touchingly enamored with Edna it was beautiful. The Travolta transformation was so complete that there was no moment when you cringed and remembered that the actors were actually two men.And the kids were amazing! I mean, any one with a tween in the house knows Zac Ephron and Amanda Bynes intimately. But it wasn't just smart casting that would translate into tween ticket sales. These kids were amazing as Link and Penny. Link was a more three-dimensional character here than I had ever seen him, and Amanda can sing! And I am positive that we will be seeing much more of the very talented Elijah Kelly. His Seaweed was the highlight of the show for me.And come on, Queen Latifah! Those of us who loved Mama in Chicago are going to love Motormouth Maybelle in Hairspray. Michelle Pfiefer and Britney Snow played the queen and princess witches as the mother and daughter Velma and Amber Von Tussel.Casting could not have been better! I took my seven year old niece to see it and she danced out of the theater. Then she begged for the next two days to see it again. We went back today and it was even better the second time. Every one should see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful show! IWe went to this movie almost by accident. We had heard the Broadway CD, but had never seen the original Hairspray (Devine) or the Broadway musical, so we didn't know what to expect.This movie overwhelmingly surprised us. The music (which we knew) was wonderful - but the show was spectacular. John Travolta is listed as the star, but really, the show is more about Tracy (Nikki Bronsky), who is absolutely delightful. The rest of the cast is just amazing as well.I've never been to a screening where the audience is clapping after a performance, but there were several times the audience broke into applause during the show, and after the show they applauded. And most of them stayed for the credits.Just about every line got a laugh or response of some type. I think I'll have to see it again just to hear the dialog, there was so much laughter. And during the show, the audience moved, swayed, nodded their heads to the music, and just had a great time.I've seen Dreamgirls and Chicago, and while I don't think this is necessarily better (Chicago is more gritty, and Dreamgirls is more realistic), this is a great movie nonetheless.This movie is fun, fun, fun. Go for a good time, and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I soooo wanted to NOT like this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long-time fan of the ORIGINAL John Waters film, I had no desire to give any respect to the stage-to-film remake, especially starring Travolta and Pfeiffer (homage to Grease 1 and 2 maybe?) Relenting to my mother's wishes (a huge Travolta fan), I went to see it today at its first showing (for the $5 price). What a great way to spend $5 and 2 hours of my time!!! The cameos of many of the original movie's cast members were so sweet to see and of course, the first one (??) immediately reassured me that this movie couldn't be ALL bad.... I'd never seen the stage play, so I had no idea how great the songs/music were going to be. For the most part, all of the musical performances were GREAT (couldn't they have done more production on Michelle's voice?) and the dancing let me know just how fantastic it would be to see this on the stage. Yes, there were some liberties taken from the original movie, but I'm sure that was done when it was brought to the stage to begin with. These didn't really diminish the message(s) of the film so I wasn't overly irritated by the changes. Most of all, I've got to give serious credit to John Travolta, himself, for his incredibly sweet, poignant, and funny performance. After the first few moments of eagle-eyeing his fat suit, I eventually forgot about it and really started to enjoy his take on the Edna Turnblad role... and then he began to DANCE! I don't think I've laughed this hard in a theater in my life! There is just something so much more funny about knowing it's a MAN dressed like a woman doing the Mashed Potato on the streets of Baltimore! All my pooh-poohing of this movie has been completely transformed into serious appreciation for the sheer entertainment value and uplifting performance of the entire cast of this film. Long Live JOHN WATERS! A Cry-Baby remake anyone??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Sixties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big, bubbly, euphoria-filled musical based on John Waters' most accessible, even beloved, 1988 film. There's not a bum number in the Marc Shaiman/Scott Wittman Broadway score, all wonderfully enhanced in this soundtrack, brilliantly lampooning a variety of 60s pop styles and Broadway classic showtunes. (Sadly, three numbers were trimmed for time.) An excellent cast of young talent and old vets, notably Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Christopher Walken (who knew he was such a good dancer?) and Allison Janney. Divine left big fluffy slippers to fill and, though I had my reservations, John Travolta fills them nicely indeed, bringing new depth to the Edna Turnblad character. When it comes time for Edna to bust a move, we're in delicious anticipation; this IS Travolta after all! And we're not left disappointed by his showmanship. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky stars as Tracy, Edna's urban Gidget-as-chubette daughter, whose optimism and idealism transform the existence of those around her in Kennedy-era Baltimore. Addictive, gotta-sing-gotta-dance, Technicolor hullabaloo with a positive message that'll have you wanting to move your feet and sing out, Louise. Welcome to the Sixties!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a major let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to buck the trend here...it seems the world is full of Hairpray fans...but I am not one of them. I loved the 1988 version because it was camp and over the top, and deliciously subversive...but the latest offering is a diluted, lifeless affair that tries to hard to be the next Grease; has songs with little or no singalong quality; is vaguely offensive in its handling of serious issues, and basically offers the audience nothing new. I can remember when Grease came out how everyone rushed out to have the soundtrack - you were something of a social outcast at school if you did not own the album. Will the same sort of buzz be generated by the latest soundtrack to Hairspray? I very much doubt it. The songs are noisy, cluttered, unoriginal and ...stale. I wanted so much to like this film...I really did...but left the cinema thinking I had wasted my time and money. Divine was loud and brash, camp and offensive - Travolta's performance is too coy and restrained to make his character as appealing or memorable. I kept watching to see if he and Chris walken would kiss, but, like the rest of this diluted movie, it appears nobody had to the balls to eat up their roles with relish or conviction ... there is loads of scope to go completely over the top, yet every character comes across as being too scared to be larger than life...as if they tried to make the most inoffensive movie they could..and succeeded. I much preferred the brashy, trashy '88 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit going into 'Hairspray', I thought I was going to get a pretentious schmaltzy formulaic musical with so-so performances....BOY WAS I WRONG! This movie was just a joy to watch. From the catchy opening number ('Good Morning Baltimore') to the sensational finale ('You Can't Stop the Beat', my fav) the film just had a wide-eye innocence not seen in movies for a looooong time.And all the performances were fantastic. Nikki Blonsky is my new favorite young actress, she really blew it out of the park with the infectious Tracy Turnblad. As for Travolta, I so wanted to hate on his performance but I just can't, his/her Edna Turnblad was hilarious and endearing. Queen Latifah was awesome as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer was devilishly good as the movie's villain. As for the rest: James Marsden turns in his best performance ever as Corny Collins, Amanda Bynes is lovable and funny as Tracy's BFF Penny, Elijah Kelly was ridiculous as Seaweed Tubbs, and I have to admit even Zac Efron was really good here (FYI, I hate 'High School Musical').Also while I'm not a huge fan of musicals, this is the first one that had me toe-tapping. I've never toe-tapped during a movie! In conclusion, 'Hairspray' is definitely the biggest surprise of the year. It doesn't matter if your male, female, old, young, black, white, latino, Asian, gay, straight, whatever, I can promise you if you give this film a shot, you'll leave the theater with a big ol' smile on your face.'Hairspray' is without a doubt one of the best of 2007 so far. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a great joy to watch this come to life for the 3rd time. I'm a huge fan of the original John Waters film (spoiler - blink and you will miss his cameo). Nikki is so adorable you will instantly fall in love with her. Travolta, who is so hard to take in the trailers, really grows on you after about 10 minutes. The weakest link is actually the kid from High School Musical, Zac something.....I saw the musical on Broadway as well, I think it follows that plot line pretty closely, I don't remember any differences in the story, if there were some they were minor. The casting was pitch perfect. The entire film a delight. I thing this film is going to get lost amongst the big summer blockbusters. The test audience I was with enjoyed it, clapped a lot, cheered and seemed to be having a ton of fun. It's a lot lighter than Chicago and Dreamgirls, just to compare it to recent movie musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Waters's classic cult flick, Hairspray, is presented in a third, modernized iteration. This wildly popular movie originally starred Divine as a mother and now has John Travolta reprising Divine's incredible role. Both play tragically overweight mothers that you just want to love back into their own beauty and grace.Travolta won me over, surprisingly, as Edna Turnblad. Her daughter Tracy, played by Nikki Blonksy, is utterly adorable and, damn, can this actress sing! Usually creepy Christopher Walken also surprised me as Tracy's absent-minded, sweet, and kind father, Wilbur Turnblad. I know, I know: Walken, no less! Michelle Pfeiffer plays the powerfully blond and powerfully overbearing boss (and another B-word) that everybody hates and does it flawlessly.Queen Latifah is spectacular (astonishing voice, comedic timing, and awesomeness!) and so are the actors who play her children, Little Inez (Taylor Parks) and Seaweek (Elijah Parks - what a voice!) Zac Efron and James Marsden are oh-so-sexy as they dance, sing, and charm. Amanda Bynes plays Tracy Turnblad's kooky and steadfast BFF. Allison Janney, as always, well plays the hyper-religious Catholic mother of Penny Pingleton (Bynes).Marc Shaiman's music repeatedly tears the roof off throughout this fabulous and ingenious new cult classic of musical theater. I've not seen or heard a musical score in ages so powerfully orchestrated and presented, nor voices so persistently clear and strong, nor lyrics that have meaning and reach across every conceivable division or perceived division in our often blessed and frequently bewildered species.This movie belts out the true meaning of love, inclusion, and diversity. Bravo, a thousand times so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched the older version of Hairspray before, and in my opinion, this version is more entertaining. I love how colorful the cars and dresses and houses were. The story itself is very enjoyable. The fact that not only did the characters accepted Tracy for who she was, and the idea of being a plus size, but also accepted desegregation and everyone ended up united. Also, the fact that the Corny Collins Show was inspired by an actual show back in the 60s, The Buddy Deane Show, makes me be more interested in the story. The only difference with these two shows is that The Buddy Deane Show had black Americans perform on Fridays, as far as I know. This movie does a great job showing the struggles black Americans went through during segregation and while trying to desegregate. Especially during the march, which I believe was the most intense moment of the movie because of the emotions the characters showed through their faces, and the song. I really love John Travolta and he did such an amazing job playing as Edna, it made the movie be more fun. Overall, I recommend this movie. It has comedy and history, which is perfect for a movie to watch with your family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hairspray", the outrageous John Waters 1988 film, was made into a musical for the Broadway stage. It was a huge success that doesn't show any signs of disappearing. The Broadway version, rather than the original film, is recreated for the present remake. Where the original film was irreverent and campy, this one is quite different in tone. Thanks to its director/choreographer, Adam Shankman, the new remake plays and feels like a musical should.Part of the success of the present "Hairspray" is the great characterization by John Travolta, who as Edna Turnblad is sensational. He is never obnoxious, which is to his credit not to have shortchanged his Edna with superfluous mannerisms. We realize Edna is played by a man, but sometimes it is difficult to separate both, the actor and the character. This is a triumph for Mr. Travolta, an man that always delivers.The other surprise was Michelle Pfeiffer who appears as the mean spirited Velma Von Tussle. Ms. Pfeiffer has never been so much fun to watch as the horrid woman who doesn't seem to realize her daughter has no talent, but wants to impose her at all costs. This is one of the best moments of this actress on film.As Tracy, the newcomer Nikki Blonski is perfect for the part. She dances up a storm. She has a sweet face that endears herself to the audience from the start in her "Good Morning Baltimore". She shows an energy that is hard to match. Also incredible is Queen Latifah, a welcome presence in any film. As Motormouth Maybelle, she does a wonderful job. James Marsden who is seen as the Dick Clark prototype and Zac Efron, a promising new star, are perfect for their parts. Jerry Stiller, the only surviving member of the original film shows up. Allison Janney has a couple of good moments too.This is a fun film to watch and it's highly recommended for the excellent dancing created by Adam Shankman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Fun I've Had With A Movie In A Long Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray (2007, Dir. Adam Shankman) It's 1962 and teenagers Tracy Turnblad and her friend Penny Pingleton are watching the Corny Collins show. When the chance to dance on the show arrives, Tracy quickly takes the opportunity. Not only does he dancing skills attract Corny Collins, but also the attention of teenage heart throb, Link Larkin. But not everyone is happy with the decision to have her dance on the show. The shows manager, Velma von Tussle will do anything to get Tracy off the show, even if it has to include Tracy's parents of new friends Seaweed and Motormouth Maybelle.I never really intended on watching 'Hairspray'. As a straight male, i thought it would not appeal to me. After a while, i decided to give it a look at, and I'm so glad i did. If there was ever a film which would cheer you up, this would be it. The story is simple and easy to follow. All the cast have been perfectly chosen, from big stars like John Travolta and Michelle Pfeiffer to teenage sensations of Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley, and what a smart choice of picking Nikki Blonsky. You would have never guessed this was her first screen appearance. The songs are incredible are so beautifully written. A lot of musicals have the problem of creating half a film of great songs, and failing to continue the rest of the film. 'Hairspray' is full of great songs from start to finish. They even continue throughout the credits. The film might not appeal to everyone, but if you ever feel depressed, this should put a smile on your face."Link, your pork is ready." - Edna Turnblad (John Travolta)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let it be known I approached this movie as a Hairspray snob. I love the John Waters original, and have seen the stage musical five times. This movie version hits all the right notes. I've seen it three times now, and all considered it is well worth an A+ in my opinion.The first time I saw it, it was more like an A-, but on subsequent viewings I became more accustomed to the departures it took from the stage version, and also was able to understand some dialogue I didn't catch the first time. I have scrutinized this movie for imperfections, and if they are there, they've gotten past me.Highlights include: Every single cast member; excellent use of the Dynamites; choreography faithful to the stage version; cutting between Latifah and Pfeiffer in "Big, Blonde &amp; Beautiful"; new song "New Girl in Town"; and an ending that's different from the stage version. Stay for the credits to hear the songs cut from the play. Better yet, see the stage version when you have a chance for a different but equally fun experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie. You can't help but not be smiling when it ends. If you like musicals, singing, dancing, the whole shabang! this is the film for you. It has humor, romance, and a bit of drama. A great thing about this movie is the issue of racism it revolves around and the approach taken to shed light on it. It's just wonderful. John Travolta does a hilariously good job at playing a woman! It was so amusing to watch him sing, act, and dance as if he were a female. Standing ovation to that role! And Nikki Blonsky, who played the main character, is such a shining person. She lights up the screen with her happy-go-lucky attitude which just completed the movie. It's a great film for the whole family!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hairspray" 2007 is simply one of the best musicals ever put on celluloid. A perfection of script, songs, orchestrations, casting, directing, choreography, editing and all technical elements. In short, a true masterpiece.The first time I saw the film I wasn't prepared for so great an achievement. It was only days after that I began to reflect on what I'd seen. Back I went, not once but several more times, and the film just got better and better each time.Congratuations to everyone who made a contribution to this landmark film musical!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exuberant and incessantly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a slew of other such stage musicals turned movies, one might expect Hairspray to have simply jumped on the cinematic bandwagon, and have little to offer, save being 'that new movie musical'. However, despite the number of stage musical adaptations of late, the quality of the productions is by no means receding, and if anything, increasing, as Hairspray proves one of the most shamelessly jubilant and infectiously enthusiastic efforts to date. Unlike many other movie musicals, whose song and dance numbers more often than not seem stiff and forced, Hairspray's crackle with kinetic vitality and genuine life. The choreography is consistently superb, and director Adam Shankman's past experience in the field really shows - the innovative dance moves certainly scream of the sixties. And while the plot may stumble and come across as a bit jerky at times, Shankman keeps the pacing and energy so consistently on overdrive such complaints seem trivial compared to the sheer ballistic exuberance on display. For a film so shamelessly fun as this, the occasional imbalance of plot or lapse of logic seem only natural, and are easily forgivable when there is so much else to appreciate going on. Apart from the unquestionably impressive song and dance numbers, the film also proves a rousing success in capturing the look and feel of the sixties in a particularly vibrant fashion. From the candy coloured costumes to the massive hairdos, the film gives the impression of immersing the viewer in a Technicolor throwback of forty years. But as well as visually, the film also thrives on interpreting some of the most valid social issues of the decade, including racism, and other such prejudices against the social norm in a particularly cheerful and uplifting way, making Hairspray one of the most morally sound musicals to grace the screen in quite some time. Such an unflinchingly feel good film might be the sort to stir up contempt in some of its more jaded viewers, but Hairspray always seems so brightly genuine that it avoids syrupy clich, culminating in a satisfyingly touching film. The universally spectacular ensemble cast each boast both wonderful performances and impressive singing voices, really bringing the film to life with particular flair and style. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky makes for a boisterous and instantly likable lead as the spunky Tracy Turnblad, infusing the film with a quirky charm and energy right from the start. One has to give John Travolta credit for playing his part straight, instead of coasting by on the shock humour generated by seeing the iconic star stuffed into a fat suit and drag, and he succeeds in instilling Edna with a surprisingly touching streak - it's just a shame, given his history, that his singing and dancing are disappointingly not up to par with the rest of the cast. Genre veteran Christopher Walken proves his effortless talent is not dampened by age, dancing and singing better than most half his age, and carrying the film's most touching scene (with his character professing his love to his wife, Travolta) with ease. Michelle Pfieffer aces her vindictive television producer role to icy perfection, and James Marsden is perfectly cast as cheery game host Corny Collins. Teen heartthrob Zac Efron does what he does best here, without doubt winning new legions of screaming female fans in the process, and Amanda Bynes is a surprisingly strong and endearing presence as Tracy's best friend. Elijah Kelly gives a charming performance as well as proving hands down to be the best dancer in the cast, and Queen Latifa also demonstrates dramatic skill seldom demonstrated before, instilling the film's most serious scene, a solemn protest for integration rights, with quiet dignity. It is a joy to see so many talented actors collaborate to such tremendously enjoyable effect. Apart from those who generally turn their noses up at the gleeful mayhem of movie musicals, it is difficult to imagine watching Hairspray without a heartfelt smile plastered across one's face. The film is too genuinely wholesome and outright entertaining to generate much contempt, and even though the plot may stumble on occasion, the film whips by at such a steady clip, fueled by universally superb singing and performances by the cast that it is near impossible to avoid being caught up in the infectious enthusiasm of the production. Expect to hear impromptu renditions of many of the songs over the course of the next year or so, and don't be at all surprised to find yourself joining in - it seems only natural for a film as downright enjoyable as this.-8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think that "Grease" is the greatest movie of all time (my eldest Sister does), or you think that what we really need are more films like "Dirty Dancing" (yes, same Sister), or you think that "High School Musical" is the best movie to come along in the past couple of years (no, that was my Niece talking that time) then you are really going to love "Hairspray". Myself I thought it was corny, clichd, camp beyond belief and as subtle as a sledgehammer.However, get this. "Hairspray" is totally saved by it's energy, exuberance and great songs. True, John Travolta is a tad underused and a prime example of stunt casting, but he really sparked off Christopher Walken during their scenes together. The whole black/white integration plot was a bit heavy handed, but there was no way that it could have been done more subtly in this kind of movie. Michelle Pfeiffer and Brittany Snow were good as the hissable villains. Amanda Byrnes was lovable as the best friend of the heroine. (And actually kind of sexy. Don't look at me like that. She's 21. I checked. I'm only 43; nearly 44. It could work between us.) Nikki Blonsky, and especially Elijah Kelley, were just bags of energy. They exploded off the screen.Some won't get "Hairspray". There were some walkouts from the screening I attended. (Boo, hiss! Be off with you to watch robots killing each other!) More fool them. But, if you do get it, "Hairspray" is a great, fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie!!!! I smiled for almost the entire show! John Travolta was fabulous...what a talent! The only reason I gave it 9 stars out of 10 was because I really disliked Michelle Pfeiffer's singing...I thought it was dreadful. Her acting performance was great but when she sang...UG. Outstanding performance by all cast-members. The set was very authentic. You'll find yourself rooting for Tracy and Edna. I wanted to sing and dance the whole time. So glad I went to see it. The film has a great message and I was pleased it led to an educational discussion with my eleven year old son about segregation. Go see this movie! You'll be happy that you did.

		<fullReview>I've seen the original and the play. This stands up on its own. You're captured by Nikki Blonsky right from the beginning, and all the actors you know and love do their thing as you're drawn into them one at a time. Although I've read mixed reviews on Travolta, the audience loved him. I guess some Travolta haters just can't get over it.The movie was so well crafted that the emergence of characters like Amanda Bynes' and Queen Latifa's make you love them. I could go on one at a time, but the evolution of Amada Bynes particularly struck me. She knew how to let Nikki have the limelight, but when the spotlight was on her, she shined...what screen presence and talent. The film stands on its own on all levels, but if you like any of the stars like Michelle Pfiefer, Christopher Walken, John Travolta, Queen Latifa, Amanda Bynes, etc., you'll love this film. However, Nikki Blonsky, the unknown, owns the film. She starts you smiling and keeps you that way throughout. Thank god there are producers and directors that know how to make musicals...a great chance to open the eyes of the younger moviegoer. The young followers of Amanda Bynes will be proud that such great young talent continues to emerge. And I'm 63 years old, male, and yes love good musicals. This one is better than Dreamgirls and Chicago, which were great, because it doesn't take itself seriously, yet makes its historical and serious points quite effectively. The audience laughs throughout and applauds at the end.To the John Waters fans of which I include myself, don't compare the original's out of the box greatness to this adaptation. This is a celebration of his legacy...and so much more fun then the special effects summer gadgets we're swamped with every year. A breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved the original John Waters' production. Never saw the Broadway version. Had a great time at the movie.It's just a good, fun movie. The music makes you want to get up and dance with the kids. Wonderful casting! Nikki Blonsky makes a delightful Tracy. Michelle Pfieffer is almost unrecognizable, but I knew women who looked just like that in the 60s. Christopher Walken -- well, he is, as always, sublime. John Travolta (did he think he was doing a Bal'mer accent?) was surprisingly light on his feet while wearing that fat suit. When he and Walken danced together -- it's not Fred and Ginger, but it's pretty darn good. Nobody except Queen Latifah could play Motormouth Maybelle.And young Zac Efron is downright hot, as is the adorable Elijah Kelley.If you were a kid or teenager in 1962, you can't help but notice the set decoration and costuming. They are dead-on perfect.Hey -- "Hairspray's" got aerosol cans, gas guzzlers, and pregnant women drinking and smoking! What's not to like?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually like ReMakes of old Movies - but this is an Extension of the original John Waters Movie that does great credit and honor to it.I have so many reasons to connect with this movie BESIDES loving the original version. I lived in Baltimore around 1987-1989 when the first version was being filmed. I LIVED the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's. I remember my Older Sister hurrying home from High School to watch afternoon Teen Dance TV! The John Waters Cameo is hysterical in the middle of the first big Number! I loved every Song, and most of the Dances. What a Holistic double whammy to see Brittany Snow in ANOTHER 60's TV Dance Show! I loved her in American Dreams and just spent a weekend watching EVERY Episode of that first season - hoping to get ALL Seasons to see again! Seeing her as the Evil Amber Von Tussle was a bit weird, but she really knew how to play it.Allison Janney and Amanda Bynes - who woulda thought they could be such perfect Pingleton Mother and Daughter. Loved them from Prior Roles, adored them here. Wish they would have done the original scene of Mom Prudy Pingleton going downtown to rescue Penny from Motormouth Maybelle's Record Shop. Using John Travolta's Edna Turnblad for This scene was the only disappointing departure from the original plot for me.Nikki Blonsky as Traci Turnblad may be a Newby, but her performance kept up with a Terrific all-star cast, like Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Jerry Stiller and others listed above.I smiled from the start of the first number, and I was in a Late Afternoon showing PACKED with Teenagers - who Cheered and applauded at all the right times - like they UNDERSTOOD what it was like to Live through this time of life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film only a few hours ago. I can only say that as fantastic as it was , I was expecting more. Each person played their part very well, but unfortunately for the younger audience the characters they wanted to see the most weren't shown as much as they would have liked. Yes the film was very good, but Zac Efron who played Link Larkin very well, only had very few parts and his story kind of jumps from one thing to another. One moment he has just met her and the next he's in love with her, the role was played well but the time sync was a bit weird. The most seen characters on the film is Tracy (obviously) her mother ( John Travolta in a fat suit... gets boring but a bit funny) Velma Von Tussle ( Ambers mother .. evil cow .. not funny .. gets slightly boring) and Moter Mouth Maybelle ( Queen Latifa .. played well) who were very good , but i would have liked to see more form the other characters. Unfortunately though .. when I looked around the cinema , i saw that many young girls were in there, most probably to see Zac Efron. They did not understand the complex story line , which is a shame because it held such a strong and important messege Over all .. a Very Good and memorable film , but things moved a bit too fast , it held a strong messege throughout and was full of laughs. I'd give it a 8/10 WELL DONE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous Movie, Odd Casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Hairspray on Broadway, so I guess I had big expectations. While the movie was energetic and happy, sticking somewhat close to the on-stage version, the casting of John Travolta as Edna was wrong, wrong, wrong! He looked nothing like the masculine, haggard woman Edna was supposed to be. Remember Divine, Harvey Firestein, Bruce Vilanch... all embodied Edna. Travolta looked just like an ordinary fat woman... and that accent he was trying for. What was that? Amanda Bynes looked way too cute for the entire movie to be Tracy's ugly duckling friend. She didn't shine in her big break out at the end because she didn't' look much different. That said... the movie was still fabulous. The music, the dancing, the singing. All wonderful. Nikki Blonsky has a set of pipes on her and Queen Latifah was great as usual. While some songs from the musical were cut, some new ones were added. "Ladies Choice" sung by Zac Efron was a great addition. Also kudos for the John Waters and Ricki Lake cameos, too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being well over the age of sixteen, seeing the original film in a theatre, and trying hard not to seem as old as I feel having sat through this schlock, I'm prepared for all the Grinch style pooh-poohing that this review will undoubtedly garner--so have at it clicking that "did not help" button all you want when it comes to your take on my opinion. I hate to spoil your summer valentine, kids, but, here goes....To say that I'm a little disappointed would be like saying John Travolta looked a little stupid. But, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.Let me be perfectly blunt...I am a huge John Waters fan and loved "Hairspray" when it was released in the late '80s. I was stunned when they decided to update the film version for the Broadway stage, and really thought it was an idea that would leave as quickly as it appeared, but, it became a hit. When I saw the Broadway production with Harvey Fierstein, and realized they were using totally different music from the film, I was blown away and left the theatre humming "Good Morning, Baltimore," "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now," "I Can Hear the Bells," and "You Can't Stop the Beat." It was just as joyous, high energy, campy and fun as the film had been. All my initial trepidations were squashed and I became a fan of the stage version as well.And now, we have a film version of the stage version. How could it possibly go awry? Simple...let Hollywood--an institution that Waters has always bucked--get a hold of it at long last. By hook or by crook, they've taken a fantastic story and sucked all the joy, camp and fun out of it. Gone are the outrageous hairdos. Gone are the notions of telling a serious story without taking it too seriously. What we have now is a funeral dirge ballad during a race protest, an off the wall bollixed pseudo-affair between two of the characters, the dropping of great songs from the stage for stupid and pointless production numbers that make you cringe, an underused Michelle Pfieffer, an overused and out of place Christopher Walken, and one of THE MOST embarrassing performances ever captured on film by John Travolta in his ridiculous attempt to tackle the role of Edna Turnblad.Honestly--Divine is rolling over in his grave and Fierstein is thanking his lucky stars he wasn't involved (Oh, what a crime the producers wanted to have STAR POWER--Fierstein would have won the Oscar for just showing up on the set. Oh, the humanity). Let's just cut to the chase--Travolta turned a big, brassy, campy character like Edna Turnblad into a cowering, slow learning, knuckle dragging mental defective. And what--tell me, WHAT--was up with that accent of his? It wasn't Southern, it wasn't Baltimore, it wasn't anything but annoying and made him come across as, no offense to anyone challenged, Down's Syndrome. When he sang, all you could hear was "Sandy, can't you see, I'm in misery?"--you ain't the only one, John. Really, once the show closes on Broadway, is THIS going to be our reference point? TRAVOLTA??? This will be our Edna Turnblad to live in infamy? Outrageous. Had he been even REMOTELY passable in the role, the rest of the film's flaws might not have seemed so bad. But, he wasn't and they did.But, Travolta isn't solely to blame--oh, would that it were that easy. Hokey Hollywood tried to add major plot twists (Wilbur Turnblad and Velma Von Tussle getting caught in a passionate moment? Pu-leeze!!) and heavy handed moments (Queen Latifah's candlelit march on the TV station) into what should have been one hour and forty five minutes of uplifting good fun. But, what's the kicker? The final number of "You Can't Stop the Beat"--when the entire company on stage is supposedly all together totally reformed--has Velma angry and fired, Amber limping and still miffed, and Lil Inez with a tiara on her head. Oh, and if you look really closely, you can see Ricki Lake making a cameo in the stands. In a word...YUCK.The one high point of the entire film is the discovery of Nikki Blonsky. Blonsky's Tracy Turnblad is every bit the star of this film, but, her cute approach seems a little forced after a while, given all the sturm and drang she she's surrounded by.If you consider yourself someone who has a broader musical reference beyond that of "Rent" and "Grease," this one doesn't even come close to being a home run. I guess "Chicago" is the only thing close to a success story Hollywood has been able to come up with of late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two days after seeing this film, I can't remember a single tune, but I'm still happy. And still thinking.This is the kind of movie that provokes both happiness and thought. And happiness and thought are especially welcome in an unhappy country that seems--finally--to be nearly ready to emerge from its Cheneyesque "There's only one way to be OK" mindset. That was also true in the early '60s, the period depicted in this film. I remember that time very well, and am most eager to leave it behind me a second time.I hope to return with a more thoughtful and thorough review, but for now I will offer one bold prediction: John Travolta will be the surprise winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for his remarkably sweet, funny and straightforward portrayal of Edna!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Baltimore, there is a big girl who dreams to take part in Corny Collin's Show and dance with a nice guy, Link. The girl's name is Tracy. One day she finds an audition of the TV S\shoe, therefore she manages to ask her mother who is not willing to accept it to allow her to join the audition. However she fails because the judge does not like hoe big body. She is depressed and late for classes because of the audition. She has to stay at school as the punishment, then she meets a great black dancer, Seaweed. He invites her to a dance party and there, she is scouted for the new cast in Cony Collin's Show by the representative. After that, she faces a lot of troubles, discrimination, and she fight for the resolution. The great thing of this film is that it has not only a funny scenes but also an important theme, that is, abolition of discrimination about not only color but also appearance. In this film, there are two contrastive characters. One is Tracy, who is a fat girl but has a sense of equality. The other is Amber, who is a beautiful but has an evil mind. These two character emphasize this theme effectively. I love musicals so much and I love this film, too. Especially, when depressed, this film is the best recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Travolta Celebrates Divine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray (2007): Dir: Adam Shankman / Cast: Nikki Blonsky, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Bynes: Hilarious musical remake about time and culture all embraced within the enthusiasm of teenage experimentation. Nikki Blonsky stars as teenage Tracy Turnblad who dreams of being on the Corny Collins Show but due to her weight she is rejected by station manager Miss Von Tussle. At home Tracy is encouraged by her father while her mother Edna is insecure herself. Despite predictable storytelling director Adam Shankman is given convincing 1950's art direction. This is a huge improvement for a director who previously made such crap as The Wedding Planner and The Pacifier. Blonsky is a burst of life while John Travolta in drag as Edna is a scene stealer. This is a reminder that Divine, who portrayed Edna in the original John Waters film was a transvestite. What Travolta does here is a tribute, not an insult. Christopher Walken is hilarious as Tracy's father who works in a toy store. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the snide Miss Von Tussle whose daughter is her top pride. Amanda Bynes plays Blonsky's best friend who is locked up in her bedroom. While remakes are often frown upon, and for good reason, Shankman creates a film that extends the budget while maintaining the same spirit. The result is a colourful expression of dance, culture and race. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

There two other types of characters in this film, those for and those against segregate. The Corny Collins Show is an example of how 'separate but equal' was conveyed because of the way those on the show act when the African Americans had their day on the show.

		<shortDescription>Adds some light-heartedness to the topic of integration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray was an overall great movie. The writer used a light-hearted dance show to shed some light on the topic of integration within Baltimore in the 60's. The story revolves around a white teenager who has witnessed the opportunities that were taken away from African-Americans at this time strictly due to the color of their skin. These African- Americans were not allowed to integrate with the white teenagers and dance on The Corny Collins show together. Instead, they were given Negro day to dance and even this right was eventually taken away from them. The main character, Tracy did not believe in this segregation so she joined them in an effort to desegregate. By the end of the movie, the African- Americans were integrated into the TV show. It was interesting to watch the fight for equality in this aspect of life for the African-Americans of the 1960's. It was a powerful example of segregation and the fact that it was shown in the entertainment industry makes the movie and the topic more interesting. All around a highly recommended movie that mixes history with entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray is a movie about the acceptance of others despite their physical appearance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray was an uplifting movie with ideas of acceptance of others. The main character, Tracy Turnblad fights throughout the movie about how she thinks black people should be treated equally on television. This reflects the ideas of the civil rights movement and the peaceful protests used during that time period. In addition, Tracy is a character throughout the movie that represents the need for acceptance because of her weight. The dancers on television are not accepting of her because of her weight and she proves them wrong. The movie is entertaining with its music and humor. A character that stands out is the mother, played by John Travolta. He takes on a female part as a larger woman and Tracy's mother. The character brings comic relief to the movie. The theme of the movie is serious, but there is also an idea of hope and acceptance of others in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie based on the play that was based on the *original* movie. Gotta love it!!! The movie works very well and is a fun watch with a superb cast.I'm a great fan of the 1988 original. This one does not compete, nor does it try to. Think of it as gelato vs. sorbet. They're similar and complimentary.Christopher Walken and John Travolta are cute and believable as Tracy's parents. Michelle Pfeiffer, does that woman ever age? Queen Latifah, all hail Her Majesty! I preferred Ricki Lake's Tracy, but Nikki Blonsky is very likable too. The 1988 Amber was a lot snarkier than this one. I do like the fact that they did not recast Velma's husband (a nod to the late Sonny Bono) or Arvin Hodgepile (RIP Divine). Nice.In fact, my only problem with the movie was this:When Tracy and Motormouth and them decide to march, Link pusses out. The REAL (1988) Link never would have pulled that crap.Other than that, I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray is hilarious and very witty, probably the best family-friendly musical film from 2007. Based on the 2002 Broadway musical, and borrowing elements from the original screen-play from John Waters. This adaptation delivers show-stopping numbers and a star-studded cast. It's the story of one plump Baltimore teen and how she'll fight to stand up for what's right. Even if she isn't as glamorous as all the thin girls she still ends up wooing Link Larkin, and helps her mother overcome her agoraphobia. Also helps her fellow friends of a different race fight for their rights. Hairspray is one movie that reminds you "You Can't Stop the Beat"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Adam Shankman (A Walk to Remember, Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Bedtime Stories), I hadn't seen the original 1988 John Waters version before, but I didn't think it really mattered, especially with this remake having an all star cast, so I really wanted to see it. Basically, set in 1962, overweight teenager Tracy Turnblad (Golden Globe nominated Nikki Blonsky) is bright and always smiling, and she has dreams to become a famous dancer, just like those who appear on The Corny Collins Show. She and her best friend Penny Pingleton (She's the Man's Amanda Bynes) run home every day after school to watch the show to see host Corny Collins (James Marsden) and drool over dancer Link Larkin (Zac Efron), and this obsession concerns Tracy's mother Edna (Golden Globe nominated John Travolta). Then Tracy finds out that the show are holding auditions for a new dancer to replace the one who has dropped out, and she is overjoyed to get the role, with the help of her friend Seaweed J. Stubbs (Elijah Kelley). The only people that are not very happy to see an overweight member of the dancing gang are nasty and racist WYZT station manager Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her bratty dancer daughter Amber (Prom Night's Brittany Snow). Tracy becomes really popular with the viewers with her high energy dancing and bright personality, and she questions why the whole team are all white and the black people only show up on Negro Day once a month, and she tries to change this policy. Velma is determined to get the overweight star off the show, despite growing ratings and letters to the show, but the star's mother, father Wilbur (Christopher Walken), Seaweed, Link, Penny and black singing star Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) they try to make changes. There does come the point when Velma does get what she wants, as the "Miss Teenage Hairspray" pageant is coming soon, and the network manager wants to make sure that the winner is daughter Amber. Tracy does manage to make it to the studio in time to participate, and Velma unknowingly confesses her nasty plans on live camera, and she is fired, and it turns out the winner is actually black Little Inez Stubbs (Taylor Parks), and this means the black and white communities are equalised. Also starring Allison Janney as Prudy Pingleton, Jerry Stiller as Mr. Pinky, John Waters as Flasher, original star Ricki Lake as Talent Agent, Adam Shankman as Talent Agent, Marc Shaiman as Talent Agent and Scott Wittman as Talent Agent. Blonsky gives a great smiley leading performance and sings very well, Travolta is almost unrecognisable as her fat mother, Pfeiffer is a good choice as the villain style character, and all the supporting cast members like Walken and Snow are well casted also. The references to the time period are good, the bright colours and costume designs are great, the singing by the stars themselves is all well done, and the songs like "Good Morning Baltimore", "The Nicest Kids In Town", "Welcome To The 60s" and "You Can't Stop The Beat" are all fun to listen to, all in all it is a fabulously fun satirical musical comedy. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up &amp; Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the 60's (or how a remake can actually work)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1988, the cult director John Waters made a musical-type approach to his childhood in Baltimore that resulted in the film Hairspray, which in turn resulted in a successful Broadway musical a couple of years ago.As expected in the wake of the recent spate of film adaptations of stage musicals, the adaptation/remake of Hairspray was expected and unlike earlier tries that gave extremely poor results (Rent, The Producers, The Phantom of the Opera) Hairspray works and exceeds the expectations of seeing a musical at the height and claiming the genre after several setbacks.The story revolves around Tracy Turnbland (the wonderful Nikki Blonsky), who despite living with overweight dreams to join the group of dancers from the Corny Collins Show, and when the opportunity to audition comes, she must make aside the prejudices of his overprotective mother (played by a brilliant John Travolta) and the channel manager Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), who above all seeks to privilege her daughter Amber. On her way, Tracy will find out not only the prejudices towards overweight people but also the racial prejudices prevalent at the time, and she will find love personified by Link Larkin (Zac Efron), the star dancer of the show.Thus, the director Adam Shankman takes us to an era in which a teenager's dream translated into dance and being part of the latest fashion through costumes and retro art direction that really makes you feel you're watching the 60's, great choreography,the performances of a sensational cast in that absolutely no one is out of place (and by my surprise, in which they all sing and do it very well) and a catchy soundtrack and full of energy and an honest reflection on racial discrimination (which in fact works better than some "Pseudo-adult-manifests-on-racism" like Crash)Without doubt, Hairspray is a major surprise in every way: a big and great musical with big songs and a big ensemble cast.In other words, is big as its protagonist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlikely musical success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Waters' 1988 original "Hairspray" was a brilliant candy-coloured movie about a fatso teenager becoming a dancing star in Baltimore and battling racial segregation on her way. The movie we're discussing isn't a remake, but a film adaptation of the Broadway musical that was based on the John Waters movie; which wasn't actually a musical. And, by the way, John Waters didn't direct the 2007 product, either. So those are some important differences.The 2007 Hairspray is a brilliant musical movie which another user here described quite appropriately as "the ultimate feelgood movie", with, as I might add, extra lashings of political righ-on-ness and a double dose of body antifascism. If you listen closely you can here a few actual racial equality activists retching in the background, but for the super good time you'll have to accept that as part of the package, along with the lack of the acidity of the 1988 original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first viewed "Hairspray" from the trailers, I was rolling my eyes in disbelief. I mean, come on, John Travolta in drag? Is this where his career path is heading into? But to my surprise he was really good in his role and I can tell he was having fun playing the laundress mother Edna Turnblad. Sure he wasn't the best actor in this movie, but you couldn't help but laugh at the fact that a super stud like Travolta giving up his macho demeanor for a pair of leggings and lipstick.It certainly is one of the best modern day musicals I'e seen in a long while. Along with "Moulin Rouge" and "Chicago", I hope "Hairspray" brings back the dying genre of musical comedy.I remember watching the original John Waters "Hairspray" years ago, so I came to the theater expecting something special. Of course the movie will tarnish more cinematic innuendos in comparison to the original Broadway musical. The original 1988 movie had a more darker content in contrast to the more fun and hilarious stage performance. They were both excellent as on would expect, but I was saddened that they left out two of my favorite songs "The Big Dollhouse" and "Mama I'm a Big Girl Now."What can I say about the acting? Well for one thing, the standout performance of them all is Nikki Blonsky. She just devoured every scene she was in, just like Jennifer Hudson did in "Dreamgirls". Her songs probably eclipsed over the original Tracy (Ricki Lake). Zac Efron shadows away from his schmaltzy "High School Musical" role with a very scintillating performance. Christopher Walken continues to shine in everything that he's accomplished, including singing. Amanda Bynes was convincing enough because her role was meant to be a character "just finding her voice" and she does it effectively. Michelle Pfieffer is both beautiful and talented as she's always been. Queen Latifah, the Queen of Rap was wonderful as the record shop owner and host of "Negro Day". Elijah Kelley as Seaweed was a pleasure to watch and has a wonderful singing voice. Brittany Snow's Amber had a great voice too, though her role was very small and her singing was limited in use.The direction by Adam Shankman was crisp and clear, but the one stink I have to make is that the school bell was blurry as the scene changes, but it really made no big deal. The costumes were purely authentic, it brought back found memories of how my parents dressed in the 1960's. The hair, the attitudes, the culture,the phrases and the music. were vintage 1960's. It was a nostalgic roller-coaster ride where times were simpler.This is definitely a movie you should own and cherish for long, long time. If you feel like dancing, lip-syncing or want to invite your friends for a sleepover, this is the perfect movie for everyone to watch. If you didn't see it yet, what the hell are you waiting for. Go rent or buy it, you wouldn't want to miss this opportunity.</fullReview>

In the original film, all of the characters - even the bad ones - had some amount of humor or nuttiness that was really enjoyable. The characters in the musical lack that crazy fun that made me giggle. Especially Mrs. Von Tussle. This version took all of the over-the-top silliness about her character and turned her into just plain mean and evil.Call me a goody-goody, but I prefer my villains to be fun.

		<fullReview>This movie was incredible! Fantastic! Hilarious sometimes! I had heard a few positive comments for this film, but i didn't expect anything like this! I have to agree now that it's truly today's "Grease". The story talks about Tracy, a plump teenager who dreams of becoming a TV star through her amazing dancing abilities. This is difficult though when she has a mother who wants her to become a laundress like her and discourages her. I'd really like to tell you what happens next, but then again what's the point of watching a movie when you know what happens in the end? Nikki Blonsky gives a pretty nice performance for a newcomer as Tracy Turnblad, John Travolta is a very pleasant surprise as Tracy's fat mother, and we generally have entertaining performances throughout the whole film. The music is totally what we call "fell good", as it makes you wanna dance sometimes, and the '60s atmosphere is made extraordinarily well! In conclusion, this is a MUST SEE movie for all audiences, and especially musical lovers. DON'T MISS IT!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta revolta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray was an excellent Broadway musical and a quirky original film, but this movie musical was a disappointment. Travolta may have been able to dance in a fat suit, but his accent is truly revolting and distracting (to give you an idea, 'diet' is pronounced 'dot'), and his acting comes from the Renee Zellweger school of eye-crinkling and mouth-pursing. Two pivotal songs, 'Momma, I'm a Big Girl Now' and 'The Big House' were trashed to make room for another Michelle Pfeiffer number, who also sang poorly (surprising from someone who did her own songs for the Fabulous Baker Brothers). It's as if the producers were star-struck and got talked into making star-based rather than correct decisions. James Marsden was a real treat to watch and listen to, Walken can do anything, and Blonsky was better a better singer than Winokur, although not as good an actress. The romance is muzzled, but should have been central to the theme of discrimination. Too bad!Hopefully they'll remake it in another decade, with a real Hefty Hideaway female in the role of Tracy's mom; drag is SO pass/e (although Harvey Fierstein was FABulous, darling). For the best of both worlds, watch 'Sugarbaby' and listen to the Broadway soundtrack of Hairspray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Hairspray For A New Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This second version of Hairspray got lots of attention for seventies disco king John Travolta doing a role in drag. It was quite an undertaking because the person Travolta was trying to emulate was the one and only Divine. Her characterization of Edna Turnblad in John Waters's original Hairspray was the pivot for that whole film.Hairspray number two retains all the originality and songs and good humor of what John Waters gave us in the Eighties. I guess Travolta was lucky there was no gossip about him and Christopher Walken who plays Wilbur Turnblad in this version.I do wonder if Nikki Blonsky who plays our hefty teenage protagonist Tracy Turnblad will have a career similar to Rikki Lake's. Lake's was going quite well as a talk-show host in the Nineties, but we haven't heard much from her as of late. The thing that shocked me more than John Travolta in drag about this version of Hairspray was the fact that Disney Studios let their number one bubble gum teen idol Zac Efron appear as heartthrob Link Larkin in this version. Maybe it's something that Zac demanded of them and they relented. Presumably he's worried about a career after the third version of High School Musical comes out. Eventually it all has to end. I can say with certainty that old Walter Elias Disney would NEVER have let one of his stars appear in any version of Hairspray. This was the man who ran Tommy Kirk out of the business for being gay. Things have changed a lot in the Magic Kingdom.I enjoyed this version of Hairspray every bit as much as I did the original one. Maybe we should do one for each generation that passes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Queen Latifah,Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Brittany Snow and Amanda Bynes star in "Hairspray," a 2007 movie musical directed by Adam Shankman. Shankman has a great understanding of what made this musical and the John Waters film great, and he brings it to the screen with a stellar cast singing and dancing their way through wonderful songs by Marc Shaiman.Newcomer Nikki Blonsky is the plus-sized, big-haired Tracy Turnblad, and she holds her own well up against her more experienced colleagues, giving a lively, full-voiced performance. John Travolta plays Tracy's mother Edna and Christopher Walken her father - now there's a power couple if there ever was one. Despite criticisms basically based on just not liking John Travolta, he really does a fantastic job. When you're watching a big male star and actually start believing you're watching a female character, that's good acting. Travolta brings a sweetness to the role and manages to dance wearing all that padding. As Tracy's dad, Christopher Walken may seem like odd casting, but he's wonderful. "Timeless to Me" is an absolute gem.The cast is uniformly excellent, with a small, funny role essayed by Allison Janney that again proves what a great character actress she is, and some high-energy vocals and dance by the multitalented Elijah Kelley. James Marsden, as Corny Collins, is very slick. Zac Efron is perfect as the adorable super-hunk Linc. As Miss Baltimore Crabs, what can be said about gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer except that she's terrific as the mean-spirited bigot Velma von Tussle. Now that she's past 40, roles aren't as easy to find for Pfeiffer as they once were, but with Velma, she starts a second career. Queen Latifah sings like a dream.My only problem is that I would have loved more of the songs from the show included - "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now" being one, and the song that Linc and Tracy sing at the jail. But the spirit of the show remains - upbeat, with a driving, pulsating energy and enthusiasm. It's a film with a serious undertone of racial integration, of being different and being accepted in society, and it makes its point with warm characters, a well-paced story, and toe-tapping music. Watch "Hairspray" when you're feeling low, and you'll dance off of the couch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They went and shoved John Travolta in it. That is probably the only gripe I have with this film really, bar some dodgy acting from that High School Musical guy. Why did they have to do it? Anyone but him would have been fantastic! The thing is, Travolta is only good in one role and even then he's not great- the insane lunatic one. For some unfathomable reason, the producers thought that sticking him in a fat suit, planting a wig on his head and making him camp it up like Christmas would make it funny. They were wrong. However, the film itself is actually really good. It is lighthearted and fun which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience. Nikki Blonsky is great as Tracy- although she doesn't have the spark that the original character had and the songs, as camp and pop-like as there are, are actually quite good, especially for a musical- they are far better than the garbage in some recent high school based musicals (not mentioning any names of course) and, overall, this is definitely a film worth getting your hands on for a lazy, possibly lonely, Saturday night in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musical comedy with a political agenda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an interesting mixture of a apparently naive plot- the self-fulfillment of a young girl from Baltimore through dance- and political propaganda- that is the promotion of the agenda of coloured mainly but also 'different' people in general. The original musical is a creation of the sixties which was the heyday of the Civil Rights movement in the USA. The performance of John Travolta as the mother of the aspiring dancer was impressive and comic while it promoted the idea that one should not make distinctions based on size- that is against fat people. Michelle Pfeifer was a very impressive scheming and power-hungry, racist director of a T.V. show dedicated to dance. Queen Latifah had a strong personality as the matriarch of the coloured youth with artistic temperaments. The producer of the show was also a successful representation of the average bigoted American businessman of that age or at least of his image in popular culture. The music and dance were inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to remember, worth seeing again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout this movie (I have never seen the original) I couldn't help thinking about The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The plot is simple but nonetheless bizarre. A "pleasingly plump" teen-aged girl in 1962 wants to dance on Baltimore's version of "American Bandstand" and along the way does her part for civil rights in America. If somebody told me they were going to make a musical about civil rights in the 1960s I would never have believed it. But that is exactly what Hairspray is.But in a way the movie is spot on. Back then the "crackers" saw themselves as squeaky clean, even when they weren't. The "negros" still lived on the wrong side of the tracks and were usually the only ones sent to detention. Sad to say, while there has been some improvement since then, there is still more to do.Anyway, it is the circumstance, richly drawn in an outlandish sort of way, that gives this movie its substance. The colors are brash and the soundtrack loud, the dancing well choreographed.Meanwhile the dialog is often quite hilarious. In one scene Michelle Phiffer is trying to seduce Christopher Walken and he is as obtuse as a 2 X 4. As if. There are several other memorable scenes, such as when the heroine bops a policeman over the head with a protest sign, all designed to convey a message; and that is that it is OK to be different. You don't have to wear your hair the same way as everyone else, or even dance with only those of your own race.This is rated PG, and I guess I can see why. But some themes are clearly over the heads of most pre-teens, and even many teens whose knowledge of history is spotty won't appreciate the humor.Still in all, this is a film to remember, worth seeing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kitschy camp classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Friday I went to see a local theatre production of High School Musical with my girlfriend, a (female) friend, and two of my oldest (male) friends. Whilst the two girls were gushing over how brilliant High School Musical was, the rest of us were not impressed with the show. Mainly because High School Musical takes so much effort in trying to communicate its heavy-handed message, it didn't have that sense of fun a musical should have.Yesterday, I went to see Hairspray with that same group, and whilst my two (male) friends were left unimpressed with Hairspray, I absolutely LOVED it. It's camp right from the outset, but at no point does it ask you to take it seriously. True, it does deal with a very serious issue (racism and segregation in 1960's America), but this doesn't prevent it from having an energetic sense of fun.High School Musical and Hairspray have similar messages (not judging people based on what "group" they belong to), but the difference is the handling of those messages. While High School Musical gets bogged down in its message, Hairspray deals with the message sensitively and manages to create an incredibly fun movie at the same time.The casting is brilliant. Nikki Blonsky has an absolute ball as Tracy Turnblad, as she makes the most she can out of what could be the role that kick-starts a potentially brilliant career in film. Zac Efron (who the girls were swooning over the whole time) expertly portrays a superficial white teen who slowly becomes adjusted to the idea that looks and skin colour are not everything. Elijah Kelley as jive-ass Seaweed delivers an energetic performance tempered with enough heart to his character one of the most sympathetic, as opposed to the stereotypical black guy.The supporting cast, comprised of some of the biggest names around, are also brilliant. Michelle Pfeifer as the villain of the piece is every bit the detestable racist she should be, whilst Queen Latifah is wonderful in the way she portrays the black matriarch who is prepared to go to any lengths for equality between whites and blacks. Christopher Walken manages to remain stiff and inhibited despite all the colour and movement around him, and although he delivers a good performance, it's a shame he never gets a chance to show off his superb dancing skills. John Travolta is strangely subdued in his musical performances (anyone who's seen Grease and Pulp Fiction knows that "subdued" is not a word easily applicable to Travolta), though he is more than adequate as the obviously male mother to Blonsky's character.The musical numbers (and there are a lot of them) are absolutely stunning. Every lead, dancer, and singer is clearly having the time of their life, and if you don't start tapping your feet along with the tunes, you may need to check your pulse.I cannot recommend strongly enough that you get a large group of friends together and see Hairspray while it's still in theatres. It's a breathtaking musical that will bring a smile to the most Gothic of manic depressives. Be warned, this isn't a film that takes itself seriously at all, and it's very, VERY camp and corny in some places. So long as you don't take it too seriously, you should have a blast with this film. I left the theatre feeling happier than I can remember after seeing a film, and I'm definitely getting this one when it comes to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My high school show choir did "You Can't Stop the Beat" my senior year and I just loved it. When I saw the preview I was excited but than I noticed the size of the cast and my heart sank. 11 cast members, 10 of which I knew from other movies. I knew this was just going to be a showcase and a chance for everyone to laugh at John Travolta in a fat suit, dressed as a woman. However, I couldn't have been more wrong.I went to see Hairspray its second week in theaters and I completely blown away. I left humming the songs and even rushed out to buy the soundtrack the next day. The music is so much fun and unlike other musicals that have come out, this one was funny but with a great message too.Now onto the cast, which was exceptional! First, Nikki Blonsky as Tracy was simply superb. I went to her fan board to discuss her talent right after I saw the movie and was shocked how many horrid people had nothing but insults to throw at her because of her weight. They obviously missed the point of the movie, which is to put aside judgments based on anything except what is in the heart and soul of a person. Her smile lights up a room and her voice is simply fantastic. She can belt out a song like there's no tomorrow. As a nobody in a cast of some very "A list" actors, she carried the film and made a niche for herself in Hollywood.Despite what others say, I think John Travolta was wonderful as Edna. His accent was a little strange but as I've only been to the east coast once, and never to Baltimore, I wasn't bothered by it. Christopher Walken was hilarious as always as Wilber. I only wish he could have gotten another chance at successfully pushing Michelle Pfeiffer out the window.Speaking of Michelle Pfeiffer, she is wonderful as well as the scheming Velma Von Tussle as is Brittany Snow as her daughter, Amber. They make a great evil/pathetic mother/daughter team and even kinda resemble each other once their hair is dyed to match.I thought Zac Efron was very sweet as Link. I have never (nor do I want to) seen High School Musical so this my first taste of him and he's a decent actor and a great singer. Elijah Kelley is handsome and very fun as Seaweed and Amanda Bynes (Ask Ashley!) has some of the best lines in the movie.James Marsden was hilarious and I had no idea he could sing. Very pleasant surprise! Queen Latifah can sing but that came as no surprise. Her song during the march on the television station gave me goosebumps and I love her in "You Can't Stop the Beat." This is my second favorite summer movie (must be a Michelle Pfeiffer summer because Stardust is my favorite) simply because no one in the cast is weak and everyone sings wonderfully. It was a great deal of fun and I left with a big smile on my face!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As if this wasn't already the best summer of movies in my life...Hairspray is now one of the best musicals and feel good movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly I knew it would be great. I just had this feeling that this one was going to blow me away and I'm not a huge fan of musicals on screen although I have seen some really spectacular ones including Rent, and Sound of Music. I had never seen Hairspray on stage, although I've always wanted to, and I have never seen the John Waters version although now I really want to so this was a whole new experience for me and what an amazing experience it was!! While director Adam Shankman has never really done anything that has truly blown me away he has been in the business for a long time and worked on some truly terrific projects as director and other parts in the crew but this is truly spectacular work for him. He captured something truly magical in turning this wild, crazy, bright and colorful story into something really important and fun and at every turn you want to jump up and clap and cheer. The music is just plain fun and the scenes are moving and important and there is a really good message amidst some satirical dialog and some very funny scenes and some really great performances. Hairspray is a very unique story and film in the way that it plays out and everyone has such an important role to the story and this is one truly outstanding ensemble cast from small cameos to great big parts.Newcomer, in her movie debut, Nikki Blonsky certainly has some incredible talent around her but she is just downright infectious and this could launch her career through the roof. She is so down to earth and adorable and an amazing singer and dancer. She was just perfect for the role and completely intoxicating and just lit up the screen with that smile. And then there is John Travolta in a bold and controversial movie as Blonsky's mother, the irrepressible Edna Turnblad. Travolta is terrific and I honestly thought that his movie star status and clout might overtake the film and it might be a little 'Travolta' heavy but it wasn't the case at all. His performance and Edna were vital and important to the film but he did such an amazing job. She (Edna) has the spark that her daughter Tracy (Blonsky) has and they are a perfect and dynamic team together. Travolta's accent and performance are terrific without being overdone or campy. He should get an Oscar Nomination...period. Michelle Pfeiffer looks beautiful and is a completely amazing catty villain as station manager Velma Von Tussle. She looks terrific and this is a great role for her and she hasn't had a lot of them lately. She is really great and seeing her and Walken go head to head in one scene (from Batman Returns days) was really awesome. Speaking of the man...Christopher Walken. I think I could watch this man recite the phone book and it'd be the most interesting thing I'd ever seen. I think Walken is the most versatile actor in the history of film. He pulls out all the stops as Travolta's loving husband and Tracy's Dad. He's funny and cute, and dances and sings and he's just amazing. And yet he still has that Christopher Walken way about him that never leaves his performances. The scene involving him and Travolta singing and dancing on the roof top is probably one of the best scenes in movie history I have ever seen. Co-starring as Tracy's light headed but big hearted best friend is Amanda Bynes. My girlfriend will kill me for this but I have to confess I have a big crush on Bynes. She is a very talented comedian and I think has a gift for really taking control on screen. I kind of feel like they underused her in this film and she really didn't get a lot of focus but then she wasn't the focus of the film. Still it seemed like they were using her in various strange and an almost subtly sexual manner. The lollipops, the school girl outfit, the pig tails, being tied to the bed...maybe I was over thinking it but she got the short end of the stick and they didn't really utilize her talents. Brittany Snow is also adorable and perfectly 'Mean Girl' in her role as the entitled and Miss Perfect Amber Von Tussle. I would have liked to have seen her get more of an appropriate ending and I would have liked to have seen Tracy have a little tuft with her in the end but she was really good in her role. James Marsden (terrific and captivating in his role), Queen Latifah (stunning and beautiful, outspoken, really great role), Zac Efron (bound to become Hollywood's latest 'It' boy and a really talented singer and dancer and actor, Elijah Kelley (terrific performance and had great chemistry with Bynes), Allison Janney (just hilarious in her small cameo role and had some great physical comedy), and Jerry Stiller who is just one of those guys you smile at when you see him show up on screen.You just have to see this cast in action to truly understand where I'm coming from with this. Every song they sang, every scene that passed I felt like jumping up and cheering and applauding. They make you feel like you are right there and having an incredible time with them all. If you need a boost, a smile, a tingle of good feeling that nearly brings tears to your eyes in how epic and fun this is then you need to drop everything and go see Hairspray because in one of the best summers in my 30 years of life for movies there has been one of the best thrillers (Mr. Brooks), Action movies (Live Free or Die Hard, Transformers, Bourne Ultimatum), Comedies (Knocked Up, Simpsons Movie) and now this amazing movie. Please go see it!! 10/10</fullReview>

Little Inez was adorable .. and a great dancer. I loved Queen Latifah ... she was amazing.The second half of the movie feels much "stronger" and better than the first. I thought this movie definitely got better as it went along, in terms of story, acting, singing, and dancing (basically, everything).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie for the first time in theaters the day after it came out. I was surprised when I came out the movie theater with the idea that the film was the best ever. (No, it wasn't Zac Efron that did it for me either.) Although he was good my favorite character was Tracy (Nikki Blonsky.) I thought for a girl that they found at Coldstone she did an amazing job. She brought such life to the screen. Many times throughout the movie I felt my foot tapping on the floor and my cheeks hurting from so much smiling. I knew I was grinning like an idiot, but I didn't care. This is the definition of a feel-good movie. I came out of it inspired to do good things.I saw the movie for the second time today. I found out that it was even better the second time around. Since I was accustomed to the songs and knew the feel for the movie it was even more enjoyable the second time. I found myself wanting to get up and sing and dance through the aisles just like characters sang and danced on the screen.The other surprising performance for me was Amanda Bynes. She was amazing. I never knew she can sing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually Im not used to watch musical films, but this one was surprisingly entertaining. the story was totally enjoyable, the plot incredibly convincing. Great funny moments combine with tear-dropping drama. The cast is simply extraordinary, Beginning with the big debut of Nikki Blonsky, this girl has everything to become a superstar, with a great amount of charisma. John Travolta is so funny as Edna Turnblad, I never expected that this role would be a great hit for him, he is simply perfect. Michelle Pfeiffer is also excellent on her role of Velma Von Tussle, a 50's femme fatal that knows how to obtain everything that she wants with her beauty. Christopher Walken is just perfect as Wilbur Turnblad, his character is intelligent but innocent and also very funny. Queen Latifah performance is great, this is the kind of movies for her. James Marsden really looks as a 50's TV announcer. Amanda Bynes very good as Tracy's best friend and even the special appearance from Jerry Stiller was very funny. The music is excellent, the choreographs perfect, the costume design amazing. In conclusion, a movie that has everything great music, great singing, great dancing, great actors, its a must see movie. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best musicals all time and the best since Chicago in 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hairspray" is probably one of the most energetic musicals I've ever seen. Either all the songs are fast, or if they are slow they are full of sight gags, making this a great movie for kids, adults, and men and women. "Hairspray" takes place in 1962, and deals with the changes being made at the time towards all colors, and towards people who are a little different. Nikki Blonsky plays Tracey Turnblatt, a heavy set high school student who dreams of dancing on her favorite television program, the Corny Collins show. Blonsky's performance is really about as good as you can get, as were most of the other performances in the film. Tracey is finally accepted on the Corny Collins show, and when she is, she infuriates the show choreographer Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfieffer) by expressing that she thinks everyday should be negro day, which only comes once a month on the program. Tracey's sweet nature and wanting to do what's right ends up causing a popular kid Link (Zac Effron), to like her, and her mother (John Travolta) to come outside for the first time in 10 years. This movie was a real joy to watch, because of how peppy and fun it was, along with handling the theme of fairness, and also having a great sense of humor. If it doesn't get you hooked by the first song, I'll be surprised.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 115 mins. Rated PG for language, sexual humor, some adult themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's biggest surprises: a sparkling musical full of vitality and humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A musical that deals with racism while retaining a light touch? Most directors wouldn't dare make such a film, as it would be too easy to mess everything up. Adam Shankman's Hairspray, however, is one of the year's most pleasant comedies because, similarly to Michael Bay's Transformers, it takes its own trashiness and turns it into a quality.Based on the eponymous Broadway show, which in turn was inspired by one of John Waters' few mainstream pictures, Hairspray is set in Baltimore, late '60s. In this kind of environment, young people have only two hobbies: getting a cool (?) hairdo and watching the Corny Collins Show, where people their age get to sing, dance and become famous under the supervision of a smug yet likable host (James Marsden). Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) would love to be part of the show, whereas her mother Edna (John Travolta) doesn't agree. Fortunately, her father (Christopher Walken) supports her decision, and so the energetic girl manages to get cast despite being overweight. Because of that last factor she is frowned upon by one of the show's producers, Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), a woman who uses the program simply to make a celebrity out of her talentless daughter Amber (Brittany Snow). The fact that Amber's boyfriend Link (Zac Efron) has begun to show an interest in Tracy isn't that good either, which is why Velma decides to get rid of her no matter the cost, while at the same time focusing on getting the African-American minority out of the way as well. At this point, an open conflict begins, as Tracy, who has befriended a group of black dancers, finds an ally in Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah), Corny's co-host, who knows exactly how to use music to make things better.The film should be a message movie, and in fact it manages to criticize racism on a few occasions, albeit without turning into a Spike Lee joint. Most of the time, though, the plot is rather thin, and for a good reason: the story is actually one big excuse for some non-stop singing and dancing. In another movie, this kind of choice might be ridiculous, but in the hands of Shankman, who also choreographed the musical numbers, it becomes priceless: he injects the film with a passion and an energy that is hard to find these days, making Hairspray an unstoppable ride that sets out to merely provide the audience with a good time and eminently succeeds.And in the middle of this ride, he has found one of 2007's acting revelations: making her screen debut, Blonsky is a mix of sweetness and relentless vitality that makes her adorable right from the start, in the hilarious "Good Morning Baltimore" sequence (which also features a great cameo by Waters). Her talent and commitment are shared by her young co-stars (Efron, Amanda Bynes and Elijah Kelley), who all make sure the story has an emotional core amidst the music-induced madness.As for the adult cast, that is actually where the movie's only problem resides: while the cheerfully evil Pfeiffer and musical veteran Latifah have no trouble merging with their roles, Travolta and Walken show a little discomfort at first, both needing a couple of scenes before they can perfect the transition from "amusing" to "irresistibly funny" (the scene where the two perform "You Are Timeless To Me" together manages to be entertaining and oddly touching simultaneously). Travolta, in particular, raised a lot of controversy prior to the movie's release when people heard he was going to play the obese Edna, only to turn out to be one of the film's gems: ditching the usual physical and vocal stereotypes (he actually sounds more like Mike Myers playing Dr. Evil than Dustin Hoffman playing Tootsie), he plays the part completely straight, making Tracy's mother look like a human being, not a grotesque caricature; even more satisfyingly, the fat-suit he had to wear for the role has not impaired his dancing abilities, which means he may look like a middle-aged, overweight woman, but he still moves like Tony Manero and Danny Zuko, thus providing one of the film's biggest pleasures when he is given the chance to show he's still got it. Even so, however, he doesn't steal the movie: the one who gets closest, even if the picture really belongs to Blonsky and her mates, is Marsden who, taking a vacation from superhero movies (he appeared in the X-Men trilogy AND Superman Returns), has a lot of fun and uses his handful of scenes to perfection, delivering a performance that is consciously dumb and therefore impossible not to enjoy.Having a message without being preachy, light in tone without bordering on rubbish, Hairspray is a great piece of entertainment for the whole family. It might not win any Oscars, but it is a solid two hours of pure fun, and that should be enough.8,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rip-rocking modern day musical has a life and rhythm of its own. In 1962 Baltimore, a pleasantly plump teenager (newcomer Nikki Blonsky) dreams of starring on a local dance program led by James Marsden and Zac Efron. Amazingly her dream comes true with hilarious, poignant, and chaotically musical number results. Blonsky is a good soul with a heart of gold who has obvious problems with the racial segregation she sees all around her. Enter station manager Michelle Pfeiffer (at her hottest since "The Fabulous Baker Boys") who acts as the villain who would rather only see high-class Caucasian people on television and really no one else. Blonsky's parents (Christopher Walken as a joke/gag store owner and John Travolta in drag as Blonsky's insecure overweight laundress mother) are riotous characters whose good morals and shining qualities are always apparent and illuminated. Wonderful musical in the tradition of the most recent modern-day masterpieces of the once-believed dead genre. The performers are all home-run hitters (including standouts Queen Latifah, Allison Janney, and Amanda Bynes) who have their moments in the spotlight and the choreography/musical numbers are something to be appreciated. Director Adam Shankman has crafted a fun, memorable, smart, and surprisingly socially-aware movie which has loads of upside. What's not to love about seeing former "Pulp Fiction" alums Travolta and Walken in a whacked dance sequence? Shades of Travolta and Uma Thurman in 1994? Not quite, but still not a bad movie. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't say I'm a massive fan of musicals ... Moulin Rouge is the only other that springs to mind as a favourite ...Hairspray, however is a fantastically feel-good movie. Nikki Blonsky literally LIGHTS UP the screen and the very strong supporting cast deliver a brilliant re-spin on the 1988 classic. In a very depressing, violent world it was a real pleasure to sit through this 2 hours happy-fest and the smile didn't disappear from my face for the entire run time.A surprisingly apolitical film too, the march scene with (the always brilliant) Queen Latifah is highly poignant and moving, the race card being intelligently mentioned but never played for controversy. The musical numbers (of which there are an impressive amount) are almost irritatingly toe- tapping, with particular mention going out to the finale "You Can't Stop The Beat" ... It's really the cast that make this. Zac Efron (the dude from High School Musical) breaks out of the Disney mould and established himself as a great male lead, and his terrific voice makes it all the better. Amanda Bynes plays Blonsky's ditzy best friend, and she's a real pleasure to watch too, her voice being surprisingly strong also. The real scene stealers however have to be Blonsky, Latifah and the heavily costumed and dragged-up Travolta, who makes a DISTURBINGLY good woman!All in all, fantastic music, cinematography and production design make for a very enjoyable night at the movies, FAR more than I had expected!10/10 Dir: Adam Shankman / New Line / PG / 2007</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a beautiful old-fashioned Hollywood musical! Sure, it has the background of bigotry, segregation and integration, tolerance and understanding in Baltimore of the 60's, but except for one song, no preaching. The music was fine, the dancing great, the acting delightful. The dancing and music nicely blended into the action. I was delighted that Travolta did a great job, subdued and comedic - a wonderful Edna, mother of the irrepressible Tracy. The plot - well, it does simplify the civil rights movement - but I don't think It's a spoiler to say that it's fun and ends happily. Michelle Pfeiffer plays an over the top meanie, Christopher Walken, as usual, is great, and does a wonderful dance with John Travolta, who plays his wife. Queen Latifah brings a lot of it together. You walk out of the movie knowing that you will be very happy to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Shankman is a genius!Hairspray is the best re-make I've ever seen. It has so many similarities to the original 1988 version. In the original a man plays the character of Edna Turnblad; which is the person John Travolta plays. Travolta is amazing many a time during viewing I forgot Edna was played by a man. Jerry Stiller was in the original as well as Rikki Lake so bringing them back was so respectful. The comedy was great and everyone was enjoying it. The racism of the characters was not extremely offensive in any way, and they made what could be a racist comment into a comedic moment. The actors could not have been selected better. This movie reminds us that we can do any thing we want. This movie also brought to my attention to the incredible strides we have made from that period of time. Not only is this movie wonderful but it is a view into our past showing us how accepting we've become.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original John Waters movie "Hairspray" was one of the genuine unalloyed delights of the 1980's. Since the material seemed tailor-made for the stage from the outset, it was only a matter of time before some astute dramatists (in this case, Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan) would get around to converting it into a smash Broadway show - and, indeed, their creation went on to win the Tony Award for Best Musical of 2002. Now "Hairspray" has come full circle, returning as a full-fledged movie musical that will lift your spirits and set your toes to tapping in record-setting time. Needless to say, only a total curmudgeon could resist the pull of this film.The musical "Hairspray" stays true to the ebullient spirit, ribald satire and offbeat humor of the original film while adding a generous helping of original song-and-dance numbers that take the material to a new level. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky assumes the role, originated by Ricki Lake in the 1988 film, of Miss Tracy Turnblad, the eternally sunny teenager with a heart as outsized as her fulsome figure and ceiling-scraping coiffure. Obsessed with the fashions and accoutrements of early '60's pop culture, Tracy takes Baltimore by storm when she secures a spot as a regular on the Corny Collins dance show on local TV. Once ensconced on the program, the naively optimistic Tracy, a true product of her time, spearheads the effort to bring white and black teens together on the dance floor, a radical proposition for 1962 that does not sit well with the bigoted station manager and major segments of the city's population. As such, the movie is what "Grease" or "Bye Bye Birdie" might have been had they been imbued with a social conscience. Yet, even though this "Hairspray" is immensely enjoyable on any number of levels, we still miss some of the trademark subversiveness that Waters brought to the original (Tracy's being thrown into "special ed" classes at school, for instance, has been summarily dropped). For all its undeniable glory and charm, this is a softer, more user-friendly version of the story than we're used to seeing. But the original's themes of inclusiveness, of breaking down social barriers, and of being true to oneself still come through loud and clear.As a crowd-pleasing musical, "Hairspray" kicks into high gear from its opening moments and never lets up. Director Adam Shankman allows the innate energy of the material to burst out in any number of ways - be it the dazzling, high-stepping choreography; the gracefully gliding camera-work; the sharp, rhythmic editing; the bright, flashy color scheme; the clever, witty lyrics; or the nostalgia-inducing and humorously exaggerated hairdos and costumes. There's even a wonderful scene in which Tracy's love interest sings a song to her framed picture - and the picture sings back! This intense stylization allows "Hairspray" to exist in a never-never fantasy land where centuries of racial prejudice can be wiped away in the blink of an eye, and we never question the plausibility of it for a second. It's a dream we want to believe in and, if it becomes a little self-congratulatory at times, well, who but the most dour party pooper is going to be complaining about that when the rest of us are having such a great time? Much of the credit for "Hairspray"'s success goes to the actors, all of whom do a splendid job capturing the offbeat, fun-loving spirit of the piece. As Tracy, Blonsky perfectly conveys the innate sweetness, wide-eyed innocence and boundless energy that make the character so tremendously appealing to the audience. John Travolta, appearing in full fat-suit and drag, is a hoot as Tracie's supportive but supremely self-conscious mother, Edna, as is Christopher Walken as the devoted husband and father to the zaftig Turnblad clan. Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Byrnes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Britanny Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly, Allison Janney and Jerry Stiller round out the spectacular, powerhouse cast.The score by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman is not only exuberant and catchy in its own right, but perfectly captures the rhythm and style of the music of the period. I guarantee that your toes will be tapping quite a bit throughout the course of this film.In a summer in which audiences have seen one bloated mega-blockbuster after another crash and burn before their very eyes, it is a joy to be able to report that here at last is the genuine article - a perfect summertime entertainment that restores your faith in commercial movie-making and will have you coming back for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get ready to dance and tap. The music is here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a tepid summer of tired sequels and action orgies this film is a breath of fresh air. I am not usually a big fan of musicals, but this one won me over! The young cast seems to be bursting with joy and the experienced performers are clearly having a ball, as well. The songs are exuberant and the story, well-known to many because of its long run as a stage show (based on a 80's flick and starring Ricki Lake at one point), is very good for a musical and even addresses the civil rights' issues of the 60s.Teenage newcomer, Nikki Blonsky, won the celebrity lottery and landed the lead role of Tracy Turnblad, a Baltimore high school student who is obsessed with becoming one of the dancers on the local Corny Collins Show and stealing the heart of the lead dancer, Link Larkin (Zac Efron). Tracy's mother, Edna Turnblad, played frighteningly well in drag by John Travolta, is worried that Tracy will get hurt. This role has traditionally been played in drag going back to the 1988 feature with the famous transvestite, Divine. Christopher Walken is great as Tracy's dad, who supports her dream. Look for a funny cameo by original writer, John Waters as a neighborhood flasher. Michelle Pfeifer and Brittany Snow star as the nasty mother/daughter team of Velma and Amber Von Tussle who are determined to prevent any changes to lily white, homogeneous look of the show. Queen Latifah and Elijah Kelley's characters of Motormouth Maybelle and Seaweed, performers on the show's 'Negro Day' march to fight for the rights of all, when even that tiny representation on the air is threatened. Tracy disregards the risk and marches with them.Well, I don't want to start gushing, but this is the most appealing and energetic musical since Grease and if you liked that wonderful fifties romp, then this should be a can't-miss movie for you. The performances and charming cast combine with a strong story, along with catchy tunes and nifty dance numbers, to create a winner that will be remembered long after the summer and all of its mediocre films have been forgotten.(This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray, take two: better than the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SOLID A* Rarely does a remake surpass expectations, much less surpass the original! The remake of Hairspray does both. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky's adorable zeal for life makes the audience fall in love with her by the end of the opening number. This is a musical, but it is so humorous and entertaining that you forget the actors are singing sometimes! A few minor plot changes- the contest at the end is "Miss Hairspray", not "Miss Baltimore", and the integration scenes are different in length and makeup- shake things up a bit and lighten the seriousness of the plot line. Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelline was a given in casting this film, and Amanda Bynes is a little dirtier and cuter than the original Penny. Some of the casting decisions were a little hasty, in my opinion. I could not get past Brittany Snow as Amber, the backstabbing attention-seeker, played by the blue-eyed TV sweetheart; Michelle Pfeiffer played her mother at least as well as the actress from the 1988 version of the film. I hadn't seen Michelle sing in any film since Grease 2! Cool Rider, anyone? I have to mention John Travolta as Mrs. Edna Turnblad (better acted than you'd think from the previews, I promise) and his counterpart played by Christopher Walken. The duet they share is priceless.With a cast like this, how could you miss this film? The theater I saw this movie in, was full of folks who applauded at the end. I guarantee laughs.</fullReview>

The cast and acting was excellent, they superbly conveyed their emotion to the viewers. Michelle Pfeifer played her hideous character in the most fantastic way ever and I cant say enough good things about Johnny T as Edna Turnblad.I'm going to watch it again, worth my $10 and they get a star for every dollar I paid and much more!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, just saw this on a Saturday night date. I saw the original. The lady friend had seen the original movie and the play. We both agreed that this was a likable bit of over the top corn.There are some benefits to this one. One the whole, I liked the 1988 film better, but I think that Nikki Blonsky even improves on Rikki Lake as Tracy Turnblad. Nikki has just the right bit of upbeat, youthful enthusiasm and undefeatable spirit required for this character (Good Morning Baltimore, anyone? The scene of her singing this song at the top of her lungs while riding a trash truck on the way to school is unforgettably hilarious).Queen Latifah is also a better Motormouth Mabel than Ruth Brown was in the original (Miss Brown was a great singer, but not much of an actress). Speaking of which, we all know that the (accurately titled) "Corny Collins Show" was based on the real "Buddy Deane Show" which was the American Bandstand of Baltimore. Conversely, Motormouth Mabel appears to be based on Paul "Fat Daddy" Johnson, a Black Baltimore DJ who appeared on the real "Negro Day" on the Deane show.Now back to the film. For the most part, the crazy, over the top humor that made Hairspray I so successful is just crazy and over the top without as much of the humor in this one. John Travola as Edna is just plain silly, but the actor who plays "her" husband has the right amount of goofy charm to pull it off. The "Negro Day" scene is straight out of "Mad TV." Some might resent the "ghetto as a playground" idea of the film and the civil rights march scene falls flat in its attempt to be meaningful and serious, but it's heart is in the right place and Latifah works it for what she can.The actress who plays the spoiled blonde whose mother strangles the show for what she can get seems to eerily forecast Paris Hilton.The songs have just the right amount of cheeky goof appeal and satire of the teen dance shows of the sixties, so they work quite well.In short, it's not a bad film, just remember to leave your brains at the door and don't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well when I went and saw this movie it started out really corny and kind of dumb, but as it went on it got better and it ended up to be one of the best movies of the summer! The characters were matched up well with the actors selected to play them, and the storyline was fairly close to the one in the play. it was colorful, funny, and made you want to get up in dance right in the middle of the theater. However, there were some details that were left out in the movie that seemed really important in the play. For example Tracy never goes to jail and gets rescued by Link. But I guess things like that are what make the movie more unique from the play itself. This is going to do very well</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baltimore Bliss!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful musical was a two hour treat of indulgent escapism. From the first line of 'Good Morning Baltimore' I defy viewers not to have a broad grin permanently fixed to their face, as they watch a terrific cast sing and dance their way to musical brilliance. The outcome may have been predictable but this fits perfectly with the film's feel-good nature, and the message that is delivered. Blonsky, Travolta, Bynes and co. deliver believable and comically sound performances that dazzle and delight when coupled with the stunning music and choreography. Hairspray is the kind of film to watch with friends on a lazy summer afternoon, and not one to be critically discussed for the intricacies of the message it portrays. While that message is one of immeasurable importance, it is one with which we all concur, leaving the only thing to be discussed the correct lyrics for the many catchy songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I love musicals, and I enjoy John Water's more "mainstream" movies (Hairspray, Pecker, Cry Baby). I loved nearly everything about Adam Shankman's re-imagining of the original film, except for a few things. First, Nikki Blonski, Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Christopher Walken, and Elijah Kelley are all absolutely stunning, great voices and great acting. John Travolta and Michelle Pfeiffer are terrible. John Travolta's voice waivers between a Midwestern accent to his normal, JT voice, to some other weird accent throughout the movie. After the cuteness of Travolta being a woman wears off, you realize that his acting is quite bad...Pfeiffer too.So the movie and music are excellent, songs are top-shelf, Travolta almost kills it all with his confused, poorly-acted character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie that preaches tolerance, this movie isn't very tolerant of religious faith. The only character who is explicitly Christian (and apparently Catholic) is presented as sadistic and narrow minded. She ties her daughter to her bed and then plays "The Lord's Prayer" on the record player. Why is it that the few times Hollywood presents the Christian faith it is presented in a negative light? Oh that's right...it's Hollywood! I wonder if the producers of this movie realize that Catholic priests and nuns, along with Protestant pastors, were among the marchers for civil rights in the 1960s. I did enjoy the music and appreciated the message of racial equality and integration. John Travota was a hoot!</fullReview>

I love Zac Efron and he is so cute. Nikki had a great first on-screen appearance and I think she will go a long way seeing that she is only my age, 17. I want to see the Broadway show of this now.

The entire cast is excellent and I was laughing and smiling from beginning to end. I had my doubts about Travolta but he blew it out of the park as Ms. Edna. He gave his own performance and did not try to impersonate Divine or Harvey, he seemed much more like a real women than a man in drag and the chemistry between Travolta and Chris Walken was great, you really believed they were man and wife, their musical number is a highlight of the movie. I'm going to see it again this week with a different group of friends and I know I'll buy it on DVD. This is the best 10.00 bucks you will spend this summer, forget Transformers, Hairspray is the kinda movie Hollywood needs to make more of, cause I think we all just want to feel good and Hairspray delivers in spades!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A much better film-to-Broadway-to-film adaptation than The Producers. And unlike Dreamgirls, it doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't ashamed to be the over-the-top, realism out the window, movie musical it should be.The younger cast is fantastic, with Elijah Kelley's Seaweed being the standout. John Travolta as Edna Turnblad is refreshingly subdued and touching(particularly surprising considering the character's unapologetic campiness in previous versions of this story.) Less successful was Queen Latifah's Motormouth Maybelle. She's so watered-down and meek that it makes the viewer wonder how she got her nickname.During the musical numbers, director Adam Shankman's camera is considerably less intrusive than, say, Rob Marshall's in Chicago, but I still would have preferred even less cinematographic pizazz and more of the old-fashioned "let the dance numbers wow us without all the jerky edits" kind.If you don't think you'll enjoy this film, I'll honestly say you probably won't. But, as expected, I had a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helluva movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray is one helluva movie, it's a brilliant musical, possibly one of my favorite films this year (up there with Die Hard, Hot Fuzz, Spidey 3, Waitress, Blood Diamond and Dreamgirls) and one of the best musicals of all time, it just works, unlike the producers which while being a nice film felt very tacky and badly directed and Dreamgirls (even though brilliant) had too much of an operatic feel, but this just worked. It felt like a classic musical where everything just worked out in a good way. The direction by Adam Shankman (who has had some terrible films under his belt) was brilliant, his shots just worked (the opening shot of Baltimore, and the dance number in Welcome to the 60's were some I was impressed with) and he managed the mix of fantasy and realism quite well, none of the musical numbers felt out of place. The acting was great, Travolta wasn't half as annoying as the trailers make him out to be, you really believe that Christopher Walken and him are in love, Amanda Bynes was sweet but under used, Zac Efron (the main reason my cinema was full) ditched his teeny bopper style and moved on to great things, Michell Pfeiffer was brilliant, her voice was excellent and she was incredibly believable, James Marsden as always (even when wearing a visor) brings charm to his performance though he needed much more screen time, Queen Latifah belting out "I Know Where I've Been" brought a tear to my eye and possibly the best casting decision in the movie (and one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen, with ms Bynes being up there too) is Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Edna Turnblad, she is Rikki Lake, she is Marissa Janet Winokour, she is fantastic. The story is the same as the original pretty much and the songs all work fine the only real problem I had was that it needed to be longer, it felt a bit rushed, I mean I think there must be an hours worth of songs and that leaves about 40 or 50 minutes to move the plot along. Honestly this might be my favorite of the summer but I am yet to see Knocked Up, Ratatouille or Transformers. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really was not going to see this movie. What changed my mind was Travolta's interview on the Letterman show. He was looking quite youthful and funny and his attitude was the same. Comments about the fun he had with the fantastically fascinating Christoper Walken loosened me up enough to think "What the heck" and so I went.WOW, WOW, WOWIE WOW(a near quote from Walken's romantically hopeless yet hopeful character, the Continental) this movie was absolutely amazing. My foot was tapping to the music right from the start, and almost lifted me right off my seat. I found it very hard to find a reason to dissect this movie for any faults even though there are a few. I just couldn't. Performances were perhaps as close to perfect as you can get.Walken and Travolta just made my eyes water with love and laughter. Pfeiffer, WOW, Pfeiffer!! - the best and most lovable baddie. Queen Latifah was fun and great to watch but almost got lost in the crowd. But in the street march, she sang a song that opened my eyes and heart with utter respect and admiration. Her voice is still so beautiful it can make you melt. Even more, when I saw what I am sure was a very sincere tear trickling from her right eye down her nose, I cried with her. And I knew that this character meant far more to her than just a part in a movie. It was also then that I realized that all the performances were an indication that all the performers played their parts to perfection out of love for what they do.I wish more movies were made with the love that this one was. This was truly a movie madeout of love by, with and for the people who love to love. 9 out of 10 from me and a thousand thanks to all of those who made this movie so fantastic!</fullReview>

Maybe it was because the people were young and not as experienced but if Zac Efron wants to make it in movies like this, he's got to pack a little more punch.

		<fullReview>I think I'll watch any copy or remake, at least for a while, because its fascinating to have one movie folded onto another. In this case, the original was attractively strange. We knew it came from someone who celebrates not just trailer park kitsch, but the peculiar self- referential sexual edge. It was joyful trash, and not from the South. On that, Waters laid a veneer of a genre, but the thinnest of veneers. His poke in the eye was intended very seriously.Now the formula is reversed. We have a stage show that takes itself seriously, and the poke in the eye? Well, that's now gone, replaced by stylistic nods. Travolta in drag is a joke, but a simple movie joke, not a statement about the edge of the world. There's a moralistic story here about integration that ends happily. In the original, we know that what we see is one positive event in a sea of reverses. We have our fat girl in both, but in the original she was deliberately pathetic and the whole world of similarly pathetic creatures saluted. Here, she's triumphant. Having Queen Latifah on board in such a prominent role assures that. For once, she was appropriate for the purpose.Its all another reminder of how we absorb the deviant. We had the hippies for less than a decade before they became a "lifestyle." We had true black heros, and they were swallowed in a glueball of hiphop. Waters is no great shakes in the grand mastication of society. But he was boldly perverse (within the rating system). And here, that perversion becomes simply set dressing for an old fashioned song and dance show.Its perverted.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hummable and hammy, weighted down with ostentatious 'attitude'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musical remake of John Waters' cult-comedy from 1988, adapted from the Broadway triumph and full of toe-tapping songs--each one a 'showstopper' that hopes to obliterate the number that came before--has a "short and stout" white high schooler in 1960s Baltimore becoming a teen-sensation on the TV dance-program "The Corny Collins Show", which is run by bigots afraid of integrating white and black dancers. Leslie Dixon's script retains much of Waters' original elements--which is a good thing--but she doesn't allow the characters to take shape, and teen rabble-rouser Tracy Turnblad (well-played by newcomer Nikki Blonsky) hardly gets to make her mark on the tube before leading a protest march on Baltimore against segregation. Comparing the two movie versions is pretty much useless (Waters' film wasn't a musical after all, and it had a far slimmer budget), but beefing up the (supporting) characters of Velma Von Tussle and Motormouth Maybelle was pointless (except to showcase Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah, respectively, in these roles). Centering so much of the plot on Von Tussle (now the station manager who handles "Corny Collins") takes time away from Tracy and her new boyfriend, and from the teen-celebrity angle itself. Tracy still signs on to be a spokesmodel for Mr. Pinky's Hefty Hideaway, but after one musical number in his shop, we never see him again. Casting John Travolta as Edna Turnblad was an endearing idea (the role has traditionally been played by a man in drag), but portraying a woman barely brings out a softer side to Travolta (he has far less grace than usual); a worse gambit was Christopher Walken's casting as Edna's husband--never before has Walken appeared so charmless and dull. The film gets off to a rousing start, and Blonsky is firing on all cylinders, but the script is a shapeless mess and the direction isn't sensitive. The kids here have lots of in-your-face attitude, when actually a more subtle approach might have given their characters some depth. The Waters version took the racial issues seriously, but presented them in a lively, winner-take-all manner; here, Dixon and director Adam Shankman are teary-eyed literal, with Latifah singing a spiritual in the street. It drains all the fun and hope from the scenario, in an attempt--I guess--to make its nostalgia relevant today. Shankman moves through the scenes so fast that Tracy's audition (and rejection) for the TV show isn't even her moment--she's discarded so Pfeiffer can sing her number. The songs are certainly hummable, though the lyrics continually pit one race over another (who is superior to who), which leaves all the celebrating at the end seeming just a touch shallow. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical of all time is one of the best movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray is the latest film in the flood of Broadway-to-movie films, and not only is it the best of its kind, but it is probably the best film musical of all time. All of the scenes were perfectly paced and balanced, and Hairspray is probably the ultimate feel-good film. It makes you proud of pretty much everything. The acting is all-around magnificent and all of the songs bring goose bumps to the viewers. Hairspray features an all-star cast, with newcomer Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, James Marsden, Brittany Snow, Christopher Walken, John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah, and Elijah Kelley.In 1962, teenager Tracy Turnblad and her friend Penny Pingleton are rightly obsessed with The Corny Collins Show. After one of the members takes a leave of absence, Tracy goes to try out and finds herself on a wonderful adventure, which includes falling hopelessly in love with fellow teenager Link Larkin and making integration happen.With the opening scene, the magical musical number 'Good Morning Baltimore', the film is off to a great start. One musical wonder after another, each song is perfectly balanced and the tunes are all so catchy. The lyrics are so rich and full of substance, although they are probably not as great as the lyrics in Rent. Each song brings something new, and each of the cast greatly contributes. John Travolta is hysterical, and when he sings it just goes to show why he was such a noteworthy selection. Amanda Bynes has a surprisingly smooth voice, but it is certainly not the best in the world. The biggest surprises are James Marsden and Nikki Blonsky. It seems as if there couldn't have been a better choice for Tracy Turnblad, as Nikki's voice is soft and powerful. James Marsden has a stunning voice that you would never expect to come out of him. He is just sensational as Corny Collins. Queen Latifah is one of the best among the cast, with her belting voice. Latifah has an amazingly strong voice, and Elijah Kelley as Seaweed is no exception. He is a huge surprise with his wonderful take on the character. The best casting choice by far, however, is rising star Zac Efron. He plays Link Larkin with such personality, such gusto, that haters of High School Musical may actually grow attached to the guy. His character is very lovable, and Zac displays certainly his best acting yet in Hairspray. Many people, myself included, shall be waiting in anticipation for what Zac has next, which just happens to be High School Musical 2! Zac has the pleasure of singing a new song specific for the movie version. 'Ladies Choice' is not only one of the best songs, but it displays Zac's musical talent in a very vague and effective fashion. I really enjoyed the new song, and it was a great addition to the movie. Michelle Pfeiffer is very evil as the wicked villain, and her daughter Amber, played by Brittany Snow, is also cast perfectly. I don't think there have ever been better casting choices in a musical (besides maybe Rent).Hairspray is a relief in many ways; it is probably the best movie of the summer, and the movie musical of all time. Normally, you can't go wrong with an all-star cast, but there are some exceptions. It will remain for many years to come that Hairspray is the big movie musical of our generation, our very own version of the classic Grease (to which it is superior in every way imaginable).Sitting in that theater, viewing Hairspray time and time again, is an experience that can be rivaled by no other, expect perhaps seeing the Broadway show which I have yet to have the delight of seeing. Hairspray makes you want to get up and dance and cheer for how fantastic the movie really is. Hairspray is the one of the best movies I've ever seen, and is a fitting summer movie and delightfully cute one at that. In fact, I can't wait to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to great movie musical comedies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray has done something truly amazing already that has nothing to do with the actual movie. It has saved a genre that has been struggling to survive over the past few years: Musicals, and particularly musical comedies. For the first time in recent years, people are really excited about seeing a musical at the cinema- even teens! For someone like myself, that's pretty exciting.The story of "pleasantly plump" teenager Tracy Turnblad has been told three different times: As a campy 80's movie, then on the Broadway stage, and now in this fantastic new screen version. The story is that this big girl teaches her beloved Baltimore a lot about racism and integration, all while winning the hearts of the city on a dance-off TV program. It's a very cute story with lots of laughs and lots of heart, and this film puts it together wonderfully and hilariously.The cast is pretty much perfect. Unknown Nikki Blonsky stars as Tracy, and "stars" is what she does indeed. In fact, she's downright radiant on screen. John Travolta is laugh out loud funny in his gender-bender role as Edna, the mother of Tracy. The rest of the cast is all impressive, most very interesting choices for the individual; interesting choices that turned out quite well. Zac Effron is perfect along with Amanda Bynes. Both were surprisingly good. Elijah Kelley, Christopher Walken, Allison Janney, Michelle Pfeiffer. Brittany Snow and James Marsden are all great. And what can be said about Queen Latifah: She's simply wonderful, as always.The songs, which are half the reason we're all there, are all well-sung and, of course, well-written. The most surprising of the singing voices were James Marsden and Amanda Bynes. Both sang beautifully, and I had no idea. Michelle Pfeiffer was the only one who had a little trouble with her song. Ms. Blonsky's voice is fantastic.Really, a great movie all around, with big laughs and big heart, and a great return musical comedies and blockbuster musicals period! 8/10 stars!

		<shortDescription>Absolutely fantastic musical/comedy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply a joyous movie. If you love musicals and you love to laugh, you'll really love this. The film introduces Nikki Blonsky who is excellent as Tracy Turnblad. Michelle Pfeiffer, Chris Walken, Alison Janney, John Travolta, James Mardsen and everyone else rocked it as well!! The scene with the song, "Without Love" has cute special effects. Don't miss John Waters as the flasher or Riki Lake as one of the agents. I missed both the first time. And how often do you get to see JT dancing in heels?Go see it and enjoy it! FYI,the role of Edna is traditionally played by a man. Have fun with it as I did ... twice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie and a wonderful way to spend the weekend or weekday. There were great surprises throughout the movie. You will find your feet will be tapping and your hands clapping. Take your friends with you, and then discuss it with other over coffee on Monday or at the water cooler. This movie made an excellent choice of casting director and casting. There was never a dull moment and even keeps your interest, even if you are not particularly a fan of musicals. The musical compositions were fresh and vital without depending on music and artists directly from that time period. You'll find yourself in awe of the characters and the storyline hits most of the concerns of the period. The need for social change and the courage to stand up to fight non violently for social changes were addressed. The movie as a whole was packaged and put together delightfully and without obvious struggles to connect the various high points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray is the best time at the movies in a long time. Throughly entertaining from start to finish.Movies like "Chicago" and the over-hyped "Dreamgirls" were more like MTV videos with all the quick cuts and camera movement. Other recent musical outings like "Rent" and "The Producers" were just horrid and almost killed off the recent revival of the musical film.Hairspray is a big-hearted musical comedy like they used to make them. The movie is fun, looks great and is packed with wonderful songs. People actually applauded at the end of the film - when is the last time that happened? Casting is almost near perfect. I said ALMOST. John Travolta fails as Edna who looks like a man in a fat costume...many lines are swallowed and the comedy misfires. This Enda is too June Clever in tailored house dresses so the big Edna-makeover number "Welcome to the 60's" fails to hit the mark. And where on earth did Travolta get that accent? He sometimes sounds like a Southern Belle, other times like a Minnesota housewife. Golly John, this is Baltimore! Queen Latifa calls in her performance as Motormouth Mabel. There is no commitment to the part. What we get is the same character she played in "Beauty Shop." Where's the grit? Where's the anger for injustice? The scene with the protest march is more like a Sunday walk in the park.But, the young cast is fabulous. Nikki Blonsky as Tracy carries this movie. She is the heart...and the soul. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray BEATS Chicago and Every Other New Movie Musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing Hairspray and I'm still smiling. That's what this movie makes it's viewers do! From the energy-filled opening to the spectacular finale, Hairspray keeps the crowd grinning. With recent movie musicals leaving a lot to be desired, Hairspray outshines them all. Chicago started the trend of bringing back movie musicals and it was definitely stunning, even cinching Best Picture... and Hairspray makes it completely yesterday. After all, Chicago was the 20s... Hairspray is the 60s and even so it's completely timeless.With Phantom, some audiences felt the stage to screen transfer was too cheesy. Rent saw even more disappointment from those who felt it was either too morally modified or again, too cheesy. Even though many maintain the Broadway cast can't be beaten, Rent proved that stage performances on screen are not as believable. The Producers drew more disappointment, proving that you can't just take the set, script, actors, lighting and over the top performances onto a sound stage and turn on the camera. Hairspray, in the style of Chicago revitalizes the show it is based on.The cast is spot on, even Efron, who many feared was just there for the tween girl audience. Here he proves he does have genuine talent. Latifah outdoes her role of Mama in Chicago with Maybell, and Amanda Bynes finally finds a role that her strengths play to. Travolta is sweetly adorable as Edna, with Walken being a perfect counter. Pfeiffer is delectably devilish and her on screen daughter played by Brittany Snow is the perfect spoiled princess. Elija Kelley shines as Seaweed, and shares tons of chemistry with Bynes. James Marsden is just right for Corny, and Taylor Parks as Little Inez is perfect. Nikki Blonsky steals her scenes and steals your heart as Tracy.The pacing in Hairspray must also be applauded as it is never slow. And the dancing is definitely explosive. Hairspray will truly nab nominations when it comes to award season. Even the cut songs playing over the credits are worth staying for! The themes of racism and universal acceptance when it comes to appearance makes Hairspray a family winner as well! I surely will be going again, perhaps even tomorrow. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just been to see this with my hubby. We didn't really know what to expect but from the first gloriously cheerful burst of song we loved it. Our film got twisted half way through and we spent a couple of minutes watching everybody upside down and walking backwards, and had to wait a good 20 minutes for the staff to unravel it all and find the place where it went wrong, but I'm so so glad we waited. The cast were faultless. John Travolta was very enjoyable as Edna, and it looked like he enjoyed is role! Christopher Walken, what can I say; fab and weird as always. Queen Latifa, beautiful as ever, Michele Pfeifer deliciously nasty! As for Nikky Blonsky, she was amazing, well able to carry the lead which she did with gusto from the opening to the closing credits. It's a fun, feel-good, optimistic film, with wonderful songs and it leaves you feeling hopeful for the chances of all those of us who are 'different' from the norms appointed by societyIf you like musicals and need a bit of cheering up, go and see it on the big screen while you can. It got our feet tapping anyway!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray is a BIG hit with me! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mom and I saw Hairspray today in the theater and I have to say that Hairspray is the best musical of the year and actually in the past few years at that. I haven't enjoyed a musical this much in a long time. Hairspray was so uplifting and was wonderful to watch, it really makes you feel good about everything, that being different from what is described as "normal" is OK and can be hip. The music and dancing were terrific, I actually bought the soundtrack after we left the theater. John Travolta actually made a good looking woman, lol, but he, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfhiffer, and Queen Latifa were sensational! I couldn't believe all the talented people that were in this musical.Tracy is a plus sized teenager in the 60's, a hard time of racism and harsh acceptance. Her and her friend Penny love this show, the Corny Collins show, Tracy auditions for the show, but is snubbed immediately by the manager, Velma. But with the encouragement of her parents and a cute guy, she tries again and makes it on the show and is an automatic hit! But Velma and her snotty daughter won't let her steal the spot light, and are also snubbing the African Americans from having an integrated show. With the help of Tracy's friends, they prove that anyone can be a star and shine.Hairspray is without a doubt one of the best films of the summer, I highly recommend this movie to anyone, even if you're not into musicals, this is just such an uplifting movie. I loved the John Waters cameo in the beginning, the director of the original movie, Hairspray. This was a fantastic film and was brilliantly made, I'm sure that you'll have so much fun watching it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie with an amazing cast fun songs and a still valid message. John Watters' touch is still in this film. I've watched the 1988 version and seen the musical performed on Broadway and loved both versions. I think this new film version stays true to the originals and I recommend people go see it. High School Musical fans will love to see Zach Ephron in a this new to him role of Link Larkin (originally played by Michael St. Gerard-now a NYC pastor who rarely speaks of his time as an actor). John Travolta as Edna was not as great as I had hoped, but I adore him as an actor so anything I disliked about this performance can be overlooked. The rest of the cast was great.

		<fullReview>I just came from a sneak preview of this movie and was enchanted. I was familiar with parts of the story line and some of the main characters, but had never seen the stage show or previous film, so I'm unable to comment for those who have. Bottomline: I just thought this was wonderful.Very much a feel-good film, with a great (and mostly well-known) cast, it is also surprisingly funny! There were many witty moments as well as quite a few laugh out loud lines and I believe the roles were well cast. The leads were a delight and they were supported by a strong cast overall, in acting, singing and dancing. I was not bored for even one minute of this exciting movie; in fact, I had a smile on my face throughout most of it to boot.I am a huge musical nut, but I went with a friend of mine who is admittedly not a big fan of movie musicals and she laughed and loved it right along with me.A nice balance to the big action movies (I did like Transfomers :)) dominating summer '07. Easily one of my favorite movies of late-- go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we learn from this film? That Michelle Pfeiffer can play as well a nasty woman, that John Travolta can be a convincing obese wife and Christopher Walken can play himself (boring) as usual. The other actors, Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, are all OK. It's the story of a fat teenager who dreams of going to dance on a TV show. And she succeeds to do it. She manages even more than that, giving a slap to the racial segregation from America in the '60s. All songs in the film are super cool. The choreography is also at height. Worth seeing on a big screen and sound volume, at least stereo, to the maximum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie overall was very entertaining and fun to watch. I enjoyed the singing and dancing, it was very catchy and had me laughing at times. I chose to watch this movie for a movie assignment for my APUSH class because I knew it would be upbeat and exciting and Zac Efron was it in so that was a plus. What I enjoyed the most was how the movie depicted how the white people were slowly accepting blacks. It was absolutely amazing to see the blacks and whites dancing together at the end with the crowd cheering. It shows how segregation had come a long way from the past and was leading to brighter futures for black people. The way the black characters held themselves strong and unwavering in the film, was inspiring that even though they were being denied rights and being treated unjustly, they didn't let it bring them down. A lesson to us that even in our deepest struggles, we can't let them bring us down or hinder us from achieving our goals in life. Enjoy the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray is a bright, bouncy, and fun musical about integration in the 1960's. Tracy T. goes to great measures to integrate a popular dance TV show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes a fun and enjoyable path on educating people of the horror of discrimination of African Americans. Throughout the movie Tracy and her best friend Penny attempt to integrate the Corny Collins show. African Americans are only allowed to perform once a month and Tracy does not believe it is fair. When Tracy gets a spot on the TV show she sees a chance to make a difference. She marches with them and even messes with the dance finals near the end of the show. Penny also ends up dating one of the black dancers. This movie shows society that African Americans were treated very unfairly not too long ago, but not every white person felt that it should be this way. It showed that some people were willing to stand up for them even though it was only a minority. People were very mean to people who tried to help the African Americans. When Tracy tried to stand up to the racist people at the movie set she was kicked off the show. This showed how people would discriminate against you if you wanted to go against society. Overall, this movie was great. I truly enjoyed it. While at some points it could have been trying too much to poke fun at something so serious, it was still a good eye opener for today's generation.</fullReview>

John Travolta took on the daunting task of playing the MOTHER of young Tracy Turnblad and he blows the character out of the park. Queen Latifa does a great job of capturing the powerful, ambitious, and determined civil rights advocate of Baltimore, Motormouth Maybelle. Nikki Blonsky also does an amazing job making her debut as the tenacious Tracy Turnblad. Aside from the cast the overall storyline was also outstanding. The mix between the determination the characters have towards integrating the Corny Collins show and gaining Civil Rights to the adolescents overcoming adversity. Overall it was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray is based on a Broadway musical of the same name that starred Rikki Lake and tells the tale of a young girl named Tracey(played by newcomer Nikki Blonsky)who lives in Baltimore with her parents(played by Christopher Walken and John Travolta(yup im really not kidding here but John was done up in drag as a woman in this movie crazy right).Tracey dreams of starring in the Corny Collins show which is hosted by Corny Collins(played by the lovely James Marsden)and drags her BFF(best friend forever) played by Amanda Bynes to help her get on the show. But of course there is competition with Michelle Pfeiffer and Brittany Snow's characters who would do anything but to be in the Corny Collins show and ruin Tracey's dream to star with Corny Collins and a hunky guy called Link (played by High School Musical star Zac Efron who looks like a young Elvis Presley I must say in this movie). So will Tracey's dreams of starring in the Corny Collins show come true and can she help Queen Latifah's charcther a spot at the Corny Collins show too?Bottom line is this, its a feel good musical to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon with some catchy songs (that will have you humming or not)and a great supporting cast from John Travolta as Edna (in drag),Nikki Blonsky,Zac Efron,James Marsden,Amanda Bynes and co. SO do I like it sure its a good flick,its not the best film in the world but I enjoyed myself watching it.Overall its a 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hairspray" has a lot of energy, great songs and the casting is excellent. Nikki Blonsky really shines as Amber but everyone (even John Travolta as Amber's mother) is perfectly cast. The dance numbers are fun, though at times edited too frequently for us to really appreciate them. It also has a nice message that's been simplified (perhaps a bit too much at times) for younger audiences to enjoy and understand. It's got glimpses of a more serious subject in the story, but mostly it's a light musical so children and adults alike will definitively have a good time. While I kind of wanted the simplified message to be developed more, it is an important one to show, especially to children who would not have heard of it before. (Dvd, August 24, 2012)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Great Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy light-hearted, family friendly, fun movies, then the musical Hairspray is the movie for you! Like every movie, there are always negative and positive sides of a film. This particular movie has many features and factors that make it a worthwhile watch. Hairspray is about a young girl in high school that has a hard time fitting in but ends up making important decisions that affect her life immensely. In this movie, Tracy, the main girl, decides to audition for a dance and singing show that is popular among the town. Throughout the movie she realizes that the TV show she stars in has segregation between white and black people; she uses her popularity from the show to change that. Each actor and actress the director chose for the movie play the parts well. In this movie the director chose big name actors and actresses such as Queen Latifah, Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Brittney Snow, and John Travolta to help make this a successful and shining movie. This film was based off of the 1988 version made starring Ricki Lake and has now been made more modernly. Although this film isn't an original, there is definitely originality in the plot as this movie has much controversy between the colors of skin, which was a true phase in American history. With the history used, the director of Hairspray made the movie very entertaining with a deep, historical background of the past. Adam Shankman, the director, did a wonderful job producing the movie. He knew how to film at certain angles, focus in, and edit the material. At the start of the movie one can already see some of the camera techniques this movie uses. One common method used is focusing on the main character(s) and blurring the surroundings where the scene is being shot. Each transition from scene to scene has been done smoothly. In most movies, the scenes have many fade-outs and black outs, however, Hairspray didn't have as many of these techniques. There transitions simply jump over to the scene except in doing so it's almost unnoticeable. The development of this movie increased throughout the film. Just looking at the script alone without the movie made yet was a work of art. The scriptwriter really used diction and syntax to emphasize certain points. For example, a word used often in the film is "Negro." This word in today's society is not tolerated so hearing the word in the movie built a strong statement. Another big factor that helped shape the movie is the costume design. Costumes in any movie help develop the characters and define their personality. The white people in this movie wear fancier and simple quality clothing while the black people wear colorful and fun outfits. For example, in the show when both groups sing "The New Girl in Town" the whites wear simple dresses with their hair done up neat while the blacks wear tight orange dresses with wavy flowing hair. Hairspray has many up beat and fun loving scenes with great sing-along songs. This is a famous movie that should not be unseen. This movie points out an important historical controversial event and helps show that people can make a difference. This is a movie for all ages and welcomes anyone who wants to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a Baltimore teen who runs home everyday with her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) to watch the Corny Collins show (James Marsden). She wants nothing more than to be on the show. Her mother Edna (John Travolta) is afraid of being ridiculed but her father Wilbur (Christopher Walken) supports her all the way. She gets put in detention with the negroes and Link Larkin (Zac Efron) sees her dancing with them. She gets selected onto the show to the chagrin of lead dancer Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) and mother station manger Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer). They loath to see Tracy win Miss Teenage Hairspray, and her push to integrate the show. When Velma cancels Negro Day where blacks are allowed to dance on TV for one day a week, Tracy and Penny and many from the black community start a protest to integrate the show.This movie is chalk full of charming joyful fun. It starts with the adorably happy Blonsky. All the songs have that happy upbeat sound. It's wall to wall singing and dancing with a good dollop of racial equality message and acceptance. However it is missing that one popular radio hit to put it over the top. Nevertheless it is still a toe tapping good times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too "American" and shallow, but with strong performances and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical in question has apparently wanted to combine frivolous exterior with solemn interior - but has not fully succeeded, the outcome is often naive or ridiculous, as e.g. racism, obesity and exclusion are not topics dealt with constant dancing and jumping... At what is another important message? That studying is less important than show-dancing... All the 1,5 hours is a row of restless attitudes and actions, with some "serious" behavior not fitting totally in the mood. Luckily, most of the cast is great, especially Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Edna Turnblad (plump but well dancing), John Travolta as Edna Turnblad (funny and surprising), Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle (convincingly cold bitch), Christopher Walken as Wilbur Turnblad (versatile Bohemian), Queen Latifah as "Motormouth" Maybelle (hearty entertainer with social nerve); other younger actors, however, provide rather mediocre performances (apart from dancing numbers).Thus, Hairspray is neither West Side Story nor Mamma Mia!, but if you like musicals, you will probably enjoy the whole thing. As mentioned, Blonsky + "older" actors provide several memorable moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that musicals aren't my favourite genre of films so when I set down to watch this I wasn't really expecting much? I don't know if it is because I went in with low expectations but I ended up rather enjoying it! Set in 1960s Baltimore, teenager Tracy dreams of appearing on the local television dance show and when one of the regulars has to go away for a while it is her big chance, unfortunately for the woman doing the selecting doesn't think she looks right? she is a bit large. At school she comes across a room where the black kids are dancing and joins them to learn some new moves. She soon finds herself on the programme after impressing the host although the woman who rejected her is still not impressed; especially when she says she wishes every night could be 'Negro Night'. Soon after the channel decides to stop playing black music altogether and Tracy and her new friends march in support of integration on television. During the march she (gently) strikes a police officer and the incident is blown out of all proportion? with the police looking for her it looks as if there is no way she will be able to attend the big dance completion.This film was a lot of fun and contained some entertaining songs. Stars Christopher Walken and John Travolta were fun as Tracy's parents? yes John Travolta played her mother! But the real star of the show was Nikki Blonsky who really shone as Tracy. As with most musicals the story wasn't exactly deep although it did deal with racial politics. As I haven't seen the original film I can't say how it compares but I'd recommend it to anybody wanting a fun film with singing and dancing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think many reviewers here forget that this film is a satire - a spoof. Like Grease, it's having a bit of sly fun while it mimics the look and sound of the early 1960s. It's meant to be kitsch and cheesy and out-there. And loving it! Having seen the DVD several times, I think the film's strength is the music and lyrics. My favourite songs are Good Morning Baltimore, Run and Tell That, New Girl in Town and Nicest Kids in Town. The best singers are James Marsden as Corny Collins, Nikki Blonsky as Tracy and the little girl who plays Inez in Run and Tell That -- she's a great singer and dancer. Sure it's a cheesy film but also cheeky. I love sly little details like the rats, the bum and the flasher in the opening song, John Travolta playing it straight as Mrs Turnblad and the two groups of girls (with great voices) singing about the New Girl In Town getting run over. It's not a cool film but being a fan of musicals, this is one of the best I've seen, up there with Chicago and that's saying a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hairspray!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When discussing the merits of a musical, it is often the soundtrack recording that weighs heavily on the reception of the overall product. If this the common mindset towards the musical, that it is to be judged by large on the quality of the music rather than its technical achievements as a film, devices such as character development can often become pedestrian and tedious as the audience awaits the next spontaneous burst into song and dance.'Hairspray', an adaptation of the stage musical (which, in turn is a Broadway re-imagining of John Water's original comedy vision), tackles this issue by marrying plot and music in a relentless unity; tracks flow one into the next, shifting the story along at high speed and maintaining a constant toe-tapping pace. There's rarely a dull moment to be had as the film is almost always a display of either mind-boggling choreography, hilarious fantasy sequences or its perfectly cast ensemble reeling off sharp dialogue packed with witty one- liners and puns; at its best, 'Hairspray' can utilise all three of these aspects simultaneously to achieve the definitive 'feel-good' status so commonly attributed to the genre. At its very rare, though still thoroughly entertaining worst, the film buckles under the weight of obliging to slow balladry and heavy handling of the mature racism theme it had previously dealt with in such eye-opening, well meaning jest.As the notes barely cease, 'Hairspray' is effectively a two-hour exercise in music-video style film, unfolding so unbelievably quickly that it never pauses long enough to declare any moment as iconic, depriving itself of the esteem it would have shared with the likes of 'Grease'. It is fortunate then, that the movie rarely gives you the opportunity to even notice this.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic and feel good!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was terribly bored on Sunday afternoon so got the Hairspray DVD out again. I NEVER tire of watching it. I can honestly say it's the best feel good film I have ever watched. Absolutely superb music and sublime performances from all the cast. LOVE IT!!!!! Right from the offset the music and colourful sets grab your attention and keep it for the entire length of the movie. There is no lull yet the movie builds to a fantastic climax and you never want it to end. The dance routines are some of the best too.The message it portrays is done so in such an amusing way, and it makes one ashamed of the bigotry that existed then and, sadly, still does. I always feel humbled at the end so it succeeds in getting the message across.Wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your feet wont stop dancing while watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must see for musical fans and a comedy that will entertain and amuse the general public. It is a remake of a previous film by Jonh Waters, which, unfortunately, I haven't seen.Set in 1962 --in a period of transition from the controlling 50s to the freer 60s-- tells us the story of Tracy, a fat funky optimistic girl who dances and sings very well and wants to become part of the cast in a famous dancing TV show, and on how she breaks all barriers (familiar, social and racial) to do so.It is a light comedy, with all the elements and stereotypes of the genre but with a twist and hip vibe, with a positive message that is, again, presented in a very light manner.The look of the movie is very fifties in dresses, hairdos and social environment, but we see the new ways of the 60s breaking out, how people attitudes are changing, how a new society is forming, and how that environment allows a person like Tracy to fully express herself and succeed in her endeavors. It also shows the first anti-segregation movements in the USA, a subject that is approached without dogmatism, but with sensibleness and a warm heart.The costumes, setting and colors of the film are visually yummy. The musical numbers are brilliant, the songs catchy and cheery, and the dancing great and full of energy.The adult actors are all great in their acting, singing and dancing themselves (not dubbed): A brilliant despicable "bitch" played by Michel Pfeiffer, a loony sweat-heart father played by Christopher Walken, a fat shy mother played by an inspired John Travolta (who is especially good in this movie), and a strong anti-segregation-fighter played by the always powerful Queen Latiffa. Also great is the unknown but talented Nikky Blonksy, which conveys perfectly the character she plays and has a great musical talent. The movie would have been very different without her. The rest of the cast is correct in their respective roles. The whole ensemble is actually very powerful,Although the story is predictable, the brilliance of the musical numbers, the brilliance of the actors in their respective roles, the humorous dialogs, and the beautiful atrezzo and dresses round out the film.One of the little details I loved in this film is that the bad girls are mostly skinny and blond, and the good ones brunettes and/or black and not so skinny. The only good skinny blonde is Tracy's friend, who is a little bit dumb!I left the theater with a big smile in my face, cheered and entertained, wanting to dance, thinking that the money I had paid for the ticket was well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant toe-tapping fun movie with an important message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray was a very nice surprise because you expect something corny and cheesy which make no mistake, you do get but you also get a strong and serious message from it as well. The story was great about the underdog achieving goals and, at the same time, deals with the issue of being different and it was nice to see. The characters were well written and were a joy to watch and the acting was brilliant, John Travolta being the best as Tracy's mother, Edna. Also, Queen Latifah should be recognised for her great performance in this as well. The songs were good to watch and so were the dances. The direction and the writing were done very well.Hairspray is a feel-good movie that's there for you when you're feeling low and need a little bit of cheering up. I liked it, it was a very nice surprise as, even though it's all singing and dancing and fun, there's also a couple of serious messages in the movie. While kids may not see it, adults will. It deals with being different, ignoring doubts to achieve what you want and race and the strong messages are shown throughout the movie and the way it's portrayed in the movie is great. I thought the singing and dancing was brilliant. There were some songs that had my toes tapping and there was one song that was brilliant to listen to and it was by Queen Latifah who has an amazing voice. Make no mistake, there's a lot of singing and dancing so if you don't like musicals, don't rent or buy this. However, if you're looking for a cheesy, feel-good movie and a bit of light-hearted fun, then you'll like it.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun... and a bit of everything else!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray goes from great to madness to cheap to vulgar and great again. John Travolta really stole the show and ran away with it! I never thought in a million years that he would accept to play such a crazy role. Michelle Pfeiffer, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Zac Efron and especially new comer fat little Nicki Blonsky and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job. The story was lite and good humored, it was just a pity they felt the need to stuff it with sexual innuendos from beginning to end. But again it might just have been faithful to the original, I don't know having never seen it. Good music, good dancing, and a good cause to fight for may just be the perfect ingredients for a movie to succeed, and they certainly achieved that. Well, it is by no means a horrible movie but its greatness is also debatable. So, go on and see it if you have nothing better to do and make your on mind about it. If nothing else, you at least will laugh seeing John Travolta doing a marvelous job as a fat, very caring mother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I preferred john waters version of course, the original with the transvestite divine and the crass show hostess Ricky lake, but john Travolta was really good as a transvestite here too. As per usual Hollywood affairs are for the moron masses, so this loses the appeal of the Waters film but still the fat girl is a great actress, and it rips enough off the original to make it enjoyable.I have to fill out these lines because somehow IMDb doesn't allow for less than ten lines of review, what's with that, I thought brevity was a virtue?

		<shortDescription>Fun remake, I guess, but odd casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical and the original were much better. This isn't bad. Good music. Some great casting: Allison Janney, Jerry Stiller (from the original), James Marsden, Nikki Blonsky, Michelle Pheiffer. Some really odd casting, in my opinion: Christopher Walken and John Travolta. I like both actors but their roles here were ridiculous. You can't tell me there wasn't someone out there capable of playing Edna. And Christoper Walken doing comedy just doesn't seem right. His talents are for more serious roles. Most of the actors playing the kids were just fine. Sometimes it seems that remakes are done just for the heck of it. With an original movie and a very successful musical, was this remake necessary?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie based on the Broadway version of the 1988 John Waters musical comedy. It's 1962 and Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a plump but positive teenager in Baltimore, Maryland who dreams of becoming the lead dancer of a local musical TV show. There are may obstacles in front of her dream though, namely a rivaling classmate (Brittany Snow) and her mother, the TV station boss (Michelle Pfeiffer). Luckily Tracy's parents (Christopher Walken and John Travolta) support her after initial suspicions, and she eventually manages to inspire an anti-segregation civil rights movement on top of everything else.The colourful production design and the very sympathetic characters make the new Hairspray a delightful experience. In her first movie role, Nikki Blonsky plays her part with such compelling energy that you can only cheer along. The fatsuit-wearing John Travolta in drag is also amusing as Tracy's understanding mother, as are the other supporting actors in their respective roles. There are lots of catchy songs with fun choreography, actually so many that I think the movie could have flowed a little better if they'd cut a few of the numbers, but it's difficult to choose which ones should have been dropped. Even as it is now, the film is recommended for fans of light musicals: I actually like it better than the 1988 movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hairspray" is most fantastic musical comedy movie that I have ever seen! All songs and dances are very cool but funny. All costume that used in this movie and original hairstyles are colorful and cute! Nikki Blonsky play the leading character, Tracy Turnblad. The scene of this story is in 1962, Baltimore in America. Tracy loves dancing and singing. Tracy is innocent girl, and her dream is dance at Corny Coliins Show. Her engaging smile cheer up everyone. she is so pretty. Also, John Travolta play woman, Tracy's mother, Edna. His play is awesome!! He is looks like real woman. Edna's character is gloomy. Edna has a complex about her weight and appearance. However, she is change because Tracy gives her heart. In addition, this is not only a comedy movie, but also appeal to everyone for abolish segregation. Tracy wants to change the world because she thinks that it is foolish white people cannot dance with black people on TV. If you have a chance, please watch this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Treat for High School fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very colorful film with all characters dressed up in colorful costumes, which suits the film's very light and bubbly atmosphere set in the 60s. It is like High School Musical with many catchy songs and flashy dance moves from all the stars, including those I don't know can actually dance.I like John Travolta dressing up as a woman. He looks very motherly, wish I had a mother who looks like that. Christopher Walken is great as well as a supporting actor who always steals the scene. Zac Efron is cool but he is really not handsome, just sings and dances very well. The fat girl sings well too but I doubt anyone would use her again as a main cast unless maybe when there is singing involved. She comes along just because the producers happen to look for a fat girl. I may never see her again in another movie.The songs are okay. I saw all the 3 HSMs and this one doesn't have much difference. Overall it is a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta stole the show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, they all were show stealers. Travolta was just my favorite. He never for a second missed a beat being a female, not a single slip. I liked that the "message" was not dark and heavy with gut wrenching (ho hum) scenes and endless preaching. The "message" was light and fun. Very upbeat in every way. At first I thought I liked the first movie better because it was just more cheesy. But this remake has grown on me. It's sweet, it's smooth, every performance was perfect. Choreography left me just a little flat. Too many close ups. Dance is a full body sport. Of course, I waited expectantly for the Travolta dance. Then, too many close ups. It's Travolta that was the highlight and I particularly enjoyed every scene he was in as the mother of Tracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the 1960s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2007 remake of John Waters' 1988 film "Hairspray" is nothing other than fun. Nikki Blonsky stars as a "roly-poly bundle of excitement" Tracy Turnblad, in director Adam Shankman's new version of the once hit musical on Broadway. Set in Baltimore in the 1960s, the opening scene begins as Tracy jumps out of bed and dances down the streets of Baltimore. For Tracy, size has never been an issue and to her what's really important is what's on the inside. Every day after school Tracy and her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) race home to watch the Corny Collin's show. Tracy's big dream is to land a spot on the show to dance with her long time crush Link (Zac Efron). Tracy is considered too pleasantly plump to appear on local television, but that doesn't stop her from chasing her dream. When Tracy gets put in detention because of her enemy Amber (Brittney Snow), who is the star on the Corny Collin's show, she finds that most of the kids being punished are black. She soon discovers that they don't spend their punishment studying, but dancing and practicing their moves for the once a month Negro Day on the show. They teach Tracy a few groovy moves that end up helping her get a spot on the show. As the plot continues, Tracy fights for what's right when Negroes get kicked off the show completely.Nikki's energy and enthusiasm shine through the entire movie. What is really amazing is that writer Leslie Dixon discusses serious issues through songs and groovy dance moves. She restates the point that John Water's made nineteen years ago; just because you are colored or a little overweight does not mean you shouldn't follow your dreams and make them come true. The best part is that John Travolta wears a fat suit and a dress! The song and dance of this film makes it enjoyable to watch. I wouldn't give it anything other than two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with crossover appeal - but missing some oomph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zac Efron is certainly making his name as a new musical matine idol for the 21st century. Temporarily leaving the lucrative High School Musical franchise which made his name, he stars in the new big-screen adaptation of Hairspray. Efron is part of a stellar cast which puts on a slick song-and-dance show that certainly gets the toes tapping but has a brain and soul as well as a heart and feet as it tackles issues such as racial prejudice.The premise is simple enough ? in 1962 Baltimore, Tracey Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky in her first role) is a slightly overweight girl who is fanatic about dancing, specifically the Corny Collins show and its lead dancer Link (Zac Efron), after she catches a lucky break and manages to get onto the show, the typical shenanigans and machinations kick in as the usual bitchy blonde characters feel threatened in their position of top dog etc you know the rest of that. Meanwhile Tracey's mother Edna (John Travolta in a fat-suit ? he's come a long way from Grease and Saturday Night Fever!) plays her daughter's agent as she tries to cement her place in the big time and win the heart of the matine idol that is Link Larkin.Hairspray is generally quite an enjoyable musical with some great song-and-dance routines and little of the awful clichs that dragged down High School Musical. A strong sense of light-hearted fun is present in the majority of the songs, particularly the toe-tapping 'Welcome to the 60s,' 'Without Love' and the ultra-catchy 'You Can't Stop the Beat,' while the more poignant 'I Know Where I've Been' highlights the fact that the film is not glossing over the growing racial tension present at the time of the film's setting. Further, seeing Christopher Walken dancing and dueting with the fat-suit-wearing John Travolta is certainly an image that will sear its way permanently into your retinas. What makes the scene even more memorable is that the actors are clearly having the time of their lives - rather than wondering what on earth they are doing there. While the vocals and choreography may not win many awards, there is little doubt that Hairspray is a fun film. This sense of fun transmits itself to the rest of the cast, as Michelle Pfieffer plays a truly pantomime-level hissable villain, while Queen Latifah tones down her usual brash persona to good and soulful effect.However, underneath the singing and slick dancing is a serious and sharp observation of racism and segregation in 1960s America ? note the dividing rope between the white and black students at the school dance, as well as the 'Negro Day' on the Corny Collins show; it does the film credit that it does not overlook or try to gloss over the racial tension that was prevalent at the time.Yet for all its toe-tapping quality and political impetus, the film does feel as if something is missing, as if it does not have the pizazz of Chicago or the power of the Phantom of the Opera. While there are a number of standout songs, there are none with the raw passion of 'Music of the Night' or the snappiness of 'All That Jazz', the power of 'The Phantom of the Opera' or the aggression of 'Cell Block Tango'. This is possibly the film's only real failing - assuming of course that you find John Travolta dressed in a dress and fat-suit amusing.But while the racial tension is not overlooked, it is not allowed to overshadow what is, at its heart, a fun and enjoyable musical. Hairspray is probably the musical with the biggest crossover appeal since Chicago (at least until Mamma Mia came along) made them fashionable once more. It is slick, sharp and sassy. It just perhaps needs more of a standout song or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta: still great for musicals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be straightforward with you: if Travolta's voice would have changed just the slightest...and he didn't have arms like a man, he would have done a much better job as Edna. I was disappointed at this...at first, but then I grew to like him...er, her rather.Another thing I will say is this: after watching this movie, I don't hate Efron as much. I think he comes off pretty clean as the thin guy who stands up for the large woman he loves. I'm a large woman, so Efron is different for me...hands down. Pfeiffer and Snow on the other hand... let's not go there.There are some great vocals in this, but my favorite comes from Queen Latifah, while my favorite dance scene is the one where they're coming out of the school and dancing in the bus. Superbly done! There are few strange parts, though funny: the singing picture and Efron singing to it; and the part when Walken and Travolta are dancing together. It was funny also when Travolta ran into the door! So funny! My sister asked me after the movie went off who my favorite couple was. Do you want to know my answer? Edna and Wilbur all the way! Good going, Travolta!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, with lots of bits of real quality, version 1.10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came at this by way of a user comment for Grease that mentioned this as a sequel. I accepted that the 2007 version ending reminds me of the energy of bits of Grease and that the rest improves with repeated viewings, but I need to consider them as separate, not properly related. A comparison with Grease gives Hairspray trouble as Grease is so unusual in its strengths. These do not compare favourably, but nor does most anything else. So okay, acclimatise to this and it can still be a real high flier. The 2007 musical is a mature work in the musical genre that manages to do okay by the air head entertainment angle too, I can relate to it, as I can relate to Grease. A musical that is fun. The 1988 dance version often manages okay by that air head angle, it also managed to give birth to this approachable musical, it also does a bit better on the race war angle, on the rats too. But there is a stylised component that makes it not 100% at the same level. I can typically accept that style with some low budget features and some consider that the 1988 is superior to the 2007. * By March 2010 my views had changed a lot. It is now the 2007 that I go back to watch occasionally, much more frequently than I re-watch Grease. If Grease looks to the end of the 50's then Hairspray looks to the early mid 60's, a comparison can be valid?</fullReview>

Yet there's no standout number that makes you want to buy the soundtrack. Travolta is alright as the mum (!), but its young Nikki Blonsky who steals the show with her irrepressible attitude. James Marsden impresses in a brief appearance. Christopher Walken is decent but I expected more from him. Queen Latifah's inclusion was probably there to add a number stressing racial harmony.

		<shortDescription>Go see the show before it closes..it's so worth it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this movie last summer because it is one of my favorite Broadway shows. When you see a movie like this, you have to compare it as a movie musical on its own and compared to the show.Unlike in Mamma Mia (which I loved so much, but Pierce Brosnan cannot sing for his life), everyone here can sing and act very good, and they take real control of their characters. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky is AMAZING as Tracy. She sings very well and makes it clear to the audience why you should love her from her first notes in Good Morning Baltimore to her last in You Can't Stop The Beat. John Travolta was also very good, and bhas certainly grown up since Grease. He and Christopher Walken as Edna and Wilbur share one of the best and romantic scenes in You're Timeless To Me. I was surprised how well James Marsden and Michelle Pfeiffer did, never heard them sing before, they were AMAZING. Queen Latifah was flawless as always. I had very low expectations when Zac Efron was casted as Link, seeing that I being a huge fan of the show did not want the movie to be ruined by Disney freaks. I was very worried that Efron would take his High School Musical voice when singing Without Love, which is my favorite song from the show, and ruin it. Efron was better then he was in HSM (a failure), but he still didn't cut it for me. I felt like Link needed a better voice. Also, I did not like the plot change with Tracy running away instead of being arrested because you couldn't see the Tracy/Link chemistry in Without Love, which is one of my favorite parts of the show because it's so beautiful. Also, no cast can beat OBC's. Blonsky and Efron were good, but they don't stand a chance against Marissa Jaret Winokur and Matthew Morrison who were TOO AMAZING FOR WORDS. They just ARE Tracy and Link. Winokur brought so much energy and talent to the character that Blonsky (being very talented) just couldn't beat if she tried her hardest. Morrison's voice and acting is much better than Efron's and Morrison also brings out so much emotion in Link that Efron just fails to do. The same thing with Seaweed and Penny, who were played HEAVENLY by Corey Reynolds and Kerry Butler in the OBC. I'll start with Amanda Bynes, the movie's Penny. When I heard that Bynes was cast, I was SO excited because i loved her from her old Nickelodeon days from All That and The Amanda Show. Don't get me wrong, Bynes was great in this movie, but it wasn't the Penny that all fans know true and dear. Penny is my favorite character from the show. I think that what makes Penny so interesting in the show is that she starts out as the COMPLETE definition of a dork (dorky clothes, glasses, voice etc.) and then during Without Love she starts getting out of her shell and sings amazingly. However, in the way Bynes played her, Penny is exactly the same for the whole movie. This just ruined my favorite character and favorite parts of the show. Also, Bynes' voice is not that good in my opinion. I mean, on Broadway, actresses who played Penny included Kerry Butler, Diana DeGarmo, and Alexa Vega, all of whom are amazing and flawless. Bynes is so opposite that her and Seaweed's parts in You Don't Stop The Beat had to go down an octave, which was holding back Elijah Kelley. I was also expecting Bynes to deliver more on the humor, which was like 85% in my opinion. Alison Janney was HILARIOUS TIMES 100000000000 i can't even start to explain how funny she was. She was definitely one of the high points. Brittany Snow underimpressed me as Amber. Her voice is cute, but it's not an Amber voice. Where is Laura Bell Bundy when you need her? Laura's amazing and the person who replaces her is always crap compared to her. This happened in Legally Blonde too when she got replaced by Bailey Hanks, who is MUCH less talented. If there were any OBC members that should have been brought for the movie, I think Laura definitely (no one can be Amber but her), Marissa and Matthew (they ARE Tracy and Link, as I stated before) and Kerry (the big screen needs what she brought to the stage as Penny, I still don't get how she didn't get nominated for a Tony). Harvey Firestein would have been great but John Trovolta already doe a great job. The rest of the OBC are also amazing but their parts are easily replaceable. I actually think that James Marsden is better than Clarke Thorrell. Anyways, this was a very good movie and musical with all the great songs from the show. It is much better then movie musical wannabe's like Rent, High School Musical series, The Producers, Grease etc, and in my opinion tied with Mamma Mia and worse than Sweeney Todd (my favorite movie of all timew) However, the show is MUCH better and you should all see it before it closes on Broadway on January 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! John Travolta really pulled it off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray is another in a run of recent musical hits. This one stars Nikki Blonsky as an exuberant teenage girl hoping to get on the local TV dance show and John Travolta, who plays her mom, yes, her mom. Blonsky is charming, fun, and sweet and Travolta is surprisingly both believable and lovable playing a character of the opposite gender. Michelle Pfeiffer is deliciously evil as the mother of a rival teen and Christopher Walken adds some laughs and sincerity as the father. An honorable mention should also go to James Marsden who is quickly becoming the face and voice of the modern day musical. The catchy songs, flashy costumes, and colorful sets also help to make a very enjoyable musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a spectacular movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only describe my feeling as astounded after I saw this amazing movie. At first I thought it was so boring a movie with people in 80's hairstyle and all but I completely changed my my mind right after I watched it. I'm too fed up with those mass-produced routine teenage musical movies like High school musical, camp rock... They're just not exclusive at all. But not this. This is a total difference. The cast are amazing. I really admire Travolta for the way he moved in that big fat suit, and love the Amanda Baynes, Nikky Blonsky, James Marden ( prince Edward in Enchanted), Queen Latif, Elijiah... for their acting. Tracy still looks adorable and beautiful despite her overweight body. The movie's just too fantastic. They wanted to crush all the discrimination between the black and the white, the fat and skinny and they did a wonderful job. I was so moved by the last scene when eve'one gets on the stage and dances and sings together it just feels so good I wish I could be on such a show...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and slightly twisted Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I was skeptical when I first saw the previews for this but I am indeed amazed sometimes at what I see.This is a nice little musical set in the early sixties where everything seems to revolve around a popular dancing show. The main character is a woman with a dance and a song in her heart. Of course with here open views of race and her slightly full figure this becomes the challenge of a lifetime.The acting in this piece and the singing and dancing that are pretty well done. I look at this and I say this beats the heck out of Moulon Rouge. I enjoy talent and this is very good. The story is pretty solid and though a bit preachy at times It is a fun and lively film that is great for taking time.Anycase this movie is well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bringing back the old fashioned musical movie spirit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In lots of ways "Hairspray" is surprising much like musicals from the '30's and 40's; the era of the birth of movie musicals and by fans are still regarded as the best decade(s) for movie musicals. "Hairspray" comes real close to what those movies were all about. It's a happy no worries musical, with dancing routines and singing, that is colorful, fast and with a moralistic story to it. In that regard "Hairspray" is already a better and more successful movie at what it tries to achieve than some other genre movies from this decade.The movie of course also has moralistic messages in it but it doesn't really work out that great though, since it just isn't realistic enough about it. As if dancing can solve interracial and acceptance issues. But that's just how musicals normally are. They show what should be a perfect and happy world and provide simple 'sulutions' for much bigger and more serious issues. The message of the movie is to respect each other, just the way they are, despite of race or size.But obviously this just simply doesn't take away any of the fun of the movie. It's obviously not a movie that should be taken seriously. After all how can you take a movie with John Travolta in an elderly female role take seriously in the first place? "Hairspray" is light feel-good fun and it does not fail to bring entertainment.It's also a movie with lots of humor in it, mostly with its spoken lines and insight jokes about the '60's. You don't have to been born prior to the '60's to understand it and find it all funny and amusing though. Its humor and the over-the-top going of it all makes sure that you'll never take this movie seriously and take it as simple light warm hearted entertainment instead.The movie its cast is pretty amazing, considering the genre the movie got made in. It features some actors you normally wouldn't expect in a musical. John Travolta hadn't starred in a musical for almost 30 years but here he is again singing and dancing like he has done nothing else before. On top of that he isn't playing any ordinary role but he's actually playing an over-sized female. Of course a role you would never expect to see him in. Perhaps the most amusing role is being played by Christopher Walken, who always deliberately plays his comical roles so seriously that he becomes totally hilarious. Also actors such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Bynes and James Mardsen have some quite big singing roles. Jerry Stiller also makes an amusing small appearance. He also was in the previous "Hairspray" movie from 1988. in the role that in this movie is being played by Christopher Walken.Can't really say that the musical numbers are anything memorable but they are done with style and is very happy and colorful, which makes them amusing to watch, even though it isn't always too great to listen at. At some points in the movie some musical numbers also too rapidly follow each other. Normally it's also really something disturbing when characters in the movie suddenly in the middle of a sequence burst into singing but I must say that this movie handled this well and in an almost entirely seamless, non-disturbing way.I simply enjoyed it a lot, despite that musical isn't my favorite movie genre.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed the DVD with a few other seniors. Generally the responses were positive. The beat really raised our heart rates a notch or two. An incredibly heart warming performance by Nikki as Tracy. She really ran away with this movie. John Travolta didn't seem too comfortable in his role as Edna but then, Edna was not at all comfortable with her weight problem. Wouldn't it be great if all racial differences could be solved by dancing and singing to a fabulous beat. It was wonderful to see the audience including myself, leave the theatre nodding and walking out in time to the beat as the credits were running. The intense and sometimes bitter rivalry between TV networks is well portrayed. Likewise, the exploitation of women by clothing and feminine products. The finale has a somewhat contrived result in the naming of Mis Teen Hairspray for the year. The decision comes across as fair and just. I found some some bits of the sung ideologue which called to mind, Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It probably comes as no surprise to everyone reading this that originally (back in 1988) HAIRSPRAY was a movie with music but wasn't a musical. A few years back, the plot was resurrected and brought to Broadway and this current film is a movie based on this musical.At the onset, I've gotta point out that I adored the original HAIRSPRAY and still prefer it after watching this musical version. Now this isn't to say the musical was bad (it was exceptional), but the first film was so close to perfect that it's no wonder my original preference hasn't changed.One of the biggest reasons for preferring the original were having Divine in the role as Mrs. Turnblad. He was as good as you can get and I felt a bit sorry for John Travolta having to try to fit in Divine's shoes--you can't help but compare to the late Divine. Another reason I prefer the original is that it was so completely fresh and original--and a remake can't recapture that. Finally, the other reason I prefer the first film is that there were more cute little vignettes that got lost in the musical--mostly because they needed to make time for all the musical numbers. The kooky couple played by Pia Zadora and Ric Ocasek, the way Mrs. Pingleton freaked out when she went into a Black neighborhood and all the other little touches really made HAIRSPRAY (1988) the best.Now the second HAIRSPRAY is no slouch--it's got plenty of strengths and a lot to love. In particular, I love the frenetic pace of the singing and dancing--particularly at the end of the film. I was almost surprised that some of the dancers didn't pass out or have heart attacks completing it and it probably is the highest energy number I've ever seen. Plus the cast all did a marvelous job--they tried hard and it seemed like a labor of love. Finally, I just loved seeing Christopher Walken in drag near the end of the film--it was so funny and creepy at the same time!UPDATE: I just saw both movies AGAIN and, I hate to admit it, but perhaps I was a bit premature. I think I actually enjoyed the remake more--mostly because of its high energy and polish compared to the first film. Of course, neither could compare to the amazing Broadway musical--now THAT was truly amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well.......what can I say?How about the best film of the recent years?After seeing the 1988 John Waters version, I was unsure how a remake would fair but due to the toe tapping catchy songs and the brilliant dances I gotta say it beats it by a mile! I think newcomer Nikki Blonsky was wonderful playing Tracy Turnblad, and if this performance is anything to go by I know this ain't the last we'll see of her! The most underrated person by far in Hairspray has got to be Queen Latifa, who completely blew me away. Her stunning performance of !I know where I been" was absolutely full of emotion and I defy anyone to think this was not one of the best songs in the entire film.Overall I think the whole film just oozed 60sness from the work go and the songs are absolutely brilliant and I just want everybody to go out and buy the DVD so they can see how fabulous it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed at how much I could enjoy a musical comedy made in 2007. This film is so tunefully upbeat and energetic that it caught my interest seconds after starting. The performances by John Travolta (playing a mother!!), Nikki Blonsky (the lead character), Christopher Walken (playing Travolta's husband) and Michelle Pfieffer were simply awesome.It's 1962 and an overweight white girl who's thrilled about dancing gets an opportunity to try out for a TV dance show. Her positive, open-minded attitude and talent cause people not only to challenge their "fat" stereotypes, but racial ones as well.The first hour was absolutely fantastic. It introduced and handled many social issues in a lighthearted, uplifting way - and primarily through fun music and dance routines. Here we see the lead character's unstoppable positive attitude in the midst of group criticism, her mother's issues about being seen in public, how her and her friend are colorblind and benefit from the experience - and so much more.The second hour was also good, but was pretty much focused on racial integration. The movie wasn't quite able to hold onto the same level of fresh energy and dynamic story-telling as the first part. Parts were well done, but at times a bit over-over-the-top too.All in all, this is terrific movie to watch - even if you don't generally like movie musicals. It's so fun to watch, just about everyone will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favorite movies. The music is outstanding. I find myself singing and dancing when I watch it. And it is currently showing on HBO a lot. It has a good plot. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing. Zac Efron and Nikki Blonsky are so cute together--makes me wish they were a real couple. Queen Latifah is always great in whatever she is in, big part or small, and this movie is no exception. I do find it,hard, though, to believe John Travolta as a woman. He is very good in the part, maybe it's just me, but I just don't think it was the right casing putting him in the part of Edna. I know that part is always played by a male actor, but just not sure Travolta was the one. But watch the movie for the singing, the dancing, and the portrayal of life in the 60's. Just a great movie overall.</fullReview>

I was laughing most of the time he was on. The facial expressions are just so priceless. The thing I liked the most was the song and dance. It really cheered me up when I was feeling down. It's a fun movie with lots of humor in it and the acting is pretty good too. The ending was fantastic and I loved it. I wouldn't change a thing about this movie.

		<fullReview>I just watched this film last week, and I had been looking forward to seeing it for quite some time. I was apprehensive about Travolta replacing Divine, who was always divine, but I have to say, Travolta was terrific. In fact, I watched the film a second time strictly to see Travolta. Maybe I had such low expectations of what his performance might be that I was pleased to see him give such a charming turn. Yes, charming! True, his accent was terrible and he didn't sound too womanly, but that does not deter from his embodiment of the character. I actually felt sorry for Edna as well as happy for her. Go figure... Plus, the scenes with Walken and Travolta are very memorable. They appeared to have a great time together on screen.Along with Travolta, everybody in this film looked like they had a good time making it, and the musical numbers are solid. I think that's hard to replicate in today's times ? good music, that is, in a film, less a musical. It gives me hope to think that there is a chance this genre can make a comeback. I've never been hooked on them, but they can appeal to a broad audience if the subject matter is inclusive and diverse enough.Hairspray is inspirational in a lot of ways and on different levels, and the strong cast delivers. I hope John Waters is pleased with the outcome. You will be, too, once you watch it. It won't disappoint!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this version of Harispray last night and quite frankly, am still glowing from the experience. Totally engaging, excellent new songs, captivating choreography, great clothes and a beautiful variation on the original.Even more interesting is that this version also presents delightful variations on the original characterizations as well with the end result making them somewhat more sensitive/poignant than in the first. Divine's Edna Turnblad was just as loving to her daughter as Travolta's Edna - though Travolta's Edna was not nearly as confident as Divine. Christopher Walken, abandoning his usual scary persona, is downright adorable as Wilbur. Jerry Stiller, this time out playing Mr Pinky was just as much fun as he was as Wilbur in the first. Michele Pfeiffer is loads of fun as Amber's ambitious mother and Queen Latifah's MotorMouth Mabel is fierce!!!! This version also stays true to the overall theme of racial equality and the setting remains in a teenage world still idealistic enough to not only want to effect change but also honestly believing that they could.One cannot mention the attributes of the movie without mentioning the enormously powerful music. The music, expertly based on 60s sensibilities enhanced by modern flourishes is a crucial element to the success of the film.It is also worth noting that both versions can indeed stand on their own. The latest version does not AT ALL try to copy the original - it simply presents another variation. This also has a somewhat different format as it is essentially a Broadway show on film....and it works beautifully.What's even more amazing is that the message is still MOST relevant in 2008 and this was set in 1962!!!!! (sigh...) Nonetheless, this is a powerful, uplifting film with a remarkable cast. Additionally, it is quite funny.Hiiiiiiiiiighly recommended!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The current economic climate is something which has sparked a revelation in the minds of Brits and other people around the globe alike. It seems that the dire state the planet is in at the moment has given way to a host of soft-centered, enjoyable family films.Hairspray came just before the recession hit us hard, but nonetheless it still made a huge impact around the globe. The original film released way back yonder was a crude representation of 60's life, whereas this smacks you straight in the face; but for all the right reasons.Adam Shankman is at the helm this time and brings a world of colour on to the screen. The casting by any standard is superb. John Travolta leaps off the screen as Edna Turnblad and Michelle Pfeiffer is also excellently realised as the greedy TV station manager.The lovable Christopher Walken, hunky Zac Efron and bubbly Queen Latifah also star alongside newcomer Nikki Blonsky, who nearly steals the show, were it not for her character's mother (Travolta).Overall, Hairspray will set your heart alight with a warm glow, it's a must watch if you're feeling blue!</fullReview>

I don't know what kind of accent he was going for, but whatever it was he never quite got there. In fact, he was so bad he brought my overall rating down from an 8 to a 5! Yes, he's that bad. In fact, I found myself turning away from the screen whenever he was on camera and doing anything I could to distract myself from his voice. He's completely wrong for the part and it's a shame b/c the rest of cast was terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but I just wish the movie would have stayed a light hearted comedy and not included all the racial stuff. It made the movie sound serious, but it was supposed to be fun, so I think it would have been better with the protesting and racial story line left out. New comer Nikki Blonsky was good in her part; she can dance good. And surprisingly, John Travolta was funny playing a very large woman. The make up department deserves props for his female transformation.The songs in the film were pretty good, but certainly not the best musical I've seen. None of them were catchy enough to remember how they went after seeing the film. Michelle Pfeiffer is back playing the villain, an obsessed mom who wants her daughter, Amber, to win Miss Hairspray contest. But Amber, just can't dance as well as Tracey. The Miss Hairspray contest was entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you like songs in films, then you'll like this.</fullReview>

She wants to dance and sing with Link Larkin played by Zac Efron whom she has a crush on. At high school dance party, her dance catches Corny Collins's eye and she get gets into member of TV show. She is getting popular, but the shows manager, Velma von Tussle and her daughter, who is main character on the show, don't welcome Tracy so interfere her. One day, Tracy holds a demonstration for racial discrimination with her black friends for that reason she is pursued by polices. While she is escape from polices, the dance contest called "Miss Hair Spray" starts? Over all this plot is a light, entertaining movie; on the other hand, it is thought-provoking through racial discrimination. "Hair Spay" of musical has also a good reputation, so the soundtrack is powerful upbeat music. The acting is amazing even though actors have to play a lot of role such as acting, dancing, singing on the story. Nikki Blomsky, is the lead of movie, also pass the audition for appear the movie like Tracy that's why her acting is realistic, so she can inspire audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the sixties...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a movie, there was a musical; I have yet to experience both. Then came this movie, which is also a musical, which I have experienced and been infected by it. "Hairspray" is like "Grease", where in a small town the high school is divided between the popular kids and the unpopular. Where the music, simple and soulful, ultimately unites everyone.But the story itself is different. "Hairspray" is about Tracy (Nikki Blonski), a girl whose only dream is to appear on "The Corny Collins Show", a popular singing and dancing program broadcasted in her hometown Baltimore. As the movie opens, she's waking up and walking the town's streets as she goes to school while she happily sings the beautiful "Good Morning Baltimore". Tracy is not ugly, but she's fat and unpopular, and has everything going against her; but she doesn't care. That's the first thing we notice, not only about the film's main character but about the film itself. "Hairspray" is the joyful ride it is because it doesn't care about being taken seriously: the characters look at the camera with innocence; they are all, even in their good-hearted nature, ridiculous stereotypes (notice James Marsden's masterful composition of Corny Collins); John Travolta plays a big, fat mother who loves eating and dancing and Christopher Walken is her husband?Any movie that shoots Travolta and Walken dancing and singing romantically together is not to be taken seriously.From this point of view, you could also assume "Hairspray" has everything against it. However, it's astonishing how it gets almost everything right: the production design of each scene, the costumes, the colors; not to mention the songs and the singers (Zac Effron sings, and this time's for real); and the dances and choreographies, made by the director Adam Shankman. Shankman?he's an interesting guy that makes you wonder about his directing choices. He's directed regular comedies ("The Wedding Planner"), awful comedies ("Bringing down the house") and unnecessary comedies ("Cheaper by the dozen 2"); great romantic films ("A walk to remember") and even a Vin Diesel ("The Pacifier"). He should know why he's done all this; but the truth is that he always comes up on top and, when taking his choreographing talent to the maximum, he chose to direct this movie. Intelligent man. I said recently that it's impossible "you may not find music, dancing and acting so perfectly combined in a film these days" as you can find in "Across the Universe". Let me say "Hairspray" almost lives up to the challenge; with a photographic and editing work that shouldn't be overlooked. There's a feeling that in every scene Shankman tried to capture not only his spectacular choreographies but also the characters relationships and their reactions towards each song. That's why the action is not always focused on the dancing in the musical numbers; try to notice on what it focuses instead.John Waters' original piece, I heard, deals with one of this film's subjects but in a more serious way. It's something I haven't mentioned and has to do with racism and integration and Queen Latifah and an amazing singer called Seaweed (Elijah Kelley). I won't give details because I think it's an aspect of the movie you'll enjoy if you don't know much about it. However, I must say I don't think it's treated so lightly; it's just that the movie is so good and lively that you get lost on the beat and miss the sharper comments it contains. Some of them are funny and some are not.Sadly, "Hairspray" suffers from the same problem that "Across the Universe" and many films originally conceived as musicals or adapted from the stage to film: it's unable to maintain the velocity it begins with and is so sure of possessing. Unavoidably, every time "Hairspray" loses its pace, the fall is more notorious than we would want it to be. Consequently, there are moments when we feel plain bored?but these are few and shouldn't be taken into account."Hairspray", with Travolta, Walken, Latifah, Effron, Michelle P, the lovely Amanda Bynes, Jerry Stiller and a sparkling ensemble that doesn't stop shining, is the perfect role model for anyone who wants to shoot a musical in what's left of this decade.</fullReview>

Nikki Blonsky plays a perfect Tracy Turnblad, who isn't afraid to shake things up, And John Trovolta plays the lovable Edna, keeping up the tradition as a man playing a female, nothing harmful. And there are tons of other actors and actresses who are great and funny in the movie, and how can I forget the always rocking Zac Efron as the Sweet teen Heartthrob?! Adam shankman's Humor and ultimate greatness really shine in this one as the director.

		<fullReview>If you find yourself feeling depressed, for any reason whatsoever, just pop in the DVD of "Hairspray" and watch Tracy (Nikki Blonski) sing "Good Morning, Baltimore!" The entire WORLD should start off its day with this song. Tracy is filled with so much joy that it is absolutely contagious. I watched this film the first time with a smile on my face for almost the entire thing. My cheeks were hurting when I walked out of the theater. Now that I have the DVD, I just have the desire to watch it everyday.I could pick apart certain things in this film, but there's no point. It's plain fun, it's entertaining, it's uplifting, it's filled with laughs, great songs and great dances. It's a totally American movie that reflects American values of a certain age. It depicts a time when we were still racially divided, literally. The sad thing is: We still are. But for a brief moment, white/black lines intersect and "mingle" and the result is a fantastic burst of energy and joy. I bought it and I will never need to see a therapist again. I can hear the bells -- and I'm so happy that I can!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bubble-gum musical - but not the new 'Grease'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying not to compare this with the West End stage show (which was loud, colourful, and brash), I approached 'Hairspray' the same way I do every musical - are the songs any good, and does it grab my attention? The songs are, at best, OK. 'Good Morning Baltimore', 'I Can Hear The Bells', 'You Can't Stop The Beat' and 'You're Timeless To Me' are fun and memorable, and the cast - Nikki Blonsky as Tracy, John Travolta as mother Edna (managing to put some personality into a hideous fat-suit), and Christopher Walken as father Wilbur (the singing family role he's always wanted?); plus Michelle Pfieffer and Queen Latifah, are fine and well-cast.Did it grab my attention? Yes, but it didn't always hold it. Punchily satirical, and saying lots about integration, I didn't feel it was funny or slanted enough. It is a bubble-gum musical - nothing wrong with that, but a bit of black comedy might have worked better. I can't see this being as popular in thirty years as 'Grease' is now, but maybe, in this disposable culture, that doesn't matter, and we should view it for what it is, a toe-tapper which makes you smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, how I hate musicals. People bursting into song and dancing on tables for no apparent reason. Hairspray is a musical with people bursting into song and dancing on tables. Ergo, I should hate this movie.But I didn't. I though it was very charming and entertaining. Above all I have to "blame" Nikki Blonsky for tricking me into enjoying a musical. She's very talented and just a bundle of energy. But I have to say that the cast overall was extremely good. So what if some of them can't sing. They deliver with such energy that it's just impossible not to like this movie. The ones in the cast who really stood out for me (except for Blonsky) were Michelle Pfeiffer (deliciously evil) and James Marsden (he was born to play this part).I was pleasantly surprised. Just don't hold your breath for me watching more musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and wonderful choreography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its success owe much to its excellent balance of great dance numbers and ample character development for nearly everyone. To start with, the singing and dancing Tracey is so beautiful and so plus size! Then it is her classmates' turn, the vibrant black youths in the detention class, singing even more beautifully and leap so high in the air. When Mrs. Turnblad (John Travolta) showed up with her feminine features, not to mention her adorable and modest demeanor, that's worth zillions of laughs. The scene Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad (Christopher Walken) singing in the backyard can be so romantic. But I love the finale best - the way John Trovolta moves and bends, Queen Lativah sings and the group dancers twirl round and round unbelievably fast.And one big surprise, the 2 dance lessons in the bonus features given by the choreographers are eye-opening. I won't be able to perform the "camel pull" and "chicken" sequence. However, I can admire those dancers even more than the main characters. All right, maybe Mrs. Turnblad's final dance is still more hilarious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Opinion: Hairspray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!!!! One of the best movies ever in my opinion. Songs were great. Love how it was a bigger girl instead of a really thin girl. Bigger is better. Zac Efron so hot. the best musical movie I seen (so far) Love it. The acting was excellent. John Travolta was excellent(whoa). Very funny. a movie you could watch over and over again and not get sick of. Watch it once and you will never forget it. A great movie with a meaningful story. So many great actors. Nikki Blonsky is so amazing. Her voice is gorgeous and her smile is beautiful. Amanda Bynes has a surprising singing voice, very nice though. It was great how they had John Travolta who was on the musical "Grease" and Michelle Pfeiffer who was on "Grease 2". Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I wish I'd seen this movie in the theater, I can't imagine how that would have gone. Sure, it would have been great to share the (guaranteed) exuberance of the other viewers, but how could I dance while trapped in one of those binding theater seats? Without jumping on my neighbor's toes? Without the usher being forced to remove me at flashlight-point? This movie is THAT infectious! I've never seen the original, and, in a way, I'm glad because that might have tainted my extreme enjoyment of this film. Someone called it "the ultimate feel-good movie", and they were right on the money.I won't bother with specifics, because if you're reading this, and other comments, you already know the story and how wonderfully it's presented.All I know is, when it's time to watch "Hairspray" at home (which it often is), that means it's time to move some furniture around... to make room to dance, and to get fabulously happy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Songs, Pretty Lightweight (So to Speak)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a nice little musical that really didn't blaze much of a trail for me. It has some pleasant songs and some fun dancing, and the lead is quite talented. Actually, I though Queen Latifah really stole the show. She was the real talent in this movie. I thought it moved OK. I especially like where a simple swat with a protest sign turned into a brain bashing through the media. The problem is that it tries to be more than it is. The social issues are serious but they seem to be dealt with so delicately here that they lose their punch. I was never able to accept Travolta in that role. Every time he was in a scene, I couldn't keep my suspension of disbelief. I kept thinking, "It's John Travolta in a fat suit." And I like John Travolta. Anywyay, I don't want to dis it too much because it has a good heart. It's just, for me, it bites off way more than it can chew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with 8 and 9 year old girls and we all absolutely loved it. It is pure escapism fun, with all the requisite components of the underdog triumphing, beating the baddies and getting the guy. Zac Efron proves he looks almost as good as a brunette and he can actually act, Nikki Blonski was so good as the pure hearted and determined Tracy. It seems that teenagers would especially love seeing the characters break out of the bounds their parents and society are setting them, but actually I wonder it wouldn't be a little too formulaic for them lacking in emotional depth. It is interesting to contrast the social situation with today, with a women and a African American heading towards the White House for the first time it seems we haven't reached the utopia just yet. But 40 years on breaking the bounds of social norms can still attract the ire of the government, just the labels used may differ from communist to terrorist. But you won't spend long pondering that while you watch this, enjoying the score, fabulous dancing and even more fabulous sixties frocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my friend told me about her DVD, i borrowed it because i wanted to see it at cinemas. I watched the film and i loved it. i was astonished about the performance of John Travolta, when you remember him from GREASE and then as Edna Turnblad...but every single actor did his part really good! Michelle Pfeiffer, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Brittany Snow, Amanda Bynes, Nikki Blonski and, of course, Zac Efron. I loved him from HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL and i couldn't resist about dancing and singing along. The film was really great and i would tell it to all my friends about that film. Also, the performance of Jerry Stiller was very funny, because when you know him as Arthur - from KING OF QUEENS, then you can laugh about it.

This is because she is afraid they will hurt her because of her size. Tracy's father Wilbur Turnblad (Christopher Walken) explains why her mother refused, he says Tracy can go. Edna is not happy.Nethertheless, Tracy goes on with the plan, the next morning, accompined by Penny, Tracy arrives at the studio to audition.Velma Von' Tussle and Tracy did not get along. Velma made fun of Tracy's flaws, her size, her belifes about racism. Tracy believes that black kids deserve to dance on TV just as much as white kids. But as this is 1962 TV has Negro Day once a month. The audition didn't go well.Tracy becomes close with the black children through detention and secretly dances with them regularly.

Luckily enough for her, Corny Collins was watching. He immediately gets her on the show and she becomes an instant hit with boys and girls her age/younger. Her parents and Penny are ecstatic and Wilbur is making a money out of Tracy merchandise, that he is selling in his Joke shop, Hardy Har Har Har.Velma Von' Tussle is not a happy lady, especially when she finds out that her daughter Amber is hurt because of Tracy &amp; Link getting closer, and Link making friends with black kids. Velma has had enough.She cancels Negro Day! So, Tracy, along with Black people, they march, to fight Racism and get TV officaly integrated! The Police immediately tell them to go home, but Tracy is having none of it. When she hits and police officer on the head, he attempts to arrest her. She runs.Penny helps her immedeitly, hiding her in the celler of Penny's house, but when Penny's mother, Prudy Pingleton (Alison Janney) finds Tracy and Penny in the celler, she calls the cops. She ties Penny to her bed and tells her she will never leave her bedroom. Within moments of being in the bedroom, tied up, Seaweed climbs through her window and unties her. They kiss and fall in love.As they let Tracy out of the celler, they put her in the trunk of the car so the police don't find her.Tracy's other dream, becoming Miss.

		<fullReview>Now i can say that i am one of the biggest Hairspray fans. Not the product but the movies. You see i saw it the day i came out and i got the Shake and Shimmy edition DVD the day it came out. Set in Bailtmaore in 1962, it is a warm hearted comedy/Musical about a teenage girl Tracy who is big hearted and big bottomed. Her dream is to be on the Corny Collins-(Fantastically played by James Marsden)- Show. Its a show that the council kids dance and sing every afternoon after school. Amber (Brittany Snow) the shows resident brat and her mother Velma (Michelle Pfhiffer) who is also the station manager try to get her off the show. It also is a serious movie at sometimes with a message of anti-racism. Also stars John Travolta, Amanda Bynes and Zac Efron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cheer, but does not live up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a fun movie, very colorful and lots and lots of songs. It is a remake and I must say that I actually preferred the original by "the master of bad taste" John Waters. What I did not like very much in this modern version was the amount of songs. I have nothing against musicals, and my favorite ones are Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar, Tommy etc... I think it probably would have benefited to have more talking scenes and to develop and flesh out the characters a bit more. This version despite all the good cheer and a surprisingly good performance by John Travolta felt at times long and repetitive. And it lacked the Waters signature wackiness....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved Penny Pingleton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the advertisement about Hairspray, I thought that it was a comic film for young people. I saw that it was a musical movie and even the first Hairspray was filmed in 1988. I like musical movies but in reality musical movies are not being liked as American people like them. For example in my country and in Europe musical movies are highly appreciated movies. Maybe American people are trying to behave differently than others like baseball and American football. With music's, with dances, with actors/actresses Hairspray is really satisfactory movie. Unbelievable change of John Travolta into Edna Turnblad surprised me. Travolta is really talented actor in musical, he indicated it Grease as well. I loved Penny Pingleton as Amanda Bynes very much, she is pretty indeed. Michelle Pfeiffer acted very good, nearly I hated her because of her character in film. In her ages how can a woman can be beautiful still? I can not imagine not to give an attention to her like poor Wilbur Turnblad. What a wonderful woman Queen Latifah, she is absolutely woman. Nikki Blonsky suits perfect for her role. Other actors/actress are also sucsesfull.The location is Baltimore and there is a dance competition in local TV. Young generation had been trying to solve social problem as race differences with new paradigm. Standart declaration of American Culture like dance, music, American dream, pioneering etc.The musics are like rap music with the words. All the songs are like story telling. I wonder all the musics have been written for the movie special? If they are so, if we take into consideration even just music, written a song and perform it as a musical might be tough job. For this difficulty, I must give extra appreciation to the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie, it puts a smile on my face. I am not very easily impressed with most movies today. It was well put together - from the cast to the dancing and singing - and it has a good moral also.I had never heard of the Benny Dean show before and even thought it was loosely based on that show, I did learn some very interesting history. John Travolta was great! He should win an Oscar for his role. He not only looked and acted like a woman, but he also danced and sang. And he had the Baltimore accent down to a tee. He truly deserves Best Supporting actor Oscar and he should have gotten the Golden Globe!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! Blew me away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the DVD and am sorry I didn't go see it in the theater. First of all, I'm a guy, a macho guy who usually likes action movies. However I was a fan of the original Hairspray movie mainly because of the desegregation issue. But to compare this to the original would do a great disservice to both films. Both are great in their own ways.What blew me away was that it's a musical first and foremost. I was not expecting that. The opening song, "Good Morning Baltimore", was just great. Nikki Blonsky is perfectly cast and extremely talented. She really played this roll well and should be at least nominated for a Golden Globe and possibly an Oscar. Then there was John Travolta, he played his part very well too. I heard about how Travolta really pulled off an authentic Baltimore accent. Well I didn't know what it was but he must have done a god job because it was funny. The rest of the cast were great too. Queen Latiffa was good as Motor Mouth Mabel. Her singing was excellent. Elijah Kelly puts in a grossly underrated performance as Seaweed, the black high school student and son of Motor Mouth Mabel. His songs are great and there is real chemistry between him and Penny Pingleton payed well by Amanda Bynes.They pulled off something that the vast majority of high school movies can't. They high school students acted like actual high school kids rather than adults in their 30s. In real life, those kids are rare. When I was going to school we were hardly ever grown up and serious about anything except having fun. So props to this film for that bit of insight.Hairspray is socially conscience and very entertaining. If it can entertain a macho guy like me, then it must be something special.Rayvyn</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best stage adaptations out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw Hairspray on stage but I now wish I had.I saw the original film, I thought it was a true delight from Lake's performance to Stiller's. This movie is officially revived.Newcomer Nikki Blonsky plays Tracy Turnblad, a Baltimore girl in the 60s who dreams on being on the local "Corny Collins show", she can dance very well and has a fantastic singing voice, but she is not skinny or pretty by regular standards. John Travolta, who dresses in drag, plays Edna Turnblad, Tracy's mother, immediately shoots down her dreams because she doesn't want her to get hurt. After a failed audition to Velma Von Tussle (played by, Tracy thinks her dreams are over. Then Corny Collins (played by James Marsden, who has a wonderful singing voice, and is funny) hosts Tracy's school dance, where she impresses him, she gets on the show. Velma isn't happy because she is ugly* and supports "Negro day" There is also, another thing in here that I consider a sub-plot about racism, which beautifully blends in with Tracy's dreams. On the "Corny Collins show" there is a "Negro day", Velma hates it, and is very racist (as most people were in the 60s.) When Velma cancels "Negro day" all of the people on there protest, including Tracy.I loved this film, the cameos where fun, (especially John Waters') except for one thing, a bunch of wasted opportunities. I really wanted Amanda Bynes to sing more, and a song for when Allison Janney was correcting her daughter would have been cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this with my entire family- my parents, 3 sisters, and 2 brothers. The only reason I didn't protest to going, was that I knew Zac Efron looked FIT in it! (I'm a fourteen year old girl). My family are like the Von Trapps so they like any film with fun music in it. About ten minutes into the film, we had some good laughs from it, and John Travolta's performance is exceptional! It was a fun film and at one point, I turned around to the audience, and there was no one who wasn't smiling. I ended up buying the soundtrack and I know every single word from it. It is a must see film, but plenty of my friends hated it, as they thought it was too much like The Brady Bunch. The musical score was Fantastic with a capital F! The lyrics were great as well. No one could've played the role of Tracy Turnblad than newcomer, Nikki Blonskey. There was great chemistry in it, and it surprised me what a great cast it was! And also the actors could sing really well, for instance James Marsden was an excellent singer in this. I would warn people who are disinterested in musicals to skip out this one, because you could hate it. It's a pleasure to watch and it really is a top film.xxxxxXXXXXxxxxx</fullReview>

It was a well scripted show and although at times it seemed kind of slow with moving on plot wise it was worth it.

		<shortDescription>Hairspray Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the original "Hairspray" aired on television right before this new "Hairspray" came out. I must say the first was one very well done, but the new one is just phenomenal! My friend and I had just gone out for the day, for a shopping day. Out of the blue the movie "Hairspray" came to me. So I brought it up the idea to go see it. My friend agreed 100% One thing I must say about "Hairspray" is that the casting of all the characters was done very well. John Travolta "Edna Turnblad" stood out the most, and him playing the role of a woman was hysterical. Everyone is so use to see him being a tough guy, or the good looking guy in the movie "Grease" But here you get a whole new look at him. He did an absolutely fantastic job taking on the role as a woman. His movement, his dancing, his accent was just wonderful. My friend and I are huge John Travolta fans, so seeing him in this role got us roaring with laughter.The music is another big part of the movie. After all it is a musical. All the songs had a wonderful beat to it, and the dance moves they did on the screen just made me want to get up out of my seat and dance. There is one song sung by Queen Latifah "Motormouth Maybelle" that is called I Know Where I've Been. Since this movie is based around segregation, "Miss. Maybelle" is walking down the street with a crowd of blacks behind her holding up candles, and signs protesting about being separated from the whites. This song she sang moved my friend and me, and I could feel the tears starting to run into my eyes. She did a beautiful job expressing her vocals, as well as the words, and the group of all the men and women behind her joined in as if they were a gigantic choir. That scene took my breathe away.The color choices in this movie made it feel as if you were in the sixties, as it was suppose to be set in the sixties. It made me feel like everything in that movie was happy, and joyous. But everything wasn't all that great because of the segregation going on. But they were showing both blacks and whites happy together in parts of the movie, and had them join in together in the dance scenes, and I just wanted to jump in the screen and dance with them.After seeing this movie, my friend and I could not stop singing the songs. So going shopping afterwords we split our money and bought the soundtrack. We listened to that CD all the way home.Soon after that, another friend and I went to another theater and saw Hairspray. My second time seeing it I loved it even more.This movie will never grow old. The music is fantastic, the acting is spectacular, and the story is told with a lot of heart, and soul. If you like upbeat movies, this one would be for you!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, yet disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hairspray" is probably the most delightful new musical seen on Broadway this decade. While it is a light hearted evening, there is also a strong emotional pull and characters that one truly cares about. Transitioning Hairspray from stage to screen would not have been as difficult at other recent musicals like "The Producers" or "Rent". Yet, the resulting film was not wholly satisfying.The biggest problem was the mistake of not sticking to the stage script, thus eliminating the jail scene (and the amusing number "In the Big Doll House"), and changing the circumstances under which "Without Love" is sung (making it much more difficult to sympathize with Link). Likewise "Mamma I'm a big Girl now" is greatly missed, and the two new songs "The Lady's Choice" and "New Girl in Town" are not especially happy additions to the story.It was never likely that the younger generation from the original cast would get to repeat their roles on film, as all of them were in their mid to late twenties when they opened the show. So it was inevitable that actual teenagers would have to take these roles on screen. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky does quite well as Tracy. If she lacks the glow that Marissa Jaret Winokour had on stage, she's a cute and appealing presence with a sweet singing voice. Brittany Snow is appropriately icy and pretty as Amber. But Amanda Bynes disappoints as Penny (with unimpressive singing) and Zac Efron fights a loosing battle with the re conception of his character. Its a bit more strange that none of the adult leads from he original Broadway cast were permitted to reprise their performances. If no one is superior to their stage predecessors, none of them disappoint. John Travolta's make up is less than flattering, but his Edna is a warm and likable character. Christopher Walken is also likable and charming as Wilbur. Queen Latifah isn't as brassy as Mary Bond Davis, but she is an apt choice for Mabel and has never been in better voice. Michelle Pfeiffer successfully plays up the sex in Velma to good effect, and the singing just strong enough for the role. Perhaps the happiest newcomer however is James Marsden, with a pleasant singing voice and broad toothy grin that's just perfect for Corny Collins. Hairspray was pleasant summer fun, and is more than easy to sit through, but it is frustrating to see that it could very easily have been a flawless stage to screen transfer, which it wasn't</fullReview>

He actually did very well even if he did look mildly uncomfortable in a few parts.Zac is a heartbreaker. Charming and cute even if I'm not much for High School Musical (his debut, as it were).Nicky Blonzky has a future in front of her that looks bright. I can't wait to see what she does next. She has one heck of a voice so, just like Queen Latifah, I hope I get to hear it again.I've been really enjoying the musicals they seem to be bringing out a lot more lately and I hope Hollywood keeps it up.</fullReview>

I have to say I didn't like the movie although I wanted to.The music is still excellent, and the new songs are very good as well. Queen Latifah is very good although she seems to be playing the same type of character that she played in Chicago. Tracy and Link are excellent. But...The movie seems to play on the racial issue to excess, especially in the last half hour when a great deal of the plot was changed from the Broadway musical. While the Broadway musical could be taken seriously, I couldn't take the last hour of the movie seriously.After having seen the brilliant Harvey Fierstein as Edna on Broadway, John Travolta was,... well, let's just say that Dorothy Michaels would get a 9 out of 10 (for those who remember Tootsie) while Edna would get a 4 at best. And there was no chemistry between Edna and Wilbur.But I had real problems with the changes in the story. Why take something that works and change it? I haven't seen the current cast of Hairspray on Broadway, and few have these days with the strike. But when the strike is over, I'd urge everyone who visits or lives in NYC to see the show.As for the movie... well, it IS entertaining. How does it compare to other musical movies? I liked Chicago (the movie) more than the Broadway Musical and I liked Phantom (the movie) MUCH more than the Broadway musical (although it took some time for me to get used to the Phantom's "gruff" voice). Chorus Line was much better as a musical, and Rent was better as a musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musical comedies are very rare today,Leslie Dixon adapted John Water's screenplay of his comic farce HAIRSPRAY made in 1988,This is the movie version of the Broadmay musical hit of a few years back.(same title).Adam Shankman directed this spirited romp.The time period is 1960 when integration of schools etc,was beginning. This is a satirical, farceial look at the period..The entire cast for nearly 2 hour sings &amp; dances up a storm.John Travolta in a fat suit is fantastic, he is doing the role that Divine created in the first version, Harvey Fierstien did this role on Broadway. ALL 3 have created memorable Edna Turnblad's.The rest of the fine cast Michelle Pfieffer, Christopher Walkin,James Marsden,Queen Latifah are all pitch perfect in there rolesI left 2 names for last as these 2 STAND OUTNicki BLonski as Edna's heavy set daughter,she will become a talent to be reckoned with,Elijah Kelly a young Black lad who steals his scenes with ease.Now for a few minor points. one being the music.All the songs seem to have the same beat &amp; tone, Also if I did not have the sub-titles on I would have missed most of the lyrics.Also the editing could have been tighter.This is an enjoyable film for the entire family.RATINGS ***1/2 (OUT of 4) 91 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is very little not to like in this movie. It opens with an absolutely stunning song by newcomer Nikki Blonsky ("Good Morning Baltimore") and then continues with an equally stunning performance by the same actress (playing the lead character Tracy Turnblad) and it just continues on at a frenetic pace that will leave the viewer almost exhausted with (a) a lot of laughing and (b) just the contagious energy level of the movie. Behind it all (and somewhat overshadowed by the song and dance numbers) is an important message about accepting those who are different. In early 1960's Baltimore blacks weren't very welcome and still today overweight girls (and women) are somewhat looked down upon. In this movie, as the black kids (most prominently "Seaweed", played by Elijah Kelley, who offered a performance almost the equal of Blonsky) struggle to be accepted by the local teen TV dance show, Tracy and her mom Edna (played by John Travolta - yes, you read that right) struggle to accept their status as "fat girls." In the end the two groups help each other gain acceptance.This is fantastic. I have to mention Christopher Walken's performance as Tracy's dad Wilbur. He treated the character quite seriously, which was exactly what was required, and as a result was quite funny. Queen Latifah as Maybelle I thought wasn't quite as strong as she was in, for example, "Chicago," and I'm still coming to terms with Travolta as Edna. His first appearance in the movie causes quite a laugh, but it almost seems as if that was the only reason to cast him in the role. I can't believe that there were no female actresses who could have taken the part and done well with it, and somehow Travolta playing a woman gets old pretty quickly and I found it a bit distracting to be honest.Still, from beginning to end this is a very enjoyable movie that you will never regret watching. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, films and art has no limits. But John Travolta as a woman !Oh my Rab ! what a surprise to eyes, how weird to mind. Who had ever thought such a brilliant idea ! I think most of the audience is watching the film because it has been told that he is playing such a role. And he is amazing as always. Film is about understanding each other, tolerating differences, friendship. Gives good messages and most of all has no disturbing immoral scenes. By the way Michelle Pfeifer act a very impressive villain and she rules. So film is also about how bad the racial divide between black and white people is, And it is very hopeful to see someone who is in favor of it,is defined as the villain. A very entertaining movie with high messages to watch with your family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don&#x2019;t bite all the hype, this movie is no messiah for musical genre. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong it&#x2019;s still good move, story is decent, songs are nice and often funny, only problem in that compartment is that voice dubbing is too apparent and this for me was quite a big problem because it sounds more like some music video instead of musical. But overall they are good and not what disappointed me the most and that was quite dreadful acting of the movies main selling stars Travolta and Walken. Travolta is cheap copy of fat Eddie Murphy while Walken is, well, vintage Walken. Both somehow end up being unfunny despite trying hard. What saved the movie were the young ones with Nikki Blonsky leading them. In the end movie is watchable, entertaining even, but in no way more than vast majority of 50-60 musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in hong kong and when the credits played at the end the group of girls sitting behind me were shocked to find out Edna was not only a man but Jonh T they had no idea very refreshing. They obviously had no idea about the history of the movie but enjoyed it enough to stay through the credits. That in my opinion makes it a hit. I saw this movie after a really bad day at work and laughed through the whole thing. I am very familiar with the original movie but I haven't had the chance to see the stage show. A smart remake of a great movie. Once you get over John in a fat suit and just decide to enjoy it is a truly enjoyable ride.

		<fullReview>and that's exactly what I'm planning on doing. I never buy movies when they first come out on DVD but this time I have no choice, I've seen the movie twice at the theater and have the soundtrack and I'll keep on listening until I'm totally sick of it! It's fun, smart, beautiful, ...I could keep going but I gave it a rating of 10 so I think you get my point.Usually I'm more of a horror movie type but when it comes to musicals I'm a total girl and this musical is great! A must see and see again.It's the ultimate feel good movie, you leave the theater with a smile and have at least one of the songs in your head for the rest of the day. I'm not going to analyze the scenes, the characters, the sets, anything, it's just this easy: be there or be square :) You'd really be missing out if you didn't go.So that's it, a fantastic movie, a must, already one of my favourite movies, one of the best movies of 2007, great music, great acting, great everything!

		<fullReview>From the minute the movie opens we are taken on the most joyous musical journey in years. And what an opening! Nikki Blonski is perfect and her opening number is brilliant. We are grabbed straight away. I doubt there has been a better opening since Maria sang about the sound of music way up in the Austrian alps all those years ago. Tracy is a great character and Nikki is perfect.I will not give the ending away but its great to see the big girls are not losers, in fact Tracey gets a big prize at the end of the film. John Travolta is very brave. He makes no attempt to copy the great Divine or Harvey Fienstein, he plays the role straight. Its a brave choice and he does it brilliantly. The duologue with the fabulous Christopher Walken will make you cry. Its beautiful. This is the best film made since Chicago. The whole cast are superb. Great eye candy in Zac Effron who is much better than he was in High School Musical. He is a much more engaging performer The real eye candy is the impossibly gorgeous and talented Elijah Kelley. He is fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you thought other musical movies such as Grease and Saturday Night Fever were great, watch out for Hairspray. Hairspray is another great Hollywood musical movie which boasts an incredible cast with the likes of Hollywood veterans such as John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken but also some other great talented actors with the likes of Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelley, Allison Janney and newcomer in a fantastic debut role Nikki Blonsky. Besides the cast/characters and the plot of the movie, the most memorable things about this movie is the soundtrack/singing and dancing. This should be put amongst the greatest musical movies of all time as well as being voted amongst the best and most entertaining movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a revision, not a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Waters's film Hairspray is such a cult classic, and one of his most mainstream films, especially after his run of shock comedies; ala Pink Flamingos. Behind all the satire and Baltimore bashing in Waters's original, there resided a commentary on racism, set behind the battle of integration and segregation. Director Adam Shankman and Co. brings the Broadway production, based upon Waters's version, with all the glitz, glamour and sparkling shimmer. Hairspray though doesn't stray into rehash territory, unlike many other remakes. While based more on the Broadway production, Hairspray is a re-envision on it's original counterpart; an element many remakes miss. Shankman's update may be Hollywoodnised, and glazed covered candy with an extra serving of sweetness, Waters's satire nowhere to be seen, yet a remainder of tongue firmly in cheek in his brief cameo. Screenwriter Leslie Dixon, while dropping all satire, has no problem sinking the teeth in with hard biting, forked tongued humour, making Hairspray a delightful treat. Along with cameos from Ricki Lake and Jerry Stiller, and homage in Tracy's final dress.As with any musical, the defining factor is the music and dance numbers. Choreographed by director Shankman; who pulls off two major feats, after a run of very ill decided, and plain awful films, constructs the most energetic and exuberant atmosphere. On Shankman's part, this is a real surprise, and a welcomed one at that. All songs hook and reel you in, right from the opening number "Good Morning Baltimore", Hairspray grabs you. All the dances are constructed and executed with such mirth and spirit, embodying the era of the early sixties, along with costumes and reconstruction of sixties Baltimore.Pelting out every tune, Hairspray has an exceptional cast. In her debut role, Nikki Blonsky shines and sits as the sweet core of this film as Tracy Turnblad. Zac Efron has charm and grace as Link. Yet this is an all round affair. Even this late in his career, John Travolta marks a career defining role as Edna. Never sending up Devine, who played Edna in the original, Travolta embodies this woman and weight, stealing every single scene he's in. And he can still sing and dance. Michelle Pfeiffer is magnificently bitchy as Velma Von Tussle and a surprise singer. Even with minimal screen time, both Christopher Walken and James Marsden mark their presence strongly. Queen Latifah hasn't been this wonderful since Chicago. Even with her few scenes, Allison Janney is a small treat.While Waters's Hairspray is endearing and the penultimate version, Shankman's new Hairspray stands solely by its self, and another fine example that the musical will always live on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so up-beat and i was never disappointed with it. There's nothing to hate about in this movie. Nikki Blonsky is amazing. I can't believe she's new to the business, she's awesome! Zac efron was great, and cute. John Travolta was fantastic(always:)). And every other character had great acting and singing skills. I think this movie is a bit better than Grease. However Grease was great too! Anyway, this movie should bring a smile to your face from start to end. It did for me and it should for you! The only sad part was when the movie was over:( I just hope the company that made hairspray won't do this: Make a sequel when there's no need for one. This is what happened in Grease. The first one was great but the second one sucked! WARNING: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HATE MUSICALS BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS MUSCIAL FUN! WHAT THE HECK, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS MOVIE EVEN IF YOU HATE MUSICALS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Hairspray is a cult classic. So when I heard a new version was to hit our screens this year, I was a little dubious. I was then informed the source material was not the original movie, but the Broadway show which draws it's inspiration from the movie.So straight away, we can throw away our preconceptions of the movie, because we know we're going to be seeing something completely different to the original.The movie opens with the fabulous "Good Morning Baltimore" performed wonderfully by the movies Tracy Turnblad, Nikky Blonsky. Ricki Lakes portrayal of Tracy is top class, so to try and top that is a challenge for sure, and Nikki accepts and succeeds brilliantly. There's a wonderfully endearing sense of naivety about Tracy, so you completely relate to her, as many of us, i'm sure, have experienced the sort of things she has.John Travolta had a lot to prove as Edna Turnbland (played originally by the late and great Divine). I thought he did an excellent job. Although it was like watching a fat Danny from grease prancing around in a dress.. but it made me smile.Queen Latifah had me shaking my booty when she stormed up for a sexy "Big, Blonde &amp; Beautiful" number. Michelle Pffiefer was perfect as the racist and down right nasty Velma Von Tussle, with the sweet Brittany Snow as her equally nasty daughter. Younger viewers familiar with the "High School Musical" craze will drool themselves into delight with Zac Efron as the teen heartthrob Link Larkin. I could go on all day about how great everyone was... Amanda Bynes.. Elijah Kelly.. Christopher Walken...The sets were magnificently camp and nostalgic. Lots of bright colours and big hair. The dance routines were energetic, and the music.. i've never been so eager to get a movies soundtrack. All the songs are so cheerful and upbeat, you can't help but smile and tap you're feet. The ending number "You Can't Stop The Beat" gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, and it's just so...happy! It's a great laugh, the musical numbers are brilliantly choreographed and pulled off, and it's just a real feel good movie. I urge you go and see this, because I'm sure that you will become addicted like me too..</fullReview>

You'll be tapping your feet from the first scene when Tracy sings Good Morning Baltimore to the very end when Little Inez wins Miss Teen Hairspray. You should go see Hairspray it is the best movie of the summer, and thats not just my opinion because Hairspray recently won a Teen Choice Award for best comedy/musical. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so we can sing a long without annoying the other people in the theater. Go see Hairspray its an amazing movie, you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really like singing, and dancing is kind of pointless to me. However, Hairspray has a lot of charm to it, even if sometimes through the movie your mind starts to wander. Allow me to throw some phrases out there so you can familiarize yourself with Hairspray: John Travolta playing a woman in a fat suit; Travolta ripping off a robe to bear "her" legs in the fat suit while dancing; and "pleasantly plump" Tracy Turnblad (Blonsky, the teenage dancing phenom) smacking her butt to the beat. Here's my stance on that: those parts are disturbing, yet the movie is so happy-go-lucky that it doesn't matter.Hairspray takes place in Baltimore, Maryland, back in the early 1960s. Racism is strong here, and so is the desire to dance. (I don't know why either, so don't ask me.) The teenagers all flock to the set of a local dance show, managed by Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeifer), an evil, manipulative woman who does all she can -which includes cheating and threats- to make sure her daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow) wins all the dancing contests. Tracy, along with her cute friend Penny (Amanda Bynes), meet up with a few other dancers and decide to make it onto Von Tussle's dancing show no matter what. However, it wont be easy with Von Tussle in charge. Enter Motormouth Maybelle (Latifah), the African-American answer to Von Tussle, except nicer and a better dancer. Maybelle is widely popular, and with some white folk on her side, she has the power to challenge Von Tussle at her own little game.Hairspray is about as happy a movie as you can find. Even when Von Tussle is at her worst, the movie remains positive. Tracy is always smiling, dancing, singing, and so on. Sometimes she can get creepy with all that cheerfulness. Looking at her and Travolta is just downright odd for two hours, especially with those always happy, clown-like expressions they wear.The music of Hairspray is all poppy and upbeat, with many of the songs having chorus voices backing them up. Some are annoying, but you cannot doubt "You Can't Stop the Beat" as being a great song. Nearly every song is catchy, which I guess could be a good or bad thing.Musicals will never be up there with other genres of movies I enjoy more. Hairspray, however, was a fun movie that was well put together. The pace was kept up via appropriate doses of humor and charm, and the movie ends perfectly with "You Can't Stop the Beat." Remember, it's always important for a movie to go out with a bang, and Hairspray does just that.Good) very catchy songs, mostly good acting Bad) Travolta ripping off the robe, some boring parts, some dancing parts</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray was the best movie I have ever seen! Based on the 1988 John Waters comedy and the 2002 Tony-Award-winning Broadway show comes the story of "pleasantly plump" teen Tracy Turnblad (newcomer Nikki Blonsky) and her fight to dance on the local TV dance show "The Corny Collins Show". But, the villainously seductive WYZT TV station manager Velma Von Tussle (brilliantly done by Michelle Pfeiffer) won't let her, and the next day at school is a Corny Collins Record Hop where Tracy takes a dance she learned in detention (which she got because another student couldn't see past her hair) called the "Peyton Place After Midnight" and danced up a storm, wowing show host Corny Collins (James Marsden) and the handsome male star of the show Link Larkin (Zac Efron). Corny puts her as the lead dancer on the show, but Velma's star daughter Amber (Brittany Snow) is really peeved and while Tracy's at a platter party with Negro Day host Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah), she calls Tracy's mother Edna (hilariously played by John Travolta) and gets her to go the platter party while Velma is out to seduce Edna's husband and Tracy's father Wilbur (Christopher Walken). I'm not going to reveal the end, but this gets an absolute A from me.</fullReview>

I had a smile on my face for 2 hrs. that felt permanent.It was a blast to just laugh out loud.The audience was filled with all ages.The 5 women in front of us got every joke and and enjoyed themselves I could tell you that and they were probably all in their 70's.I highly recommend this movie just for the dance scene between Chris Walken and Travolta was worth the price of admission. If you need to lighten the mood and feel like laughing out loud go and see this film.It was Fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big, bright, shimmering, candy cane of a musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I must address the simple and obvious fact that this film is just an outrageous, undeniable blast to watch. I had so much fun sitting there in the theatre, tapping my feat to the beat and to the irresistibly catchy tunes. I just knew that, had I been familiar with the songs before hand, I myself would have burst out in song, compulsively trumpeting the lyrics with much enjoyment. The film has a simply irresistible energy and beat to it, and the fast-paced, brass-band style numbers only add more to the already freight train pace the movie chugs along at. I had barely even noticed that the entire movie had passed and ended: It's just so engrossing and so fun, you don't even notice anymore, you just want to hear more songs and see more dance numbers. And the film more than delivers on that plane.Like Chicago, Hairspray is a throwback musical; while Moulin Rouge shakes the very foundations of the genre, the former two entries are a lot more traditional, more of a throwback to the old MGM productions, albeit with that modern flare that makes them so unique. For a sweet, sugary, innocent musical, Hairspray actually deals with some pretty major subjects, both on the external plane and on more subtle levels as well. Of course, the whole 60's setting and the plot of integration of blacks into the community and television is daring enough, but we have an overflowing barrel of sub-level messages dealing with sexuality, youth rebellion, Cold War McCarthyism and everything in-between. But ultimately, the film is about accepting those that are different. Here lies the Tim Burton connection: Although his style is quite different than that portrayed in Hairspray, Burton's films are also about outcasts, outsiders and those that are different, even though his outcomes are far more melancholy and far less sugary than Hairspray, which ultimately offers a similar story of an outcast making a big change.Not that being sugary is a bad thing ? the bubble-gum style, look and feel of Hairspray is just what makes it so special. The exaggerated costumes and hairstyles, the spacious, dollhouse sets, the wacky characterizations ? it's all a part of the fun and energy of the production.What a cast this film was blessed with. Michelle Pfeiffer still looks great as ever even at age 50; Queen Latifah, James Marsden Amanda Bynes, Allison Janney and Jerry Stiller are also always great to see. The other teen performers ? Zac Efron, Elijah Kelley, Brittany Snow and the others also do a quite admirable job But the crux, of course, lies with Nikki Blonsky. I have no idea how they found her, but for a girl of her stature (and young age) not only to have such immense talent but also such confidence, is truly admirable. And then of course, there are John Travolta and Christopher Walken, both of whom are on a whole different level than the rest of the cast and whom perform their own share of singing and dancing ? Travolta reminiscing the old Grease/Saturday Night Fever days albeit wearing a fat suit and in drag. The two share what is easily the best scene of the movie, when they perform "You're Timeless to Me".In the end, Hairspray is just a big, bright, shimmering, candy cane of a movie. With absolutely fantastic, upbeat, fast-paced and well-written musical numbers, high production value and a stupefying all-star cast behind it, Hairspray's relentless rhythm and pace make it just one bright, fun, fantastic ride from start to finish. Add to that the various period/social overtones, and you get a fun, relentlessly entertaining musical with a heart AND a brain. Kudos to all involved ? especially director Adam Shankman who, with previous credits such as Cheaper by the Dozen 2 and The Pacifier, truly surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched a lot of movies this year even though I've wanted to but I told myself that I HAVE to go watch Hairspray. I've never been to Broadway but I've eyed Hairspray ever since I spotted it on the Broadway website a couple years back (Diana DeGarmo from Idol was in the cast, too).The moment the first scene came on, I knew I had to get the DVD release as well. That's because the music is amazing. I felt that throughout the whole movie, the consistency of the quality of the music was something the creators should be proud of. The lyrics, the score, everything was amazing. And everything made sense. It all fitted really well into the context of the movie. The score had the appropriate amount of 60s flavour and completely suited the film, which was great.The cast was the next thing that I found astounding. They were perfect for their roles, especially John Travolta as Edna Turnblad (the whole pink shiny dress scene was fantastic, and so was the bit at the end where Edna danced with the Miss Teenage Hairspray girls) and Queen Latifah as Maybelle. Of course, Nikki Blonsky was amazing as Tracy and if I had to name the whole cast I would be challenging the word limit, but honestly, they were all good. Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderful as the 'villainess', extremely convincing. And I find Zac Efron's voice more pleasing to the ear in this film as compared to High School Musical.The message of the movie was very clear and I liked it - watch it for yourself to get what I mean. All in all, this is definitely one of the best movies I've watched this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musicals usually make me cringe so I wasn't prepared to like Hairspray but I did despite all the cheesiness expected in a remake of John Waters' 1988 flick! Fat but confident teen Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) goes against the flow in a non-integrated Baltimore circa 1962 after winning a coveted spot on a local TV show (ala That's Entertainment). Her dream is bigger than her mom Edna (traditionally played in drag, and John Travolta does a terrific job)'s own apprehensions and is further fueled by her dad Wilbur (Christopher Walken)'s encouragement. Walken and Travolta obviously have a grand time in their dance scenes; there should've been more of them.Tracy is all heart, likable, optimistic and confident, it isn't surprising that scheming mother-daughter tandem Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) do everything in their power to keep the camera focused on them. Pfeiffer is great to watch and only her bloodshot eyes give away her age, while Snow takes on a very similar role from her other TV show, American Dreamz.The rest of the cast is equally stellar and well thought of: Amanda Bynes succeeds in her comedic stylings as Tracy's bestfriend Penny Pingleton, James Marsden plays as refreshingly regular role as Corny Collins, Queen Latifah is luminous as Motormouth Maybelle, and Zac Efron is perfect to play rebel/lead dancer Link Larkin.Watch Hairspray if you just want to have a good time and not think. Great to watch with your parents who may remember the Broadway/film versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you loved GREASE...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...run, do not walk to see HAIRSPRAY, the dazzling and exuberant 2007 film version of the Broadway musical based on the 1988 cult classic directed by John Waters that introduced Rikki Lake to the world. This is the story of Tracy Turnblad, a wide-eyed and pleasingly plump high schooler growing up in Baltimore in the racially turbulent 1960's who finally realizes her dream of being a dancer on her favorite TV show, THE CORNY COLLINS SHOW,an "American Bandstand" type music show that extols the virtues of being young and white in America in the 60's. One day a month, the show has what they call "Negro Day" where they feature exclusively black artists and black dancers. Tracy's innocent remark that she "wishes every day was Negro Day" makes her a surprising but willing symbol for the civil rights movement in 1960's Baltimore. Director Adam Shankman has expanded the Broadway musical beautifully for the large screen and also provided the superb choreography for the toe-tapping musical numbers. This musical sucks you in right from the beginning...I found myself singing along with the characters on the screen and I didn't even know the words to the songs, that's how deliciously contagious this film is. A product of a nationwide talent search, young Nikki Blonsky makes a sparkling film debut in the role of Tracy...her fresh scrubbed enthusiasm and her clear-as-a-bell singing voice are a perfect fit with the role of Tracy. Her opening number "Good Morning Baltimore" energetically begins the story and has the audience in love with Tracy immediately. John Travolta works very hard to be believable in the role of Edna Turnblad, Tracy's introverted but loving mother, a role originated in the Waters film by transvestite Divine. No, you never completely forget that it's Travolta under all that makeup and padding, but he completely commits to the role and brings Edna vividly to life. Michelle Pfeiffer is perfection as the villianness of the piece, Velma Von Tussle, the manager of the TV station where The Corny Collins show is taped and Brittany Snow, who played the good girl in JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE, proves she can be bad as Velma's daughter and Tracy's arch enemy,Amber. Elijah Kelley (so memorable in TAKE THE LEAD) is sexy and charismatic as Seaweed, Tracy's black pal who falls for Tracy's best friend Penny (Amanda Bynes). Christopher Walken is delightful as Tracy's dad and Queen Latifah is effective as Seaweed's mom, who is the host of The Corny Collins Show on Negro Day. Mention should also be made of a brief but very funny turn by Emmy winner Allison Janney as Penny's mother and if you don't blink, you will even see a brief cameo by the original film's director, John Waters. Musical highlights include the previously mentioned "Good Morning Baltimore", "The Darker the Berry, the Sweeter the Juice" :Run and Tell That". "I Know Where I've Been" and "You Can't Stop the Beat". HAIRSPRAY is a musical with a message, but it's never preachy and the message is not delivered with a sledgehammer, but with a song and smile and some amazing dance moves. An instant classic that will motivate multiple viewings. A winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful happy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent. That's all I can say ... Like others here, this movie has put a smile from the beginning till the end of the show. Not to mention the songs are great. You just can't stop moving your feet even though you are restricted on your seat. The girl next to me was even dancing along the beat .. yeah dancing on her seat ... and she was clapping after every song of the show. That's the level of excitement this show brings. The casting is just perfect. Can't ask for more. Brilliant acting, singing and dancing. I just wish it never ends .. but ah well .. it ends at the high note anyway ... so it's well worth it. Go watch ... unless you don't like musical sort of show ... but if you love music ... you should give it a try. It'll not fail to make you smile. :D :D :D :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is a really funny film with great acting and humorous situations. If you remember the 1980's version, which by all means was good, this one is better. Rare ? rare, indeed, very rare these days! But John Travolta rocks big time in the role of Edna Turnbald. I enjoyed him very much and can only say: what a great actor. Alison Janney is great too! She steals every scene she's in! But I was happy with the whole cast and give them a 9, all of them! As for the content, well tolerance is unfortunately still something our society lacks big time. So it is a good and fun reminder that we are all worth the same, no matter how different we are. Acceptance of who we really are is something we as a society have to learn. Funny didn't we go to the moon like 40 years ago? And we still can't accept gays, lesbians, blacks, hispanics, asians and anything non-white-irish-puritan as our equals? Well this film is a great reminder that the world is not just "black and white" (this is a play of words, get it?). I prefer this film to most musicals which came out in the past few years, like Chicago, Producers, and Dreamgirls. If you're in for a funny treat, go see it. It is totally worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Hairspray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teenager Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) has a dream, and that is to join a group of hip teenagers in a dance programme on television called the Corny Collins (James Marsden) Show, especially when she has a crush on the show's heartthrob Link (Zac Efron). But as you know, despite being pleasant, blessed with a good voice and groove, possessing a wonderful never-say-die attitude and positive demeanour, television's all about glamour, and being plump means she's out of place, especially for TV producer Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer) who sees her as a constant thorn undermining her and her engineered-for-success daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).Given the loads of song, dance, music that you can shake your booty too, Hairspray is right up my alley. I can't seem to recall having seen the original 1988 movie (though the songs do ring familiar), nor watched the musical, but I guess it doesn't matter unless you want to be picky and start comparing. On its own, Hairspray has all the ingredients that continues the now-tapering tradition of Hollywood made musicals, with a surprisingly star studded cast who seem to get ample time to showcase both their dancing feet and vocal prowess. And to sum it up, it's almost perfect as an entertaining musical.But what worked into this breezy light hearted film, are serious themes on race relations and society's obsession with being thin. Hairspray's set in the 60s, where segregation in American society still reared its ugly head, where in a television programme, white folks don't mix with "coloured folks", and in a seemingly progressive move, a "Negro Day" is set aside in the programme schedule for non-Whites to perform in. Tracy Tumbald, as a character, seeks in her earnestness to break down those barriers, of course with tacit support from Corny Collins (who though may seem is doing it for the ratings?). Being sentenced to detention class also made it quite clear that Tracy's one of the rare white folk who gets sent, though her interactions with the RnB hip hoppers, proved to be fruitful. And weight obsession provided for some cheap laughs in the beginning, slowly made way to acceptance, and hey, girl power, whatever size they may be.Much has been said about John Travolta's comeback to the musical genre after his ever successful 1978 musical Grease, as Danny Zuko. Here, Travolta dons a fat suit and gets casted in the opposite sex as Tracy's mom Edna, and I think he did a great job, still showing he has the moves and the singing voice, despite it being almost 30 years coming back to the genre. While the novelty of donning the fat suit isn't new, it's still Travolta, and there are moments when you'll cringe, especially when husband Wilbur Turnblad (Christopher Walken) gets all lovey-dovey with her. Walken is fantastic as well, despite the relatively short screen time, singing and dancing (he did the music video for Fatboy Slim's Weapon of Choice) opposite Travolta and Grease (2 actually, and Batman Returns) alumni Michelle Pfeiffer.It's been a while since we last saw Pfeiffer on screen, and this year we see her taking on two roles (including this one) where she plays the antagonist (the other movie being Stardust). She still looks great though, despite her age, and wearing that red slinky dress, brings back memories of her heating up the screen with her sultry moves and singing voice way back in the Fabulous Baker Boys. Screen daughter Brittany Snow (John Tucker Must Die) does a complete evil-Barbie role here, while Amanda Bynes was a hoot as the wide eyed and naive in the cute and ditzy dumb role of Tracy's best friend Penny Pingleton, who actually goes against the grain (of the times) with her inter-racial romance.Rounding up the cast of notables include Queen Latifah and Elijah Kelly, but in a real act of reel emulating real, or real emulating reel, the discovery and coup casting will be newcomer Nikki Blonsky. Somehow she exudes this lovable charisma that you can't help but fall in love with her and her character. She bursts into the movie full of energy, just like her character did, and Hairspray provided the perfect platform for her to showcase her singing and dance talent. To sum up in two simple words, "she rocks", and her chemistry with Travolta as daughter-err-mother, was simply irresistible.Hairspray's full of wacky fun despite its tackling of serious themes, has memorable songs and great chemistry amongst the cast, who look like they all had a good time making this musical. And it's a very enjoyable movie where you feel plenty of positivity exuding when the end credits start to roll. Highly recommended, one of the best musicals to have come out of Hollywood in recent years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly fun Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see it on Monday, and it ended up being a rollicking fun bubbly romp with no strings attached, dance-a-licious from beginning to end with perfectly cast, perfectly campy, and perfectly enjoyable from beginning to end.Tracy Turnblad (played with exuberant energy by newcomer Nikki Blonsky) is an overweight teenager who loves to dance and sing in Baltimore in 1962, but whose aspirations are consistently looked down upon by her mother, Edna Turnblad, played by none other than John Travolta. I wasn't sure what to expect with this casting choice. Would it be nothing more than a silly gimmick? No, surprisingly enough. Travolta is wonderfully endearing as Edna, and not once does she come off as disgusting or unlikeable. To move along with the plot, Tracy gets cast on an American Bandstand look-a-like, the Corny Collins show, much to the chagrin of Velma Von Tussle, who would have the show consist of nothing more than perfect looking boys and girls, all of whom would preferrably under 170 pounds. She is played by the villainous vixen Michelle Pfeiffer, who hits every note (both literally and figuratively) expertly, stealing every scene she's in and relishing every snotty flip of her hair and snide comment with gusto. She absolutely abhors the idea of integration; to her, even once a month Negro day is too much - it's all about the white preppy kids. Unfortunately for her, Tracy is dead set on integration after she makes friends with the detention class, made up mostly of fun-loving dancing black kids, led by their ringleader, Elijah Kelley, who starred in Stomp the Yard and styles his ultra cool dance moves to perfectly fit the era of the film.If you haven't yet figured it out, casting is probably the strongest point of the movie. Aside the from the stellars already mentioned, several other expertly chosen stars shine. Zac Efron as the guy the girls go ga-ga for, Link Larkin, takes a clear step up from his Disney channel role and shows even further great potential as an actor. Christopher Walken as John Travolta's semi-clueless husband is subdued and just Christopher Walken-y enough to enjoy. James Marsden as Corny Collins dazzles with his effortless wide smile and corny (pun intended) attitude throughout the whole film. Queen Latifah brings charisma, respect, and attitude to her role of Motormouth Maybelle, the head of Negro Day. Nikki Blonsky, the newcomer of the bunch, is a perfect choice and she blends in wonderfully with the rest of the cast and shares great chemistry with Zac Efron. Her voice is amazing, too, which brings me to the second-best thing about this film, the music.From the rousing opening number "Good Morning, Baltimore" to the dancy, flashy, fun finale "You Can't Stop the Beat," Hairspray is first and foremost a movie that will make you want to get up out of your seat and dance in the aisles, singing along with the terrific cast. Each song is a show-stopping, fever-inducing, thrill ride that the entire cast puts all of their hearts into. The music is perfect for a 60's era, with just a touch late fifties fun. Every song is hip, fun, groovy, and easy to bob your head and tap your feet to. You may even find yourself humming along, or, as I did, unsuccessfully attempting to guess the lyrics as it went along. All this being said, however, Hairspray's near fatal-flaw is that, eventually, all the songs begin to sound alike.As I left the theater, there were only two songs that stuck in my mind. "Good Morning Baltimore" and "You're Timeless to Me", both undoubtedly the best songs of the movie. "Good Morning Baltimore" probably stuck in my head because the whole thing began with it, but it's also a sensationally amazing opening song with great camera work and acting as Tracy strolls to the bus stop on her way to school. "You're Timeless to Me" stuck in my head because it's a delightfully sweet love ballad that is brutally frank and honest about what real love is - it's not some blind ignorance of your loved one's faults and foibles - but a brutal acknowledgment of them and a love that looks past all that and to what really matters. Christopher Walken and John Travolta are also not creepy in any way, which is a remarkable accomplishment considering that Travolta is a man basically dressed in drag. It's a beautiful song, and the highlight of the movie. And though the rest of the songs are completely fun, they do blend together.Hairspray's other flaw is the black and white characters. Everybody is divided along completely equal lines, with no room for bleed over. Those who are good are squeaky clean, and those who are bad ooze evil intentions. Obviously, I'm not expecting anything of some grand drama caliber - this is called a fun romp for a reason - demands of multi-dimensional characters don't weight on it as much. But all the good guys are so unquestionably good and all the bad guys are so unquestionably bad that there were times I simply found it kind of boring. Quibbles and squabbles and problems may come and go, but at the end of the day, I just found this movie incredibly fun. I don't think I've had this much sheer uninhibited fun at the movies all summer. Sure, I've been awed at the special effects of Transformers, I've been stunned by Sunshine's spectacle, I've been entranced with Ratatouille's story,but no movie has made me just want to get up and dance more. If you ever have just a plain musical craving, Hairspray will satisfy that need like none other. It's fun, harmless, exhilarating, endearing, sweet eye, ear, and foot candy that'll have you tip tappity tapping your feet, swing swingety swinging your hips, and hip hop hoppitying all the way home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad once you get over the spectacle of John Travolta in a frock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started life as a John Waters movie, a homage, if you like, to his beloved Baltimore at the time he was growing up, full of the wonderful, (and silly), rock and roll of the period, not to mention the equally wonderful and silly dance crazes. It worked because it didn't take itself seriously, (though it dealt, brilliantly by lampooning it, with the serious subject of racial prejudice). It also served as a vehicle for the over-blown and over-sized Divine as Enda Turnblad, whose persona wasn't so much female impersonator or drag queen but a bona-fide female superstar much in the way that Dame Edna Everidge is today and it introduced us to another big-boned gal called Ricki Lake as Edna's daughter Tracy whose dreams of appearing on the Corny Collins show formed the basis of the film's plot.The film was never quite mainstream but it developed a sizable cult and was eventually turned into a very successful Broadway musical with an entirely new score by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. And now we have the film of the show and very time-warped it is, too. I think I was determined not to enjoy it from the word go, particularly after that tooth-ache inducing opening number 'Good morning. Baltimore' and one's first sight of John Travolta in a frock was seriously off-putting. (I could never figure out why, after the demise of Divine, they needed a man in drag to play the mother).However, by about three numbers in I was beginning to get hooked. The score is of the bright, breezy, catchy "Grease(y)" kind of Broadway we have been used to over the last decade or so, (more pop than show-tune and I confess not to having heard any of the songs before). The choreography is also pretty neat, (once again the film's director and choreographer are one and the same). Best of all it's got a terrific cast. Travolta's Edna is never thrust in our faces, (lucky us), but by the time he gets to strut his stuff in the big finale, he's won you over. Far better, though, as the film's uber-bitch is Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer is so good you feel almost sorry when she gets her come-uppance. It's hardly going to win her that long overdue Oscar but on the other hand the Academy could do worse. As Edna's husband Wilbur, Christopher Walken is largely wasted; (I had hoped for something of a reprise of his 'Let's Misbehave' number from "Pennies from Heaven"), and Queen Latifah isn't Ruth Brown, (Motormouth Maybelle in the Waters movie).On the other hand, you certainly don't feel short-changed by the kids. As Tracy, newcomer Nikki Blonsky can shake her tush with the best of them even if her singing voice tends towards the nasal inflections of too many pop singers today. Whether she has a career ahead of her remains to be seen, (remember Ricki Lake slimmed way down and turned to TV chat-shows), but for now she'll do very nicely. As the object of her affections Zac Efron has all the appearance of the vacuous hunk but he sings and dances well and he nails the character's fey narcissism perfectly. There is also a nice turn, if underused, by Amanda Bynes as Tracy's friend Penny. So no classic then and I still prefer the original, but it kept me smiling and once or twice I even wanted to get up and dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the stage musical yet. So I had no expectations. I have seen the John Water's film lots of times and have enjoyed it. But I have never had SSOOO much fun at a movie! From the opening "Oh oh oh..", and to the chorus "You Can't Stop the Beat" I had a blast!! That has never happened to me before - and I've seen them all... GREASE, SOUND OF MUSIC, RENT, ETC...Queen Latifah was a joy, and so was John Travolta!! It's just a FUN movie. I've been telling all my family and friends that they must see this movie.Caroline Rhea - when she had a talk show - would always mention how much she adored the musical HAIRSPRAY. If the movie's joy is close to what is onstage I can understand why she loves HAIRPRAY. I'm gonna go see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fluffy fun!!!!! Nothing more, nothing less.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Briefly, I just came back from the film after seeing it with my wife - she loved, I found it enjoyable! The downside - it dragged a bit at points, even with the dance routines. And the film left a couple of points hanging at the end - like, what happened to Tracy Turnblad and her assault on an officer charge?Joke spoilers ahead...The up-side - pretty much everything else. There are a number of throw away one-liners in the film that you'd miss if you don't pay attention. For example - when Travolta is watching TV early in the film, and says that "John Glenn is in a movie studio somewheres"; when someones says "a place of moral turpentine" as opposed to turpitude and the "ideas of March" as opposed to Ides.So, it's an enjoyable film - a little slice of 1960's ethnic attitudes and tension. It's primarily fluff - don't expect high cinema. The film ends with a positive message - albeit somewhat unrealistic - that we should accept everyone regardless of their differences. Frankly, there is no way someone who is overweight is going to wind up with someone who is popular (and I do find Nikki Blonsky to be EXTREMELY talented and attractive) - being obese myself, trust me, I know - but a nice goal to go for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very upbeat, very lively. Much better than I expected, to be honest... enjoyed the cast and surprisingly found nothing wrong with Travolta as Edna... except that he was heavily outshone by several others. Nikki Blonsky -- wow -- glued to her in every scene; she's that infectious. Amanda Bynes was a welcome sweetheart, Christopher Walken was spot-on, and most importantly, MICHELLE PFEIFFER IS AWESOME. I saw this the day after seeing Stardust (another 8-rating from me); she steals the whole movie in Stardust and plays a terrific villain here too. Such beauty (without even attempting to be 'younger' than she is -- take that, Hollywood!) and brilliant emphasis-without-over-acting on every facial gesture. Two movies out, two roles not-to-miss. Hollywood -- more Michelle Pfeiffer, please! For Hairspray, not only are the roles fun, but the music is so toe-tapping and up-tempo -- I was wrapped-up in this movie and left it humming "Can't Stop the Beat" -- who can ask for more than that from a film. Fun, oodles of fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Stopping the Beat Here with Such a Game Cast and Surprising Gravitas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of brassy, candy-coated musical to which you either give yourself entirely or not at all because there is little room in between. First, there was the edgy 1988 John Waters comedy followed years later by the sunnier 2002 Broadway musical version. I thoroughly enjoyed the elaborate stage version thanks mainly to Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman's ebullient music and sharp lyrics and stellar performances from Harvey Fierstein and Marissa Jaret Winokur as a most unlikely mother and daughter in 1962 Baltimore. That most of that high-kicking, watusi-gyrating spirit remains intact is quite an accomplishment for director Adam Shankman, whose previous track record consists of mediocre studio comedies. Adapting Mark O'Donnell's stage book, screenwriter Leslie Dixon seems equally unlikely of pulling it off. Yet, somehow they do and even bring a deeper sense of gravitas than the previous incarnations with the heavier elements of racism and segregation. Starting out his career as a dancer and choreographer, Shankman provides the energetic, in-your-face choreography that is appropriately applied here.The story centers on Tracy Turnblad, a genuinely optimistic teenager, a bouncing bundle of energy obsessed with the local Corny Collins dance show. Living in a working-class neighborhood with her agoraphobic, self-consciously plus-sized mother Edna and her congenial, novelty store-owner father Wilbur, Tracy only wants to dance on Corny's show. Standing in her way is the malevolent Velma Von Tussle, an aging beauty who owns the TV station, and her equally venal daughter Amber. Once a month, the station allows the dance show to have a co-host, blonde-tressed Motormouth Maybelle, who holds a "Negro Day" to allow the local black kids to dance on their own. These kids seem to end up in detention a lot since Tracy finds them there and learns new dance moves from them. She realizes the world would be a better place if black and white kids were able to dance together on Corny's show. This sets up the story's central conflict, which comes accompanied by romantic complications among the various characters. All of this ends with the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant and naturally a pull-all-the-stops production number.The casting is inspired. Following Divine and especially Fierstein in the cross-dressing role of Edna is no easy task, but John Travolta brings a surprising delicacy to the character. The novelty of his casting never wears off, but he also does not stoop that much to parody either. Even with a slightly garbled Baltimore accent, he is convincing as a woman who has accepted life's compromises for the sake of her family. Alternating quickly between clever and broad, Michelle Pfeiffer has a field day playing Velma, though she has precious little opportunity to show off her long dormant singing talent. As Maybelle, Queen Latifah seems to be cornering the market on musical earth-mother types and gets her shining moments on "Big Blonde and Beautiful" and especially on the gospel-flavored "I Know Where I've Been". Christopher Walken has comparatively less to do as the put-upon Wilbur, though he shows off his singing and dancing skills on his sweet pas de deux with Travolta on "(You're) Timeless to Me".For all the veteran talent on display, it's Nikki Blonsky who carries the heart of the movie as Tracy, and her sunny demeanor and "American Idol"-caliber talent keeps the story aloft. The other teens - Zac Effron as singing heartthrob Link, Amanda Bynes as devoted best friend Penny, Brittany Snow as spoiled Amber, and Elijah Kelley as Maybelle's son Seaweed - are all played with energetic adolescent brio. Complementing the principal cast are James Marsden as the perpetually smiling Corny and Allison Janney as Penny's Bible-thumping mother. Everyone is in the right spirit, and the pacing and tone are spot-on. The film's one weakness is a certain lack of energy in the camera movement around the production numbers, as Shankman's tendency is to film key dance sequences intermittently at mid-waist level. The net effect is a reduction in the overall energy level at key moments such as Travolta's Tina Turner-style turn at the end. Regardless, this is fun stuff for those open to this genre.</fullReview>

While the 1988 original was a huge disappointment, this shining new version of the Broadway adaptation of the film can only be described as excellent. The soundtrack (Nicest Kids in Town, Good Morning Baltimore, Ladie's Choice) is superb, the cast (Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, John Travolta, Queen Latifah, Christopher Walken) is amazing, the characters (Tracy Turnblad, Link Larkin, Penny Pingleton, Seaweed Stubs, Motormouth Maybelle, Corny Collins, Amber and Velma von Tussle) are believable (if not in a clich popular girl vs. unpopular girl way), and the message against prejudice of all kinds will leave many prints on your heart.

		<fullReview>I went to the film with few expectations as I have always found the film adaptations of stage musicals lack a certain energy and authenticity. I am also not a John Travolta fan so was prepared to hate the whole thing. Great surprise though, I totally enjoyed the experience, left the theatre singing the songs and have recently both purchased the soundtrack and attended a sing-along version of the movie. Loads of fun! The principals were all strong and I particularly enjoyed Chris Walken as Wilbur - he had a great comic touch. Michelle Pfeiffer is also very entertaining and plays a great villain.

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. OK, I will admit that I am a bit partial to the John Waters 1988 version, but despite a resume that includes some god-awful films ("Cheaper by the Dozen 2", "The Pacifier"), director Alan Shankman does a good job creating a fun film that doesn't lose the message.Watching this version, it is difficult to determine which is creepier: watching Travolta in drag and a fat suit or watching Divine in the original as himself. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky does a very good job in the Rikki Lake role, although her dancing seems a bit one dimensional. Michelle Pfeiffer leaves nothing in the bag, but my two favorites are Christopher Walken and Queen Latifah. Lending support are Amanda Bynes, James Marsden (Cyclops from X-Men), Brittany Snow, Elijah Kelley, Allison Janney and the rarely seen Paul Dooley.Those making appearances in both versions include Rikki Lake as a talent scout, Jerry Stiller as Mr. Pinky, and the great John Waters (fittingly enough as the town flasher). Sad to see Deborah Harry wasn't plugged in somewhere.The musical numbers are lively enough, the dancing mostly just adequate and the comedy actually quite funny at times. Watching Walken fend off Pfeiffer advances is worth the admission. Travolta plays his part a bit whiny and never really cuts loose dancing ... although he does fine with the heels on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My wife and I smiled virtually the entire movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I really, really enjoyed this movie. Rare in this day and age are the films my wife and I immediately say upon finishing "I want to see this again" -- but 'Hairspray' certainly gets scribbled onto that list of flicks.It's GREAT fun, yet certainly sporting its share of serious subject matter -- handled all but brilliantly, IMO. There's nary an 'uncomfortable' moment where the audience feels preached 'at' so to speak, or times of heavy-handedness that--in lesser skilled hands--certainly could have ruined the overall mood.The only part of the experience that took me a while to get into was the John Travolta character. I just couldn't initially get past my knowledge that it was 'him' in the role. Yet not too far in, I was more than accepting and enjoyed him. His dance moves and special charm are still abundantly in evidence. And the ACCENT he was "going for" (a question from another poster) was most definitely that of southern Ohio/West Virgina. I know it well -- having had dear friends who speak in the EXACT manner.If you love musicals, you'll adore this one. If you don't, I personally believe you'll at least LIKE it. 'Hairspray' seems to hit all the right notes, looks GREAT (and there are some fabulous looking people therein), and contains enough memorable tunes to start you humming -- even if you can't remember the words...Are there some 'telegraphed' moments? Yes, as there are in most all films of this genre. But one is smiling far too much to mind -- not to mention enjoying himself much too much for them to matter!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music and dance just keeps on coming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is going to turn out to be one of the great ones of the genre!Originally, I wasn't too excited about seeing this film, likely because I knew nothing of the story or the music and probably turned-off by the title, which I thought childish. Fortunately, I got to see a NY pre-screening and wow was I wrong. In the first 2 minutes I realized we were in for something special!This turns out to be the most enjoyable and engrossing movie musical I can remember. It has something for everyone. Definitely will be adding the DVD to my favorites collection when it comes out. The cast is incredible, with someone for every generation from kids up through Baby Boomers. They all fill a valid role and are enjoyable and likable by probably all demographics (No one seems cast simply to draw a certain fan base). The music is tremendous. No wonder the soundtrack is Billboard #1 album right now. I'm still singing to myself days later, and my 10 and 12 year olds are doing it too! The songs and choreographed action are nearly continuous, and the film editing certainly enhances the beat.It's a real feel good movie with a moral, and clever little insider jokes thrown in, too. Does everything these days need to be depressing? Bring the family... Everyone will enjoy. And incredibly, while the plot tackles some serious issues, it's done appropriately for even the kids.I've now been fortunate to see the "Sing Along" version's NY premiere, also, and see the fan base growing enthusiatically. People simply get involved in this film (almost like the old Rocky Horror Picture Show). You don't leave it behind at the theatre. Watch this one at awards time. But just see it first!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the summer! A feel good movie for everyone!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hairspray' is most likely to be the best movie of the summer because of the variety of people it attracts. Everyone from musical to non-musical fans, old to young people will love this movie. I've seen it twice already because its a whole lot of fun. Everything a movie should be. Blonsky can be a runner for an Oscar for her performance in this film. John Travolta certainly has come far from his days of wearing leather jackets and bell bottoms. He tends to grow on you after you get into the middle of the movie. I can't resist to say how amazed I was by the entire cast. Zac Efron, Elijah Kelley, and James Marsden are excellent on film. Blonsky along with Amanda Bynes, Brittany Snow, Taylor Parks are fantastic. Christopher Walken looks as if he was made to play the role of Tracey's dad because of his easy going style of acting. Queen Latifah may have a great voice and she proved it after being in the movie 'Chicago', but in this movie...she took it a step further with her vocal performance and vocal performance only. I still feel she didn't bring anything different. Michelle Pfeiffer was the complete opposite of Latifah. The acting was excellent, but the singing was the worst in the film. Most likely not an Oscar contender but it's still a wonderful movie and Nikki Blonsky is a joy to watch on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is superb! The songs are great (probably cos I already knew them), Niki was excellent - same with Zac also. I much prefer Mary Bond Davis (Maybelle Motormouth in the Broadway Production) but Latifah did a good job. It seems as tho they worked around her character to make her suit it. Mary's voice is much stronger. But the one who takes the cake is John Travolta. He will leave you laughing throughout the whole thing.So far everyone I know that has seen it enjoys "You can't stop the beat", but i absolutely love the new songs that they made for the movie - especially "The new girl in town". I didn't enjoy the snippets and songs on YouTube and had to place a comment as I thought they butchered the songs, but once I saw the movie it was well played!By far the musical to date. 20 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw "Hairspray" yesterday and I already want to see it again! Ran out and bought the soundtrack as soon as I left the theatre!! The performances by Nicole Blonsky, Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelly, James Marsden, Queen Latifah and the rest of the very talented cast were simply amazing!! Haven't seen Hairspray on Broadway, but the producers couldn't have picked a better Tracy than Nicole. And to think that she was working at Cold Stone Creamery before this!! On the "Today Show" they showed a clip of her finding out about getting the part when she was at work and she was so excited. So if you want to go see a fun movie with a really great message about just being yourself and reaching for your dreams, go see "Hairspray!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for the dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts out wonderfully energetic and funny (Water's cameo is perfect), the opening television dance sequences soaring it to a level of fun that many people still laude on the film "Grease". Unfortunately, when the film decides to konk the audience over the head with its "message" in an unbelievably heavy manner, bereft of all humor, the film takes a misstep. Which is too bad, as there is a lot of talent on display here. Travolta, (the reason many audiences who wouldn't normally rush to a John Water's-inspired film are seeing this) surprisingly doesn't have as much fun with the role as one might expect (did that photog'd male to male airplane kiss make him scared to go too far?) But he's entertaining, though not nearly the centerpiece I think many thought he would be in this film. And frankly, his skills aren't as strong as his "Pulp Fiction" fans may think: his character voice isn't maintained 100% throughout the film, and there are moments where he sounds more like...well...like Travolta. It would have been a coup to have Olivia Newton-John playing against type too as the monster bitch portrayed by Pfeifer (I wonder if that occurred to them) who per usual, though camping it up with vicious stares and grins, is still believable and strong. But it's really the younger cast who takes the film, and inspired moments like a singing photo performing a duet. And the dance is great, though I would have liked more. Cutting away from it too much is a disservice to the film.</fullReview>

But to my surprise last week after going to see it at the cinema, I felt huge relief.The soundtrack for the film is great and the lyrics are cleverly filled with comedy and relevancy to the plot. The cast were definitely better than the original. The newcomer Nicky Blonsky did Ricky Lake justice and Travolta replacing Devine was perfect.This film may seem a little 'camp' but contains, and tells, a great moral and ethical story about race and acceptance and portrays the attitudes of the 1960s brilliantly. A great watch for children and families and also to anyone looking for a good satirical musical.mikey</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The average John Waters movie about segregation in Baltimore is turned into an average musical. The plot is a very simplistic look at race issues. Blonsky brings a lot of enthusiasm to the role of the fat girl who identifies with the plight of the black people. However, the characters are caricatures, with only Walken coming across as someone resembling a real person. Putting Travolta in drag is neither funny nor touching. Given the simple plot and cartoony characters, the film must rely on the musical numbers for entertainment value. The songs are uneven and the dancing is nothing to write home about. All in all, the film is entertaining if forgettable.</fullReview>

The whole movie was fantastic, i was not disappointed, i've seen it 2 times in the theaters already, i could see it 12 times and not be bored. The whole cast was excellent, John Travolta was hysterical as a woman, James Mardsen was good as Corny Collins, Elijah Kelley was perfect as Seaweed, Zac Efron was superb as Link, Michelle Pheifer did a fine job playing a mean person, Amanda Bynes was funny as heck in it, Queen Latifah was perfect as Motormouth Maybelle, Christopher Walken was good as Wilbur, &amp; of course Nikki Blonsky stole the show she was excellent as Tracy, she's adorable. I definitely give this movie 10 out of 10.This movie i predict will get nominated for academy awards, i really hope it does because the movie deserves it. Especially for Best Picture &amp; Best Supporting Actress for Nikki Blonsky. This is the greatest Muscical of All Time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pleasantly plump teenager Tracy Turnblad and her best friend Penny Pingleton audition to be on The Corny Collins Show and Tracy wins. But when scheming Amber Von Tussle and her mother plot to destroy Tracy, it turns to chaos.This must be one of the happiest summer movies this year, if not the happiest. From beginning to end, this is like Happy Feet times ten. Yes, it'll make your feet stomp. Yes, you are going to want to shake through the rhythmic songs. And yes, it'll put a huge smile on your face.This film is extremely satisfying. From all the summer disappointments this year, this is one of the few surprises. It is one of the best movies this year! The look of it is fantastic, giving it a realistic look. Let me give another look on the film: It is like Rent, but the opposite. It is not depressing. It won't make you cry.This one hit it out of the ball park. It's fresh and original on the take of musicals. It doesn't need fancy camera works to give the pizazz look. The musical songs are great and the humor will make you laugh out loud or chuckle.If you are human, Nikki Blonsky will surly make you smile because of how happy she is. She gives a great performance. As for John Travolta, he actually gives a good performance in drag and it's not like he's playing a woman in a man's role but he actually tries to play a woman. Queen Latifah plays wonderfully in her role, as usual and Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very evil role. As for the entire cast, it is beautiful! This movie is not trying to be a big "message" movie, shoving it in your face. Everything was subtle or sappy in any way. Even though you wouldn't expect this to be a movie that takes things seriously like the racism problem, you'll like it.I don't see this winning Oscars but it sure is better than Chicago, Phantom of the Opera, and Rent. It's just simple and you'll have a lot of fun when you go and watch it. The humor is pitch perfect and it's better than any other summer movie out today. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summer of Hairspray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of original-recipe Hairspray, I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this one as much, for three reasons: 1) Zac Efron 2) John Travolta 3) the unknown Nikki Blonsky. However, I walked away from my first (and second!) viewings a true fan of all three actors, and I became totally enamored of Shankman's vision of John Water's classic story. Nikki Blonsky is perfection personified as Tracy Turnblad, the zaftig yet confident heroine who not only instigates social change and proves that dreams can come true, she gets the cute guy in the end. She is absolutely stunning. Zac Efron really surprised me by fully expressing his character's short developmental arc. His natural chemistry with Nikki Blonsky rounded out what was unfortunately a short-shrifted romantic journey for Tracy and Link. Efron really needs to get away from Disney to realize his full potential.But the real surprise was Travolta, who nailed the part of an insecure, overweight housewife who needed to rediscover herself again. While I never forgot it was Travolta on screen, he portrayed Edna Turnblad with such realism that I not only sympathized with her, I could relate to her as well.Other casting gems were Elijah Kelley as Seaweed (the best showman of the performers) and James Marsden as Corny Collins. Their performances are not to be missed and both men were brilliant. Director Adam Shankman has truly created a fun, infectiously happy movie. If he only makes musicals for the rest of his life I'll be thrilled. And I'll go see every one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the actual show on Broadway, as well as locally, I definitely went into the movie as a tough critic. However, the cast really pulled off the show very well! I wanted to stand up and dance for a couple of the numbers, which is pretty surprising, because usually movies don't make me feel much emotion.The weakest point in the cast was definitely Amanda Bynes. Her acting was okay, but her singing was awful. "Without Love" was ruined. =( I'm guessing she's the reason that they cut "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now", as well. I've heard that the actress playing Amber cannot sing well, either. John Travolta did well, however took Edna in a direction that I didn't really like. =/ I'm just too used to seeing Edna as a cross-dresser with a raspy voice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hairspray" is one of the most upbeat and energized musical I have ever seen. As a big fan of movies such as "Grease" and "Chicago", this movie definitely had the most energy.With such a teen based cast including Zac Efron, I was afraid it would be a little too cheesy and childish for my liking. As to my surprise the movie was great. The dancing and the songs suck you in right from the beginning and keep your attention throughout the film. The massive amounts of colour (costumes, sets etc.) keeps your eyes wide open and your mouth smiling from cheek to cheek.The only slight complaint I will make is that, although they were meaningful and went with the plot, the slow songs seemed to bring the mood down. Other than that great movie for the whole family to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT. I went to see Hairspray in theaters and it was AMAZING. I have never seen a movie that even though I had never seen the play transfered play to movie perfectly. Unlike other Broadway adaptations like Rent which was a great watch but really made the movie a movie instead an adaption of a play because they used things that could only be used in a movie while Hairspray made the movie feel like a play and did not do anything major that you could not recreate on a stage. The sets were B-E-A-UTIFUL and it really made it feel like the 50's. The acting was wonderful too Allison Janney made me laugh every time, Nikki Blonsky was perfect and has now made a good name for herself in my book, Zac Efron who I had marked down as stay far away contaminated with High School Musical was perfect, John Travolta amazed me with his wonderful comeback after his not so great run in Wild Hogs, Christopher Walken can do anything, Michelle Pfeiffer was a perfect Velma Von Tussle and actually scared me, and Queen Latifah is always good. I will own this movie the day it comes out. My only con to this movie is Amanda Byes performance I did not see any of her comedic talent and her part could have been played by anyone I was just hoping she would bring some more spunk to it.</fullReview>

Not only was this movie hilarious but it was also touching at times, and even though a way out, corny musical also managed to feel very real at the same time.It goes without saying that John Travolta was superb as Edna and Michelle Pfieffer (however the hell you spell it!) was excellent, but Nikki Blonski stole the show, or movie as it were, her voice is out of this world, it's strong, smooth and i could quite happily listen to her blasting out "Good Morning Baltimore" all day long.The costumes, the set and the story were exciting, colourful and down right perfect, i really have never seen a movie as flawless as this, i think the fact that i've seen it three times already when it's not even been open for a week says it all! On all three performances the film has ended with a round of applause (and no it wasn't just me being a geek!) and has been completely sold out at my local cinema.Well done to everyone involved, this is a must-see, feel good hit and will have a long and happy life ahead of it, as i hope so will Nikki Blonski.</fullReview>

When Tracy gets a part on the Corny Collins Show, she realizes there's something not right, segregation.

My opinion of Zac Effron changed dramatically from his performance in "Hairspray". Amanda Bynes' character was the heart of the movie's teenage glory. But if one person had to be singled out, it would be John Travolta, no questions asked. The character of Edna Turnblad is traditionally played by a man and has always been a big laugh for the audience. Travolta played the character so well you almost forgot he was a man, (I don't know if that's a good thing or not)! I never stopped smiling while watching "Hairspray". In short: Go see it now! Forget all those other movies and "Welcome the 60's!" I'm going a second time as soon as I have the time!</fullReview>

Classics like that don't come along of-fine. When they do you have to see it.

		<shortDescription>Hairspray Drives Racial Integration in Sixties Baltimore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is an overweight four foot ten high school girl with a dream: to star on a Baltimore afternoon teen dance show of 1962, the Corny Collins Show.A blend of Rock 'N Roll High School , Grease and the Civil Rights Movement, Hairspray's art direction is a big part of its success.Kinky casting including John Travolta in drag as Tracy's inflated laundress of a Mom Edna, highlight this small film. Michele Pfeiffer is Velma Von Tussle, a former Miss Baltimore, and a defender of the white status quo. Mother and daughter Amber (Britney Snow) are in a continual battle with Collins (James Marsden): the daughter to get her image in front of the camera, and Velma to steer the show in the whitest, blandest direction. When Tracy comes late to class, she is sent to detention, where she finds all the black kids who appear on Negro Day on Corny's show, practicing steps in detention. They soon learn that Tracy is a talented dancer.The production numbers on the Collins show are funny, lyrical and a send-up of early sixties teen fashion, song styles and high school vapidity. Guys are wearing tight shirts pants that don't quite reach their shoes, revealing white socks. Women are mostly in control of the movie discussion. This is a chick flick first. I was one of two males with 13 young women at the 9:55 p.m. showing.Many of the performers on the show attend high school with Tracy, like Link Larkin (Zac Efron), who like everyone on the show, lacquers his pompadour with hairspray. Even a spit curl that hangs loosely from the pomp over his brow has had the life sprayed out of it. The hair on all the white dancers on the show is ludicrously glue-like, but that's nothing compared to the grotesque makeup showing every possible wrinkle on the parent types like Tracy's Dad Wilbur Turnblad (ChristopherWalken), a pathetic loser who peddles jokes and sight gags at a small Baltimore novelty shop. Paul Dooley as Mr. Spitzer, WXYT-TV's owner, looks like a zombie, with his deadly makeup, as does Walken, with his wrinkled face and obvious bad wig. Jerry Stiller as owner of a store for Big Girl Fashions, has little more than a cameo here, but his makeup and costume, like Dooley's and Walken's makeup and their carnival-like clothes, suggest the living dead. In opening scenes, Walken has one of those thin summer shirts of the fifties through which you can see the hung shouldered white undershirt below. Travolta's makeup makes him look grotesquely large playing Edna. Even Michele Pfeifer is showing veins in the neck. The makeup message is that adults are old and out of touch.Their kids, by contrast, are fresh-faced and dressed in the most laughable high school and rock 'n roll costumes of the period. The makeup and clothes of Link Larkin are modeled on the look of Frankie Avalon and Fabian. He even wears that slinky thin suit to school. Its the continental look: no belt. Link is a Johnny One-Note but he is a winning Johnny One-Note.High school itself is given short shrift, but it is telling. In the teachers lounge, instructors are engulfed in cigarette smoke wearing the dullest suits and hairdos imaginable. The message here is that only the kids know anything.Tracy and a friend show up to audition as dancers , but are driven off the show by Velma and the intensely white regular dancers including Alma. Tracey manages to break onto the show anyway after being tipped to dance natural by the black kids who appear on Negro Day on the Collins show, once a week.If the parents are zombies, the white kids mostly dull pastel with the exception of Tracy, the black performers are the most colorful lively performers in the movie. The message: The lively blacks are not getting their just due in American high school society and on local TV dance shows. Corny's Negro Day co-host Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) is told by station manager Velma Von Tussle that Negro Day has been canceled. Tracy and her mother advise Maybelle and the black kids who are still wearing heavily processed conked hairdos, to march on WXYT-TV the next day. Tracy, risking her newfound stardom, marches too, and becomes a fugitive when she touches the head cop trying to stop the march, and is charged with obstructing justice.Maybelle and the black kids, with Tracy and her Mom and Dad, decide to sneak their way onto the show to compete in the annual best dancer contest, which is decided by phone-in polling. A little black girl wins. Velma's daughter Alma embarrasses herself on the show. Corny Collins declares his show officially integrated and featuring black dancers every day of the week, their processed hair notwithstanding. Seaweed, a black dancer reminiscent of the Jackie Wilson of the Sixties who did a death-defying knee slide on Dick Clark's dance show, kisses the white Penny Pingleton, confirming that integration is now official.Hairspray the musical has made changes in the original Waters film, improving it. Performances are extraordinary, except for Walken and Queen Latifah. Walken is stiff for the dance scenes with his wife Edna, though he is a professional Broadway dancer. He appears to have a permanently stiff neck. The Hip-Hop Latifah seems out of place in Hairspray. Allison Janey as Penny Pingleton's puritan Mom, Prudy Pingleton gets all the funniest lines. The new movie is funny, somewhat original and winning. I cannot remember for the life of me what the original Hairspray was about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit I am a bit of a campy musical junkie (Crybaby, Rocky Horror, etc), but this movie has been a favorite of mine since it came out and my awe and enthusiasm for it has not diminished at *all* over the years!The choices for the cast are so amazingly fitting. There are so many familiar faces, as well as some newcomers that you can't help but fall in love with. The music and choreography are SO much fun! I just can't get enough!Though the movie has an upbeat and bouncy feel throughout, it does address what was a major problem in America at the time with passion, coming from the perspective of an optimistic, albeit naive, teenager who can't understand why it's an issue in the first place and is determined to do what she can to try to change it. The finale always gives me goosebumps!It's easily the feel good movie in the history of movies! I wouldn't change a thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperately wants to be a hit on the scale of "Blues Brothers" but just does not have the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of things to enjoy in this; Michelle Pfeiffer would be worth watching reading the telephone directory, Alison Janney's "mom from Hell" is hilarious, John Travolta's drag act is amazing ("from 'Saturday Night Fever' to this???"), much of the singing (especially from Queen Latifah) is superb and, dominating everything, of course, is the energy-filled,"100% commitment" performance by Nikki Blonsky in the lead. Despite all of this, however, it does not really satisfy. Apart from the "right on"/PC message (1980s/90s hindsight of how every teenager should have behaved and thought in 1960), the main problem is that, as a musical, it just does not stack up and I at least could not recall a single song or tune about half an hour after it had finished beyond the chorus line of "Good morning, Baltimore". Shame, as a lot of talent, effort and devotion went into the making of this movie and it deserves to be better, but ends up, in my view, just being a 'one off' viewing experience (for the reasons mentioned right at the beginning) and not at all memorable as a viewing AND listening experience. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Ricki Lake version of this in my childhood and was extremely excited to see this one. I really was impressed with the cast and thought, even though I had not heard of Nikki (the lead), surely they would not place someone in this position that wasn't going to be stellar. Huh, well you win some you lose some Hollywood. I can say that without a doubt she was awful. Her voice was whiny and young, she really had no acting capabilities that I saw. Really I feel as though all her co-stars had to carry her through the film. I was sitting in the theater thinking, where did the casting director go wrong? Did he/she just look for the fattest, shortest youngest girl he/she could find? Because if so, then he/she succeeded, this is definitely a short, fat girl who looked as though she was still in middle school while her co-stars were in high school. Furthermore, I have heard this actress (as I use the term loosely) says that people should feel comfortable with themselves at any weight. Well my dear, I wholeheartedly agree, one should feel comfortable with themselves, but one should also live healthy as well, ie: exercise and healthy foods. I don't mean anorexia, but healthy. Honestly, this girl doesn't look healthy. But that is what this specific character is stereotyped for in this film. But that also does not mean there are not a plethora of girls that fit that description who have actual talent. In essence I feel as though if you are a primary character in a film you should be able to act and sing, if the part calls for it, she can do neither, which lead me to the low score on this movie. Sadly, had they cast someone else it probably would have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love John Waters But Really Disliked This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Corny Collins Show is all the rage among high school girls, especially in Tracy's house. After meeting up with the "negro" kids, she is encouraged to try out for the show. Using her newly acquired dance moves, she's accepted. Things go poorly, however, when Tracy's popularity grows and she tries to persuade the show to integrate.I guess I really don't get this movie. I never saw the original with Ricki Lake, but what is the point of this? The songs aren't particularly memorable or good, John Travolta's role as an older woman is pathetic, and the rest of the cast is just alright. Christopher Walken does a fine job as usual and Amanda Bynes is sexy, but I didn't really see anything that made this film sustainable.Now, aside from the bad songs, what's the point of this movie? The plot focuses on integration in the early 1960s... but there's no historical message here, and the moral of the story is that blacks and whites can live together in harmony. In today's world, this lesson is just old news. Sure, racism still exists... but the fact this movie can exist and have an interracial kiss and not be enough to even raise eyebrows shows how pointless the point is.I have no idea why you would watch this. I watched it on a DVD imported from Iraq that was bootlegged, complete with people laughing at scenes that weren't funny. I'm glad it came bootlegged from Iraq, because had the person who showed it to me actually purchased said film, it would have been a waste of cash. I mean, again, Amanda Bynes is hot (pigtails and lollipop), but that's this film's only redeeming quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hairspray (2007) *** (out of 4) Remake of John Waters' 1988 cult favorite has Nikki Blonsky playing the overweight teenager who has dreams of being on a local TV dance show. I'm really not sure if a remake that followed the original so closely was actually needed but if it had to be done then this film does justice to the original by adding some great talent and some wonderful music. I think the film runs a good ten or fifteen minutes too long so it should have been trimmed but other than that there's a lot of great stuff here to enjoy. The songs are mostly excellent and all of them perfectly capture the music that would really have been playing in 1962. Blonsky steals the show with her highly energetic performance, which is delightful to watch from start to finish. Her singing voice is also very good and she brings a lot of charm to her songs. The supporting cast is great and you know you're in for a good time when you have Christopher Walken married to a John Travolta in drag. Both actors do a very good job and even Travolta who gets to spoof his Pulp Fiction dance in one scene. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as the racist at the cable station and Amanda Bynes is very good as her daughter. Even Queen Latifah is very good in her role as Motormouth Maybelle. The cameo's from the films original members were also a lot of especially Waters' scene, which is a highlight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2007!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2007 was a year to remember in movies with Martin Scorsese winning the best director Oscar for "The Departed," but it was also a year for when blockbuster movies tackled one another for the gold of box-office glory. With movies involving a talking rat (Ratatouille) making a difference in people's lives, threequels that didn't make the cut as their predecessors (Shrek 3, Spider-Man 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3), Matt Damon proving that three is a magic number (Ocean's 13 and Bourne Ultimatum); pregnancy being in every woman's mind (Knocked Up, Bella, Juno, and Waitress), and a killer to make you want to haunt people (No Country For Old Men). Somehow with 2007, there was a one movie that could make you sing and smile without having to hurt anyone.Nikki Blonsky plays the role of Tracy Turnblad who not only dreams of getting her teen idol, Link Larkin (Zac Efron), but at the same time wants to fight segregation to allow Negro Day to take place everyday rather than once a week. Nikki was born to play Tracy in which she carries the attitude of every spunky teen girl that wants to make a difference. John Travolta is a riot as Tracy's mother, Edna, who not only dressed in make up and a wig but also should get an Oscar nomination for his performance. The film also stars James Marsden as the corky host Corny Collins who shines like a game show host; Queen Latifah leaves comedy behind and shows how much of a great actress and singer she is as Motormouth Maybelle. Christopher Walken proves that no matter the situation, he can be both funny and charismatic as Wilbur, Edna's husband; Michelle Pfeiffer is a delight as the sexy Velma Von Tussle who will do anything to get her daughter as Ms. Teen Hairspray.The soundtrack is dynamite for which it has everything from tears and laughter to make you wanna shimmy shake.Hairspray is like this year's Transformers for which both franchises came out in the 1980's and I wanted to see why my family liked both the original experiences. With this movie, it made me laugh and smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little less spray, too stiff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Shankman directs and choreographs this adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, "Hairspray" of the same title. Starring newcomer Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad a young teenager looking to get a spot on her favorite local dance show. Along the way she changes her 1962 Baltimore city and opens their eyes to the beauty of desegregation. Along with a star-studded cast ranging from Academy Award nominees John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah, winner Christopher Walken, and a slew of teeny-bopper talent such as Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelley and more; this is a fun hearted family film.Blonsky tackles her role with ease and puts forth a vivacious and entertaining performance in the role of Tracy. Completely engaging with the audience and breaking through all the talent of this film, Blonsky is a talent to watch in the coming years.As critics go crazy for John Travolta's performance as Edna Turnblad originally played by Harvey Fierstein, I find him incredibly miscast and even more distracting from the picture. This might be one of the worst performances of the year in my humble opinion. Travolta hasn't been more annoying and even less talented in previous roles.Pfeiffer is a marvel in her musical numbers and turns in a very unique and lively villainous performance. Pfeiffer has been off the radar for a couple of years and its good to see the veteran actress still working and turning in good work.Latifah is excellent in her "Matron Mama-like" role. Walken is simple and considerate of the audience and is perfectly cast in his role as Wilbur. James Marsden and Elijah Kelley are the best of the supporting players as they stand out in the crowd of many loud and lively singers and dancers.Amanda Bynes is disappointing in her turn as Penny, a role that suited her perfectly. Efron is normal as ever in his element of musical films. Brittany Snow as Amber is comedic brilliance in her whiny girl role. Allison Janney is brief but equally effective as anyone else.Hairspray is loud with color and set and fun in artistry and entertainment but alas, this is no Chicago, Moulin Rouge! or anything of those sorts. It's fun and fun it shall remain, just like the Broadway show.Grade: ***/****</fullReview>

I wasn't too excited about it until the movie actually started.It captivated me within the first thirty minutes, and then it got deeper and deeper as it went along. I love the message of the film, that everyone should get a fair chance.The actors were fantastic. Nikki Blonsky will def. get more roles in the future and John Travolta did great as a woman.I recommend this to anyone and everyone. This movie is for EVERYONE. You can watch it with the entire family too, and that isn't possible with most musicals. It makes you laugh and cry and just feel good! Sure, there are a few slow parts, but the songs keep you singing and dancing after the credits roll. 4 STARS! A ++!</fullReview>

I was blown away by John Travolta, who was brilliant and cracked me up every time he came on screen, also by Queen Latifah who looked like she was born to sing and dance. Christopher Walken in a role unlike anything he has EVER done before, acted beautifully in some moving scenes among the hilarity.

		<fullReview>I said in a previous review of High School Musical that musicals were dead. But I also said that I would change my mind about that if a new musical came about.Hairspray has not only changed my mind, it blew my mind!The energetic style of the movie picks up right at the beginning minutes with a Good Morning Baltimore belted out by the lovable Tracy Turnblad (played by Nikki Blonsky in her film debut who has a promising career ahead of her!) and doesn't let up even for the end credits.The standout performance is easily John Travolta (as you've never seen him before!!) who was ROBBED of an Oscar nomination. Oh hell, the whole cast was just brilliant.Hairspray almost explodes with amazing sets, costumes and just so much colour. And I can guarantee you will leave with a big cheesy grin on your face.If you didn't get to see it in theatre, grab it on DVD! Or however you see it, don't miss Hairspray.Over all rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this movie with preconceived and somewhat prejudicial feelings about John Travolta taking on a role that was originally conceived and played by an iconic drag queen, Divine. It seemed offensive and hypocritical that an acolyte of the Church of Scientology, known for their anti-homosexual sentiments, would take on a role that had only been played by gay men. The movie was pretty good, the music was great, and Nikki Blonsky is a miracle of casting. She sings, dances, and acts like no one in recent memory. I hope that there are more roles featuring her, because she is the real reason to see the movie.John Travolta in the role of Edna Turnblad is disturbing for many reasons other than the one mentioned. He really overacts (trying to emote through the latex prosthetics may be the reason), and also seems to think that a weird accent, fey gestures, and a furrowed brow convey femininity. In every scene. With no other emotions attempted. His one-note performance became tedious and I started to dread the scenes he was in. What ever happened to the actor who was so good in Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction? Michelle Pfeiffer played Velma with just the right spark of malice, and Christopher Walken is always fun to watch.That being said, the homage paid to the original movie, with John Waters, Jerry Stiller, and Ricki Lake making brief appearances was really gratifying (though John Waters and Ricki Lake had non-speaking parts). Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, but if you want to see a musical, rent Dreamgirls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the musical, of course I was jumping up and down when I heard there would be a Hairspray movie. I saw this the day it came out and was not pleased. Here were the faults for me: John Travolta- I'm sorry but Divine would be rolling in his grave if he saw him in this. Also, Harvey Firestein was amazing on Broadway and no one can replace either of them.Removal of the jail scenes- The movie was not the same without the jail scenes. The "Without Love" scene was completely ruined because Link didn't break Tracy out of jail. I'm sorry but Link singing to a picture? Great directing, Mr. Shankman. Which brings us to the next fault.Adam Shankman's poor direction- I'm surprised John Waters was proud of this movie. Adam Shankman, to me, seemed to really suck at this direction and the screenplay was absolutely horrible.The character of Amber- They removed both of her biggest songs (Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now and Cooties) and replaced it with The New Girl in Town where she doesn't sing that much. However, I did like Brittany Snow's portrayal of her.The songs- Did anyone notice that almost every song was changed in some way? I like things the way they should be and the songs were not what they should have been.It is fine for family, and it is very fun, however, if you are a fan of the original movie or the musical, then you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zac Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A musical is by definition a celebration of song and dance. This film does both, in this stunning romp of a musical, set in the gritty city of Baltimore in 1962, before integration of the races is completed there.Zac Efron is the gritty Elvis-like teen idol crush for Nikki Blonsky and one of the stars of her favorite black and white television show. In fact, Nikki and her girlfriend never miss the Corny Collins teen dance show, hosted by handsome James Marsden, similar to Dick Clark's American Bandstand. The Corny Collins show has several peculiarities, however. These include, of course, hairspray as its advertising sponsor, a token "Negro Day," in which the local black population shows off their fascinating dance moves, and a prejudiced and vain former Miss Baltimore producer, hysterically portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer. But, Nikki is obsessed with the dance show, even though she and her mother John Travolta, are "two tons of fun" in the weight department and resemble the dancing hippos of Fantasia, most of the time, as they mimic the moves they see on TV.So, Nikki goes to detention at her high school and learns how to dance in the "Negro Day" way from the blacks also in detention at her already integrated high school. And, Nikki gets her chance to get on the television show. It goes from there, a regular Elvis story, in which a child of the lower classes makes it big in show business and wins the affection of her love interest.Along the way, we meet fetching portrayals by Queen Latifah of a local civil rights leader and by Christopher Walken of Nikki's affectionate father. If you love song and dance and vivid portrayals of the early 1960s, with all its growing pains and celebrations, you will not just like, but adore "Hairspray."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original movie and the musical in Seattle while they were still tweaking it for Broadway.I'm not as enamored of the changes this movie made to the Broadway storyline, as I believe they were put in to focus more of the movie on Travolta.Strangely, in all 3 productions, the only Edna that seemed played by a drag queen was Travolta's. Divine and Firestein(spelling?) both played Edna as a woman rather than a caricature. Travolta's Edna is a caricature so it comes off as much more fake than either of the two preceding actors that have played that role. This Edna is more worried about what the world thinks of her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to see this movie last week with my friend but it was sold out for the showing we went for so we ended up seeing I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry instead (I gave that movie 6 stars for some good humor and mostly positive message concerning gays though I was turned off by some of the homophobia and Rob Schneider's Asian stereotyped character). Having seen Hairspray just hours ago, I have to say: This is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen this year so far! Everyone in this cast deserves praise: John Travolta (mostly successful as Edna Turnblad with her swaying hips and speaking voice, though it's obviously a male doing the singing on the songs. Dosen't matter, it's still enjoyable), Michelle Pfeiffer (perfect as the ice-cold beauty who can't let go of her past), Christopher Walken (always good to see him dance, which I've enjoyed since watching him on "Saturday Night Live"), Zac Efron, James Marsden (a hoot as Corny Collins and now the second X-Man-after Hugh Jackman-who has great vocals), Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelley, Queen Latifah (Loved her in Chicago, love her here), Brittany Snow (perfect contrast from one '60s dance role of Meg Pryor on "American Dreams" to here as Amber Von Tussle), Allison Janney, and, in her very first performance on film, Nikki Blondsky as social crusading optimistic dancer Tracy Turnblad. From "Good Morning Baltimore" to "You Can't Stop the Beat", the music never stops completely and it keeps the energy going even through something as serious as a protest march which is handled well by Queen Latifah and her number ("I Know Where I've Been") here. Both my friend and I enjoyed this movie so much, we both rated it a 9. P.S. Loved the cameos by original movie Hairspray participants Jerry Stiller, Rikki Lake, and, especially, original writer/director John Waters.</fullReview>

Not something you see everyday. The whole cast was great! John Travolta was a laugh riot! Seeing him as Edna was a bit weird at first but I got over that pretty quickly.

		<shortDescription>Hairspray: Big, surprising and worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been a summer of very good movies. Personally, I loved some movies and some ones were not so good. But now I will like to talk about Hairspray. This one is totally worth it, very good acting, and of course an excellent production, choreography and music. First, the cast was amazing, and the acting was outstanding; each one did a really good job. For example, John Travolta (Edna Turnblad) was incredible funny, he really catch his character. I was a little afraid in how Travolta was going to take alive this feminine character; but he did it, amazing, funny, and totally hilarious. Queen Latifah (Motormouth Maybelle) did a really good job too with her inspirational character, Amanda Bynes (Penny Pingleton) acted very well, and Nicole Blonsky (Tracy Turnblad) was totally surprising and inspiring. Meanwhile, Michelle Pfeiffer (Velma Von Tussle), Christopher Walken (Wilbur Turnblad), Elijah Kelley (Seaweed) and Zac Efron (Link Larkin) brought to the movie very good elements with their amazing talent.Second, the direction by Adam Shankman was totally brilliant; he brought so much fun to the movie with this unique story. The original music by Marc Shaiman was very contagious and the set decorator, costume designer and the makeup department brought back the 60's in a highlighted and fantastic way. The choreography was extraordinary and each actor surprised me in how they danced and singed in this fantastic family movie. Finally, I really loved this movie and everyone in the theater left saying "what a good movie!", laughing and commenting their favorite scene. I recommend it to everyone because it is very funny, surprising, and brings a really nice message. If you don't like musicals give a chance to this movie because is really worth it. The visuals, music, choreography and characters transport you back to the 60's and makes you part of the musical giving you the possibility to think about your dreams without people judging how big or colorful it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as Good as the MUSICAL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the musical on Broadway when I was in the 8th grade with my class. I'm a junior in high school now- even four years later it was a treat to see. When I saw the play I was so impressed. Hairspray was the musical that got me hooked on musicals. I followed the news about the play and listened to the soundtrack at least once a month religiously. When I found out that this was being made into a musical I was ecstatic. A big group of friends that I originally saw it with came and saw it with me- we sang the whole time. We all agreed unanimously that it is just as great as the musical. The new songs "Ladies Choice", "New Girl in Town", "Come So Far (Got So Far To Go)" fit seamlessly with the original songs and I enjoy them just as much. The acting is excellent and Nicky Blonsky was made for the role of Tracy- she is so good! I felt like the casting was perfect, everyone fit their roles so well! Nothing is too inappropriate for children- it's a great family film. It was so funny and everybody else in the theater seemed to enjoy it. The ending strays from the Original Musical a lot but it won't be enjoyed any less. This is definitely the Must-See movie of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best summer movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie! The cast did a fantastic job, (especially John Travolta and Amanda Bynes), and the movie emphasized a very important point (integration) while keeping the movie upbeat and enjoyable. Penny and Seaweed together are absolutely hilarious and the same goes for Tracy's parents. My favorite musical numbers are Good Morning Baltimore (look out for the John Waters cameo!) , I Can Hear the Bells, and Without Love. Zac Efron is absolutely perfect in the role of Link Larkin.He manages to be sweet, and drop dead gorgeous. (new crush alert!!!!).Nikki Blonsky stars as Tracy Turnblad, and they did an absolutely perfect job casting her. She brings Tracy to life and made the character her own from Lake's and the Broadway version. Allison Janey brings big laughs from her little part as Prudy Pingleton, Amanda Bynes' mother. John Travolta shows Edna in a more sensitive light, and there has been more than one occasion when I felt bad for her in the movie. Elijah Kelly, who plays Seaweed, is the coolest cat on the block, and he portrays it with ease. Queen Latifah brings the most essential thing to the movie, a powerhouse voice that can't be forgotten. Michelle Pfeiffer and Brittany Snow are deliciously evil as the mother/daughter team. Christopher Walken kept me laughing every time he was on screen. James Marsden plays Corny excellently, piling on the cheese. Hairspray is the perfect summer movie, and I will be seeing it over and over again for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>forget Harry Potter, Shrek, Transformers and dare i say it - the simpsons, Hairspray is without doubt one of the summers greatest films. In a summer in Britain that has been plagued by floods cursed by songs it was nice to see something nice cheery and fun. Although the actual plot line is rather off the wall i didn't care, the acting, the choreography, the songs - everything about this film was brilliant. Nicki Blonski, who plays Tracy was a complete find i thought find and was brilliant as the lead. Other members of young, hot Hollywood like Brittany Snow and the hilarious Amanda Bynes were brilliant, yet i thought zac Efron out of all of them was amazing. In Hairspray he proves hes more than the star of High School Musical and he proves himself as a brilliant actor. But John Travolta in his fat suit and dress as well as Michelle Pheiffer i thought really stole the show, Michelle was brilliant as the mean bitch - Velma Von Tuslle and Travolta did fabulous work as a woman. Queen Latifah did fabulous work, and was a far better choice of film than the ones she usually picks like 'Last Holiday.'Overall i thought this film was fabulous and i thought Adam Shankman did a terrific job of Directing and choreographing this masterpiece. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, I must admit that I thought that it wasn't going to be good. To me, it looked like an excuse to make a musical but after seeing the adverts and the comments made on this movie, I thought I should give it a look-see. I admit it, I was wrong, this movie was really good and I'm not much of a fan for musicals.John Travolta just made me laugh when he showed up as Edna and saying the one-liners and also the fun and charm in the movie that shouldn't fail to rub on anyone. The movie is set back in the sixties and tells about when white and black were apart and shows us about the joining of the two together. Also, some of the songs are a little bit catchy and the cast was great. I was shocked about Amanda Bynes because of her voice, it was terrific and, of course, Queen Latifah's voice was brilliant. Also, the dances were great as well.I will admit on its downside that there may have been a little too many songs because it felt like they burst into song every 5 seconds but don't let that put you off. Hairspray is a great and funny film that all the family could enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a lot of fun to watch. The musical numbers were fun &amp; carefree. Memorable performances were many. Michelle Pfeiffer outdid herself as the witch of a mother of the top contestant. I never knew that Christopher Walken was that talented. He held his own against John Travolta which was not easy considering. That brings me to John Travolta, it was a bit creepy watching him in drag but he was really good &amp; pulled it off. Queen Latifa was entertaining not quite as good as Chicago but very well done. The only thing that keeps me from increasing my vote was all the civil rights stuff. For the times it was appropriate but the ending was too over the top. Today a black man kissing a white woman is fine but for that time... it would have caused a riot.</fullReview>

C'mon, parents take little ones to movies that the kids enjoy but the parents don't always. While I was waiting for the theatre to empty out, I saw little kids, senior citizens, young couples, teenagers -- you name it! Hurray for a movie that touches all generations and is so much fun! I went with my three sisters and we loved the entire movie. Usually there's a part that drags but not in this one. My sister commented how she couldn't sit still and I started singing Good Morning, Baltimore from the opening credits! Great job by the cast -- everyone was on point. John Travolta - terrific! Queen Latifah -- amazing! Nikki -- welcome to Stardom! James and Zac -- great job, guys! Go see it, take the family, go again, buy the DVD!</fullReview>

Not only did it look fantastic, but the music enhanced the story and vice versa, the performances were spot on and the directing was terrific. There were a lot of details which passed by quickly but were appreciated. I would have preferred a little less John Travolta, but it was pure delight, especially for those of us who feel outside the 'norm' and also with healthy bottoms!My husband and I had a great time with this movie. I have not seen the musical, only the original film it was based on. The script of this was much better than the original John Waters film, and the energy is through the roof.

		<fullReview>From the very first scene of this fabulous and fast moving film, HAIRSPRAY captures your heart and also that of a young woman on a wondrous journey to become something more than just a fat girl with a dream, and in Nikki Blonsky HAIRSPRAY takes off like a rocket to mars and keeps you laughing and your foot tapping to the music of this magical movie. And, what a tremendous cast! Michelle Pfeiffer in a role that is such a zinger and her character sets up the prejudice of white vs. black but done in such a way that you visually see what the late '50's were like in America. I loved this film ten times over and so did the audience at The Arc Light in Hollywood.John Travolta as the mother is sensational, along with Christopher Walken as the father, and in HAIRSPRAY Adam Shankman has created a film which not only gives us an insight to the issues of race in the '50's, but brings back the memories of Dick Clark's original Bandstand which originated from South Philadelphia and brought together South Philly teens that became stars, long before today's American Idol. Queen Latifah in a role which makes you think of CHICAGO, and all the cast of young men and women who make HAIRSPRAY a wonderful experience to see and to behold on the screen. Bravo, HAIRSPRAY and company for bringing this jewel of a story to an audience starved for solid entertainment in summertime America.</fullReview>

I have to admit i went in thinking that having Amanda Bynes and Zac Efron in the cast would be a bad idea because i think of them as in little kid movies but they really showed their stuff in this film.

		<fullReview>Let's get it out of the way - John Travolta simply doesn't work as Edna. I think he's simply miscast.That said, WOW is this a fun ride. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Queen Latifah lights up the screen. Zac Efron and Nikki Blonsky are great. Amanda Bynes, James Marsden and Brittany Snow do a great job in their supporting roles. Taylor Parks and Elijah Kelly have the presence and vocal chops to headline their own pieces sometime very soon. Of course Allison Janey is a hoot. And Michelle Pfeiffer is hilarious. And who knew Christopher Walken could be such a cool dad? The direction is tight. You won't find yourself dozing off during this entertaining piece. I just wish I could have enjoyed John Travolta's scenes. His Baltimore accent works but I never believed him as Edna. I'm a Travolta fan - but clearly Harvey Fierstein would have worked more effectively.Still, I know I'll go see it again.By the way, be sure to stay to the very end. One of the best songs in the Broadway production "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now" was cut from the movie but then appears in the end credits - and true fans will love this trio! I'm out to buy some Ultra-Clutch Hairspray...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of "Hairspray" is bouncy, bright, candy-colored, and instantly forgettable. (Quick now - hum one tune from this picture!) Even the theme of race relations, the genesis of the "Hairspray" oeuvre, gets lost in all the goop. Everyone seems to be trying too hard. The end result is so far removed from real life that any lessons it may have are lost.Of course, musicals are primarily pure entertainment and not learning vehicles, but in this case the emphasis on gloss is disappointing because the source material, the 1988 "Hairspray", managed to be thoroughly entertaining while slyly slipping in quite a bit of social commentary. Not just acceptance of the "pleasantly plump" and integration - think of the contrast in that movie between the Turnblad family and the Pingleton and Von Tussle families. The Turnblads may have been the somewhat oddball group, but there was real affection and acceptance there, as opposed to the corrosive relations in the other two families. All this subtext is stripped out of the musical "Hairspray", and it is a less satisfying movie for that.It is a lot of fun, but once is enough - it is the original "Hairspray" that you will want to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray: PG?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This does contain a little bit of spoilers!I took my 8 year old niece to see this, because, hey, it's a musical, it seemed fun, and it was PG. Watching the movie, within the first five minutes, a man flashed some women. Michelle Pfeiffer pulls toilet paper out of a girl's bra, and wrapped up towels out of a boy's pants, which I'm guessing wasn't all that innocent.The dancing was very provocative; Tracy was supposed to be an awkward girl, waiting for her chance to shine, but she was dancing very inappropriately for that type of character.Michelle Pfeiffer sings a song about her being a Miss Baltimore, and she says "I screwed the judges". !!!! Does no one else see that this is NOT PG-movie material?! One of the characters just admitted to se-x with multiple men!Link says "Kiss my --", and Amber holds up a picture of her teacher and says to Tracy, "Such and such does not have breasts!" and sure enough, on the drawing, he did have them.Tracy sings a song about Link, and says "We'll kiss in his car, we won't go all the way, but I'll go pretty far". She's saying they won't go ALL the way, but they'll get to the clothes-off stage.I grabbed my niece's hand and we left the theatre an hour into the movie. I was nervous the whole time, worried that something might pop up that I don't want my niece to see, at age 8.PG movies are no longer for little children, as they used to be. They're mainly for adult-pleasure: language, sexual references, comments, and even iteensely passionate scenes (if you know what I mean)I think that this was a horrible movie to enjoy, if you take children under the age of 13. This should have been rated PG-13, if there was going to be so much stuff in it. What could have been a great movie (I mean, John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Amanda Bynes was fantastic!) turned out as a disappointment.Does anyone agree?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to think. I saw the original and I Luuveed it as my comments suggest. I didn't know what to think about this thing. It wasn't BAD or whatever. I didn't HATE IT--then when I watched it. But the relationships in hairspray 1988 were deeper than in 2007. I don't know if it was because of the musical numbers or what. (Tho I surprisingly liked some songs: Excpet the part when Ambers' Mom sings about being Miss Crab in 1945 and goes in detail with it. Who the F7#&amp; CARES what she did in 1945? I mean in 1988 she mentions it for a millisecond and it's done. In 2007 they Dedicate a whole FRIKKIN song to it!! NOT NECESSARY.) I know it's a musical, but Grease still mananged to be a musical and still have real human connections,in it. I mean for example in 88 Hairspray Penny and Seaweed really bond and you can see why she would risk her bu** for him. In 2007, Penny and Seaweed are just like, "I like you, you like me, let's get together and sing a song!" And Ricki Lake convinces you she's TRACY all the way. This new chick is like: ( I'm Tracy! I sing! I dance! Badda bing badda boom!But that's it!) ehh The only exception where it Didn't come across like that is when they were marching for civil rights. Yeah, most people will probably not agree with that. But that's how it came across to ME. Many in my theatre liked it (esp. if they were old a** white ladies) but me..I just...don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Myra Didn't Like It: A Hairspray View The movie musical Hairspray was a light, fun musical adaptation of the John Waters film by the same name. And that is what makes it forgettable. The story of an overweight, plucky high school girl who overcomes the prejudice aimed at her and becomes a popular local celebrity is a cute, fun story in itself , but without the zany edginess which John Waters films are known for, it sort of glides by and goes down easily like cotton candy. What made the original film so unique and entertaining wasn't just the plot, but the characters and the over the top way they were portrayed. Divine's Edna Turnblad was a stronger character than Travolta's. Travolta played Edna Turnblad as a meek, timid house-frau who Tracy had to coax and cajole to even leave the house, whereas Divine's Edna was feisty and ambitious. By making Edna so meek there wasn't anywhere he could take the character. It was Edna's zest and ambition in the original movie which drove the character and made her funny and campy. Christopher Walken played Wilbur Turnblad as though he would rather have been out on the golf course. The character seemed so lackluster that you just wanted him to go away every time he came on screen. Walken tends to play so many of his characters with a sinister edge and this was completely out of place for Wilbur. Jerry Stiller's portrayal in the original was effective because of his clownish, effervescent quality. The rest of the characters lacked the intense quirkiness of the original. It is that quirky, off beat quality that made the characters in the original so memorable. The only exception was Michelle Pfeiffers portrayal of Amber's mother, but unfortunately that performance seemed out of place against the other, milder characterizations. Because the rest of the cast toned it down so much, Pfeiffer seemed like she was over-acting. Nicky Blonski's performance as Tracy was charming and endearing. She did manage to portray Tracy's earnest vulnerability well in her drive to fight against injustice and prejudice. She does it in a way that is uniquely Tracy without being abrasive or harsh. While the musical numbers were fun and sweet, none of them stood out as particularly memorable. What gave the original Hairspray a lot of it's appeal musically was the use of the music of the period. The score from the musical version, while passable, did not hit hard on the sound of the period. You did not get a sense of the early sixties by listening to this score. Unlike a musical like Grease, for instance, with songs like Beauty School Dropout which really imitated the 50s ballad sound, Hairspray's music did not really sound like the popular music of the period in which it takes place. Listening to the music of the period brings people back to that time in a way that visuals alone can't accomplish. Hairspray is definitely a period story and it's imperative that the music borrow heavily from the sound of that period. The movie was well paced and visually pleasing. It was definitely written with more of a mainstream audience in mind. It didn't ever surprise you or make you squirm a little in your seat. It was charming and sweet. It would have been more interesting if it played up the dark side of the issue of racism more by sacrificing a little of the feel good cheer for some hard hitting, bluesy songs. There were many opportunities to hit on some of the darker themes in this story, but the writer and director decided to play it safe. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh What a Beautiful Morning in Baltimore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last, someone has made a good modern movie musical! Though ironically, "Hairspray" is good precisely because it's old fashioned. This film, based on the hit Broadway musical that was in turn based on the 1988 John Waters movie (now we need a non-musical stage play based on the film musical...), reminded me of the screen musicals produced back in the heyday of Broadway to film adaptations: films like "The Music Man," "My Fair Lady" and "Oliver!" that knew enough not to mess around with an already good thing. No one felt the need then to justify film musicals; characters simply burst into song because that's what characters do in musicals. "Hairspray" is like that -- the songs are not staged as dream sequences like they were in "Chicago," and they're not part of a stage performance like many of the songs in the woeful "Dreamgirls." They're just good, solid Broadway songs performed with a ton of energy and verve by a talented and charismatic cast.That cast is largely responsible for making this film the exhilarating success that it is, and the fact that the casting is unpredictable and strange makes it all the more thrilling that it works. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky makes a perfect Tracy Turnblad, the chubby, optimistic teenager who wants more than anything to appear on the Corny Collins Show, a teeny bopper dance television series run by evil ice-queen Velma Von Tussel (Michelle Pfeiffer). Tracy's mom, Edna (John Travolta in drag, buried underneath heaps of prosthethic cellulite and a hilariously garbled Baltimore accent), doesn't want Tracy to expose herself to the ridicule she fears lurks outside in the big cruel world. But Tracy wins support from her dad, Wilbur (played smartly by Christopher Walken), her best friend Penny Pingleton (the adorable Amanda Bynes) and the town's black citizenship, namely Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) and her son, Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), who see in Tracy's challenge to the imperious T.V. station a parallel to their own racial struggles. Every single member of the cast has boatloads of chemistry with all the others: Blonsky and Travolta, who perform "Welcome to the 60s" as an anthem to the beauty that can be found in being unconventional; Travolta and Walken, who stop the show with one of the film's best numbers, the big-band infused "You're Timeless to Me"; Bynes and Kelly, who explore the touchy terrain of interracial dating; Queen Latifah with everybody she comes in contact with. Only Pfeiffer comes across as distant, which is a fault I've always found with her as an actress, but which happens to suit this particular role. And Allison Janney makes an hilarious impression in the film's smallest role as Penny's hyper-religious and over-protective mom.For all of "Hairspray's" ding-bat zaniness and froth, it manages to deliver a powerful message about progressiveness and tolerance, and handles its civil rights background action far better than last year's civil-rights-set musical, the far more serious but disastrously terrible "Dreamgirls." "Hairspray" has a gigantic heart, and it put a smile on my face that lasted long after I left the movie theatre. What a nice change of pace from the usual bang-'em-up, smash-'em-up offerings of summer.Grade: A</fullReview>

They cut out all of Ambers songs and the fact that they got Brittany Snow to be Amber why the hell isn't she doing anything? Oh and way to change the ending and top the whole thing off by giving it a absolutely disgusting ending. This movie couldn't even compare to Dreamgirls and Chicago which were actually worth my $7.50.

		<shortDescription>Hairspray (2007)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2007 version of Hairspray is based upon the 1988 film of the same name by writer/director John Waters which was later made into a Broadway musical and this new version is a film adaptation of the Broadway musical that was based on the original film. Get all that? The film is set in the early 60's and is about a teenage girl named Tracy Turnblad who everyday watches the popular music and dance television program The Corny Collins Show. Tracy's dream is to one day be a dancer on that show and after trying out her dream comes true and suddenly she is in the spotlight and famous. Tracy however is very against the racist attitude of the show's producers who will only allow African Americans on the show one day a month and with the help of some new friends she tries to get that changed, but with the producers and most of the town shaking their heads, Tracy plans to change their minds and make a difference. Some subplots of the film include a popular girl on Corny Collins named Amber who is jealous of Tracy and with the help of her mother who works behind the show she plans to get Tracy kicked off and there is also a romance between Tracy and a teen dancer on the show named Link who wants to help Tracy, but also not sure of it because it could hurt his career on the show. All of this is set to Broadway show tunes and although the plot may sound serious enough the film is a flat out comedy with a lot of fun to be had. As I may have stated in previous reviews I 'am a fan of John Waters and his films and having seen the original Hairspray, I was interested in seeing how a musical film version would work and having never seen the Broadway musical all the music, dancing and a couple of things that weren't in the original film were all new to me. I was incredibly impressed however and ended up liking this film within the first few minutes and at the end feeling very satisfied by what I had just watched. First off I would like to thank the filmmakers for putting a man (John Travolta) in the role of Tracy's mother Edna because in the original film Edna was played by frequent John Waters collaborator Divine, who for those who don't know, was a man who often dressed up and played woman roles and I'm glad they remained respectful of the film of Divine's roles in the early John Waters films and the original Hairspray for that matter. Everything about this film is splendid. The acting while often over the top and humorous is all very well done with skill and a humorous touch that makes the characters charming and a real treat to watch. The film's music and songs were very catchy and often had very well written and humorous lyrics and they reminded me of the songs you would see in a Broadway musical only in a film and the dancing and choreography were all really well done as well. Sets, costumes, makeup they were all well done and looked exactly like the time period of the film and suited it perfectly. The story which I was already familiar with had some new parts that were still really entertaining and although a family fan the filmmakers still stayed true to the John Waters spirit and even put in a few risqu moments, but don't worry it's nothing really bad. This film just won me over with it's music, charm and overall entertaining nature. Everything was a joy to look at and watch and I had a blast with this film. Easily one of the most entertaining movie experiences of this year or any year. This is a great movie musical and I would rank it right up there with some of the classics. This is one of the best film's of the year and I sure hope that even though it is a musical comedy that it won't be overlooked at awards time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Musical! Absolutely spectacular even better than Broadway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. Every member of the cast is spectacular. With a cast of many no names this movie is the best. Newcomer Nikki Blonsky, could be the Jennifer Hudson of 2007. She is wonderful. John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfieffer, Queen Latifah and all the young dancers and singers are fabulous. 2 hours + of pure enjoyment, good for the entire family.As good or better than the Broadway show. Wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unadulterated EXCELLENCE that compels on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie works in so many layered ways, it's hard to know where to begin. First off, one can pretty much guarantee Travolta getting an Academy Award nomination for his pitch-perfect, subtle, not-too-over-the-top-but-just-the-right-amount-of-camp, incredibly talented portrayal of Edna Turnblad. This is the kind of role made for movie-stars needing a turn-around comeback, something to remind audiences of why John Travolta is a movie star in the first place. Every scene, every vowel, every mannerism is dead-on as Travolta's characterization almost steals the entire movie from the music, costumes, message, and story.Secondly, the music and choreography are ingenious. Scene transitions are so beautifully done, the highs and lows of the story conveyed so well with a narrative arc so wide and narrow in all the right places, that it is hard to say a bad thing about this movie.Lastly, the finale caps the whole movie and reminds us of a timeless message: the one that love and change are intricately linked, and that people who try to oppress and go against a tide of equality are the ones who lose the most in history's pages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first 10 of the summer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic. Travolta my hats off I sometimes forget that you made your start in the musical. Everything about this movie was just a 10. the casting. the vocal ablities. Cyclopse can sing! who knew! I got a little tearing on the march Song... and I could be wrong but i am pretty sure queen L had a tear but then cut away and then she didn't. It was a very moving part and song. I really felt that the cast was just picked from the heavens of musical theater and put onto the screen for this movie. I know some might not feel it but Mr Travolta did very very well. Golden globe worthy performance. Thank you for this joy of Joys this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in not really knowing what to expect, but I was very, very pleasantly surprised. It surpassed ALL of my worries, and was twenty times more amazing than I thought it would be.The cast was magnificent. Elijah Kelley as Seaweed J. Stubbs really stood out to me, though. His charm on-screen with Amanda Bynes' Penny Pingleton was really tangible and very amusing to watch each time they were in a scene together. His voice was a delight to my ears, and his moves were fresh and always dead-on. His performance won't soon be forgotten.Now, as my favorite character, I was moderately worried about how this new Penny would be. However, within the first few scenes, I knew that everything would be all right. Amanda Bynes changed my views ENTIRELY, and she really left her mark on the role. This Penny was extremely appealing, and had the audience going nuts.Zac Efron brought more to the role of the up and coming star Link Larkin than I ever thought he would. He really showed me how well he could branch out and do something different. And, I have to say, I was VERY MUCH impressed with his performance. Michelle Pfeiffer's Velma von Tussle was deliciously evil, and I loved every second of her performance. Her and Brittany Snow's Amber von Tussle worked very well together, and were a near flawless mother-daughter pair. Both were hysterical in their own rights and an overall joy to watch.Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad was astonishing. She was literally born to play this role. I was excited to see every scene with her. Her portrayal of Tracy was perfection at its finest, and I LOVED it.John Travolta and Christopher Walken really tickled my funny bone. They also had quite the interesting chemistry going on as Wilbur and Edna Turnblad. It was very endearing.Allison Janney as the manic Prudy Pingleton was PERFECT. It was a shame when it came to her amount of screen time, but when she was on.. she rocked that big screen. Her Prudy was endlessly hilarious and very true to her psycho mother roots.Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle was positively amazing--to be frank. I expected so much from such a powerful role, and I got my money's worth. Her and Taylor Parks' Lil Inez were forever enchanting and spicy at the same time.James Marsden as the lovely Corny Collins really made my day. He took that role and worked it like the pro he is. He and the Council Members were all exceptionally talented.Overall, this movie deserved EVERY positive review it received. It's a movie that'll leave a smile imprinted on your face, and perhaps on your heart, as well. It was wonderfully done, and just seeing it four times still wasn't enough for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie. Oscar Winning Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best movies Hollywood has put out so far. Finally a movie without someone dying, being shot up, stabbed, murdered, raped, or executed. It's a family film and has a great message in it. What is that message? I am not going to say until you see the movie.The stars in this film were superb! To all the Hollywood Producers and Directors, start making more films like this. We have enough violence in the world, and we need to come back to a genuine story and happiness as well as those who teach us a lesson about life.To John Travolta: Thank you for making this film. You really had some big shoes to fill from the late and great Divine. You pulled it off well and she would be proud! To all the new stars from this film: Congrats but don't forget about everyone who helped you get to where you are now. Don't let Hollywood elitist get to your head.Thanks Hollywood again for making a great film. Time for a few Oscars for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To all the Broadway Snobs, the good and the not-so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of people in the U.S. who can't rush to New York and buy a ticket to a show. That's the reality of the situation. Film and Theater are two different mediums. Those who compare and need to complain need to get over it. When it comes to film musicals, sometimes songs have to be omitted because of time and to the relevance of the story as the filmmaker sees it. It's not meant to diss the Broadway show nor to lessen the work of those who have been on Broadway.That being said, there were some really terrific performances in the film and there were some weak performances. Nikki Blonksky, James Marsden (who knew the boy could sing), Christopher Walken, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who I hope sees an Oscar Nomination out of this, were wonderful. Zac Efron was second-tier. Unfortunately I think that John Travolta was miscast. And Queen Latifah -- you have to love her chutzpah, but vocally, her big number was a huge letdown because she doesn't have the vocal strength to belt. She is not a belt singer. I was also disappointed by the billing. Sometimes stars who have well outworn their welcome in Hollywood need to concede that they are not the names in the film and seeing John Travolta's name over Nikki Blonsky's was off-putting and disrespectful, and Travolta should be ashamed of himself, Really, John, do you really need any star billing anymore? What would L. Ron say? Nikki was clearly the lead in the film but because other people have high- powered agents, they get higher billing, even if they're not a lead. A little humility, John, goes a long way.There is no such thing as a perfect movie, but the music was infectious, and the energy was amazing. In a Summer Movie season that has been one huge disappointment after another, it's great to see something finally worth the price of admission come out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a satisfaction, what a smile it put on my face, how nice to finally hear some applauding in the end of a movie, and some sincere laughter during, people clapping and singing along with the characters. Simply amazing! I went in there believing I was in for a treat and I wasn't disappointed. This movie was just great and it was about time, - too many disappointments so far. I loved everything about it. The script, the directing, the editing, the cast was so perfectly chosen, and the music was just wonderful. OK, so it did take a little getting used to John Travolta's enormous body and unavoidably manly voice (in fact I don't think I really let it sink in) and believe you were seeing and hearing a woman sing and dance, but boy did he do a great job. That guy still can shake it even with some extra pounds on. And the new girl was really a surprise, however, knowing Hollywood I'd say the new star on the rise will certainly be Effron. And rightly so. James Marsden was great too; it's a delight to know that pretty face is backed by a wonderful voice and singing talent which he's already shown on Ally McBeal. And the rest of the cast were simply beautiful too: Latifah, Pfeiffer, Walken, etc...A well deserved 10 out of 10, excellent! This one might just join Grease as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cute, entertaining and a great movie musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie. I was funny and sweet. I enjoyed it very much. This had to follow up a very good movie musical, Dreamgirls which was very well done. This did an outstanding job. It was a fun movie that you can't help but enjoy. The songs are catchy, the dances are amazing and the acting is great. I think the biggest surprise was James Marsden. I had no idea he could sing and his voice was amazing and his acting was great. He really blew me away. Amanda Bynes was so cute as Penny and I was sad she didn't sing more. I would have liked to have seen a little more of her and Seaweeds relationship. The only thing I can find to complain about is the fact that Tracy and Link's relationship felt a little rushed and not 100% believable just because it happened so fast. Also I never really stopped thinking that it was John Travolta as Edna, I just kept seeing him instead of the character. Now I did not see the Broadway show and my friend told me there was some changes. I know they cut some songs but I didn't feel like the movie needed more songs. This movie was a great add to the collection of movie musicals and I hope this means there will be much more to come. Probably the most entertaining movie I've seen all summer and just so much fun. *By the way keep your eye out for John Waters*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hairspray" was a terrific change of pace: a happy, bouncy, silly-but-with-a-message dance-fest. I had not seen the Broadway show and only vaguely remembered the John Waters original film, but it made no difference. Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Queen Latifah and especially John Travolta really chew up the scenery and have a blast doing it (How did Travolta &amp; Walken ever play those love scenes wit a straight face, anyway? )... and the newcomer playing Tracey does just fine. The opening night audience was laughing and foot-tapping throughout, and I heard viewers from 20 to 60 mumbling "Gee, that was great!" on the way out. Fun, fun, fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel Good Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt this is definitely a feel good movie of the summer, but I expected more from this movie than what it entaled.I was expecting catchy songs like the movie 'RENT', but I was left with only "You Can't Stop The Beat"...the rest of the songs weren't that catchy and most left me more annoyed than happy.Acting wise, this is a great cast. Everyone did a splendid job. Especially Brittany Snow, Queen Latifah, Zac Efron, James Marsden, Elijah Kelley and Michelle Pfeiffer. But standing out the most was definitely John Travolta and Amanda Bynes. Not surprised at all with those two. Amanda gives you that quirky sudden burst of humor that you need in the film and John could have done more with the character but he was charming and funny.But to be honest, Nikki Blonsky did good for her debut film, but within the first 20 minutes, I was annoyed of her, her annoying singing, and the desperate need for her to twirl in a circle smacking her arse. She did it in every single dance number and every song. Overall she was just annoying as hell. I've seen Marissa Jaret Winokur as Tracy and Ricki Lake and both did a great job but they didn't leave me wanting to strangle Tracy and shuve a giant turkey down her throat.Overally, it's a great movie. I still prefer 'Grease' and 'High School Musical' but this is still a good film to see. But i was disappointed with the songs but not with the acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very cute. You should go see it. The acting was good, could have been better. Zac was the worst actor but still was a good actor. The only down is that they curse a little too much. This is about Tracy who dreams of being on the Corny Collins Show. She makes it. She falls in love with Link. (and go see the movie to learn more)Newcomer Nikki Blonski is great at acting for her first try. Amanda Bynes was great in this film. John Travolta did great for playing a woman but this wasn't his best. Brittany Snow was good. Queen Latifah was great!As for the singing, I think Queen Latifah was the best.

		<fullReview>I thought it was so well done. The singing, the dancing, and acting, it was all there. The casting was excellent. We will probably go see it again. Good entertainment for families, although not appropriate for small children. I know many parents who would take their little ones to PG rating films. This one is definitely not for them. There are a lot of kissing and other boy &amp; girl type of scenarios. The whole story is about racial segregation and I think it is too complicated for small children. The best part was seeing John Travolta do his thing with the fat-suits on. He was funny and charming. Queen Latifah showed off her singing skills again in this movie, as she fattens up her resume nicely. Zac Efron was even better in this film than he was in High School Musical. I have a feeling this movie is going to draw in a lot of HSM fans just in time before Disney airs the sequel this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching the original movie version since i was a little kid, I've seen the Broadway show, and this was amazing. Although there were a few things i would have liked to be different, you just can't deny the energy the show puts out there; it really is amazing. They did cut a couple of songs (ones i really like!), but the flow was really good and i even enjoyed 99.9% of the casting. I must admit i was skeptical of Zac Efron, and assumed he was only in it because of High School Musical, but he really was very good in the role. John Travolta was ..meh.. i wasn't crazy about his accent, but he pulled it off in the end. I do wish they had cast Harvey Firestein again in the role...why not?!?! Having cameos of the original movie cast in the re-make was really fun. All in all, i will Definitely be seeing this in the theater again, and buying the DVD too!

		<fullReview>Loved it! It was more dynamic than Grease! Had great choreography from the first note to the last and all the way through. The Characters were so real and the actors so committed, especially Travolta and Blonsky, that I found myself laughing and crying at their honest humanity.I Think Travolta deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar! Divine would have been proud!!! In fact, I think she's rolling over in hysteria that Grease's Danny wanted to play her role. He treats the character with the highest level of respect and never holds back from giving it his all.Travlota's Chemistry with Blonsky and Walken was the best I've seen in Years. You could See the Love!!! Walken and Travolta's Duet was unexpectedly phenomenal with both selling it as 100% genuine affection. Something rare in the love duets, as Barbra Streisand can only sing a love duet to herself.Everybody Rocked!!! 10 Stars!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hairspray is a hit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a magnificent story of dancing, singing, segregation, and segregation, Hairspray will surely give all ages chills. i had only some idea of what to expect from Hairspray. i knew it was about an overweight girl who dreams to be famous. it was that, but so much more. one girl, Tracy Turnblad, played by newcomer, Nikki Blonksey, was able to change a whole city's view on race with only her voice and her dancing. from the response of the audience, you could tell that everyone was completely absorbed by the music and captivated by the rambunctious and high-spirited Tracy. i heard many remarks about how odd it was to cast John Travolta as Tracy's encouraging, yet still skeptical mother, Edna Turnblad. on the contrary, Travolta did a wonderful job portraying a woman. though i'm not positive why they didn't simply cast a woman, i figure it was to add a sense of comedy to the story. on the television show, "the Corny Collins show", which Tracy and her best friend Penny Pingleton, played by Amanda Bynes, watch religiously after school, Corny Collins, played by James Marsden, hosts while a group of teenage dancers display a new dance crave everyday. then, once a week, Queen Latifah's character, Motormouth Maybelle hosts a similar show on "negro day" (which i was shocked when they first said it) which, obviously was the one day of the week set aside for African Americans to dance. prissy Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is the manager of the t.v. station, and her clone of a daughter, Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), try their hardest to keep integration from happening on the show and from Tracy Turnblad from becoming the next miss teen hairspray. throughout the movie, Tracy, with the help of her best friend, penny, her object of affection, Link Larkin, who is played by Zac Efron, and Penny's forbidden object of affection, Seaweed Stubbs (Elijah Kelley) helps the city of Baltimore realize that black and white people shouldn't have to dance separately, they should be free to dance on the same television show without any fear. Adam Shankman, did an amazing job at directing this film. the sets and scenery could make anyone believe that the time really was 1962, a time for change. this movie comes highly recommended by me if you enjoy musicals. even if you don't, Hairspray is a wonderful experience for the whole family that leaves you with an even greater feeling and understand of the simple controversies of the early 1960's.</fullReview>

I don't think there could have been a better person to play Tracy Turnblad than Nikki Blonsky because her voice was beautiful and her acting was superb. I was very surprised to hear Amanda Bynes singing because she was great! Michelle Pfieffer and Brittany Snow played the villains of the movie very well. And I have to give a job well done to John Travolta for having to dance in a fat suit AND high heels.There were just a few things I would look out for. They do mention teen pregnancy twice and I can remember Michelle Pfieffer and Zac Efron's characters swearing at some points of the movie. And the momentary teen smoking that's mentioned on the posters last for what felt like 4 seconds during I can Hear the Bells. I would recommend this to a family with kids ages 10+. Even though there are inappropriate things in the movie, the movie teaches its audience to accept people for who they are whether their skin is different or if they are overweight.Overall: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the absolute best musical since Grease and gave me new hope for musicals of the future. Lately we have had to deal with nonsense like Moulin Rouge, Dreamgirls, and Chicago, which were not bad but could not hold up to the old style of musical cinema. I was lucky enough to attend a pre-screening of this film and see how great it is. This movie will have you laughing, singing along and coming out of it wanting to see it again and again. Just the premise has to make people smile John Travolta (Edna Turnblad) captivates the audience as a woman who is married to Christopher Walken (Wilbur Turnblad). The cast was perfect such great stars in this movie from Travolta all the way to the debut of Nikki Blonsky who took the lead role although she is a completely unknown actress. Overall this was an absolutely brilliant film everyone needs to see this in theaters.</fullReview>

The movie was extremely well-casted (I can not say enough about how good they all did in their roles!!). The whole time you are watching it you are having a great time.

		<fullReview>Musicals on film don't always translate well onto the big screen. That being said I had very low expectations of this film. I was not only pleasantly surprised but I was treated to what has got to be one of the most feel good movies I have ever seen. The casting was wonderful. Everybody was spot on, and it was all worth it to see Christopher Walken dancing with John Travolta. The big concern in this movie is John Travolta, would he be good enough, and the answer is yes yes yes. I thought he did a great job and I was amazed at how well he moved in those high heels with the extra girth. There were several times during the movie where the theater broke out in applause and the soundtrack is amazing. I think Hairspray will be one of those movies that kids will reminisce about when they grow up the way we reminisce about Grease.</fullReview>

Yet I'm happy enough to find that this movie is not telling the story of beauty salon as I've predicted from the cover and the title &#x1f60b;&#x1f619; Queen Latifah is here and she's a lot skinnier than in Chicago. But I like her better in Chicago. And I don't see something special in John's acting besides the fact that he acts as an obese woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Waters has been Disney-fied!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there is certainly a lot to like about the movie version of the 2002 Broadway revisal of the cult 1988 John Waters hit, some of the rawness has been taken out in the favor of cuteness. Yes, it is still 1962 Baltimore, and racism is rampid for the Corny Collins Show where "Negro Day" is once a month and black teens are not allowed to be seen dancing on T.V. with the white kids. Many changes were made between 1988 and 2002, obviously because the producers wanted a more "family friendly" version of "Hairspray" on Broadway, and even more were made between the time the show won a ton of Tony's and the time that the movie was made.Still, the show focuses around "pleasantly plump" teen Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky in a star-making role) who can dance rings around the snooty Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), stealing her boyfriend Link (Zac Efron) in the process. I guess it would turn any teen into accusing her rival of having "cooties" or being easy, but sympathy is there for Tracy the minute the film starts and she wakes up to wish Baltimore "Good Morning". Amanda Bynes is cute and adorable as the nervous Penny Pingleton who finds she has "chocolate fever" for the likable Seaweed (Elijah Kelley).The adults here are a mixed bag. I have to vote "thumbs down" for John Travolta's nervous Edna Turnblad, preferring the tough but vulnerable Divine and the raspy Harvey Fierstein. Travolta does really look like a middle-aged woman, but he tries too hard to make her soft when really Edna should be a lioness ready to scratch in order to protect her cub. Tracy seems more protective than vice versa, and that takes away from the strength of Edna's character. Bravo, however, to Christopher Walken as Wilbur who makes Edna's husband extremely likable and even sexy in a rough sort of way. Their duet, one of the showstoppers of the Broadway production, is well preserved here, and is one of the few moments where Travolta really does come alive in the part.For a "Grease"-like show, the presence of Travolta and Michelle Pfeiffer ("Grease II") is quite ironic, although "Miss Baltimore Crabs" does remain one of the tackiest songs ever to be kept in the movie version of a Broadway musical. Pfeiffer takes her one-note character and has fun with it, but unfortunately, the one-note is sour because of the coldness which oozes off the screen every time she comes on. The amazing Queen Latifah shows that she is more than just a one-hit wonder when it comes to musicals, having rocked "Chicago", she now does the same as Motor Mouth Maybelle, and tears the roof off of "I Know Where I've Been", an anthem for freedom if I've ever heard one.The teens steal the thunder here though, and they are all truly likable and amazing. You want to see them all have their chance, both their fictional characters on "The Corny Collins Show" and the real performers, either on Broadway or in the world of pop music. Taylor Parks gets to do more as Little Inez than any other actor has had in that role in previous incarnations. The plot is altered a bit to try and make it more modern, but in retrospective, it really doesn't make sense, even if the surprise ending is touching in spite of not being true to the times.Still, you will want to "Stomp the Beat", not "Stop the Beat", as the music guides the movie into becoming a shining example of how movie producers can turn a Broadway show into a feel good hit. Alterations always needed to be made to bring in the non-theater going audiences, and some wise decisions were made. Ironically, the closing credits takes one of the cut songs ("Stop! Don't! No! Please!") right off the cast recording (with Harvey Fierstein obviously present) and helps give the film a nice feel at its exit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musical Classic Comedy set in Baltimore back in the 60's. Starred by Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) a chubby happy girl whose best friend is Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) love watching the The Corny Collins Show where Amber Von Tussel and her boyfriend Link Larkin (Zac Efron) happen to be the stars. Amber's mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) runs the network that broadcasts the show, making it racist and unaccessible. Black people are only allow to go to dance on Negro Day held the last Tuesday of each month. Tracy's mother, Edna (John Travolta), and Penny's, religious mother do allow their daughters to watch the show which does not stop the girls from watching, but a hit of destiny and a bit of luck turns Tracy into the star of the show. Fun to watch, specially Pfeiffer, and Travolta who play two different but equally enjoyable characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, although obviously a labor of love for those concerned, is a pale, pale memory of the Broadway production. I can't think of a reason why Harvey Fierstein wasn't cast instead of John Travolta, who gives a somnambulent performance. If you're not sending up gender conventions, why are you filming this piece? From beginning to end (at least for those who, I hate to keep bringing it up, missed the transcendent original B'way production) this film is just tired and uninspired. Such a disappointment. Very bland in tone: not what you're looking for in this material. Some good dancing though. I'm the last one to knock people trying to film musical theater for the masses, and A for effort, but it's just tired. On the positive side, it does retain much of the original book and score, unlike many other film adaptations of musicals, but it chicken's out. You can't have it both ways--either you're Waters-ish in-your-face or you're the Hollywood version of Bye Bye Birdie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Travolta is a millstone tied to this movie's neck.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would probably be a bright and entertaining musical if one of the lead characters was not so horribly miscast. The director of the original and much, much better 1988 'Hairspray,' John Waters, has a 15-second cameo as a flasher. If John Travolta's part had been confined to this time-span, then this film would be bearable. But no, Travolta plays the part of Tracy's mother, grimacing and staggering in a fatsuit through about 50% of the scenes, and flopping about like a beached, dying Orca in a climactic musical number.Just how bad is John Travolta here? Well, first I must certify that I am not a Travolta-hater. I have seen at least 4 John Travolta movies that I really liked, and I liked him back when he was a Sweathog as well.But here is how bad he is in 'Hairspray': Pluck-out-my-eyeballs, cauterize-my-optic -nerve, give-me-an-icepick-lobotomy, pump-me-full-of-thorazine bad. His Baltimore accent alone, one small portion of this grotesque performance, is easily the worst fake accent in movie history, surpassing Kevin Costner's atrocious Boston accent from 'Thirteen Days.' The U.S. of A. has literally millions of excellent overweight female impersonators who could have taken this role and made it Oscar-worthy. Kirstie Alley comes to mind immediately, and like Travolta, is also a Scientologist. But there are millions of other female impersonators who'd have been just as good if not better.By casting Travolta in this role, the implication is that female impersonation is not an art, but something any slob can just pick up in no time. You wouldn't even think of trying that with another art form, like Martial Arts for instance. Try replacing Jackie Chan with Nathan Lane, see how well that works. The casting of John Travolta has not only condemned this film to painful unwatchability, it is also an insult to every hard-working female impersonator in America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw any live theater versions or the other movie, so I can't make any comparisons. But I enjoyed this movie. Not only did I like the music, and music in a movie is important to me, but I also liked the dancing and the actors' talent, which are two things that I usually don't care that much about. Hairspray is against three different types of unfairness: favoring thin people over overweight people, racism, and winning competitions by cheating, so it has some moral in it, even though the "local TV show" tells young people that school is not important. Even though the singing pictures seemed awkward, Tracey's mother sounded like a man from the start, and the front part of Tracey's hair changed color not far into the movie, I found this movie entertaining and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good music and dance but nothing else I enjoyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched Hairspray the first version and the musical play. I saw that it gets high rating and a lot of people in IMDb say it was fun so I rented the movie to have some good time. However, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed. There are both good and bad things about this film. I like some songs in it and the dance scenes are pleasant to watch. Nevertheless, the story itself really turns me down. It's like a world created for those who fantasies a place where good people are always good and they will win and bad people are always bad and they will lose. Just like soap series in my country. However, melodrama like that can work if they make it a bit believable in the details. But I can't believe anything that's going on in this film. Here is this fat girl. She is nice. She is confident. She is almost perfect in every way. She ends up winning everything without doing anything. The coolest guy in school fell in love with her. The audience loves her, the black people love her, EVERYONE LOVES HER, except, of course, the "bad" people. Well,usually I'm someone who enjoy melodrama and sentimental movies,and I love musical film and play. I love Moulin Rouge, Chicago, and Phantom of The Opera. I tried very hard to enjoy myself through "Hairspray", but I just couldn't! The cast are fine, though. I can't compare John Travolta to anyone who plays this character before him because I haven't seen the other version. In my opinion, his performance was good and I enjoyed watching him being this shy and protective mom who keeps her sparks inside. Nikki looks sincere, confident, and nice. She has good voice and she can dance very well. But for a character so perfect and charming like Tracy, I expect something more special from her personality. I also enjoy the performance of Queen Latifah, Michelle Pfiefer ,and Elijah Kelly. Anyway, I am not saying that this is a bad movie. It's just not my type. From reading other comments here, I know that there are a lot of people out there who enjoy a world where everything is bright, perfect, and happy, and I think that the director of Hairspray succeeded in making this film for his target audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original John Water's movie and many of the elements that made me love it were missing in this "sanitized" version so I can't agree with all the raves, I'm afraid.The hard-edged, provocative and unconventional dialog has been diluted to the point of bland. The ghost of Water's lines linger on but re-written for no apparent purpose other than to take the sting and the camp out of them. The song-score was okay but not at all memorable - certainly not as memorable as the former film's 60s originals soundtrack. John Travolta mangles all his dialog in adopting the most bizarre of accents - an accent that bears no relation to anyone else's in the film btw. His singing leaves as much to be desired as ever. Christopher Walken, on the other hand, can't sing at all and was simply miscast.I don't like the way they messed about with the plot or characterizations either. Edna simpers and all her strength is gone. Amber is presented as universally loathed from the get-go instead of feared and admired. Penny is too "pretty" (and too tall for her bf). Corny Collins' character is just all over the place (and that crappy line about giving someone a "stiff one"??? On 60s television??? I don't think so! It stuck out like a sore thumb.) For the most part they all try their best but it just ends up being like a Disney version of the original. It just doesn't work for me.I do wonder if I hadn't seen the original then would I have enjoyed this version more. And I think, yes...but not much more.</fullReview>

The voice was strange, the character was not fleshed out and wasn't even ugly like the Divine character.This Edna was put together nicely, just big. And what was with the voice? Why couldn't Edna talk? It was as if she was mentally delayed or something.The John Water's original is a much better movie.And I can name many better musicals if you like musicals.

After she gets on the show,a young man named link (that she is attracted to) starts to notice her and they fall in love. She also stands up for racial equality on the show. She wants it to be integrated for good. Of course this gets her into trouble, and she has to highlight the issue on the live hairspray pageant on the show.Hairspray has very good songs that make you feel wonderful. They catch you, the lyrics become familiar and you can't help but sing along. It also deals with racial issues carefully. It never pushes it too far.Also John travolta is great in drag.great movie- 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Remake. Good. Fun. But Still A Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More proof that Hollywood has run out of original ideas. A remake of HAIRSPRAY? Okay.Regardless of Glamour City's lack of originality, this new Hairspray is a glitter-rama of song, dance, music and the battle over racism, and it fills the screen with enough enjoyable moments to make it a film worth your while.Comparisons between this 2007 update and the 1988 version abound, so we won't travel that overdone road here. What we'll do is give you a few glimpses into what awaits you if you should choose to pick up a DVD copy of this newest remake.Racial integration is the focus once again. Newcomer Nickki Blonsky fills the screen as the plumped-up Tracy Turnblad, a teen in love with dance and the social changes surrounding her. Her mother Edna is played by the sexually changed and fat-suited John Travolta (WILD HOGS). Most movie-goers probably haven't heard Travolta sing since GREASE (1978) and his voice doesn't shine through here because he's acting as a woman and moving his voice up in octaves to stay in character, which made his singing a painful event. But much of that can be whisked aside due to the fact that we get to watch he and Christopher Walken (BALLS OF FURY) do a fantastic dance number through a myriad of clothes lines. The production is so well done here that Travolta's over-the-top singing fades. Walken plays Wilbur Turnblad (Edna/Travolta's husband) and this aforementioned dance number hearkens Walken back to his early acting days when dancing was his forte. You can really tell that he was enjoying himself here.The all-star cast also helps move this movie up a notch thanks to its star power. James Marsden (ENCHANTED) stars as TV personality Corny Collins and hosts the dance show that Tracy thinks is totally neat. His desire for racial change matches that of Tracy's. But both are stymied by the twisted Velma von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer, STARDUST) who helps run the Corny Collins show and also cheats, connives, and misguides in order to ensure her only daughter Mandy (Brittany Snow) wins every televised competition.Queen Latifah (STRANGER THAN FICTION) stars as Motormouth Mabelle, a black dancer who's "Negro Day" on the Corny Collins show is in jeopardy of being cancelled when the white-bread Velma decides that Corny's show would be better off without the colored element.The battle between long-held beliefs of racial separation battle the new integration sweeping the nation, and the songs, dances, and physical attractions can't be put off any longer.Nikki Blonsky is to be commended for doing such a fantastic breakout role as the plumpy integrationist Tracy Turnblad. Her singing, swaying, and acting were spot-on for the referenced movie times, and she carries the weight of the entire production perfectly. But strangely enough, most older generation watchers might enjoy more the scenes with Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, and John Travolta as they watch them return to a time when their acting careers were just starting.</fullReview>

And now its nominated for 3 Golden Globes, Nikki Blonsky for Lead Actress, John Travolta for Supporting Actor, also Nominated for Best Comedy, I hope they win all of them!! Usually I like to stick with Thrillers, Horrors and movies like those but I would say that this movie would make go and see more musicals! 10/10 stars !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Waters' 1988 film "Hairspray" was a shift towards more mainstream (perhaps palatable?) films following his prior works that joyously reveled in extreme bad taste. Though it had a lot of music at its heart, it wasn't actually a musical, but was turned into a successful one for the Broadway stage, followed by this film adaptation. Blonsky plays a hefty, but happy-go-lucky teen girl in Baltimore, Maryland who lives for the afternoon "Corny Collins Show" and its league of teen dancers. Though she hardly fits the mold of a camera-friendly shindigger, she uses moves learned from some black friends to win a spot on the show. This is enough to infuriate the show's producer Pfeiffer, whose daughter Snow is the reigning queen of the set, but when Blonsky tries to integrate the program, a small war is declared. Latifah plays the straight-talking, maternal hostess of the once-weekly "Negro Day" who takes up the cause and Marsden plays the host, caught in the middle of the m?le. Despite this dollop of social concern, the bulk of the film is geared towards a plethora of bouncy, similarly constructed songs that provide ample opportunity for infectious dancing and bright presentation. Blonsky, in her screen debut, is terrifically optimistic and ebullient and moves wonderfully for a plus size gal. She starts off the movie with a bang and keeps the energy up until the end when she reemerges as a checkerboard dervish in go-go boots. Pfieffer is having fun (with about 10 or 15 elaborate blonde wigs!) in a rare campy, bitchy role. She looks stunning and creates a good villainous foil for Blonsky. Latifah doesn't have to stretch any acting muscles, but is in great voice and suits her role perfectly. Marsden makes an engagingly toothy impression while Bynes, as Blonsky's lollipop-loving friend, and Efron, as the dreamy teen idol, lend strong support as well. Kelley and Parks are impressive as Latifah's musically-inclined children. Walken does well as Blonsky's father. The one weak link in the film is Travolta, cast (as is traditional for the role) as Blonsky's mother. Apart from the fact that he simply makes an unconvincing and mostly unappealing female, he adopts a horrid, indecipherable accent that renders most of his performance ridiculous. The one benefit of his casting is that he, even in a 30-pound fat suit, can move well and he dances nicely with and without Walken. Unfortunately, the rest of his contribution amounts to a washout, but he does not manage to sink the film. Fans of the Broadway show may miss a couple of songs or object to some (generally unnecessary) tinkering of the plot line, but this is mostly a very entertaining and effervescent adaptation. Certainly the music is pleasant and wonderfully sung and the vibrant costumes consist of utterly delightful 1962-ish sweaters, skirts, dresses and so on. It's a feel good film for people who welcome such a thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The young cast really makes this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I famously predicted that this movie would bomb in the theater, but I was incredibly wrong. It's actually one of the top-grossing films of the year. When I was fumbling for an excuse as to why it was so successful, I guessed that the film's Disney Channel alumni had brought in a younger audience and recaptured them for repeat business. Well, I think I happened to be right on that account. The film itself isn't anything special. It's quite enjoyable overall, but it doesn't break any artistic ground as compared to John Waters' original flick. It subtracts some of Waters' best moments (my favorite loss being the scene where the characters meet up with Pia Zadora as a beatnik), and adds a worthless subplot just so Edna and Wilbur Turnblad can share a duet. It's not even funny how bad John Travolta is in this movie. They might as well have filmed him peeing on Divine's grave. He cannot produce a plausible woman's voice whatsoever, and when he sings it's ten times as grating. I don't even think Travolta was this bad in Battlefield Earth. Christopher Walken brings nothing into his role, which, as far as I remember, has been expanded far too much from the original film. Queen Latifah also brings almost nothing to the picture, except a decent singing voice. Too bad there's hardly a memorable song in the entire musical. I should mention that among the adult cast, James Marsden and especially Michelle Pfeiffer are quite good. So there, I've trashed it as much as I'm going to. There are some things I really didn't care for in the film, but, I must say, the film's young cast, to which I attribute its enormous success, makes it well worth watching. They're all fantastic, without a stinker among them. Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelley, Taylor Parks, and Brittany Snow are all outstanding. They are the equals, if not the betters of the original film's cast. They make the movie, really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Hairspray" treats two serious themes, first accepting and respecting someone different, in this case a short, chubby girl who has personality and can dance. And second, set in 1962, the advancement of racial integration. But all of this is done in a humorous style, with lots of singing and dancing production numbers. I enjoyed it greatly, and in most part for the performances.John Travolta is just fabulous as Edna Turnblad, tall and large, and basically home-bound for many years because she was self-conscious about her heavy looks. But his character, as a woman, is totally believable and Travolta is great in his song and dance numbers.Equal to Travolta's performance is Christopher Walken as the husband, Wilbur Turnblad. Their daughter, short and chubby but bubbly Tracy is played by teenager and newcomer Nikki Blonsky who also is just perfect.Michelle Pfeiffer is Velma von Tussle, the mean-spirited TV station producer who seems only to want to get exposure for her daughter, Amber, played by Brittany Snow (of TV's American Dreams fame). Amanda Bynes is one of the high school girls Penny Pingleton.The central theme is a Baltimore TV show similar to 'American Bandstand' where James Marsden as Corny Collins hosts the show. The featured dancers are normally all white, but occasionally they have 'Negro Day' where the blacks perform and are allowed to dance, but never blacks and whites dancing together.Queen Latifah is the voice of the black contingent as Motormouth Maybelle. Zac Efron is cute young Link Larkin who had been the boyfriend of Amber, but as he gets to know Tracy he also becomes attracted to her.All in all, a cute story and a fun musical.</fullReview>

It is in that Teen Now Magazine that he is with her I think when he was doing an interview. John is good he looks really funny I think the way he is dressed in this 1. All the actors and actresses are good in it. Like the story that at first Johns character won't let Tracey take part in the Dancing and in the end they end up looking the same as each other.

		<shortDescription>Remake of a heavyweight charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably very few Academy Awards will be in the offing for this remake of a rather obscure movie on which was based a more widely appreciated musical stage play. Though John Travolta playing a cross-gender Edna Turnblad may be worth a special category.Some movie critics may comment on the formulaic nature of this 60s throwback. What was the movie that John Travolta starred in with that Australian hotty, Olivia Newton-John? Grease, I guess. I don't remember what era that one went back to, probably the 1950s, because I don't think there was any sex or black people.On the other hand, Hairspray makes quite a deal out of the racial integration issue and learning to accept people as they are, especially people who are considered "rrroomy." Edna Turnblad, being played by John Travolta with fluffy accouterments, is gargantuan while Edna's daughter Tracy (Nikki Blonsky) may be considered dangerously short for her weight....The movie is good in all the areas of controversy, better when it weaves in the singing and the dancing, and at its nostalgic best when it becomes a simple coming of age in the 60s flick. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly more Susan Stroman's The Producers and less Rob Marshall's Chicago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I was enjoying Hairspray until at some mid-point, I had to admit to myself that it was wishful thinking on my part. Especially disappointing was John Travolta's performance in a terrific role for the right performer; all his reviews I'd read to date were so praiseworthy but I never believed him as Tracy's mother and his accent, so different from everyone else's, was genuinely irritating. And why did he not have enough good dances? I was surprised at how dull the choreography was in general; I don't remember that problem from the stage version.Aside from Travolta, all the other performers were outstanding with Queen Latifah and James Marsden really leaping off the screen. Marsden and and Zac Ephron looked terrific with their period haircuts; they looked like genuine heartthrobs.The costumes were fun and the settings looked great. What with equally good costumes and talented casts, this film didn't otherwise disappoint me as deeply as did Dreamgirls or musical version of The Producers, but still only a mild recommendation from me. Sigh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HAIRSPRAY(2007) *** Nikki Blonsky, John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Keeley, Allison Janney, Taylor Parks, Paul Dooley, Jerry Stiller. Winning adaptation of the Broadway musical smash hit based on the John Waters (who has a naughty cameo) cult classic about a '60s era Baltimore teenager Tracy Turnblad (fun newcomer Blonsky) whose love for the local teen dance show "The Corny Collins Show" leads her dream come true by becoming a member of the ensemble and into hot water during the turbulent Civil Rights movement. Fantastic production design by David Gropman, candy colored art direction by Dennis Davenport and wonderful costumes by Rita Ryack help propel director Adam Shankman's vision come true but the true stars are the tart songs by Marc Shaiman and energetic cinematography by Bojan Bazelli prove to be crowd pleasers especially the climactic "You Can't Stop the Beat". While it is a grotesque delight to see Travolta in fat-suit drag it is also a tad off-setting (he looks like Katherine Helmond form "BRAZIL" crossed with HR Puf'N"Stuf!) yet he pulls it off (and still has his dancing jones good!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were some folks who were lucky to have TV's of any kind in 1959. Personally, I had a little black-and-white that I watched all the way into 1982! I remember explaining to a child once that "You know like the 3 Stooges? Yeah, it's like that" to which he answered "All the time??" Yep.Among my neighbors, I think we started getting color sets probably post-1965.Yes, there were other anachronisms in the new version of Hairspray, but overall, it was funny enough not to mind them there.I think my family will be watching the original version again soon, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1962 Detroit overweight Tracy Turnblad (newcomer Nikki Blonsky) is in love with the Corny Collins Show on TV. It's basically just "American Bandstand" on a local level. She gets on the show and is a big hit. She then pushes for the show to be open to blacks and whites (back in 1962 that was unheard of). She ends up in a battle with evil Velma von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her equally evil daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).VERY energetic (to a fault) adaptation of the 2002 Broadway hit which was in turn taken from a 1988 John Waters movie. The movie is full of life, the songs are great, the cast is energetic and this movie is just basically one of the most uplifting Hollywood musical I've seen in a long time. The movie never stops moving and the cast just carries it through full force.Blonsky is just great as Tracy--she belts out the songs and is always on target and very good in her role. John Travolta plays her mother in a fat suit. It's...interesting casting but it doesn't work. He has a VERY strange accent and seems constricted by his fat suit. Christopher Walken plays her (his) husband. Now I've never liked Walken--I always thought he was a one note actor BUT I do like him here. He seems relaxed and has fun with his role. Amanda Bynes is LOTS of fun as Penny Pingleton; Pfeiffer and Snow are definitely having fun; Queen Latifah barrels through with her role as Motormouth Maybelle (she appears to be channeling Ruth Brown)and James Marsden (as Corny Collins) and Zac Efron (as Link Larson) are just handsome and grinning nonstop through their roles.Basically this movie just keeps moving, is VERY funny and is actually better than the 1988 Waters original. And how can you hate a movie that shows us that integration is a GREAT idea? A 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say this movie is more upbeat than the original "Hairspray" is an understatement, does it compare? Of course not. In my opinion, this movie is 3 times better than the Ricki Lake version, I only watched about 15 minutes before I ejected the original and put the new soundtrack in. The music is absolutely wonderful and Nikki Blonsky shines in her film debut as Tracy Turnblad.I love John Travolta as Edna Turnblad, this is his best film since "Grease" and I was delightfully surprised to see Zac Efron of "High School Musical" play the teen heartthrob from "The Corny Collins Show." Everyone cheered at the end of the movie which is rare, I haven't seen that since the film version of "Rent". It's simply a feel-good movie that will have you dancing in your seat and singing to memorable tunes like "Good Morning Baltimore" and "I Can Hear the Bells." Make this movie a must-see on your list and don't forget to buy the DVD when it comes out, I hope it becomes a classic for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haispray is a great movie and I took a big surprise with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 70s,the controversial director John Waters made simultaneously rude,aggressive,kind and funny films which had bad taste and they told stories which validated kinds of life very far away from normal.In the early 80s,Waters started his filmography of normal films,like Polyester and Hairspray(1988).I did not expect too much from the remake of Hairspray,but the film really surprised me.It's not as good as the original film,but it's very fun and funny.I have to say,that as a musical,Hairspray is better than more pretentious but mediocre films(like Chicago).The songs are very sticky.Also,for the fans of the original Hairspray(like me),there are brilliant cameos from Waters and Jerry Stiller.Maybe,my expectations for Hairspray(2007)were so low,that the film liked me a lot.Anyway,it's a great and very fun film.If you wanna have an excellent moment,do not doubt in watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good, but I was a bit disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have long loved the original 1988 Hairspray and I haven't seen the stage musical.I felt like I should have loved this version more, but I just didn't. It lacked any of the campiness and most of the absurd humor of the original, and between the dancing I kept wishing I was watching the original. I realize it is a different movie and what is the point of just redoing the original, but there really needed to be a way of capturing the edge of the first movie. To me, they did not do it, and that is the problem.Nikky Blonsky did as about as good a job as anyone could, but lacked the sassiness of Rikki Lake. Michelle Pfeiffer was quite good as Mrs. Van Tussell - Christopher Walken - boring. John Travolta is the worst thing about the movie, he is absolutely awful. Only a real life drag queen can play the role of Edna. The dancing sequences were certainly entertaining, well done and fun- but think of Grease - just not in the same class. Take away the dancing, and it is just a highly watered down version. To be fair, Hairspray 2007 is not a "remake" of the 1988 film, but a film version of the 2002 Broadway show whidh was "inspired" by it. I can imagine the stage show would be naturally more exhilarating than the new movie. I know some who liked show without using the old movie as a comparison, but had more trouble doing that in this film. My partner chastised me for constantly checking off comparisons to the original - but that's me - I have to do it. I can well imagine for someone knowing nothing of the Hairspray history, or who is able to forget the original, it will come off much better. But i think anyone who has spent the last 18 years watching Hairspray as one of their favorite guilty pleasures, is probably going to be disappointed.I saw Evita and Chicago about 12 times each, not to mention the 1988 movie. Dreamgirls would be worth another viewing for me, if not more than that. I am glad I saw this Hairspary and it is worth seeing - but I wouldn't see it again. Something was missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exhilarating Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hairspray", the original film, is one of my all time favorite movies, with its irreverent tone, its quick pace, and the great chemistry of its main players, among them, a great debut for Rikki Lake. When the stage musical was released, I had some reservations because as everybody knows, it's very hard to write catchy and intelligent lyrics.The new incarnation of "Hairspray" has completely won me over, with its excellent and appealing cast, the superb choreography that truly shames any recent musical releases because its breezy, cheerful, and uplifting tone perfectly carries the positive message, with the help of some of the best pop sounds in recent movie history. This film is bright and colorful, full of life, and plenty of charm. One of its best offerings is John Travolta's most recent incarnation. Here is a man who has reinvented himself more often than Madonna. Completing inhabiting the role of Edna, the shy and reclusive mother, he plays her with sincerity and much affection for a character that has been a victim of its own fears and the cruelty for a society that idealizes perfection and deluded ideals. Watching Edna embrace life, tentatively at first, and then with a renewed passion for music and life makes your heart burst with joy. Travolta has amazing chemistry with Walken, an odd choice to play Edna's husband, but their moments are sweet and classy.Another welcome comeback is Pffeifer's icy, racist mother, a woman with obsessive compulsive attitudes and plenty of pizazz. When she belts her musical numbers, they're powerful and charming, as a snake's hypnotic trance, before she strikes. She is the remarkable dark side to the cheery and positive Turnblads."Hairspray" moves very well, at time it seems so full of energy that it seems it is going to burst. It's vibrant, engaging, loving, positive, and it even manages to wear its mission proudly for those who are in need of a helping hand and some moral support.Everyone in the film is at their peak, from Lattifah to the newcomer who plays Tray. There is not an ounce of wasted time, not too much emphasis on flash without content, whereas an overrated musical hanged for life on two musical numbers and dragged for 90% of the rest of the time, this begs not to end. It jumps right into the action, keeping its heartbeat strong, until the very end, where we sit, still breathless, waiting for the amazing cast and production team to give us some more.As a side note, let's see anyone take the Oscar away from Mr. Travolta, a man who can truly show what an amazing performer he is. Here is a dancer, a real actor, a man with a big heart, among other things, and a true survivor. It's hard to believe that it has been 30 years between his first musical and "Hairspray", but I have to say it: He still has "it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Stop The Beat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: Adapted from the hit 2002 Broadway musical about Tracy Turnblad, a pleasantly plump teen trying to get a group of talented black musicians onto a racist local dance show in 1960's Baltimore. Pros: This movie really is a breath of fresh air. Sure it doesn't have the drama of Dreamgirls, or the sophistication of Chicago, but who cares? It's just a lot of fun, which is what we need in a summer of movies without heart (Spider-Man 3, cough, cough). The cast is a blend of classy old and popular new, and they all do well by their characters, and their songs (James Marsden's got jazz pipes? Who knew?). John Travolta and Christopher Walken play a "married couple", and imbue their romance with both kindness and kitsch. Director Adam Shankman gives the whole movie a bright, colorful look, and every song is a toe-tapping piece of bubblegum fun. Fans of the Broadway stage show and the original John Waters film won't be disappointed, and neither will newcomers to the story of the family Turnblad and the Corny Collins Show. CONS: None, really. Only that Hollywood doesn't make many like this any more.Hairspray is a rousing triumph, and the best time you'll have at the movies all year.</fullReview>

And from there the movie was crammed with hilarious scenes and unexpected parts.The acting from some of the "Disney teens" was phenomenal and they defiantly surprised me with their abilities and talents.

		<fullReview>With cheery if totally unmemorable numbers (exception being the sweet and sweetly sung "I Can Hear the Bells") this was a fun and undemanding outing to the movies, if you didn't expect anything like the zany, campy original film. Nicki Blonsky is delightful, looking like she is having buckets of fun and it's infectious. James Marsden dazzles with a great white smile and looks yummy in those awful too-short flat-front trousers which is all he is really required to do here. Zac Efron treads the difficult line between dreamy and smarmy, for the most part with success. As Seaweed, Elijah Kelly shines. Aside from the cute and mildly amusing dance with Christopher Walken (gnarled and lovely, but in a part he can and has done in his sleep) John Travolta's Edna Turnblad consistently and conspicuously remains "tee-hee, it's Travolta in a dress" ? and though one gets the feeling that he's wanted to do drag for years, the casting office really shouldn't have let him. Queen Latifah is fine, but not especially sassy for someone nicknamed "Motormouth". Michelle Pheiffer, come back to making movies! (Maybe Nicole Kidman can sit a few out?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia, underdog story, tons of toe-tapping tunes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary line pretty well sums up this feel-good movie, a new musical based on a Broadway hit set in Baltimore in 1962, a time in US history when racial segregation dominated. A local teenage TV show that has a "Negro day" only once in a month. The heavy subject matter of the TV integration movement is handled, however, in feather-light comedy. Even more important in this movie is the age-old feel-good-about-yourself theme, regardless of what appearance you have or how much you weigh. The "short and stout" girl's dream of becoming a teenage TV dance star is not unlike what you see in Little Miss Sunshine. But here, she makes it.You can't complain about the cast. Michelle Pfeiffer tries out playing a villain of sorts, a manipulative TV station manager. Everybody else is saccharin sweet, including Christopher Walken as the almost saintly understanding father, James Marsden (Cyclops in X-men) as the handsome open-minded show host and Queen Latifah as the determined peaceful fighter for rights of the blacks. Absolutely not to be missed, however, is John Travolta playing the timid mother (yes!) who "never left the house since 1951", blossoming into a wonderful creature at the inspiration of her daughter, played by Nikki Blonsky, a four-foot-ten, pleasantly plump nineteen-year-old, hitherto unknown, but with such a sunshine screen persona that fits the role perfectly. But it's Travolta that is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while, even the most serious movie-goer feels the urge to just go out to the movies to have a good time. "Hairspray" is the perfect film for such an occasion. Filled with splashy cinematography, funny performances, big over-the-top numbers, and lots of hairspray, it's the most fun film of the year so far.Nikki Blonsky sets the bar high as a Golden Globe contender, strutting through the film like she owns the place (and she does). Her performance as Tracy Turnblad is fun, energetic, and fantastic. John Travolta is also surprisingly good as Tracy's mom, Edna, and he (or she, I guess) belts out numbers and dances his (her) shoes off like he's still in "Saturday Night Fever." Also worth mentioning are Michelle Pfeiffer as a scheming racist mother, Christopher Walken as Tracy's odd-ball father, and Queen Latifah as a bubbly and sassy "motor-mouth" activist. The other young stars are very good as well. I found Brittany Snow to be the perfect school "witch." The real star of "Hairspray" is the music. Though the songs are large in quantity, they're even greater in soul. "You Can't Stop The Beat," the climax of the film, is also the highlight scene. I also liked that the movie incorporates (like the show and Waters flick) the issue of racism in a fun and funny way, while still never being offensive or hypocritical. "Hairspray" will probably not be the best film of the year, but it's certainly the most fun.</fullReview>

It was a shame the audience in my screen weren't very involved, when all I wanted to do was start dancing and singing down the isles.

		<fullReview>Pros: This is an excellent movie, and a great adaption from Broadyaw to film. Zac Efron, who I expected to dislike, gave a very believable performance as Link. The dancing was wonderful, and I couldn't keep a smile off my face for most of the movie. Nikki Blonsky was a GREAT Tracy. She can dance, and her voice, while different than Marissa Janet Winkour's, is just right for Tracy. Most of the actors/actresses gave a full out performance, and the movie is just SO high energy! Cons: I disliked some of the ways the film was adapted. First of all, the omitted songs were some of my favorites. Some of the script that was cut had helped move the story along. And in the march, Penny was supposed to be helping. Call me a stickler for tradition, but I felt that some of the cuts hurt, rather than streamlined the story, and inhibited the character development.But all and all, this is a very good movie! I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one I'd looked forward to since laughing uncontrollably at the trailer...~Plot/Writing/Direction~ A combination of the original film, and the Broadway musical adaptation. Tracey Turnblad is obsessed with dancing, and she and her best friend love watching the Corny Collins show every day after school. When an open audition to get on the show is announced, she and her friend jump at the chance, but are scoffed at by the dismissive, self-consumed and shallow previous winner Amber Von Tussle, and her meddling mother, Velma. After some encouragement from her unusual parents, Tracey fights back and makes people notice her. She manages to get a place on the show, but she hasn't heard the last of Velma Von Tussle.The musical numbers were written for comic effect, rather than quality. But they are all ultimately (with the exception of a few at the beginning) very catchy, and some are particularly good (such as the one performed by Queen Latifah during the march, and the duet between Walken and Travolta). The dialogue throughout is glazed with cheesiness; bad puns and corny one liners, and typical "I'll get you Gadget!"-style lines for the villainous characters.~Cast~ Well, you have a great line-up of well-established stars here. John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, and notable smaller parts for cast members of the original such as Jerry Stiller. All of whom are used extremely well. Going into this film, I didn't expect to see much of these stars in the actual dance/song sequences, but all of them take part at some stage. If you can adjust to the whole "I'm a man in a dress" gag and an obvious play on what sounds like Dr. Evil's voice, then John Travolta's Edna Turnblad should be a favourite. Ultimately, the fact that we found the character so hilarious is because we're aware that it's John Travolta wearing a fat suit and lots of make-up. Regardless, he's a scene-stealer and 9 people out of 10 will say that he was their favourite. Pfeiffer plays a fantastic villain, and looks incredibly good for her age, too.Christopher Walken was again a delight to watch. I say 'again' because everyone knows he's incapable of giving a poor performance, no matter how bad everything else is around him. He plays Tracey's father, the quirky shopkeeper of a joke store. We see him do a fantastic rom-com duet with Travolta, try to fight off a smouldering Pfeiffer and even distract security guards by dressing as a woman. He's used to great effect in the film.Still, you can't take anything away from the great new discovery, Nikki Blonsky who is nigh-on flawless as Tracey. Amanda Bynes is rather good too. I dislike Zac Efron, however, and think his casting was a corny mistake which dragged the film down a little. But he made the best of a bad job anyway. James Marsden and Elijah Kelly were also very capable in the roles they played.~Music~ As aforementioned, while the lyrics themselves were obviously written chiefly to make audiences chuckle, the songs improve as the movie progresses. The dancing is sharp and generally spot-on, though. Every musical number is visually stunning.~Summary~ I think this film has a very wide appeal, the average cinema-goer will enjoy it from start to finish. There are also a lot of messages in the film, for the more thoughtful and analytic viewer. I personally think that anyone who criticises Travolta for dressing as a woman is being over-dramatic, and foremost stupid. They're wrong, too. So, I think what I've been trying to say throughout this review is: "Go See Hairspray"!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kudos to cast, but production had some let downs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original Hairspray, I was curious how well anyone could replace Ricki Lake and many of the others. After seeing the movie earlier today, I have to say kudos to this cast. Everyone one of them managed to pull out great performances.Nikki's performance of Tracy was captivating. She really was endearing and entertaining and had me from the moment she rose out of the bed and sang Good Morning Baltimore through the entire film. You understood why someone like Link could fall for her.Zac Efron can light up my screen any day! What a hottie and that wink was to die for! James Marsden is another hottie and who knew he could sing? Overall the film entertained and will be a hit! The cast kept us riveted and entertained the entire time from the moment the film started through the last kiss. But the direction or writing (not sure who to blame here) was a let down.I felt the pacing was off. The story between Link and Tracy was rushed and many key points that explain them were missing. Link was really choppy and missing in this production. Not because of Zac's performance, but because the character suffered due to either cuts made on the editing floor or because of poor adaptation writing to this screenplay version. It was disappointing because Zac has talent and did an excellent job with the little he was given, but how much more I wanted to see Link's character on screen and better explained, more like the original 1988 version.I also felt too much emphasis was on the parents in the film. While I loved the performances by Travolta and Walken, they really took up too much screen time and a lot of the storyline suffered as a result. I have to admit that I was not too much of a fan of Michelle's Velma. She was too one-dimensional. I normally love Michelle and was surprised that I didn't care for her work here. She just didn't bring in any depth.The main characters (the teens) suffered because of the airtime that many of the adults and their side story lines took. The teen stories were rushed. Seaweed and Penny as well as Tracy and Link could have been far better explained. Brittany Snow's character suffered because she was barely noticed as Michelle's Velma got the airtime instead of her.Queen Latifa was beautiful, strong and somewhat under-appreciated in this film. When she led that march, she was riveting. But why was she so little in the film? I felt that she was again a victim of poor pacing in writing or editing. The actress was excellent, but just not seen enough.I felt that the message about integration could have come across far stronger had they allowed Link's character to have the same strength and depth and joined Tracy in the march. Likewise, where was Penny? In the original film, there were far more "whites" joining in the march than in this version. It just wasn't very well balanced.James Marsden played Corny very well and has a good singing voice, but again, the character somehow lost a lot of depth compared to the original movie because of either poor writing or editing.The choreography was a bit plain and the dancing overall was underdone. You had Zac who is a great dancer, Nikki proved she could strut her stuff, and Elijah who definitely could dance and a bunch of chorus dancers that could have delivered far more challenging moves than what we got to witness. While still entertaining, it was a bit disappointing because the talent was there, but underutilized.Again, the film entertained and will be a major hit. It definitely should be seen, even with the production problems. The acting is fine, music is great and the dancing is fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Charming Part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll admit right up front that generally I hate today's musicals. They become more interested in the song and dance than the story. For me a musical tells a story using song and dance to help not to carry the load.Hairspray fits that perfectly. A movie musical 1988? that goes to stage and then back to the silver screen suffered somewhere along the way to make it uninteresting. I think the only reason I stayed through the movie was because Nikki Blonsky was absolutely charming and convincing. She played her role in with delicate balance and won me over right up front. I look forward to what she might get to do next since this is her "discovery movie". She earned this movie the 3 I gave it.John T is a bore again. No matter what he plays his self absorbed attitude comes through. This time he was wrapped in a fat suit that could not even hide his sloppy acting. Christopher W. and Michelle P. we not much better in their roles...too clich. The only song and dance that seemed to fit was that done in the TV studio. If you have not seen this movie and plan to be certain you like musicals A WHOLE LOT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, Hairspray is not my sort of movie. I'm not a fan of musicals, I don't own any of the Grease soundtrack and I certainly don't sing along whenever the Wizard of Oz comes on the TV. So, maybe my viewing of it was slightly diverse to everyone else's. However, I had read several reviews, saying it was fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.From the opening credits, we, as an audience, can tell this is going to be a corny movie. Tracey, a chubby homely teenage girl, bursts into "Good Morning Baltimore" which is a tragic song in itself. The music sings "cheese" before she's even sang a word and her dancing along the streets is painful to watch. However, I gave the movie a chance (first impressions are sometimes wrong) and carried on watching.By the end of the film, I was quite literally running out of the cinema. Yes, it is a musical, and yes, I suppose it has to be a little cheesy and predictable but Hairspray was too much for me. The songs were never going to be 'Grease Standard' and I can't imagine, in twenty years time, little girls singing into their hairbrushes, howling away to the soundtrack, imagining they are Brittany Snow jiving away to "You Can't Stop the Beat." The storyline is quite simple enough to understand - chubby, overlooked girl has a great talent at dancing and singing. Her favourite TV show is holding auditions for dancers. She gets in. We discover her ambition leads her to much serious things - like letting black and white people dance together for one thing. And the story really is quite predictable from there.The highlight of the movie is Michelle Pfeiffer and her quite vicious interpretation of the stereotypical blonde, fancy mother who wants her daughter, Amber, to be centre stage in every one of the Corny Collins Show. Her sharp comments toward the other members of the cast is quite amusing and her tone is always cold and quite frightening. Christopher Walken and John Travolta make very good parents to Tracey, and Travolta managed to make me forget about Danny Zukos, for a second.However, the foundations of the teenage love stories are crashing down before they even begin. Seeing Zac Efron romping around a bedroom with a picture of Tracey cradled in his arms is not my idea of entertainment and I was laughing at him, rather than anything else. The chemistry between him and Nikki Blonsky is non-existent and the ending sequence is actually quite uncomfortable to watch.However, Hairspray was quite good fun if you like musicals and I enjoyed three of the songs. Three is better than nothing, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travolta detracts from an otherwise enjoyable enough musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I first heard of Hairspray, I could not have had less interest in seeing it, and everything I saw after that - still photos, trailers, etc - did nothing but reinforce my disinterest. It just looked like complete crap. There were so many things going against it: I don't care for most 60's-era stuff, it's based on a John Waters movie, it had a cast made up of people like John Travolta, Zak Efron from Disney's High School Musical, Queen Latifah, Amanda Bynes, etc...But as the release approached, I started hearing nothing but good reviews, and not just from stuffy traditional critics. Internet fanboy-types whose tastes are usually more in line with my own were saying it won them over and they had a lot of fun, even if they don't normally dig musicals. Plus the fact that I had a free pass, so I decided I had to give in and see it. Maybe it won't be completely horrible; maybe it'll be great after all! It was neither. It was enjoyable enough, mostly because of the songs by Marc Shaiman, who made the South Park and Team America movies so fun in addition to scoring many other films. Still, as musicals go it was nothing particularly memorable. I have no problem with musicals (and no problem admitting I enjoy them). I have lots of love for plenty of them, like Moulin Rouge, Rent, Grease, Annie, West Side Story, Sound of Music, Little Shop of Horrors, and even Singin' in the Rain, which I only watched for the first time this month (not to mention a lot of the Disney stuff, Muppet movies, and the aforementioned South Park and Team America). But this one ranks more in line with stuff like Chicago and Dreamgirls. Okay stuff, but that's about it.There was only one thing I hated about it, and that was John Travolta. This is nothing but stunt casting. There's absolutely no reason this role needed to be played by Travolta, or even by a man for that matter. It's distracting and pointless, not to mention seeing a guy dressed up as a fat chick has NEVER been funny. Not in Norbit, not in Big Momma's House, not in Tyler Perry movies, and definitely not here. The songs he actually takes part in are easily the ones that could have been cut as well, most notably his duet with Christopher Walken. But oh, how the older people in my audience seemed to love him. I guess they're just easier to please with a lame man-in-drag gimmick. Of course, these are the same people who made Wild Hogs a gigantic hit. Travolta is so uneven, alternating great films with horrible ones, and plenty of mediocre flicks in between. On the flipside, it's good to see Michelle Pfeiffer back on screen again, but she was mostly wasted, and her songs weren't exactly the strongest of the show. One person that really stood out for me was James Marsden, who surprised me with both his performance and his singing. He's really impressing me this year, between this one and this fall's Enchanted which from the trailer looks like it'll be fun.So Hairspray turns out to be harmless enough to tap your toe to for a couple of hours, but it's hardly anything that will join the list of truly memorable musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was worried that this wouldn't be the Hairspray I had come to know by heart and love. I am a huge fan, I own the original movie, the soundtrack, and I have seen the play on Broadway. But as soon as I stepped into the theatre and saw Nikki Blonsky singing "Good Moring Baltimore", I knew it was going to be great! It was amazing! I was even impressed by Zac Efron, who I thought wouldn't be a great choice for Link, but he was perfect. And newcomer Nikki Blonsky made me forget about Ricki Lake in a second. The costumes, actors, script, and especially the songs and dances were amazing!!! It turns out it is actually one of my favorite movies!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray - A must have for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great lover of musicals - old classics or modern attempts. I love them with a passion. There is only one thing on this earth that I hate with an equal amount of passion and that is John Travolta. I dislike the constant air of smugness the man carries whether he be playing a goodie or a baddie.Then along came Hairspray. A film that completely passed me by until opening night and a friend suggested we go. I had many many reservations, especially when I was informed that the King of Smug, John Travolta would be playing a women in a fat suit. I was not excited.I go to the cinema a lot, every weekend in fact and I absolutely love it when I go into at film and I am proved wrong!! I thought this film would be so bad it would be unwatchable - It was completely the opposite.The cast were superb - Alison Janney, a fantastic actress and Michelle Pfeiffer looked to be having a ball.The supporting cast of Christopher Walken, Queen Latifah and James Marsden and especially the younger cast of Brittany Snow, Amanda Byrnes and Elijah Kelly (who is a fantastic dancer!) were absolutely incredible.Nikki Blonsky the movies unconventional heroine lead the cast well , especially in her first film movie role, a factor which makes her performance and achievement even greater. I honestly hope that this talented young actress has a place in Hollywood and does not become resigned to the stereotypical "fat friend" an inferior sitcoms or romantic comedies. She is so much better than this.Now this leads me onto the King of Smug himself?? he was actually very enjoyable to watch, and was clearly enjoying himself playing this character as much as the audience enjoyed watching him. It was actually very surreal watching John Travolta and Chris Walken slow dance - something I would never had imagined seeing.As a musical, there has to be elements of fantasy i.e. people breaking into song etc and in the most recent musical Dreamgirls I found the switch from conversation to singing sometimes distracting but here it flowed along seamlessly and the soundtrack was very catchy - I know I will be adding some of the numbers to my I-pod.The humour was fun - we could have done without the "Fart scene" but that is only a minor complaint.The storyline - set in a small town in the 1960's a teen girl tries to get onto a predominantly "white" dance/song show on a local TV network where she finds that she doesn't fit in and joins up with the dancers/singers from the cancelled Negro day show and calls for change in the way the show runs - i.e. a mixed show all the cast dancing and singing together.Overall I loved the film. I went in with such a negative attitude and came on such a high, grinning like an idiot. I would give the show an 8/10- it loses two points for the "fart scene". I grew out of that humour when I was very young so it wasn't funny and it added nothing to the movie and also loses a point for being a remake (personal rule) If you want to watch a fun movie that doesn't take itself to seriously then you will be hard pressed not to like Hairspray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Major Disappointment. I enjoyed the original Hairspray in '88, thought the stage version was forgettable, but this new one...I actually had a hard time sitting through it. First off, the camera work is wooden and the music numbers suffer as a result. Everything just felt so flat and uninspired. And then, John Travolta,...wrong! wrong! wrong! His singing voice was terrible and his Edna could barely move her face, she wasn't a woman, she was a plasticine sack that may as well have been a mannequin. I just kept wondering why there wasn't a "real" drag queen playing the role or a campy guy or even a talented &amp; heavy "real" woman playing Edna (Bette Midler?). And the songs themselves, just noisy, unclever and not something I'll ever want to buy or sing-a-long to. I remember hearing all sorts of hype about this movie when it came out that it had really hit it out of the ballpark, I just want to know how much money the producers spent to generate that kind of phony buzz. Everyone I talked to thought it was terrible. Michelle Pfeiffer can't sing either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-intentioned but clumsy and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-intentioned but clumsy.Hair Spray has some great ideals and intentions. Set in the 1950s it deals with racism and intolerance. Surely this is a basis for something profound.Unfortunately, no, not really. What follows is fairly predictable and unoriginal. if it was made in he 1950s it would have been quite revolutionary, but by now the topic has been explored a lot, and in much better detail.The fact that it is a musical detracts from the topic, making it feel light, rather than serious and gritty. The music itself is mostly quite dull, and seems to rely largely on existing 50s music with new lyrics (and the new lyrics don't do the old songs much justice).The main novelty of the movie is John Travolta acting as a woman. Unfortunately, ultimately that's all it is - a novelty. His performance feels clumsy and forced. A decent female actress would have done a better job.Remaining performances, from an all-star cast - Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah, Zac Efron, Allison Janney, Brittany Snow, Jerry Stiller, are good though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hairspray is about a teenager attempting to integrate a dance show called the "Corny Collins" show. I liked the overall message and theme of this movie, which was slightly empowering. However, I did not like how overly corny everything is. Also, John Travolta is a sad representation of a mother and distracts me from the message. He makes me laugh at some points because its a horrible miscasting job. My favorite character is Link because he's soooooooooo hunky. As you may have imagined, John Travolta plays my least favorite character. Also, I found this film too sing-songy for my taste and that turned me off a bit; I'm not much of a theater person. Therefore, I don't recommend this film if you don't enjoy theater type entertainment. It conveys a good message but it's not my ideal movie. This movie is best suited for a family to watch together on a rainy day with nothing else to do.</fullReview>

I don't mind a musical every now and again if it's done well, and I'd heard good things about Hairspray, but I'm sorry to say it didn't impress me.The songs are constant. Constant. I mean, there's barely a minute of dialogue in between numbers. It felt imbalanced to me and the story, about the civil rights movement, suffered as a result and resorted to caricature. Also, all the songs sounded the same! They were upbeat and exciting, with good period dance moves to match, but nothing memorable I'm afraid.This isn't a terrible movie, but it wasn't for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years ago, I saw the original John Waters version, which was great, funny, had a good sense of humor to it, and featured a great cast. This one...? Um...where do I begin? The dancing was good, but that's about it. All of the musical numbers sounded the same, and were just over-the-top with their Broadway-like style. Aside from "Seaweed" the characters weren't as likable as they were in the original Waters film. In fact, even the main character Tracy Turnblad got on your nerves as she broke into song about every three minutes. And all the songs sounded the same. No variety. John Travolta in a fat woman's suit was funny at first, but it soon lost it's flair. And the plot and theme were lost in the cheesiness and corniness--as can be expected when one makes a musical out of a movie/book/whatever that already was good on its own. This film only made me want to see the original version all over again. Watch that one instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sister had wanted to see this movie for so long and had bugged me so much that I finally broke down and rented it.From the beginning I didn't like it; the music, the mood, and the script in general. I sat through the whole movie waiting for it to get better... it never did. The music never got better, neither did the acting or the emotions. It was a very poorly done movie.I like the original Hairspray but this was nothing like the original. It did have some of the same things but this didn't have the feel of the original and wasn't as funny. The ending was totally different, what happened to the dance Tracy had, the cockroach one? And they were suppose to be competing for Miss Auto Show, not Miss Hairspray. This was too different than the original for me to like.I did give it two stars for two things said in the movie, the first was the NAACP reference and the second was the "So you've met my mom?" from Amanda Bynes' character. These things redeemed the movie enough for me to give it two stars.All in all, I will never watch this movie again. For those who like the original, don't see this just get a different movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I lasted an hour before turning off this film. And I am asking myself why? I love musicals and not just old ones but for instance Chicago was excellent and I am also "into" 50's and 60's music. But this picture lacked any appeal or charisma for me at least. Simple story: fat school girl type becomes a star at the local TV station in an era when race discrimination was rife. I can give this 2 rather than 1 votes as I heard a couple of catchy songs. But maybe because of the false way the story appeared to me or perhaps due to the way one of the lead actors playing his part in drag came across as so ridiculous, then again it could be because of non existent humor in the film, hence for any of these factors I was deeply unimpressed.So between a 'hit' and a 'miss'in my opinion the latter overwhelmingly prevails.</fullReview>

Grease (forgive me for mentioning Grease on the same page as Hairspray) had several great songs, which after all these years I still enjoy. Can anyone recall the melody from one song in Hairspray? OK OK , a few of you probably can.Suspension of belief is often necessary for enjoyment of parody/fantasy and I can willingly do this. But my belief can be suspended only so far. Not far enough to embrace the idea of the cute and hip young guy falling in love with the calorie challenged girl with the perpetual goofy smile.The humor was banal and timeworn and not very funny.There were a few moments I enjoyed at the time but now, a week later I can't recall what they were.

		<fullReview>The original "Hairspray" is one of my all-time favorite movies, great cheesy fun that really captured the essence of the mid-60s as I remember my gum-cracking ratted-hair older cousins who could have been stand-ins for Rikki Lake. This version is clearly made in this time and place by the way the social issues of the past are handled.This Tracy can certainly sing and dance, but she's given Tracy a wide-eyed innocent aw-shucks, and none of the toughness of Rikki Lake's version. And the plot has been mangled, (what happened to Amber's father?) and worst of all, they actually mention the unmentionable fact that Tracy is large and it's unlikely she ever would have been on a dance show on TV, then or now. The whole point of John Water's movies is the world is just a little bit off in them, but consistently, logically off, and in his world, size wasn't an issue except for the nasty arch-nemesis and her equally nasty mother. No one else in Baltimore seemed to notice that Tracy was overweight, or her mother was a man.But this is no John Waters movie, and just doesn't stand on it's own.The singing and dancing was great, I'll give it that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently after being very intrigued by John Travolta as a woman. Unfortunately, it was quite tedious when compared to the original with Divine in the role of Edna Turnblad. Ricki Lake as Tracy did a wonderful job, Divine was hilariously cast as her mother. The original movie was so good, and still quite recent, that there was no real reason to re-shoot it. I can understand why they turned it into a musical, but the film musical was far too long winded for me. I actually lost interest somewhere through and wasn't sure, but I think they changed some of the storyline. By the end I was just waiting for it to finish. I would definitely advise anyone who likes this to see the John Waters version from 1988 - that was an absolute classic. This version is not in the same calibre. P.S. Note I am Australian and we use British English, hence calibre, not caliber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film adaption of the musical based on the film by John Waters. I liked the Waters film but it was never more than a passing like. The musical never appealed to me, I never cared for the music so I never saw the show. Everyone in my office is raving about it and seeing it multiple times so I gave it a go.Its been said that love for the film will ultimately be gaged by how one reacts to John Travolta and his portrayal of Edna Turnblatt. Travolta is awful. I disliked him intensely and so had to give up the film despite a mostly excellent cast. With an vocal performance that changes from moment to moment and an accent that is, I don't know what the heck it is, this is one of the worst performances I've seen in ages, even when compared to some of Travolta's other recent goes at screen acting. Putting Travolta in a dress doesn't make him a woman, hell one need only think of J Edgar Hoover to know that a bear in a dress is still a bear. Travolta moves like a macho trucker on triple dose testosterone in a dress. He plays it like a guy who knows nothing about women. I don't know if its his choice or the directors but it just kills it for me.Its funny for all the wrong reasons. I know the part is suppose to be broad but this is pushing it.Other than that core mistake the film isn't that bad and those looking for a bouncing up beat film could do much worse.</fullReview>

This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The original Hairspray was wonderful. It had social commentary, humor and a point. This version can't even be called a remake. It had the same characters, but the story was just terrible. Every character in the new incarnation was just such a caricature of the originals. The only character I even cared about was Motormouth Maybelle, and they barely even used Queen Latifah except as set dressing. John Travolta's Edna Turnblad just made me sad, hopping around and overacting every scene he was in. The point wasn't to poke fun at a man in drag. Not even Christopher Walken (who I adore) could save this movie for me. If they wanted to remake this, they should have either followed the original story more closely or made it topical for this period in time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cringe inducing mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point, musicals were some of the biggest movies and some of those old musical films like "The Wizard of Oz", "The Sound of Music", "West Side Stories" have gone down as classics and are films that everybody knows. By the turn to the 21st Century, big movie musicals, for the most part, were a thing of the past. A few musicals sprouted up from time to time like Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge" and Rob Marshall's "Chicago". In 2007, a remake of the 1988 musical "Hairspray" was released and received much appraise from critics and moviegoers alike, saying that it upheld the spirit and style of the original "Hairspray" from 1988. I have never seen that movie, but if that's the case, I never want to see it.Focusing on pleasantly plump teenager Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), she lives in Baltimore in the year 1962 with her mother (John Travolta) and her father (Christopher Walken). Every day after school she rushes home with her friend Penny (Amanda Bynes) to watch the Corny Collins show, which features Tracy's crush, Link Larkin (Zac Efron) and his superficial girlfriend Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow). After a member of the show leaves, Tracy tries out and is selected to act as a substitute for the missing girl. Once on the show, she tries to integrate the show, to Amber and her mother Velma's (Michelle Pfeiffer) dismay.The main reason why this film fails is the musical numbers. With the exception of one or two of them, the songs are cringe inducing messes that go on for too long and are only separated by about ten to fifteen minutes of dialogue to give the viewer a break before having to endure more. In a movie musical, the musical numbers, including the song and dance sequences are some of the most important things. In this movie, they are the worst part of it, and they fill up what might be or at least feels like half of the movie.I have a feeling the TV show "Glee" took some inspiration from this movie for one reason, the characters in both. In both "Glee" and "Hairspray", the good characters are perfectly flawless while the bad characters are all evil and superficial. This is the lowest form of characters a movie can have because flaws and quirks in a character make them more interesting. In "Hairspray", Tracy and all of the other characters who are for integration are perfect while the characters who do not want it are all evil. One word can describe these characters: boring. The only characters I liked were the father, only because he was played by Christopher Walken, and a few of the characters that can barely be considered secondary characters because they did not annoy me."Hairspray" is a glass overflowing with boring characters, cringe inducing songs, and a story that is told in such a slow and boring way. The film is longer than it needs to be by about half and hour and this film that has a two-hour running time feels double that. If I were to make one suggestion of how to better this movie, it would be to make a more interesting protagonist with some sort of flaw or quirk to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather bad adaptation, a few fine moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, despite a few flaws, this remake (or adaptation) would be rather entertaining, if it wasn't for J. Travolta horrible character as Edna Turnblad, as many reviewers pointed out. Also, I wish they had dropped that 'negro day' fuss. Fortunately, from a purely glamorous perspective, Amanda Bynes looks awesome from start to finish.More a feel good musical spiced up with nonsensical discrimination issues than a full fledged movie with an actual script, character development and so on IMHO. I would rather use the term distasteful than awful to qualify it. Fun, but forgettable songs and uneven individual performances. Don't be fooled by Christopher Walken presence, even he cannot redeem this movie effectively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no desire to pay anything to see this film! I can not believe that John Travolta who I really like as nearly any character he has ever played could even attempt to recreate Divine's most incredible performance. I saw the original and it was awesome to see one of the world's best character actors (because you forget she is a he) play a woman and get away with it. Too Wong Foo was funny because Wesley Snipes (who is the farthest thing from a drag queen) and Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo were incredible. I think the prosthetic suit that made John Travolta a big woman was a cheap ripoff from Shallow Hal and Mrs Doubtfire. I think the filmmakers instead of cashing in on John Travolta should have used a real drag queen to pay tribute to one of the most famous drag queens of them all. I will watch it on TV only because they used John Water's 1988 script. If you see this as a tribute to Divine then it is supposed to be a fantastic version of a classic. I however won't give it a single red cent as I feel it is exploitive of overweight people for the sake of copying an amazing performance whether in tribute or not. Shallow Hal and Mrs Doubtfire made a point that incredible things come in big packages.I finally watched the new film (am I glad I didn't pay at the theater) John Travolta was worse than I thought he was going to be. Why didn't they have him use his regular voice, it would have been less pathetic...Divine blended into the movie, John stood out as the co-main character....Such is life.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was very unlike the original. The story line is barely discernible. John Travolta played a snivelling wuss of a woman and sounded exactly like John Travolta, not like a woman. Link is no supposed to flake out in the pinch on Tracey. Queen Latifa plays Motormouth with no panache and rarely rhymes. The scene with Pinky is completely off script. The costuming is nearly the only positive in the film, other than the lack of period bullet bra shaped dresses for the ladies. It's sad to see John Waters sell out and allow this movie to lose it message and poinancy. I could go on but there is no point. I'd rather turn my DVD player off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I learned from this movie:1. It's bigoted to call white kids "the nicest kids in town", but okay to say "the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice", "the darker the chocolate, the richer the taste", and "now I've tasted chocolate and I'm never going back".2. White girls want black boys, but black girls show no interest in white boys, and that's to be expected (because "they" can have "your" women, but "you" can't have "theirs").3. Black people are nicer, smarter, and WAY cooler than all the stuffed-shirt, bigoted, religious kook white people.4. If you work very hard at being a good dancer but completely let your body go to pot, you should still be put on stage, as long as you are one of the rare good white people.That having been said, Christopher Walken and John Travolta were brilliant and their interaction was priceless. They really rescued this movie, but then, they make can any movie they're in watchable.Unless you're a left-wing nut and really want your children to be indoctrinated with political correctness, please talk to them about this movie if they see it and don't just allow its brainwashing to fester in their little heads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had NOTHING to do with the original plot of "Hairspray" it totally missed several key points in the movie, and looked like a very cheap re-make of a wonderful film.John Travolta playing the part of a Tracy Turnblad's mother, was in itself one of the worst roles Travolta has done. The movie left out one of the most important key elements of which when Tracy Turnblad invented "The Roach."It was a classic flop in this person's eyes.Could not have been worse.Maybe a re-make can be done in a couple of years, re-casting and making the movie into something it once was........outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if there is one song that would describe the movie, it is YOU CANT STOP THE BEAT...there is really no stopping the beats. we do not really get a break from the songs, rather the volume was turned really low and about 3, 5 minutes later, here comes the beats for the next song. talk about building up the momentum.every dance and song number just makes you want to get up from your seats and dance. i personally liked WELCOME TO THE 60s, WITHOUT LOVE and of course YOU CANT STOP THE BEAT.john travolta as EDNA is a delight. a line on the WELCOME to THE 60's goes something like wel-co-oh-oh-me is just reminiscent of one of the songs he performed on GREASE. even as dressed as a girl, you can still tell that he's the reigning musical actor of this generation.of course, who can forget LINK's and CORNY's winks. props to zac efron for not letting troy bolton come across the screen.amanda bynes and sea weed is grrreat! she is super funny! this is what the recent musicals should have been.in a time of CGI effects and mind boggling plots, it's a relief that once in a while, a movie comes that you would just simply enjoy and makes you want to scream for joy! PS. please do wait for the curtain call as you would just feel the enthusiasm of the audience and how they enjoyed it. a couple of songs that weren't performed during the movie also play at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray-Spray It but Don't Necessarily Say It **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top-notch dancing and singing still can't save a very disappointing "Hairspray."While it is a feel-good movie, there are too many social problems dealt here in an unconvincing way.Travolta's performance as Baltimore laundress, Edna Turnblad, is disappointing at best. She really puts it on in an over-the-top performance. Her face is made to resemble a rat. What saves him is his excellent dancing from prior experiences in "Grease" and the great "Saturday Night Fever."There is a gem of a performance by Michelle Pfeiffer as the bigoted television manager. She will do anything to stop that teen show from integrating.Nikki Blonsky strongly resembles Marissa Jared Winokur, the Broadway Tracy. She is quite good in the role. She belts out those songs and dances up a storm with great determination.Queen Latifah is in fine form as a leader of the black singing and dancing group. Latifah adds to her performance as Mama Morton from "Chicago."Harvey Fierstein should have re-prised his role as Edna on the screen from Broadway. He captured that part due to his sexual preference. That's missing in the Travolta performance. While this is Baltimore 1962, the film is plagued with the worn out clich that black students make up the majority of detention room attendees. This is not the case. Regardless of race, if you misbehave, this is where you go. The detention room in this film is being depicted where black students dance up a storm. While many detention centers in urban settings are out of control, they're not exactly dancing up a storm there either. It would have been better to show the dancing actions outside of school such as at dismissal time.</fullReview>

Every day after school, she and her best friend Penny run home to watch the show and drool over the hot Link Larkin, much to Tracy's mother Edna's dismay. After one of the stars of the show leaves, Corny Collins holds auditions to see who will be the next person on the Corny Collins show. With all of the help of her friend Seaweed, Tracy makes it on the show, angering the evil dance queen Amber Von Tussle and her mother Velma. Tracy then decides that it's not fair that the black kids can only dance on the Corny Collins Show once a month, and with the help of Seaweed, Link, Penny, Motormouth Maybelle, her father and Edna, she's going to integrate the show.....without denting her 'do!

		<shortDescription>Awful, awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I have ever seen. None of the characters had any depth at all.John Travolta in drag was an absolute disaster as he looked like, well, John Travolta in drag. Why was he in drag? He wasn't playing a drag queen nor did it have a comedic element. Why not get a woman to play the role? It was just a disaster. The single worst drag performance I have ever seen.The dancing was ridiculous, the singing was silly, and the main evil character, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, was plastic and obvious. It was a Disney villain, so obvious that you would fall over it.The whole race issue was stupid too. Yeah right like they would respond by dancing happily and not be upset. How absolutely absurd.The main character was so repulsive that it wasn't funny. Pleasantly plump? No she was just plain ugly. Dressed all wrong too. So cheerful too, stupidly cheerful even. I thought that she was a guy in drag at first, but no there are women that look that bad, unfortunately.The plot was thin to the extreme. If it had been aimed at 5 or 6 year olds, perhaps such a thin plot with such plastic characters would be reasonable, but there were sexual themes, terribly involving 13 year old girls in pigtails, which was just plain disturbing. It wasn't exactly aimed at 5 or 6 year olds.It is quite simply an awful movie. An awful musical. A headache, an eyesore, with no good elements whatsoever. Poor Michelle Pfeiffer once again being thrust into a plastic role, as she was in Eminem's 8 Mile, and poor John Travolta, who, not for the first time, picked a really dumb role. Big name actors didn't save this film.There is nothing good about this movie. Oh sure there was razzle and dazzle, but the songs were so bad, the dancing so silly that there was nothing good about it in that sense either.Poor Zac Efron too, it should be added. He is an actor with some talent but his performance in this movie was just plain awful. His acting was appallingly bad.Strictly Ballroom had basically the same theme, with the corrupt judge and all, although I guess that this had an extra hint of race relations thrown in. But Strictly Ballroom had comedy and good dancing - amazing dancing actually. This movie did not. The race relations part were really poorly done. Nothing thought provoking there.I wish that there was a 0 vote here, or even a -ve vote. This is an awful, awful movie and I do not recommend anyone to watch it in any way, shape or form. If you see this movie, the musical based on it, or any other versions of this movie, run. Run to the hills. And don't come back.</fullReview>

It is extremely like that of High School Musical, so if you like that kind of thing maybe Hairspray is for you. I wasn't too excited to see it but I thought "Hey, maybe it'll turn out to be really great!" Uh oh. Big mistake. Hairspray makes you think of the ozone layer a lot.without much dialog or plot there is no suspense whatsoever and John Trevolta dressed as a plump mother is not pretty. The boy who catches the heroine's heart is Zac Effron with a hideous bit of hair curled at the end. UGHHHH. The bright side: Some of the outfits are nice and I had a few half hearted chuckles, but all in all Hairspray was a bubblegum glimpse of Hell. I strongly urge you to not watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was SO disappointed with this movie! I had been looking forward to seeing what John Travolta could do with the role of Edna, and several of the songs are part of my own musical theatre "hall of fame". About half-way through, I was thinking seriously about leaving, but kept hoping that, somehow, this movie could be saved. Alas. John Travolta as Edna was far too distracting -- he is such an iconoclastic actor, I just kept shaking my head and thinking, "Oh, John -- you are SUCH a long way from 'Grease'!" I realize that touches like Michelle's Pfeiffer's blue eyeshadow and Christopher Walken's stiff-sprayed hair were supposed to be campy and fun, but they ended up being glaring distractions. Of course, the story line is so lame (plucky pudgy girl tries to integrate Baltimore in 1962 through dance) that perhaps the distractions are deliberate. The dancing was flat-footed and mediocre and lack energy -- one cannot hear "You Can't Stop the Beat" without wanting to get up and dance, EXCEPT at this movie!! I kept watching the dance finale with a vague car-wreck sense of fascination, waiting for the moment that announces energy and passion for the music and the dancing -- and sat there in disbelief and disappointment when the credits start rolling. *Sigh*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's out on DVD already? And only released on the big screen in Oz four months ago? That makes a statement. I was looking forward to it with John Travolta and Chris Walken in it. But within five minutes I was waiting for it to improve but never did.But it was absolutely embarrassing. Music and dancing mediocre, and repetitious. Cinematography - ordinary. Script - very ordinary. Singing OK, kept the plot moving at least - that alone was absolutely unbelievable and non inspiring. Heavy people unless they are like Queenie were never sexy or invited to join in dancing like this anytime, particularly on TV. The main star was plain, frumpy and couldn't dance. I was expecting her to shed the pounds in her quest for fame, but she didn't. Boobs bouncing all over the place, short stature, shaking her over sized arse and was dancing wise, like a plum pudding doing her best to wiggle and bounce herself off the stage. Certainly a good advertisement to join Weight Watchers!Baltimore 1962, is not far from Washington DC, quite a sophisticated place. Introducing the plain gal as the plump teenage heroine, might encourage some that there is hope and fame in a world that is over zealous about physical appearance. But whom the spunky teenage hero falls for, eh. come on? And a white religious gal with a black guy six inches shorter than her?And honestly the afro Americans were the best looking lot in the whole movie. So that made a statement didn't it. No GREASE, FAME or even the Beach movies, and I am surprised even John Travolta didn't make a good female, like Eddie Murphy or even Dustin Hoffman.I felt it was tasteless actually. And I am going to ask for my rental money back from Civic Video as they have a 'do not like' get a credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated Good Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangely enough, if this musical film had been released 20 years ago in the eighties, it would have been quite a cinematic feat, but now 20 years later, this good movie seems dated, quaint, and at times manipulative. It's so mainstream, so full of the now expected cliques and politically correct integration and everybody get along themes that its release now is suggestive more of its unfortunate need to be released then its entertainment value. In other words, unlike Chicago or Moulin Rouge, Hairspray doesn't really add much to the cinematic experience than if one went to a live stage production of the same musical. The singing and the acting were all entertaining, but not great in part due to society having supposedly moved on. The retro aspect of this movie seems disconnected from today or if it isn't then its a sad indictment of how society hasn't really made much progress in the last 20 years. Chicago had the cynical look at lawyers that is popular even today, the fascinating look at murder and betrayal, and a whole cinematic courtroom feast while Moulin Rouge has the eternal bittersweet love story and a truly psychedelic musical visual banquet. Instead with Hairspray we get to see how John Travolta becomes a fat mother (transexual almost) with good acting. Oddly enough the star of the show was the little African American girl who won the contest and who out-sang everybody. The dubbing, lip sync onto the movie also was distracted as opposed to a live production. Nevertheless, the movie was entertaining, had good humor thanks to John Travolta, and had good singing voices that resonated but unfortunately 20 years too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the professional reviews and the comments I've read here, I had great expectations going in. The dancing is energetic but lacking in choreographic originality. The sets are mostly standard musical fare. Michelle Pfeiffer's villain was uninspired and consisted of too many mean looking mugs to the camera. Her seduction number in Christopher Walken's shop was cramped and stiff. The kids did their darnedest to please and for the most part succeeded but their singing and dance numbers had a sameness to them. The best one was Tracy's opening song as she wakes up, gets dressed and makes her way to school. John Travolta was fine, but almost any decent male actor in a female fat suit can be funny. But then I also was disappointed in Phantom of the Opera, which puts me in a grumpy minority, I suppose. My highest standards of excellence in this genre are Moulin Rouge and Chicago for films of the last decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, but people just kept talking about how great it was. Let me tell you, it wasn't that great. It will appeal to a certain demographic (children, some teens, and baby boomer adults who like corny movies). And it was almost decent until the middle where it just seemed to drag on.There were just so many bad things about the movie that I don't know where to begin. John Travolta as a woman was ... horrible. His accent, his acting, his make-up, and everything was a big FLOP. The dancing was the worst. Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken, can't dance to save their lives and should never try it on screen again. It was painful to watch.Amanda Bynes just smiled the entire movie and Nikki Blonsky wasn't nearly as interesting as Ricki Lake (who was the original Tracy in the 1988 film). Pairing her with Zac Efron was a mistake, especially since he looked confused and in his own world throughout most of the movie.I could go on and on about how the directors just found a bunch of big-named actors (well, sort of) of all ages and pieced them together in this long, drawn out movie, but I won't.I'll try to say something positive about the movie ... half of the songs were decent, but after a while they started to drive me crazy. The costumes were nice ... except for Blonsky's. (All they did was give her a white button -down shirt for nearly every outfit and sneakers that didn't work well). The sets and staging were nice and ...I really can't find anything else to say about this movie that's positive. Just be prepared for an overly extended movie that fails to measure up against other REAL musicals.</fullReview>

Firt of all this movie was supposed to be funny, the only funny thing was john Travolta playing a chick. The music was so awful and corny that I said not another damn song at the beginning of each, although the last one is pretty good but not great. I only saw this movie because I was forced to by my sister, it came out at about the same time as Superbad did and that is my favorite movie, when me and mys sister went to the movie she went and saw this crap and I saw Superbad. When we left see bugged about forever and kept saying it was better then superbad so I tried to watch it on DVD and I almost felt like throwing it out the door. I even skipped some scenes that my sisters said where not important. A Complete waste of time with terrible actors. Is it just me or is Zack Effron the gayest and worst actor ever???. Now I could go on and on about how awful this movie is but I would go forever so I will stop by saying DO NOT ON ANY SURCOMSTANCES SEE THIS MOVIE. It din't help that my sister played those song endlessly on her speakers. And I cant believe that it won best summer movie at the teens choice awards over superbad. You wanna know why its because over 80% of the people that vote are girls who only like it because the supposedly hot Effron is in it. Thanks for reading and heres some advice forget this and watch superbad its a better use of your existence, how this movie got 4 stars I will never know, probably a female critic.</fullReview>

And throughout the movie he was so cute and sweet. He's one of my favorite actresses. Amanda Bynes and James Marsden were also great. And lets not forget Queen Latifah who can do no wrong.My major problem was that the movie was not the play. The play was so happy and cute and everyone was perfect. The movie had some miscasting and was a little depressing at parts. Also the fact that some of the songs from the show were cut and new ones were written was a little disappointing. But besides that the movie was great.I'd say go see it but if you're a huge fan of the musical don't get your hopes up that it will be the same.</fullReview>

Though I respect why a fat girl might like it, as that is the starring role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hair Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It?s 1962?the '50s are out and change is in the air. Baltimore's Tracy Turnblad, a big girl with big hair and an even bigger heart, has only one passion?to dance. She wins a spot on the local TV dance program, "The Corny Collins Show" and, overnight, is transformed from outsider to irrepressible teen celebrity. But can a trend setter in dance and fashion vanquish the program's reigning princess, win the heart of heartthrob Link Larkin, and integrate a television show without denting her 'do? Welcome to the '60s! ugh it's like rancid meat you start eating but realize that it's disgusting and it makes you want your money. Hairspray 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racist crap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a dreadful piece of racist crap this movie is. Take away all the repetitive and thoroughly boring music and the frantic dancing and you have a racist screed. White people are, unless they are grossly fat and/or in Barney-drag, ugly racists of the worst kind, but black people are just the absolute best folk ever with not a mean bone in their bodies.Remember the next time you see a thin blonde woman that she really has her KKK hood and a bunch of nooses in her Fendi bag, and bro, she's lookin' to lynch you and put you DOWN! This message must not and should not be accepted as OK just because it is all overlaid with a hyper musical score. Hairspray ain't cute or entertaining--it is cultural pollution and an expression of the most thoroughly loathsome values.PS: Was this supposed to be a comedy? I thought comedies were supposed to produce some laughs. Silly me. John Waters's talent is akin to that of Ed Wood's, except Wood's was recognized as unadulterated crap by everyone, including Wood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is wrong with you people. This was the absolute worst movie in the history of film. I have never walked out in the middle of a movie in my life. But this movie SUCKED. Every song in the movie, and there were way too many of them, had the same basic tune, and what a moronic plot line. Make fun of blacks and their dancing and fat people. WOW!!!! WHAT A MOVIE PLOT. And what is the purpose of taking great actors like John Travolta, Christoper Walken, Michelle Pfeifer and wasting their time making a movie like this. Everyone of their parts could have been done by any jake leg and it wouldn't have made the movie any worse or any better. Shouldn't they all be doing something of content so that we could enjoy them in a good movie. What a total waste of talent. Absolute stupidity, and none of the lines brought even a smile to my face let alone a chuckle or laugh. I couldn't help but wonder what the other people in the audience were thinking when they laughed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major let down AKA: Shallow Waters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the 1st time I found the 1 film I can now add to my "Worst Films of 2007" list, &amp; "Hairspary" makes the grade. Let's see where to start?? 1st Amanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton needs to get a Razzie Nomination for Worst Supporting Actress, &amp; John Travolta a Razzie for Worst Actor! Oh, and a Razzie for Worst director and choreographer: Adam Shankman!!! John Tavolta, who floats through the movie like a Hindenburg in sequins. His performance, however, is more notable as a feat of engineering than of acting. Although appealing, it seldom rises above the level of an amusing stunt &amp; laughable. I'm a huge fan of the John Water's original, &amp; really never liked the Broadway musical, well I finally broke down &amp; saw the new vision (Or what ever you want to call it?) &amp; this "Hairspray" is 100% silly crap! Did John Waters sell out? Mellow with age? Hairspray the movie musical has been conceived and executed as a faithful record of the stage version, but that's all it is ? a recording! Michelle Pfeiffer sold her self out, or the rent must have been really due to sell yourself out for this! I'm boring myself writing this, almost as much as I was bored as this trite, superficial yarn unfolded on screen. Long story short, the fat chick somehow gets to be on TV shaking her junk with the beautiful ones, then gets into her head to make every day Negro Day. Cue the countless, endless musical numbers. Do yourself a favor and just revisit the original Waters film. I might sound like the musical Grinch, so be it. "Hairspray" rubbed me the wrong way and should've remained on the stage!!! Waters has a cameo in the opening scene as the neighborhood streaker, running around in a trench coat with nothing underneath. Soooo sad when your cameo is this since you have already sold out a loooong time ago!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, Mrs. Pfeiffer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't think an actress like Michelle Pfeiffer needs a movie like this. It's so foolish, boring and innocent that, like many other movies, don't worth to pay the ticket. It has no script, no sense... I always thought Michelle Pfeiffer as a serious actress but films like this make me think that she is going sadly down on her career. When I saw "I could never be your woman" I thought: "O.K. it's not a good film, but it's funny in a way", but, it's sad to see Michelle in a supporting role after so many years working hard with actors like Al Pacino, Sean Connery and Jack Nicholson, and directors like Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Brian De Palma, Stephen Frears or Garry Marshall (Frankie &amp; Johnny). Please, Mrs. Pfeiffer, don't give up! and keep on fighting, we love watching you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no words in any language to describe the stupidity of this movie. Just don't go near it. It was just terrible. I'm glad I had other things to do at work or else I would have lost it. About ten seconds into this piece of whale vomit I was ready to have a stroke, and I wasn't even watching it.The question that kept flowing through my mind was, "does it have a plot?". The answer is most definitely, no. I don't understand how anyone sat through this crap.If you are a strait, movie loving person, avoid this at all costs. There should be a not on the movie warning people with heart conditions to stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Dear God Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started to watch this, and actually walked out.I am a huge fan of the first Hairspray (John Waters) movie. This movie is a sad remake of an amazing original.Where to start, oh yeah...John Travolta. Who cast him? Who was his vocal coach? Has Mr. Travolta ever been to Baltimore? Has he ever HEARD the accent? What came out of his mouth sounded like Vinnie Barbarino after taking a shovel to the head. If that's Baltimore, I speak with a southern accent (BTW I am from Jersey). I understand he may enjoy wearing dresses at home in his free time but that does not mean he should have been cast in this role. Divine owned the role of Edna Turnblad. He left one huge bra to fill and no amount of stuffing will make that bra fit right on Travolta. He was the main reason I left this movie. Listening to him speak made me want to be the one who hit him with that shovel.If I could I would go to every movie theater and replace this movie with the original so that everyone could see it, and realize what a horrible disservice this remake does to the original.I've sat through many a bad movie, including Waterworld. I could not sit through this tripe. It was absolutely awful.Anyone who likes this movie, please, do yourself a favor and see the original? Please?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Bother - Just watch the original movie instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a horrible movie, just a second rate version of the original.Travolta is totally wrong in appearance. He looks like Tracy's fat older sister, instead of a frumpy 1960's mom. Michelle Pfeiffer is so awful you would think her acting coach for the role was Uma Thurman.I saw a newspaper ad for the film which had head shots of every major cast member EXCEPT the actress playing Tracy, the leading role. That sums up the movie perfectly: a typical Hollywood mentality trying to hang the movie on celebrities, instead of letting the film itself be the center of attention.Save your money and wait for it to air on HBO or SHOWTIME next year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the movie, the first thing that pops in my head is: a musical made for fat people to feel good. Don't know if thats true, but smells like propaganda stuff from a mile away. The funny scenes are the ones in which Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken appears. Oh, to make it clear: Michelle Pfeiffer steals the whole movie from ... ahem... Nikki Blonsky. Now, the musical part. The songs are not long, but VERY LONG. At least 10 minutes a song; I needed to fast forward through the God damn song. Two words, more than the vote I'm giving : awful movie. As a friendly advice I would say : don't waste your time watching crap like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hairspray=A real sticky wicket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm traumatized at how such a simply divine, "Corny Collins" cult classic could end up as flat as Pia Zadora's beatnik hair in the original. This gassy re-make should have been left in the can. Its Friday night in New York City, EVERYBODY is out and there is a buzz in the theater as everyone in attendance knows, (or at least thought) they are about to have a good time. I just saw the movie a half-hour ago and am having great difficulty recalling anything about this revival. One thing I can say for certain, it should have been filmed in Smell-O-Rama. It stinks. Even John Waters has a cameo and in it he seems to be running away from any association with this production. No one will be accused of being a spoiler as you'd have a tough time even identifying any plot elements, twists, suspense or surprises in this purely pedantic pop poop. I recommend renting the old Mom's "Jackie" Mabley movie, "Look out Baltimore" if you would like to know what the real soul of Baltimore feels like. John Waters recreated the period so well you could taste it. This version comes off more like a bad Disney after school special. Several of the veteran pros were superb, for instance Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walkin, James Marsden and the divine Queen Latifah rose the the occasion of delivering the camp that is the very essence of the the work. The ensemble showed great energy and were clearly giving it all they got to no avail. The "look" of the film was "Hollywoodized". I'm certain Waters got the majority of his wardrobe in the cult classic from thrift shops. ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CAMPY CHEAP AND TAWDRY. This updated version is too polished. It loses the romance of nostalgia. Queen Latifah steals the show in the civil- rights march. She is a natural. As for Mr. Travolta; remember Trans-America and Victor Victoria? A woman playing a man, playing a woman. The rumors will be flying again. Travolta was so uncomfortable in this role that that I felt ill at ease every time he was on the screen. BAD. It was as if he were an actor playing a man who is playing a woman but afraid that his inner woman might slip OUT. He walked all over the best one liners that Divine immortalized and slipped in and out of a weird semi-southern accent. In short, it seemed like he was afraid that his public might see the real him. Predictably, the Hollywood matzah mafia made certain that the biggest villain in the movie was a Christian zealot, Prudy Pingleton. Imagine a conservative woman in the 1960's not wanting her high school daughter to join "The Revolution" in the baddest part of Baltimore? Those Tinsel Town agnostics get so nasty after they sell their souls to secular nihilism. (Dare I hint that there was anti-Christian bigotry involved???) Sorry for the stinging review, I wanted to love it. A movie like the 1988 Hairspray is like a planetary alignment, pure serendipity. One word for 2007...Tacky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spunky cast, flunky direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bright and peppy musical that's equally saccharine and cynical - a tough trick to pull off. The cast is all around excellent, but Adam Shankman, who is a choreographer by trade, is pretty lame as a director. There is no style and everything plays out by the numbers, but the film needs a little vision to make the numbers work. Once again, the dancing is chopped to bits with quick editing so that not only is it hard to follow the moves, but nobody comes across as a very good dancer. We just have to accept it by the reactions of others. (The editor has primarily cut action movies - and it shows). Even more problematic, the movie builds to a major false climax, after which the already shaky story never regains its feet. Still, people excited to see Hairspray the Musical won't care much about all of that, and the cast has enough spunk to make it more than watchable. I say wait and rent it.</fullReview>

Queen Latifah was great and the actors who portrayed her kids were awesome. when they were on i wasn't bored.but those few moments were not enough, several people walked out and i would have joined them, except i wanted to see james marsden because you don't get to hear his great singing voice very often.i know Variety gave it a good review........maybe it's one of those love it or hate it movies........i am the latter!</fullReview>
