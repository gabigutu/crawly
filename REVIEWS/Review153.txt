		<shortDescription>This isn't a bad movie but it's not brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Triple 9 is a dark and gloomy story, which feels strongly inspired by Michael Mann's Heat. Unlike Heat, the film/script doesn't give the characters enough substance to make us care for their outcome in the film. The ordeals of the characters came and went without me feeling any real emotions towards any of them.This isn't a bad movie but it's not brilliant. There are a few of gun battle/action periods that are really well shot and entertaining enough to keep you interested in the film as a whole. It's not too predictable but there are not enough shocks or tense moments that you would expect from a thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high expectations, but alas, I was let down. Good actors and a plausible story, but inevitably Triple 9 fails to deliver. There are no characters I could really root for with the possible exception of Casey Affleck (just a little). I found myself yawning several times throughout - it just didn't hold my interest. No real back story so it's hard to fathom what these characters are really all about. Some sexy girls, guys with tattoos and attitude and bad cops. The bank robbery at the beginning was the most exciting part and it's downhill from there. Somehow I didn't buy Kate Winslet as a badass. The best line in the film was Woody Harrelson's reference to the Kosher Nostra - that actually got a few laughs. Don't say you weren't warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of star power with no power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am at a split when it comes to 'Triple 9'. On one end, there were few moments where I did enjoy the film. The actors are powerhouses and did what they could with the material given to them. Some plot points were interesting to me and had my attention and lastly, I am sure there is a certain symbolism behind the constant use of the color red that is shown in a high majority of scenes. On the other end, however, there was way too much I did not enjoy. From start to finish, I hardly understood any of the characters connections to anyone. They are explained in as little detail as possible. It just was not my cup of tea as far as understanding who the characters were and what was their purpose. Kate Winslet was absolutely atrocious to me. From her seemingly forced role to her forgetful "Russian accent" as she seemed to forget she was Russian at times speaking perfect English and bouncing back to an "accent". The fan- favorite star power of Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor and company was no where near enough to save this movie and draw enough of a crowd to make this movie even mistakenly good. Too many negatives and not enough positives. This movie is forgetful to me and nothing special. A few moments do not make up for a near two hours of confusion and plot holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Action / Short on cogent exposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Worth a look if you like urban action. There's a lot of action. The good guys and bad guys are really blurred but that's a modern flick for you. The police gang unit team line up to go after a gang member in group housing, up stairs and into the apartment was legendary. Great camera work. You felt like you were lined up with them. Worth the price of admission. After viewing, very few audience members would want to A: Become a police officer in Atlanta, B: Be tasked with arresting a gang member who knows you're coming. Adrenaline time. That's the good, along with plenty of recognizable actors doing representative jobs with what they have to work with. Now for the Not as Good: The plot is there but it is ephemeral. You can kind of follow it but the exposition makes you strain for it. I'd like to say that's on purpose to add an element of mystery but I'm not real sure that's so. Not a thinking person's movie. I've seen worse plots but the bones don't hold up the body to make it recognizable enough, at least for me. By the end you can figure it all out but it isn't built up a block at a time. I enjoyed it and gave it a 7 but it's about a 7.5. Maybe a triple 7?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances don't make a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crew comprising bent cops and crooks are forced into carrying out a complex heist for Russian gangsters in order to get paid.My synopsis is skeletal: it was either that, or go into great detail about a plot which is superficially complex by virtue of the number of different groups and subgroups involved, with crossover between them. This apparent complexity hides a relatively straightforward story which, itself, is cluttered up with texture and detail which obscures the main plot line (there is an extended sequence involving the graphic aftermath of a gangland slaying, the purpose of which is to illustrate relationships between certain of the characters and introduce a couple of minor characters who have important actions later, but this scene is given such detailed attention that one is misled into believing that it has greater plot relevance than is actually the case).A good and powerful cast work hard to bring life to a thriller which, I think, has rather less to it than meets the eye. Kate Winslet impresses by looking and sounding nothing like Kate Winslet, and pretty nearly everyone in this gives a good performance.But I was left puzzled at the end because I never felt the film had a sense of purpose to it ? the events happened and each character suffered a particular fate and then it ended. Yes, I know you can say that about most films, but the stakes in this were so high that I was expecting a resolution to the film which meant more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not essential viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since The Proposition was unleashed on audiences back in 2005, Aussie filmmaker John Hillcoat has made a name for himself as an uncompromising and ambitious auteur, bringing together A-list casts for bleak and uneasy thrillers. His latest Hollywood effort ? following The Road and Lawless ? dives into the grubby underground of Atlanta, where corrupt cops, ruthless bank robbers and Russian mobsters are often one and the same. A nice world this ain't. There's an unrelenting grimness to this noir-ish street saga that generates the desired mood, and the high level of dread permeating throughout proceedings maintains tension despite a predictably death-happy final act. Yet Hillcoat struggles to fully wrangle Matt Cook's twisty-turny screenplay; what could've been an intriguing web of lies, double-crosses and daring crimes becomes a less believable concoction of coincidences, plot contrivances and dubious character choices. Taking a leaflet out of Michael Mann's book of realistic action, the handful of set pieces are executed with flair, precision and unwavering violence, with an extended gun fight at the halfway point harking back to Mann's own Heat (albeit without topping it). Unfortunately the film is also let down by its vast array of players. Other than Casey Affleck's honest but worn-down cop, everyone else is evil and unpleasant to varying degrees ? and rarely more than a caricature ? making it hard to care about their fates. Hillcoat's menacing tone and visual ferocity ensure a certain level of interest and entertainment, but narrative and character weaknesses stop Triple 9 from being essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointingly average film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast for this film really made me want to see this film but unfortunately this film fails to deliver. The premise of this film sees a group of bank robbers trying to make there last score with a unique method. Chiwetel ejiofor plays the main robber and he is a great actor. He does the best job possible in this role its just that his character is so unlikeable that you end up not caring about him. Casey Affleck plays the good cop in this film and He does a really good job in the role and probably gives the best performance in the film. Another good performance is by woody harrelson who plays the cop going after the crew and he gives a charismatic performance. Anthony Mackie gave some humanity to his character which made him the most likable of the crooks. Also aaron paul had an interesting role in the film that I kind of wished had been fleshed out a little more. The story is pretty by the numbers with not much new. There are some good relationships developed but overall pretty basic. Thev script was very dull and boring with not much going on either dramatically or humour wise. The style had some really good suspense to it that had me on the edge of my seat. But the film is a drag at times and goes on for a bit too long. Overall this is a really average movie that I wouldn't say is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm so sorry, but this film just dropped the damn ball!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things to say: the cast is really, REALLY good. Just the names alone can get me into a movie theatre, but they also hinder the movie in ways I'll soon discuss. I've seen one reviewer here compare the movie to Se7en, whereas I think its closer to movies like Before The Devil Knows You're Dead and Crash: both ensemble films that feature no concrete lead, and are bleak and very relentless in their bleakness. The plot of this movie is that a group of criminals consisting of corrupt security personal and cops are blackmailed by a Russian mob leader's wife into committing a crime to get him released from prison. In order to pull off said crime, the criminals decide to commit a 999 - the titular Triple 9 - and kill a police officer on the other side of town while they commit the robbery. The story then follows the officer in question, Chris Allen, the criminals led by Michael Belmont, and the detectives investigating the plot as led by Jeff Allen - Chris' uncle.Good points - the cast is great, and the cinematography and action are both perfect for what this movie needs. The film looks the right balance between well put together and dirty in its set-up and feel - you feel in the action, but the action is captivating that you feel like a joyful observer. The action scenes are very well handled, and director John Hillcoat is great with all of choices of camera angles; we see all the important parts of the action scene, so the audience can enjoy the tension and pace of them.But NOW to the big problems with this movie. Firstly, it is not a movie with a good narrative flow, especially after Kate Winslet's character becomes an active catalyst in the plot; one plot decision that makes little sense is that Irina (Winslet) decides to get Belmont (Chwetel Ejoifor) to partake in a tough job that requires a big crew by murdering a crew member of his. When it's further revealed that she is the aunt of Belmont's son and has him already, that makes this senseless act even more illogical, as surely THAT is leverage enough? Other narrative decisions, like the Mexican cartels that show up and then disappear without a valid reason - except for the Triple 9 that honestly could be done by anyone, hell, even one of the corrupt cops could've done it themselves - or the wasting of very potential set pieces, like the elevator at the end of the film, that could've been good. And an ending scene that feels abrupt, cut off, and like it was not meant to end there, but just did.Speaking of the cast, specifically Winslet, I have to comment on her performance first. She plays the leader of the Russian mob, and whilst she is certainly a talented actress, she is NOT the physical fit for this role, as she feels immensely unintimidating for a reason I can't quite place, but just feel. It's certainly the weakest performance in the main cast, with Woody Harrelson as the best, playing the most likable, awesome character in the film who I just love - good old Jeff, who solves problems, protects those he cares about, and has a cynical, cool humour about him. The criminals are well acted, but the problem is that none of them are particularly different to each other; all of them, essentially, are terrible people with a personal issue that they are deal with, but are just terrible people at the end of the day. They are the kind of both who are hard to distinguish; you have two brothers, played by Aaron Paul and Norman Reedus, two black men with similar sounding names and appearance, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mike and Anthony Mackay as Mark, and Clifton Collins Jr. who is the most different visually, but also not really different enough as he's just bad like the rest of them. They are the kind of characters that if played by B-name actors I wouldn't remember, which is not a good thing.This is not a bad movie - I just really, REALLY wanted it to be better. I certainly didn't hate it, I just didn't like it like I wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cop vs Dirty Cop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Triple 9 (spoiler free)Directed by John HillcoatDistributor: Entertainment One.Cast: Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Academy Award Nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor*, 2 time Academy Award nominee Woody Harrelson**, Aaron Paul, Academy Award Winner Kate Winslet***, Norman Reedus.Plot: A gang of criminals and corrupt cops plan to kill an officer to pull off the biggest heist yet across the town.Casey Affleck stars as Chris Allen the nephew of Sergeant Detective Jeffrey Allen (Harrelson) the cop behind the investigation of catching the criminals, and figuring out who the corrupt cops are. Terrell Tompkins (Ejiofor) is the leader of the corrupt cops lead by Irina Vlaslov (Winslet), Winslet's stand out performance really puts the film together kind of like in last year's Steve Jobs.Although this dark and gritty cop thriller was almost never made by Australian director John Hillcoat (The Proposition, The Road), mainly because of production problems and loads of actors dropping out. For example Shia LeBeouf became Charlie Hunnam became Casey Affleck for Chris Allen, then Michael B. Jordan became Mackie as Marcus Atwood, Cate Blanchett replaced for Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz for Woody Harrelson. It's courageous yet patchy in parts but still gets the story through, but not as good as Dennis Villeneuve's criminally underrated Sicario (2015) it still is a gripping and action packed adventure. These are the reasons why I think this is a must see thriller:Captivating set-pieces: There are several set-pieces used in the film one of them even takes the film to the next level. The main set-piece that will grab your attention is the Ram Raid around the middle of the film, that is truly an original set-piece that is very gripping.Strong Cast: The cast really makes this film people like Chiwetel Ejiofor known 12 Years A Slave, and last years The Martian, Anthony Mackie plays The Falcon in so many Marvel films, Finally the real performance comes from Kate Winslet and her very convincing Russian accent. They make this film a must in my opinion.Finally with the amazing action and intense set-pieces this film is like Point Break vs Sicario and is truly a once in a life time thriller that will have you gripping your seat from start finish. Although it is not for the faint-hearted. Verdict: If you like Se7en and Animal Kingdom and very dark cop thrillers this is the film for you. 8/10 a must watch.*Best performance by an Actor in a leading role 12 Years a Slave (2013), **Best performance by an Actor in a supporting role The Messenger (2009) &amp; Best Actor in a Leading Role The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), ***Best Actress in a Leading Role The Reader (2008).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triple 9 - review: What the hell just happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The red band trailer is amazing; When I first saw that trailer, I was game for an intense action thriller (Training Day on crack), however, what I got was...Positives:#1. A through Z (all across the board), all of the actors in this movie delivered convincing performances#2. The opening robbery scene is intense and engaging throughout#3. You know why some of the characters are doing the things that they're doing. Nothing is really explained in full context during the movie; How did some of these characters get involved with the mob? However, I did understand a majority of the characters motivations. When things happened, the characters reacted (no matter how irrational), and I understood where they were coming from.#4. The main crew felt like a close family. We (as an audience) didn't get to spend a lot of time with most of the characters, but during certain scenes you could feel that they were all close to one other.#5. Some deaths linger on. A character may die, you really don't get to know them, but the characters won't let you forget who died.#6. Information is continuously pounded into your brain throughout. I had to remember names, events, and situations. All of the information may make some feel exhausted, but I found it exhilarating.#7. There will be blood, death, and brutality. This movie definitely depicts realistic violence.Negatives:#1. I didn't care who lived or who died; The characters don't let you forget, but if I can't build any sort of relationship with the character, than why would I care.#2. The movie does continuously pound information into your head (which I did like), but it ultimately goes nowhere. By the end of the movie... just throw the info out the window because it ultimately means nothing (WTF!)#3. Unfortunately, this movie uses a "MacGuffin" device to further its already absurd plot.#4. The movie starts in a good place, it feeds us supposedly promising information, it goes down a promising path, and than at the end... what the hell! There's no pay off. There's no satisfaction to be had here. By the end of it all, you finally realize that none of that previous crab really matters... at least that's how I felt anyway.#5. This is a by the numbers movie. I wouldn't say that it's totally predicable, but there isn't anything here that you haven't already seen.I really was enjoying this movie from the start, through the middle ( a little), and than the ending happened. Some moments are intense, others are dumb, some make no logical sense, and than the ending is just a complete throwaway.This movie is no Training Day on crack... WTF!... I really had high hopes for this movie. Maybe My exceptions where to high. By the way, everything is spoiled for you if you watch the trailers.Finale Grade: D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many stars. Not enough time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's as though the director was trying to combine, Heat (1995) with Colors (1988) but ended up with a film as good as neither.It begins well with lots of action. Then slows to establish characters, and then desperately tries to speed up again but fails. It just kinda meanders to a stop rather than to an end.The star studded line-up almost seemed to hold it back. It was as though all the A-listers demanded at least 15 minutes of screen time each, and the end result was lots of scenes which should have ended up on the editing room floor, but didn't.A story and a cast with tonnes of potential, poorly executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin and Crooked Blue Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Triple 9, set in the gun-ridden streets of Atlanta, is surprisingly well executed and at times impressive to look at. But it does leave a rather unpleasant after-taste: like last year's Liam Neeson vehicle "Run All Night", virtually no one in the film has a redeeming feature which makes it difficult to empathise or root for anyone.The excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Twelve Years a Slave") plays Michael Atwood, the leader of a gang doing a bank job for the Russian mafia led by Irina Vlaslov (Kate WInslet). The gang stay one step ahead of the local cops by plotting patrol car movements on a GIS map: that's pretty easy for them since they are all crooked cops and ex-military. Atwood's character is intimately linked to Vlaslov's, as he has a son with her sister Elena (Gal Gadot). But the mafia is not easy to please and Atwood is strong-armed into doing a second, more challenging job that requires a significant police diversion. This diversion is the root of the "999" of the title: the call sign for "officer down". Investigating the robbery and the subsequent chain of events is flawed cop Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson), who is also trying to help his nephew Chris (Casey Affleck) aclimitise to the city's gang culture following a transfer from a much cushier neighbourhood. The strands of the story intertwine to violent and bloody ends as Atwood fights to protect his family and escape the ever-tightening grip of the mafia and the closing net of Harrelson's dogged detective.All the performances here a generally excellent. Ejiofor is an actor who perfects the look of being totally hacked off, and here he has plenty of opportunities to exercise that. His closest colleague Belmont (Anthony Mackie, Falcon from the "Avengers" films) is also extremely watchable. Elsewhere, the shapely Miss Gadot is a little too one-dimensionally drawn for my taste, but the other members of the gang and Harrelson and Affleck as the two 'good guy' cops are nicely portrayed. The most surprising turn though is that of Winslet who revels in her evil Russian bitch persona, a role diverging from her usual norm and which is great to watch. The story and screenplay by newcomer Matt Cook is sufficiently dense to require attention in following it ? it reminded me in places of "LA Confidential" ? and like that film contains enough twists and turns to keep up the interest. Character development though is limited, so when the twists do happen its an "oh" rather than an "OH!". The screenplay is let down by a bit of a damp squib of an ending and one that doesn't bear close scrutiny ? if you've seen the film, the hero is SURELY in more imminent peril in the two minutes preceding the denouement?? But the journey to get to the ending is satisfying enough. Cinematography (Nicolas Karakatsanis, "The Drop") and film editing (Dylan Tichenor, "There Will be Blood") are also worthy of note, particularly with the impressive opening titles which straight away tell you this is not just A.N.other cop 'B' movie.The robbery scenes and one involving a police raid on an apartment building are both well edited and exciting. So, in summary, a good solid job by director John Hillcoat ("The Road") that is worthy of your rental dollar. Just make sure you have some TV/movie 'sorbet' to cleanse the palate after watching.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)</fullReview>

They plan to kill a cop (Atlanta PD code 999 is the officer down radio sign, hence the title) to create a large enough time-frame to get things done.This film has a some pros; the cast is good, the Atlanta back-drop is nice and the overall technical look and feel is decent.

		<fullReview>I can't say this is a bad movie, it's actually quite watchable. But the flaw is that it's not a very enticing movie. The trailer is way more enticing and entertaining than the actual movie itself. I could tell they tried to go in a gritty and impactful movie, but compared to other street or cop dramas out there this one just doesn't stand out at all. Even TV shows have a more in-depth and disturbing parts compared to this movie. This movie has a great cast, especially for a street/cop thriller such as this. But it lacked the impact, momentum and gut churning moments that build tension to make it stand out. This is actually quite a forgettable movie. Most of the cast just seemed to have been wasted in this. None of them have any moments that actually makes them shine or stand out, because there is no memorable scenes. Maybe because I got a bit desensitized because I have seen a lot of thrillers that are better than this one. This is a movie that deals with crooked cops try to deal with idealistic cops with 2 heists thrown in. Overall, despite the good cast it's a very lacking thriller.5.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We pray at the same alter." In this town cops and criminals are the same people. When a gang is caught and blackmailed by the Russian mob they only have one option other then death. They are to break into a special forces safe house and steal classified government files. Without any real choice the crew realizes that the only way to pull this off is to set up a 999 call. When criminals, good cops, and bad cops all become involved something is bound to go wrong. I was actually looking forward to watching this. The cast is incredible, the idea sounded very interesting and I was hoping for a movie along the lines of Smoking Aces, but a little more serious. I wondered why it came and went in the theaters so fast but I was still excited. I watch and review every movie I order for the store and because of that 99% of the time I review my first impression of the movie. I did something I never do with this one. I watched it twice because I figured it couldn't have been as bad as my first impression was. After the second viewing I came to the conclusion that this was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. I'm not sure how a movie with an idea this interesting and a cast this great can drop the ball so badly but they did.

		<shortDescription>Awesome Director + Awesome Cast = Win-win, Right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It didn't take much convincing to get me into the cinema for this one. I've been looking forward to it for a while, not for it's content and concept, but purely for the names attached. John Hillcoat has yet to make a bad movie, and I figured him finally tackling present day could yield some interesting results. Pairing him with his biggest and most impressive cast yet could only bring further promise.Unsurprisingly, Triple 9 is driven by it's characters, with a handful of impressive, gritty action setpieces to keep the audience's attention. We follow characters on both sides of the law, including the murky grey in the middle, but no-one is particularly likable. We have Mike, head of the criminal crew plotting an officer down code as a distraction. He's in with the (Jewish?) mob more than he'd like by way of having had a son with the boss' sister, Elena, giving Irina, the boss, more leverage over him than he'd like. His crew is made up of army buddy Russel, his deadbeat brother Gabe, Gabe's Gang Unit cop friend Marcus, and another dirty, somewhat psychotic cop Franco. Marcus has just been assigned a newbie as a partner; Chris, who just so happens to be the nephew of Jeff; the head of the Homicide division. Of course with such ties, it's the newbie who ends up as the target of the triple nine.Each one gets varying degrees of character development, but due to their being so many characters, it's unsurprising that there might not be as much as you might hope. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mike as a sharp leader who's just unhappy with his situation and what he's made to do for the sake of his own son. Kate Winslet hams it up a little bit as Irina, but never quite reaches the amount of intimidation required for the role, and you wonder why Mike doesn't just shoot her in the face and be done with it. Casey Affleck is a little dull as Chris, who's probably the most likable character by accident, having no discernible character beyond being the guy thrown into a world he doesn't entirely understand. Anthony Mackie, however, manages to bring a bit more depth to Marcus than any other character/actor. As the guy tasked with initiating the triple nine, he suffers a strike of conscience at inconvenient times, but is still ultimately a corrupt cop. Aaron Paul does what he does best with Gabe, which is walk around lost with tears welling up the whole time, although in Triple 9, at least his character has good reason. Clifton Collins Jr. plays the semi-psychotic Franco with as much cold heart as is necessary without making the audience wonder how he got passed the police tests in the first place. Woody Harrelson's Jeff is the well- meaning drunkard, who is as close to a show-stealer as Triple 9 gets. Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot, and Michael K. Williams all make small and underdeveloped appearances throughout, as Russel (the only guy on the crew who seems to have his head screwed on), Elena (who exudes bad mother), and Sweet Pea (transvestite pimp who has her ear to the ground) respectively.In truth, the impressive cast was necessary just to be able to keep track of who was who at times. There isn't enough time to get particularly attached to any of them as the plotting keeps the movie moving quite thoroughly, although I must note there were some questionable holes (such as, you have the guys son, why not use him rather than offing one of his crew members and making it infinitely harder for him to get the job you want done). Dotted about are some smatterings of action, and to be honest, this is where the film's strength lies. The movie opens with the bank job that doesn't quite go to plan as Gabe gets a bit greedy, resulting in them all covered in red dust. Of course there's the second half of the job which makes up the movie's climax in the third act as well, but in the middle we switch perspectives a bit and follow a police raid in the heart of Mexican gang territory, and absolutely marks the movie's high point.Story wise, holes aside, there's quite a lot going on and quite a lot to keep track of. Everyone seems to be interrelated somehow, and it can take a bit of work on the audience's part to connect all the dots together. Most of the plot is focused around the characters themselves, as I've mentioned, but it cleverly uses this to guide the outcome of the movie. It feels like the writer came up with the idea, came up with the characters, and then threw them together and followed them individually along the timeline to figure out how they'd end up at the end, and what their role would be. This results in some fairly unpredictable twists and turns that make complete sense from the perspective of the characters.In all Triple 9 is a solidly enjoyable movie. It's not the masterpiece I'd hoped for, marking itself probably as Hillcoat's worst movie, but that's not really saying a lot as all his work is top-tier. Every actor does their job to the best of their ability, hamstrung only by the amount of time and space they get given to work on their characters. Triple 9 is less than two hours in length, but there's a lot to fit in, which makes it feel like quite a long movie. Thankfully it never rushes through, and makes enough time to linger on moments a little longer than you might expect. I give Triple 9 an enjoyable 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll make this short and sweet. I really wanted to like this movie. With its insanely talented cast, this should have been way better than it actually was. It is well acted, and the cast did the best they could with the material given to them.However, it all gets lost in what tries to be a convoluted plot. This wants to be a really good heist movie (with very well executed action scenes, granted), but in reality it is just a sub-par, predictable action movie filled with your run of the mill, dirty cop dialogue filling the scenes trying to move the plot forward. Rent it for a rainy evening, but don't expect anything you haven't already seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavily inspired by the superior 'The Town' but lacks the focus and a character to root for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to get overwhelmed with the abundance of A-list actors in this ensemble cast but it quickly tires you down with its under-cooked run-of-the-mill script. One might look at it as a darker and brooder version of the superior 'The Town' but I don't think the makers were able to put the pieces of their puzzle together neither interestingly nor in totality. While the intention was to have a realistic depiction of dirty cops, junkies, heists and police reactions, every single character is hell bent on being heroic without a purpose and not a care for their dear lives - which is the most unrealistic one could see.999 for the uninitiated is a police code for 'officer down, all units respond'. A group of mercenaries and dirty cops - Michael (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Marcus (Anthony Mackie), Gabe (Aaron Paul) and Russell (Norman Reedus) are to pull off a job partly due to money and a hold the Russian mafia led by mob boss wife Irina (Kate Winslet) has on Michael through his wife Elena (Gal Gadot) and son Felix. The investigators led by Jeffrey (Woody Harrelson) stumble on to a solid lead that could crack open the investigation while Chris (Casey Affleck) who joined recently is taken for a ride by Marcus with a devious intention.Couple of questions first - it is incomprehensible how each character convinces the other to do something risky and stupid with very little in return, above that is how the makers convinced each of these actors to do something just dull with so little in return. We are not just talking about the ones who are budding actors trying to make a mark like Anthonie Mackie or Aaron Paul - it has veterans like Kate Winslet and Woody Harrelson. While Gal Gadot hardly has any role to play, Kate Winslet's portrayal of a Russian mob boss is very B-grade. However it does have some good points like Harrelson's portrayal of the semi-good cop until the last scene, the way the car backs up when Michael was lying on the ground, the first heist with the red gas overflowing the car or the way the plastic explosive cracks open a guard's leg. They were inventive and well executed but hardly creates an impact on top of its dull background.Heavily inspired by the superior 'The Town' but lacks the focus and a character to root for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Combination of wrong path and untrustworthy troop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should have been the Hollywood's bad boys film. I mean the big cast names are expected like the earlier films of QT, or especially like 'The Departed'. There were many who dropped out of it for various reasons prior to the production commence, although this cast did a great job. In my finding I blame for the screenplay. It was a good story, but the first half was not very interesting compared to the next half, which was so brilliant, especially towards the end, mind blowing.It was a multi starrer film, only that's much I know, but I kind lazy to count how many were there because I thought it was a modernised and an improvised cop version of the 'Ten Little Indians' theme. There's no evidence to prove that, it is just my theory. But seeing all the deaths and the conclusion, I felt the inspiration to the writer might have been possible.From the director of 'Lawless' who aimed for another success, but received backfire from critically and commercially. Mixed response from the audience though. Definitely it will find its own fans in the days and years to come. The ladies had scopeless roles, so they're completely forgettable their existence the narration, except very often just appear to show the faces. But well made crucial parts, in all the action sequences which kind what back the films along with Casey and Harrelson's parts.Like there is a saying, 'slow start, but ended strong', this film belongs to the same category. If you hold your patience for nearly 2 hours long, in the end you might feel after all it was not a bad flick. So not recommended to everybody, at a same time not suggested to skip it without properly knowing about it. P.S, the closing credit song, the remix version of 'Pigs' by Cypress Hill was awesome considering the theme of the film, I mean the corrupted cops, but felt the words were strong.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd crime drama that gets a pass thanks to Hillcoat's signature brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boasting an enormously talented ensemble cast and a multi-layered story of corruption and greed set in the murky criminal world of the Russian mafia in Atlanta, John Hillcoat's Triple 9 has the ambition of Michael Mann's Heat (1995) but neither the scope or the running- time to convincingly pull it off. Telling the tale of a gang of hardened criminals and bent coppers coming together to pull of a heist, and then another, to save the skin of a brutal Russian mafia boss, it is hardly the most original entry into the crime genre, but manages to sneak a pass thanks to some splendid visuals and Hillcoat's signature brutality that gives the film a unique, raw edge.Two cops - Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.) - and three criminals - gang leader Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and brothers Russell (Norman Reedus) and Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul) - come together to rob a bank in order to retrieve a security deposit box containing evidence against the husband of mafia boss Irina (Kate Winslet). After a narrow escape, they are refused payment and are ordered to pull off another job to again retrieve data on Irina's husband. The job is near-impossible, so the gang come up with an idea of triggering a 'triple 9' call, which involves all police responding to an 'officer down' and heading to the location of the incident, therefore diverting all attention away from them. Marcus's new partner Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), a bullheaded new recruit quickly making enemies with the Mexican gangs, is chosen as the ideal candidate.There's an undeniable star power to Triple 9, and the film struggles to allow them all the chance to shine. Because of the lack of running time required to properly develop the many characters, they are either painted with incredibly broad strokes or so thinly that they are relegated to merely 'tough good guy' or 'tough bad guy'. Weaving in and out of the main set the central story is crack- snorting Detective Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson), the hard-nosed yet likable sergeant investigating the gang, who also happens to be Chris' uncle. Just in case his questionable drug habit isn't enough, the camera insists on showing us every bead of sweat running down his unwashed brow to reinforce the idea that this really is a tough guy who doesn't play by the rules. Triple 9 is sadly chocked full of tired genre clichés, right down to the tacky dress-sense of Winslet's Russian gangster, all big hair and garish outfits.Despite the immense talent of its actors, lazy writing and too much time spent watching these characters flexing their muscles at each other means that none really make an impression. Ejiofor certainly tries, but he fails to make us sympathise with his character, who is supposed to be the conflicted emotional core of the film, and Paul repeats his Jesse Pinkman shtick without the benefit of 5 seasons worth of character development. Things lighten up when a few heated exchanges simmer with tension, as Hillcoat makes it clear from the outset that no character is safe. With his best films, The Proposition (2005) and The Road (2009), Hillcoat demonstrated a real talent forging an extremely dark mood, brimming with atmosphere and lurking threat, but here, he manages it only fleetingly, finding little time to do so amidst an overstuffed plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing and confusing mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a few corrupt policemen in Atlanta, who have to plan a heist to rob the Department of Homeland Security for the wife of a Russian mafia boss.The fact that it contains so many famous actors and actresses make it a must watch for me. However, it is also the reason why I find the story very confusing because it contains so many characters. None of the characters are developed well, and they are not even introduced properly. In fact most of the time I don't know who is who, or who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. The confusion is compounded by my inability to distinguish between Casey Affleck, Aaron Paul and Norman Reedus! "Triple 9" has a complicated plot, and it is not told well. There are too many things that have to be deciphered by the viewers. Clues appear so momentarily, and frankly it is not enough for me to piece together what really happened. I am disappointed to find it a confusing mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do NOT believe ANY mainstream CRITIC REVIEW of this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something seriously amiss about the bad reviews of this film! Okay, maybe I'm just 'completely crazy'. It's entirely possible. While it's not like it's the greatest film crime drama/ heist film to ever hit American cinema, for this film to receive the reviews it's getting is down right disgusting to me! (More so then any violence ever depicted in this movie).In fact, there is a scene in the movie where one of the characters says something to the effect..."You are targeted!". Well that's exactly how I feel critics and film snobs are reviewing this movie. First of all, I'm a movie lover (first) of ALL genres, AND I've actually written an indie $25 million dollar movie that appeared on thousands of screens, not to gloat but just to give you some perspective. And my movie was ripped by critics and film snobs alike too.(And that ripping was deserved!),just to show you some humility, but these reviews are not just when it comes to this film.But think about it for a second...what IS exactly a "professional critic" OR "film snob" critic? For starters, neither have ever written/directed/starred/ or produced a film that was any good OR cost millions of dollars of someone's money. EVER! So f' them all to begin with. A bunch of hack nobodies that can't actually create anything themselves, with the exception of garnering some popularity for being "said critic". Like seriously...losers if you ask me. If they're so good at evaluating movies. Why don't they go out and smash grab a couple of ten million dollars or so and actually PRODUCE something besides a review of another's work?! But I was a FILM LOVER, waaaaaay before I got into the biz...and this crime film was very very good! The first thing that caught my eye, was that the acting performances were stellar. I've never seen Casey Affleck so good, and I've never EVER seen Kate Winslet so diabolical OR as 'sexy' before this film. (I didn't know she had in it her for both so kudos to her! And as long as we are talking "cinema snobs", I actually read a "critic review" that discussed how bad Winslet's 'Russian Accent" was in this film. Really? We are now going to rip an "Academy Award" winning actress for her accent in a "crime drama" movie that was meant for just pure entertainment of the genre and is not supposed to be fing Citizen Goddamn Kane or Gone with the fing Wind? Well, yes we will apparently so exactly that. As if we can ALL do it better.I LOVED Woody Haralson's character in this film. Yeah, we've seen bits and pieces of this type of character from him in the past, but he's great in this! Okay, yes, Norman Reedus is a little bit "Daryl", and yes, Aaron Paul is a little bit "Jessie Pinkton" (Do we NOT still all love those characters???), they are still very very good in this movie too! And I have to admit, Even though I've seen them, I'm not as familiar with Chiwetel Ejiofor or Anthony Mackie, BUT I AM NOW....and will be following for sure in the future..both will be house hold names in a few years.And Clifton Collins Jr.....I almost didn't recognize him...but a great actor that's been around for YEARS...and will also probably finally be a household name within a few as well. I hated him in this movie..."as a character"...and that's exactly how we were supposed to feel! And what about the giant set of balls (no pun intended when you see the film)of actor "Michael Kenneth Williams" for his role of "Sweet Pea"! Come on, now! Okay, now let's talk about "crime/drama/heist movie/ plot. The plot is a bit different than most heist films too. It trends on the darker side, like a Reservoir Dogs type film, but it's NOT trying to be Reservoir Dogs either. It's more of a 'Departed, meets "Reservoir Dogs", meets 'Training Day' type movie...without all the self importance! Now as for the Director/Writer team of John Hillcoat &amp; Matt Cook, I'm honestly not that familiar with either, although I really did like Hillcoats "The Road", but I'm looking out for their future stuff now too because of this film. Great directing and writing.Oh, and btw, what big studio film put this out??? NONE. Is your answer. It's purely an bigger budgeted 'indie film" produced by (count them) 21 PRODUCERS! That either put their heart, blood, sweat, money..or....made a phone call or lend-ed their name for half a sec. (it's Hollywood, people, that's how indies get done sometimes)to get this sucker made.And yet it's ripped by "Hollywood Critics" and "Film snobs" alike.My point is, if you like a really good, non academy award winning, non film snob, non big budget, non big studio, non Hollywood machine, non anything that is popular (beside the cast) type crime film....SEE THIS MOVIE...it's worth your $15 at the box office, it's worth your $10 to own, it's worth you're $6.95 to rent/stream in HD, it's worth your $1 at Redbox. It's just worth seeing period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is the gang version of The Departed (2006)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Departed was a movie about the biggest police operation ever. No one knew who was on whose side and the criminals the police operation targeted were small time criminals. The movie was full of twists that were not believable for the characters, in fact a lot of the characters were basically plot elements that existed solely to execute a twist. Why am I saying this? Because Triple 9 (2016) shares awfully lot similarities with The Departed. We have lots of gang members, crooks and police forces here and none of them are really fit to their job. We have some Russian criminal organization who doesn't matter at all, but still runs the whole city and all the events. The settings are the exact same for the organization run by Jack Nicholson's character in The Departed. What Triple 9 does better than The Departed is making the characters believable. They are still a complete mess, but make much more sense than the character actions in the end of The Departed especially. The biggest factor that makes me compare these movies is the body count at the end. Everyone is killed by someone, just like in The Departed, but this time the killers are much more believable. The run time is also much more reasonable with Triple 9, but all in all this movie is less memorable for sure. Shame the original score in this one is basically nonexistent and stands out by being so non-noteworthy.Would I recommend this movie then? Well, it is definitely a must watch for people who enjoyed the Martin Scorsese movie, or the original film Infernal Affairs (2002) which The Departed was based to. I think the film is average, but works well as a crime movie that it is. If you are in need for a crime movie, then you might as well entertain yourself with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triple 9 is corruption intermingled with a heist story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about Triple 9 is that it has actors who can really act, and a director who can really direct. Just look at the star cast; you will be blown away to pieces by the number of veterans it packs. But the big question is does John Hillcoat use them enough? TRIPLE 9 THEME: GET YOUR SPOILER SEAT BELTS ON The movie justifies its moniker as it capers around the theme number of times. Pulling a Triple 9 as a diversion so that a robbery could progress unimpeded is what the movie endeavours to run its plot on. However, it focuses on everything else leaving out that perfect crime that it should have aced.Triple Nine movie also tries to weave a complex story that entails dirty cops getting greedy for moolah, Russian clients withholding money to get more jobs done, threatening the team and familia to see the latter through, and betwixt all the commotion pulverizing a clueless good cop.TERRIFIC DIRECTION OF TRIPLE NINE MOVIE The way Triple 9 has been helmed will leave you appreciating the knack Hillcoat retains for acing cop-robbery movies. His pace is stunning and will keep you interested. He does a good follow up of characters, ending his incessant runs at right moments. However, the weird thing about his direction is that he ends up focusing on triviality too much. Like that instant where he follows up what Gabe Welch was drinking (Jack Daniels) to make a point.MEDIOCRE HEISTS IN TRIPLE NINE Whilst you might have seen bank robberies a bazillion times in movies, you might wonder if Triple 9 heists have something to shake things up a little. Sadly it doesn't have that thrill to tingle your bones. The big question from the first heist is if they were doing it all for the money primarily, why didn't they go for the money from the banks in the first place? Overlooking that, and focusing on the good stuff, you see Chiwetel Ejiofor as Michael Atwood bringing in a rare charm through his demenaour. He walks around confidently, composedly seeing everything through, that will make you remember him for his finesse.The second heist is performed by just two men that makes it a downhill journey per se. But surprisingly things pan out for them. Watch out for that security guard leg though! CHARACTERS OF TRIPLE 9 Woody Harrelson's flair is as astounding as all of his roles that somehow put him in a cop story. Sadly the screenplay basket doesn't hold aplenty to gnaw upon. His character Jeffrey Allen build-up is not exactly heroic, but he still manages to reach there.Casey Affleck creates a superb comportment for Chris Allen. He carries this rare cool mien throughout the movie with that everlasting chewing gum that you can feel that character come alive.Anthony Mackie as Marcus Belmont is the next best thing to the tale. He is in a constant tussle with himself to pull a betrayal over Chris. Gabe Welch is the weakest link to the story as he tries to decimate the plans of the group suddenly with a change of heart. Even though Aaron Paul does fair justice to him, I wish the reason for him to turn should have been brought into the vanguard. Oooh Oooh Anthony Mackie calls him "Bitch!" one time. :P Constant follow up to the Michael Atwood story will have you take him for a heroic figure, but Matt Cook, the writer of Triple 9 has other plans for him. Kate Winslet does a fairly good Irina Vlaslov but you can't take her seriously for a mafia head. She doesn't come too strong although her screenplay fits her character like a glove.The most complex of all characters is that of Clifton Collins Jr. who plays Franco Rodriguez. You do not see him coming! The fact that everything sieves out on its own, might dilate your eyes though.The best part of the Triple 9 movie which was superbly shot was that 'breaking in the neighbourhood' scene. The mission is a constant follow up as Chris heads his team with a tactical. The shootout is absolutely thrilling to watch.OTHER PROBLEMS WITH TRIPLE 9 There are other downsides to triple nine apart from the aforementioned. For instance a lot of characters are simply there. I mean look at Gal Gadot who plays Elena Vlaslov. She becomes nothing but a sheer reference to her sister. There isn't a proper character development there. Norman Reedus gets the faintest of screen time. I wish he had more. His talent ends up getting smothered, like literally, in the first few frames itself.What constantly messes with the story is the fact that you are able to see everything through but unfortunately Chris isn't. He is blind like a bat, and it becomes hopeless at times, if it weren't for Jeffrey who constantly does the research and all the detective work. We could have done with a better climactic revelation kind of stuff in the end, which might have pulled the plot tauter. Also, the fact that Triple Nine goes a tad banal in the thrill department will have you miffed a little bit.Even though there is subtlety to how the movie ends, threads still remain open. You are forced to wonder about so many things, and loose ends that don't come to fruition. Every character is dispensable, so if you were saving your favourites, one recommendation: simply don't! At the end of it all Triple 9 still gets saved by powerpack performances by its stellar cast and brilliant direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story concept has possibilities but poor script, poor direction, and poor editing sinks it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at home on DVD from my public library. The title is taken from a police code, at least in the universe of this story, 999 meaning officer down. It is a key plot element because some bad cops and former cops are planning a risky robbery and they are hoping that calling in a "999" will occupy the others long enough to allow them to do their crime. Of course there has to be a target, one of the good cops.The story becomes overly murky for no good reason but to simplify it, a group of dirty cops and former cops are doing jobs for some Jewish Russian mafia. They want to pull out but are being pressured with threat of harm to their families.There are several good characters but my favorites are Casey Affleck as Chris Allen, the good cop who ends up being targeted for the "999". Woody Harrelson as Chris's uncle Jeffrey Allen, who is also a good cop. And Kate Winslet is a different role for her, as Russian crime boss Irina Vlaslov.The core story has possibilities but often the action, scene to scene is muddled, some of the dialog doesn't ring true, and overall doesn't come together very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of months ago I saw the teaser trailer to this movie and thought it could be absolutely amazing! I just got around to watching it, and to say the least, I was pretty disappointed. The list of actors cast for this movie was amazing, and the potential that could've been is astonishing (if the screenplay was much better). It's a great shame that so many well known names were put to waste. It started very strong, and was a potential 9/10 rating! It was running at a steady pace and the characters seemed like they could very well be likable characters. As the story progressed, my rating for this movie was dropping one notch at a time..The connections between the characters were confusing and very uninteresting, and the characters themselves were beyond paper-thin. There wasn't a single character that demanded the utmost attention from the viewer. Also, because we as members of the audience learned little to no details of the connections between these individuals and the full reason behind their motives, all connections felt seemingly pointless and out of place. I found myself checking the run-time a lot, hoping that around the three-quarter mark there'd be an epic twist and it'd give the film some flavor; it never came... As soon as the credits came, I was totally and utterly gob-smacked. I sat there in awe, and said to myself out loud "Really? Are you kidding me? That's it? Wow.."What was the point of this film? Maybe it made sense the people/person who wrote it, but to me? I had little to no clue what was happening. It was going this way.. it was going that way.. Nope, changed direction again.. Okay, there's a new character. Who is that? Oh you're not going to tell us who it is and what their connection is? Okay, then.. The acting was excellent. That being said, that's the only positive I can find to express this film as a whole. I look forward to never watching this film again. Ever.There's my biggest disappointment for 2016. 4/10. Sub-standard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the cast of characters in this movie (mainly Wood H &amp; Case A.) I realized this movie had to be good! Wrong! Nothing original about the story line---crocket cops doing criminal activity behind the badge. Typical, expected, and predictable murders. Too many scenes didn't sync seamlessly with the movie. Seemed more like plug and play but nothing matched. Story line wasn't the easiest to follow based on to much jumping around. My 1st time seeing a movie with a woman acting like a Mob Boss. Very horrible acting on her part though the movie added all the classic mob boss stereo types and she failed horribly. As action unfolded predictably you knew what was next. I regret watching this movie. I saw a previous movie with Case &amp; Woody where the on screen chemistry was awesome. Seemingly they attempted again but failed miserably. Lastly, a few racist stereo types that didn't fit into the movie but were forced in taking away from the movie. I started the movie over 20 minutes in because it seemed good and I wanted to make sure I got every detail. As stated early not an easy movie to follow and me starting it over validated that point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling action and brilliantly shot, I just really wished I could care more about the characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is action done properly, and it's absolutely packed dense with it, the adrenaline level rarely dipping below 100% throughout. And I suppose that's what the producers wanted, because it seems like most of the character development scenes were left on the cutting room floor, which is a real shame because without that it's pretty hard to care about neither cops nor robbers enough to make the stakes high enough and the action as emotionally gripping as it could be.As it is, despite a pretty fantastic cast (Aaron Paul, Anthony Mackie and Woody Harrelson in particular somehow manage to impress despite being given almost nothing to work with) in what should be an intelligent ensemble action flick in the mold of Heat, Ronin and The Departed - but grittier than any of those three - it becomes at some point pretty hard to feel anxious about anything other than the popcorn you're crushing with such a furious adrenaline rush between you're teeth, and least of all about the fates of these poorly fleshed-out and almost entirely despicable characters. Which isn't to say that it's not an enjoyable watch - on the contrary. It's actually both a very entertaining and quite well-made movie, as well as being a pretty massive wasted opportunity at the same time. With as little as 20 additional minutes to set up back stories for these people and make them appear somewhat human this could have been one of the best action films of the decade, instead it's one we'll probably forget within a decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to look up the writer. Turns out this is his first movie credit.I hope it is his last. Thrown together are a confused, convoluted mess of every thriller cliché and wild-ass idea without explanation for how and why they fit together. Russian Mafia using a Kosher food plant in Atlanta as a front. Orthodox Jewish men (really!) operating under the direction of non-orthodox Russian women who look like prostitutes (got to be an in-joke) and report to their Russian boss (who is in prison in Russia) via satellite phone. The Russians are working with Homeland Security and using a crew of corrupt cops (who are willing to kill one of their own for a payoff) as errand boys. Now: the plan, when the corrupt cops steal the MacGuffin and give it to the Russians, the Russians will give it to Homeland Security who've arranged to get the Russian crime boss released. Ultra violence ensues. Murky plot! Murky cinematography! Murky sound! Murky direction!Lots of name actors in a hot mess!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triple 9 equals double disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie and although it had a few good elements it just didn't work as a whole.The story goes everywhere and nowhere and the direction seems to have been like"let's just put something together". All the performances felt phoned in and it was really hard to root for someone in this movie.I liked Norman Reedus having a film role again but his screen time was to limited because he died in the first half hour of the movie.After an hour I got bored and than still had an hour to go and kept going hoping it would have a grand finale but it just got worst.This lacked the entertainment value I was looking for and it wasn't the thrill ride they said it would be.It's O.K. for some I guess,as for me I don't recommend it.Almost forgot,if you do watch the movie you gonna get a lot of "deja vu" feelings of better movies you once saw.Which makes this one.....totally forgettable.A shame,such waste of talent and resources.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot also have suspense and some twists which makes you watch interestingly . Please don't compared this film with the Departed and Sicario. Every film makers have their own style. Overview: Bank robbery in the beginning. All the involved robbers were a cops .These Cops were also controlled by Russian mafia. With all these stuff there one good cop between bad cops. Interestingly watchable, how this god cop will survive among the dirty cops. Kate winslet as mob bass and woody Haralson as typical cop have done good job.Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot, and Michael K. Williams all make small and underdeveloped appearances throughout, as Russel (the only guy on the crew who seems to have his head screwed on), Elena (who exudes bad mother), and Sweet Pea (transvestite pimp who has her ear to the ground) respectively.</fullReview>

It all starts rather easy with a heist at a bank but once they have to do another job things go wrong.From there on it's corruption galore. With the excellent cast it do delivers a superb bloody flick. And yes, some main actors do die quickly in this flick and even as Aaron Paul (Gabe) is doing what he's best in, a drug-fiend it is well done. Top cast in a top flick.

		<shortDescription>Heist and Ham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film started with full on action and almost confusion, but got better as the plot progressed. With nods to Reservoir Dogs and TV's The Shield, the pace and plot made this film worth the effort. Kate Winslet hams it as the Russian Mafia boss, and Woody Harrelson is morphing into a mumbling Marlon. Russian Mafia v street gangs v bad cops v good cops. Lots of violence and collateral damage, not for the squeamish, and shoot outs galore. A very strong cast are given free rein, and even the bit characters are allowed depth of personalities. This is far from the American Dream, and the squalid underbelly of downtown city life is frighteningly real. In the hands of Quentin Tarantino this would have been a very different film but the lack of humour adds to wind up the tension. There is no release valve until the bloody climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Semi-decent heist movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Triple 9 is a complicated heist movie involving a lot of double crossing, corrupt cops, plot twists and rug pulls. A team of bank robbers, being blackmailed by the Russian Mafia, have to pull off a nearly impossible heist which involves killing a cop. T9 immediately stands out among the many similar movies out there because it has a great cast and the director, John Hillcoat, has proved himself before to be a good filmmaker so T9 looked promising. In the end, it's a mixed bag. Hillcoat manages to make the shaky cam style of the cinematography work well for once and there is plenty of tension. Thankfully, each set piece doesn't just feel like a repeat of the last and overall it's safe to say it's a well made thriller. The cast, unusually strong for this type of movie, all do a good job. Anthony Mackie stands out in a more gritty, dramatic role than some of his earlier ones, and Chiwetel Ejiofor owns the movie. That being said, it would have been nice to see more of Aaron Paul, Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet. This isn't a predictable movie, and there are plenty of shocks and tense moments, but it's not always that enjoyable. With its mean spirited atmosphere and convoluted plot, it just didn't quite hold my attention the whole time. The script is OK, though the story feels rushed at times and it's not as good as it could have been as a result. It's perfectly good though, and better than some of the stuff we usually get at this time of year. It'll probably sink at the box office, but it's worth a look.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big-cast disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Triple 9 (999) is a police code which is heard when an officer falls down. Triple 9, the film, is about pretty much something similar. A group of infamous thieves, including two corrupted cops, is preparing for a big job which entails an officer's death. The plot sounds passable, but Triple 9 has so many wrong elements. I don't know what was the director, John Hillcoat (''The Road'',''Lawless''), thinking, but the whole movie looks like an extemporaneous effort. The main problem lies with the characters. They are so uninteresting that the audience has no reason to care or be intrigued by them. Such a great, strong cast with numerous big actors (Woody Harrelson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Winslet) ends up to such a poor constructed plot. Oh, and when you have Gal Gadot, make sure you use her, don't just lock her away. Even the action and the few shocking scenes are so vapid due to their sappy characters. In a crime action film, the plot and the characters are the only weapons, considering that you don't have Michael Bay's budget at your disposal. Triple 9 is so lazily built and has nothing to show, nothing interesting or fresh to exhibit. Thus, we are talking about an another big-cast action disaster, following the examples of films, such as ''John Carter'',''R.I.P.D.'' and ''Cowboys and Aliens''. The only thing I'll keep from this movie is Gal Gadot of course, even for her few appearances</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Police Heist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Australian director John Hillcoat made one of the most depressing movies I've ever witnessed, THE ROAD. While it was well made and took a serious look at what it would be like to survive the end of the world as we know it, it was indeed a movie not to allow anyone on a death watch view. Then he made LAWLESS which was quite different, the true story of a family who made their money via moonshine in the depression era Virginia. So when I heard he had a new movie coming out I was interested to see what it would be like.TRIPLE 9 tells the story of bad cops gone worse. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Mike, the leader of a crew of thieves, among which are two police detectives, Marcus (Anthony Mackie) and Franco (Clifton Collins Jr.). Mike owes the Russian mob another score and the job they have him scheduled for is a seemingly impossible task. As the gang plots out a method to accomplish their goal the only thing they can come up with is to create a situation that calls for a "triple 9" distress call, officer down. The call will result in all officers in the area being required to lend assistance thereby leaving their intended target unguarded for a short period.But to do this there is one hitch. They must actually kill a fellow officer. While Marcus wrestles with this issue Franco is all about taking it on. The difference in characters makes for some interesting interaction between the pair. The decision is made and now they need to focus on just who they plan to set up.Around this same time Marcus has been assigned a new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). Chris has been on the force for a while and is the nephew of Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) a name to be reckoned with on the force. While Casey knows his way around police work he doesn't know the streets he's been assigned to like Marcus does. While partners they don't see eye to eye on how to handle things. When the crew decides to choose Chris as their target it's less difficult for Marcus due to the nature of their partnership.Problems come not from Marcus but from fellow crew member Gabe (Aaron Paul), an addicted criminal who thinks this is going too far. As the film progresses Gabe tries to be the voice of reason and get them to refuse the job. What he isn't aware of is that Mike has no option but to follow through. Failure to do so will result in not only retribution from the Russians but the loss of his son as well.The movie works on some levels and not on others. As a well-conceived story you can tell that a lot of thought went into this one. Like an onion layers are peeled away getting to what is really going on and it's never quite what it seems. That being said there is also not enough solid clues for viewers to pick up on the end result.The acting here is some of the best you'll find on screen, from the more well-known stars to those that are familiar faces yet not quite so familiar names. Collins is superbly slimy here as a cop who doesn't care who he kills and has no morals whatsoever. Mackie does a great job showing that he can do more than don wings for superhero movies. Affleck proves that he has no reason to hide in his brother's shadow. And Harrelson displays an ability that many would not have seen coming back when he played Woody on TV's CHEERS.The end result is a movie that's not bad but not necessarily good either. At just under 2 hours there are moments that shine while others simply feel like the pace plods along. Had those scenes been trimmed down, left out or just written differently that might not have been the case but as is they offer moments where I found myself yawning and dozing occasionally. Do the good sequences make up for the bad? I would say yes they do but know going in that the movie will not be a slam bang shoot 'em up that the trailer might have you believe. Realize that not everyone is going to walk away in the end and that the true story of what is going on here is deeper than you realize. If you do so you just might enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising but ultimately falls a bit flat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of names in this: Woody Harrelson, Kate Winslet, Gal Gadot, Anthony Mackie, Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Aaron Paul. Directed by John Hillcoat, who did The Road and a stunningly dark and violent Australian western, The Proposition.Heists, cops, Russian mafia, gangs, drug raids, shootouts, gritty urban decay and mean streets for authenticity.Should have been great but somehow it just wasn't. That's not to say it isn't good. The story twists and turns the whole way through. The shootouts are about as good as anything I've seen in any movie, one standout scene is a police raid on a suspect in the middle of a housing project... and he turns out to be quite the drug cartel soldier.The problem with this movie is that it takes on far too much. There are too many threads and too many characters. Nobody in the movie really gets enough screen time to establish themselves as a character properly. The result is a mess, frankly. It's got a plot line for a tight, single-season TV series, not a movie.There's also no real action climax to the whole thing. It twists, it turns, it's got doublecross after doublecross and various plans going wrong, and it does these things brilliantly. But it all happens at the same pace throughout instead of building up. The result is a great start, okay middle, goes flat toward the end.If you liked Heat then it's OK, 7 / 10. Otherwise avoid, this movie is not going to be remembered as anything special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, I see you coming "3/10 he's severe!" Well, this movie is too contrasted as it first shows you a very promising story with a pretty famous cast but as the film goes you get more and more frustrated...Triple 9 fails to deliver the story, very too often I felt that the acting was poor except for Woody Harrelson, maybe it's because he played True Detective and it reminds me of a great season one of the TV-Series. That said, as the story goes on, you barely understand the links between the characters, neither their true motive. Chiwetel Ejiofor was the most disappointing as to me he really didn't fit in his role, he didn't convince me at all. Kate Winslet was also not fit to be this ruthless Russian mob boss (or wife as we don't understand for sure...). Many scenes are also totally random and makes you feel awkward.There was good parts and good ideas but very not well exploited. Too bad !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Triple 9 is a crime thriller. It probably wouldn't have worked as a book, and it barely works as a movie.The movie has a stylized look. The cast is top notch and ready to deliver, but the writing tries to develop multiple story lines and fails. There are just as many holes in the story as there are bullets being fired. Too many characters to develop properly. Motivations, origins and relevance to the story are essentially left for the audience to guess. I felt this movie to be a half baked effort. It doesn't feel that much creative love went into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What one remembers in this Unmemorable Film is the Color Red and the Darkness. There's Red Dye, Red Shoes, Red Dress, Red Lights, and of course, Red Blood. Scenes are mostly in Dark Rooms, Dark Tunnels, Dark Vans, Dark Alleyways, and of course, Dark Characters.Every Cast Member is a "Name" of sorts, but not a one Brings Anything Remarkable to the Story. Casey Affleck, some Professional Critics actually Single Out His Gig as something Special. Must have been the constant Chewing Gum that caused Him to Mumble even more than usual.The Action Sequences are OK and some have a Gimmick or Two to Heighten the Display of Standard Gun Action. The Story is Simple but surprisingly Incoherent at times. Nothing much comes together in this Average at Best Cop/Criminal Heist Movie. The Russian Mob is on hand to be Typically Sadistic, Brutal, and Barely Human, strike that, Inhuman. Overall, Worth a Watch for Fans of the Genre but don't expect anything Special. It's Downbeat and Gloomy with nary a Smile, but Plenty of Painful Scowls, more than a Few Coming from the Audience.</fullReview>

All characters are convincing, actors did well, save for Winslet - grossly miscast, unconvinced acting - just bad overall. Also, this was definitely not Harrelson's best acting.

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but strong crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some guys complain about working under the Russian-Israeli mafia and how things were better under their previous boss. They are planning a job but have to hire two additional guys. One of them is known, his brother isn't known to the crew.The job is to steal a security box from a bank's vault. The job goes well, except the unknown guy couldn't help himself and stole some money which then blows up during their escape leaving them covered in red dye.As it turns out one of these guys is married to a Russian-Israeli. Her sister is the big bad mafia boss, who has his son basically kidnapped and uses him to get the guy to do whatever crimes she needs done. He has 2 corrupt cops on his crew.The cop chief who's also a bit corrupt start investigating the crime. In the meantime, one of the cops who is part of the gang is a assigned a new partner--a new kid who is related to the chief. They are working on a Salvadorean gang.Unfortunately the boss lady lied and this wasn't their last job. She kills the known new guy and forces the gang to do one more job: to steal info on her from a Homeland Security-contracted facility, which is an impossible job in the time they have before police arrive. The only way to get some extra time is to commit a triple 9--code for an officer down--elsewhere in Atlanta to distract police. One of the corrupt cops actually volunteers to kill a fellow cop. But they decide the victim will be the new rookie partner and they will get the Salvadoreans to do it. But the problem guy from the earlier heist suddenly shows up and ruins their plans. In the end a cop does get killed giving the rest of the team time to steal the info. When they leave the facility cops are there, but they somehow manage to escape easily, do the exchange with the mob and get their money. But by now things get more complicated as the mob isn't one to keep its word and the cop chief is starting to figure things out.Triple 9 is nearly 2 hours long and has a somewhat complex story. Well, the story isn't so complex, but the characters aren't established at all and dialogue is unclear at times. The initial heist should be a bit longer and more thrilling. But overall, this is a very thrilling movie. You end up hating the villains. With everyone somewhat dirty there isn't one character to really root for. The one innocent character, the rookie cop, is too secondary a character to be of importance. Nevertheless Triple 9 works.</fullReview>

As a normal movie buff, the beautiful thing you want to see is the stars coming together and playing their roles beautifully in the movie. This is usually the director's headache when they cast such an amazing 'Crew'. I'm not biggie in watching trailers, when this came out, I stopped in middle and said to myself when it comes out, it's a definite watch. (Why can't trailers be short and sweet and leave the rest to imagination now days?) From the get go itself your bond to be engrossed in the movie. Not a second did I feel like I should get off the couch (It's a different story when you feel good in the washroom after). It takes through each and every character in the time they are afforded in the movie.All in all. You hardly get to see a cop movie this well made, with reasonable yet realistic action sequence.</fullReview>

I found the pace of the movie pretty good managing to keep me interested throughout the movie and I liked the slow unraveling of the truth. There was no major events here it was more of a focused low-key look into how corruption can affect the lives of those who are involved. I liked the fact that there were really no heroes. Woody can play a bum cop so well. (Although I got a little confused with the initial cast of heist characters as they were under their masks half the time and the other half of the time they were in low light settings). I think it was a good solid action movie. (If you liked "The Departed" you will probably like this movie as well like me.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fresh and exciting new crime flick for 2016, and got badly attacked. This is the new Heat and Man On Fire with awesome performances to boot, where they at the top of the league. You might feel the story gets a little muddled with so many bad asses, where your questioning, who's who? Two similar looking blacks for one. Lets start with Normus Reedus- (fantastic, in a short lived but striking performance) part of this bank robber gang, some of it's members, like the fabulous (Clifton Gonzalez Junior, an actor who always delivers) cops. When their latest bank robbery doesn't go exactly, thanks to some red explosive dye (consult movie cover) they're blackmailed into doing another robbery for they're boss, an unbelievable Winslet, like you've never or ever to see her again. She's a real nasty piece of work. Their next job, a real big one, they're forced to kill a cop, that poor SOB being Affleck, who'm at first I didn't recognize, where this fabulous actor, just puts in another unique performance, his wife Teresa Palmer, just nice scenery, popping up, a couple of times. This is a new age crime corrupt cop film, that reminds you a lot of Heat. What impels us through this story is the actor's splendid performances, and choices these corrupt cops have to make, as we know their world begins to crumble around them, where walls will start closing in. We know Winslet's sordid intentions too, for these guys too. As I said, a real nasty piece of work, a more, amped up and so similar portrayal of character to Kristin Scott Thomas, in Only God Forgives. Harrelson, as the detective in charge, gives one of his best and flawless performances, while being Affleck's drunk father too. This film (with an "Oh No" twist at the end, regarding one party) so badly copping flack, is worth the view for the performances alone, from a group of actors I love, about every main performance, top level, but it's Winslet's, you'll remember. She's Satan herself. Another film that kind of shares some similarities, was Street Kings, where this too, makes great use of L.A locations. Sure this film, isn't without faults, but exciting entertaining like this, falling into March of this new year, this is a event surprise. This film should go by another title: Why Does This Film Cop So Much Flack?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watch The Departed for the third time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong this is a film worth watching- but only if you've seen the departed at least twice. The plot it fairly predictable and there just seems to be too many story lines packed in. It lacks depth and confuses you with where you should direct attention to. The action is decent but it's really nothing we haven't seen before in a well-financed heist film. The individual performances aren't great despite the big names involved but this is no fault of the actors alone. They individually have so little screen time that it's hard to cement any sort of characterisation apart from maybe Ejiofor and Aaron Paul who delivers an excellent performance in the little screen he is given. I really do not know what Kate Winslet was doing in this film. Stream it legally folks.</fullReview>

Uneven at best warmed over Michael Mann HEAT wannabe - to wit: a gaggle of corrupt LA cops plan several heists in league with a Russian mafia king pin (Winslet, slumming and decidedly miscast) finds things going off the rails when a good cop (wan Affleck) enters the picture to gum up the works. While there are a few kinetic chase and action sequences arranged with skill and flair by director John Hillcoat the screenplay by Matt Cook is pedestrian at best and the blue chip cast (except for Mackie, the poor man's Will Smith - not a compliment either) wasted except for Harrelson begin a hoot as an alcoholic detective and uncle to Affleck to spice things up nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gritty and Well Made Cop/Heist Drama That Wasn't The Whole Package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at the lack of push this movie got. This is quite the ensemble of Academy Award nominees (Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson and Chiwetel Ejiofor), current and future blockbuster stars (Anthony Mackie and Gal Gadot) and prominent T.V. actors (Norman Reedus and Aaron Paul). You would think that alone would help it secure more attention when it was released. John Hillcoat's past work is more on the artsy side but his films have been largely well liked. I didn't see much of the marketing material for Triple 9 but when I read the plot synopsis, it seemed like it could be a lot of fun. I'm still glad I saw it but anyone expecting an End of Watch, The Town or Training Day calibre movie (which are the first three movies that come to mind in comparison to Triple 9) will be disappointed.The movie opens with a bank heist in Atlanta, Georgia. The crew is performing it compromised of 5 people. The two leaders are Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who functions as the point man in the bank and Russell Welch (Norman Reedus) who is the getaway driver and relays the instructions to the team about police presence and the timing of the job. The other members are Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie), Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul) who is Russell's brother. It's important to remember that Marcus and Franco are dirty cops. They enter the bank and target a specific safety deposit box. They are in and out quickly and they exit in a separate vehicle from Russell who is still in a truck. It all seems to be going well but Gabe grabbed some cash in the vault and the dye pack explodes while they're driving away. The vehicle is compromised and it leads to them having to hold up someone else while they blow up their original van.The crew is understandably angry at Gabe at the drop off point, especially his brother. They are working for the Russian mafia in Atlanta, Georgia which is being led by Irina Vaslov (Kate Winslet) because her husband is in prison. What's also important to know is that Michael is involved with Irina's sister Elena Vlaslov (Gal Gadot) and they have a child together. While Michael works for them, he and his crew were supposed to be released from any obligation but that is no longer the case, Irina has another job for them and if they don't do it, there will be consequences.If you know anything about Triple 9 beforehand, you'll notice that my early plot description doesn't include Casey Affleck or Woody Harrelson. The reason for that is that you don't get introduced to their characters till around 15-20 minutes in. One of the problems that I had with Triple 9 is that the flow of the plot is very unusual. It's always progressing and it's never boring but it doesn't really feel like there's any movement, especially in the middle of the movie. We find out that there's going to be another heist and the plan is formed but then nothing happens in regards to it for a solid third of the feature. I don't want to give anything away but the plan for the ending doesn't even come into play until there's about a half hour left in Triple 9. It isn't that there isn't anything going on but it was confusing to me and I wanted them to get back into it instead of another scene of the criminals mulling over whether they should do it or not.The other problem was that there wasn't much character development with any of the characters. To be fair, there's a lot of big actors and they all deserve screen time but you can't root for them because you know so little about them. Chris Allen is more or less our protagonist but other than that he has a family and transferred from another part of town, why should we like him? I guess it comes down to the fact he's the only non-corrupt character. The movie also wants to get behind Michael but other than the fact that the Russian Mob is holding his son hostage, we don't really know that much about him. His relationship with his Elena is also pretty cold, why does he care so much about her when all he does is cuss at her when they're around each other? Nobody gets to really dive in to their character because it's just not written there or there was a heavy editing job and all that stuff was on the cutting room floor.I don't want to be all negative about this movie because I did enjoy it. The acting is really good all the way around, they've got an impressive stable of actors here and they all do good work. I was most surprised with Kate Winslet. She was just the right amount of cold and cunning and she really held her own. It channels David Ayer's past work (Ayer is one of my favourite directors working right now) really well from how dingy and gritty it looks and how intense it can be at times. I mean that as a compliment and I really enjoyed it from that angle.I was with this movie up until the end and it offered a couple of good twists in its ending. Triple 9 is hard to rate though. There's great acting and the movie looks cool but when I sat back and looked at it, there seemed to be a lot of stuff missing. There's very little character development over the huge cast and the movie tricks you into thinking it's moving faster than it does. I like heist movies so I'm glad someone is still trying to make a good ensemble heist movies. I'm just going have to split the good and the bad and arrive at a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some criminals and dirty cops get together to do a heist in a very secure building. They need to get something for the Russians so one of them won't be prosecuted or something like that. Hard to figure it all out. To give them more time to get the job done, they decide to do a Triple 9 (Officer Down) to insure all cops will go to that shooting and leave them to do the heist in peace. I had never heard of the term Triple 9 until this movie. This movie is a disaster from start to finish regardless of the quality of actors within. The big heist is at the end, but before that caper we see a lot of sub plots that have nothing to do with anything, but it is an opportunity to show numerous shooting scenes. Too many of these scenes are shot in the dark and we have no idea who is doing what to who (whom). And for the longest time it was hard to tell who were the good guys and the bad guys.We see Casey Affleck as Chris, a detective, but his role is subservient to everyone else. We don't look to him to be the true lead in this. Then we see Woody Harrelson as a boss detective Jeffery Allen and he is kind of disappointing and we are not sure about him. Oh, his acting is very good, but how he figures into this disaster is beyond me. The very last scene in the movie with him is most confusing. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Michael a bad guy who goes along with the dirty cops because chief Russian Irina (Kate Winslet) has Felix, his son, to insure the heist goes ahead.Too many scenes are very short (and dark) and it's hard to follow any continuity. We figure we'll just wait for that big heist with the Triple 9. The main problem with this movie is that we follow good guys and bad guys and get involved in their personal stuff and are kept wondering when that big heist will come off. The acting is good, but the story isn't well planned out. The story would have been better if we just followed the good guys, but we end up following everyone and that prompts the confusion.Notables: Aaron Paul as Gabe; Clifton Collins, Jr as Detective Rodriquez. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

If u do so the movie is great and not disappointing at all. Walking out a movie at 45 minutes and than judge it with only 1 star. U can only judge a movie if u watch the hole movie. U can only watch a movie if no one else made it up for u if this is a good or bad movie. People let critics and other reviewer make up their mind about a movie. The only thing i do when i want to know if a movie is worth watching is look at IMDb to see if the score is above 6.0. I don't read any critics before i have seen the movie myself. After i have made up my mind (when the movie is watched) I check on IMDb to see what other thought about the movie. You'll see that this gives u another perspective on the movie. OK back, to the movie. Just watch it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Star Cast Squandered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All star ensemble cast of dirty cops, ex military, a burned out detective, and strait shooter come together to create a miserable failure of a heist movie. Fans of Woody Harrilson and Kate Winslet will likely get something from watching this movie. Both roles are well tailored and cast: A substance abusing but competent sergeant detective who delivers dialog with stunning ease, and a black widow, icy criminal who sees everything around her as pawns she can bend to her will. Fans of Reedus, Affleck, and Ejiofor will be left wanting. Affleck is especially terrible. Perhaps he was trying for an effortless feel, but his performance lacks inspiration in a way that could be analyzed as a clinic on bad screen acting - a bad approach.And is he the main actor? Whose movie is this? What is the point? What is this movie trying to be? None of these questions are answered. It is not a stylized heist movie in the form of Ronin. It is not a deep look at the life of criminal, cop, or both like Heat. Perhaps as a cynical look at money and meaninglessness? Maybe, but the point is - this movie has a very uncertain nature, and delivers no satisfaction by way of entertainment, symbolism, or story.Can a movie without a clear lead actor work? Sure, many consider The Thin Red Line a great movie, with me among them. Funny that Woody is in both these movies that build a story by following multiple characters. But that is where the comparison should end. The Thin Red Line excels thematically, artistically, and ponders a number of interesting questions. Triple 9 is canine feces. Offering any compliments would be a stretch. Perhaps fitting too that the one good'ish guy turns in a terrible performance. All of Affleck's scenes fall flat, and at times its like a guy in solid costuming, hair, and makeup speaks his lines in front of a camera. This doesn't say anything good about the director either. A director who has done really good work in the past. In the end, it doesn't matter whose movie this is, or who we are supposed to care about. Triple 9 is a terrible movie that waists all collected talent.Not recommended. Perhaps a movie worth watching for sake of critique, a performance or two, and the sublime presence of Gal Gadot - otherwise take a pass. 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great ride, one of those that reminds you why the police-crime drama genre has never, ever left the silver screen and why after decades it still remains as timeless and engaging as ever, why its potential for thrill is so high and when delivered right what it can achieve. "Triple 9" certainly has some of that, it isn't by any means a revelation nor a revolution on the genre, but it is dam well worth its time.Opening with a great bank robbery right up until the very last shot, the film never slows its rhythm down and has a tight pace which always keeps things moving and interesting. Thanks to a very well assembled cast we are introduced to a stack of characters that all have a distinctive beat on screen which helps enormously in keeping you up with the plot. These aren't certainly highly original characters and the ensemble is just as predictably cast, no one is surprising in a role or unpredictable, yet there really isn't any reason to complain for this since all of them are very committed and just flow in the movie without leaving space to the viewer for second thoughts. That being with the exception of Kate Winslet which is distractingly cast in a role that clearly doesn't belong to her, yet still she is so amazing she manages to own it, but the fact remains that every time she is on screen you are thinking that is Kate Winslet doing a Russian accent...why? We also have to thanks director John Hillcoat for a very ambitious and complex staging. It is very strange to see this film receive such a mixed reception. I personally saw a lot going on and felt the passion Hillcoat brought to the project. There is a lot that can be said: the subtle use of red lights as a foreboding element, the incredibly perfect blocking and staging of action sequences, the very complex use of various camera movements that get molded into a very coherent tone, the understanding of the intricate plot that is presented to us in a very clear and visual way which makes the film very simple to follow even if there is a lot of interlacement between different characters and situations. Hillcoat does miss the mark in a few beats, one key towards the end where the editing is really off, but that's all and overall this is very well directed film, it is unfortunate to see it go so unnoticed.Where is can be criticized a little more is in its writing. Don't get me wrong this is a enviable screenplay that I only wish I wrote, but looking it from a distance there are a few key elements that needed a final rewrite. The closing for one is a little murky and could have done with a little adjustment on characters being where they are and their motivations, it is also victim of the fact that there is a key beat in the film involving ironically code 999 that, whilst in the complex of the film it doesn't make things collapse, it still preserves a slight convenience about it that could have been easily solved in a rewrite. But that's it, this script is really tight and whilst a little by the book in its rounding of characters, it maintains a great complexity and momentum that are remarkable.I really enjoyed myself, I had a very good dose of thrill and can't see why this film didn't find a wider appeal, I think that its very superficial to judge it a generic, because there is a difference between being generically clichéd and actually committing to what might look from afar as 'seen-before' stuff, whilst in reality there is loads to be processed and enjoyed.</fullReview>

There have been more clever and eclectic examples, as far as I've seen, but this one's got the right ingredients and the proper time to set them in a good mix; the straight cops, the dirty cops, the hit, the car chase, the shootouts, the plans and the B-plans, with a bunch of misery and lowlifes in between. All the main women are hot, and I've never seen Winslet as sexy as in this role. Ejiofor is great as usual and the best here, along with Casey Affleck who should always be the one cast in movies containing his brother Ben instead, for the sake of Cinema. Paul plays the usual punk-ass loser and Hollywood keeps squeezing Harrelson's gritty detective with mouth marbles. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed yet still gripping tale about dirty cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Australian director John Hillcoat opens the hellish gates right in the beginning sequence of Triple 9 and till the very end, the saturnine world of crooked cops is consecutively examined. Putting some minor flaws of the plot and execution aside, this film delivers shivers down the spine and ends up being a truly blood-curdling experience.Triple 9's plot line is a quite complicated puzzle to put together ? five well-trained ex-mercenaries and cops do a bank heist for the Russian mafia. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned and they are forced to do another job, which includes getting their hands even dirtier. Eventually, they begin to struggle with the time and fellow cops, who are after them.As the thriller genre's father, Alfred Hitchcock claimed ? film should start with an earthquake. Hillcoat pays attention to the words of the master and starts off with some heavy artillery ? the bank heist sequence is the absolutely top-notch directing. This solid and entertaining beginning sets the pace and the unsettling atmosphere throughout the entire film. The ubiquitous dreariness mixed with unbearable tension is a tribute to classic films like Mystic River and Heat, but we may find some inspirations drawn from Traffic, Sicario and End of Watch too.What's more, the soundtrack by Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross and Bobby Krlic boosts the cinematic experience too. The heavy electronics, pulsating in the most dynamic tracks, flows into a haunting cacophony of voices and ominous strings in more dramatic scenes, keeping the vibe of Matrix's soundtrack, Gone Girl, Mad Max: Fury Road on one hand, but going towards Jóhann Jóhannsson's and Dan Romer's pieces too on the other. But don't get the illusion that Hillcoat and his team just copies others' works ? he's well versed with the genre, moving around with grace and finding his own gripping style.Unfortunately, Hillcoat's work is far from being flawless. His star-studded cast was supposed to be the solid ground, because let's be honest ? Kate Winslet, Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Woody Harrelson, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul and even Michael K. Williams in the most hilarious appearance in his career ? this is a dream team to work with for every filmmaker in Hollywood. Yet, this ensemble causes these talented actors to have limited time on screen and only few of them really grasps the essence of their characters. We get truly convincing performances put by Ejiofor and Affleck, a simpleton-drunkard by Harrelson and some straightforward letdowns by Winslet and Paul. This is a pack of dogs let loose and unfortunately, it's all Hillcoat's fault.What's more, Hillcoat struggles with the meandering script. The plethora of characters emerging on the screen seems to be overwhelming to the director sometimes, whose apparent love for action-packed scenes doesn't go along with the psychological aspect of the film. The Australian director manages to dig into the depraved world of corruption and abominable crimes, yet he only scratches the surface, mainly by using shocking imagery and violence. He sometimes loses the depth, but covers it up with brilliantly crafted action.Triple 9 will surely satisfy the ardent fans of cop dramas. Those, who enjoyed End of Watch, True Detective, the remake of Miami Vice or any other gruesome and realistic thriller, should not hesitate and watch Hillcoat's film. Despite its flaws, we don't get many such compelling films anyway these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grimy and unapologetically brutal, yet a bit too sporadic and fragmented for its own good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the spirit of creating authentic heist movie, "Triple 9" incorporates plenty of tactical strategy, gangland shootout and visceral treachery. It opens with rapid pace, and only able to maintain it partially due to too many erratic subplots which barely sync with each other. The actors do a respectable job on creating a sense of urgency, yet most of the characters are one dimensional and not entirely likable.Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a former special force forced to do Russian mob's bidding, meanwhile Chris Allen (Casey Affleck) is a detective recently transferred into the town. They will eventually cross path while Jeff Allen (Woody Harrelson), Chris' uncle in investigating a particular heist. The whole scene is bogged down with intricacy and it becomes problematic to tell many perspectives smoothly.Actors deliver an intentionally crude depiction of shady or tired men, each of them has relative portion of screen time and they use it well. With the addition of Aaron Paul, Anthony Mackie and Norman Reedus, this is a solid crew, but it sometimes stumbles on the narratives. Direction would wallow too much on certain subplot without creating any investment.The problem is their struggles, with the kid, job or family, are not easily approachable, especially since it tries to include multiple backstories and authoritative jargon. There are a few good moments, but these are standalone showcase. The continuity and build up are sketchy, this also includes the main point of views of Michael and Chris, which makes the movie feels lacking in term of the main leads.It shines best under stress of gunfire and explosion. The action just feels like they are trained and choreographed with precision, even the bits where characters would stumble or react accordingly in the site. Blood and shot carry their weight nicely. Recent action movies like John Wick or Equalizer tell their stories with style, but this kind of razor blade authenticity is equally refreshing."Triple 9" has a raw muddy grit for the action, unfortunately it applies to the narrative as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What immediately comes to mind after watching 'Triple 9' is the Michael Mann epic crime drama, 'Heat'. Mann's criminal masterpiece has long been considered the benchmark of such films in this genre and Hillcoat's attempt to bring a similar experience to the screen can be seen as a reflection of this mans ambitious talents. It is a travesty that productions like these are made all too infrequently. They instantly capture the imagination of the audience and open up so many brilliant narratives and plot lines. So much can be created with the characters and how they integrate with each other. 'Triple 9' is not up to the same level as 'Heat' in terms of its overall impact but it is still able to deliver a powerful punch for those viewers that enjoy being fully immersed in the world of 'cops and robbers'. Even with a poor marketing campaign, 'Triple 9' is a tantalising film to engage.John Hillcoat (The Proposition, Lawless) is a very popular Director and one that can be easily identified by the art that he creates. Always exploring the relationships of his characters in male dominated turbulent settings, he accompanies his direction with gritty painful scripts and brooding sombre scores that echo through a narrative that consumes the audience. Hillcoat has played around with the time-lines of his stories, placing them in the near future (The Road) and the recent past (Lawless). It was only going to be a matter of time before he was going to place one of his films squarely in the present. Employing his tried and tested techniques from past productions, Hillcoat churns out another enthralling and addictive drama. Matt cook is credited with writing this crime tale. Cook's story is set to a formula that has been explored before but it still works, building up to an unexpected climax that will keep the audience interested. A question can be asked about the absence of Australian musician and writer, Nick Cave. Has his non involvement affected the quality of the narrative? Cave has been the scripted inspiration behind Hillcoat's last two productions, with both having that real dark, raw edge but Cook has been able to compensate nicely. 'Triple 9' still has an eerie atmosphere boiling away underneath the surface.John Hillcoat has put together a stellar cast to drive his film and it begins with a bang as we are all thrust straight into the middle of a bank robbery in the city of Atlanta. After a greedy mistake is made by one of the bandits, the true identity of these criminals is revealed that sets the tone for the entire movie. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Michael Atwood, an ex military veteran that is up to his eyeballs in criminal activity. His crew, which includes Anthony Mackie as Marcus Belmont is made up of Atlanta's finest from the police department and like Atwood himself, army veterans. 'Triple 9' refers to the police code for 'officer down' and it is this exact incident that these bandits are relying on to do one last job for the dangerous Russian mob that is run by Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet). On the other side of the fence are two tough cops. One is a hard nosed, unconventional leading detective, Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) and the other is his nephew, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), who is more of your idealistic, 'wants to make a difference' lawman. Chris rubs a few of his colleagues up the wrong way by asserting his authority on the rough streets of Atlanta and it soon becomes apparent that he is the one that is the target of this lawless crew.With so many great actors, we could have seen a jostling for top billing but each plays their roles professionally. Woody Harrelson stands out as the experienced commanding detective that has perhaps spent too long fighting the scum on the mean streets. His tactics are borderline criminal but he is a realist and tough, knowing exactly how his world works. Casey Affleck is solid in his performance as is Ejiofor but it is again the extraordinary talent of Kate Winslet that shines through, adding another element to a male dominated story. This modern day great can do about anything and playing a Russian mob boss is just a feather in her cap. Throw in Gal Gadot as Winslet's sister and Teresa Palmer as Affleck's wife and the magnitude of the cast becomes obvious.'Triple 9' won't be for everyone but it will excite the loyal audience. It paints a gruesome picture of life on some very mean and real streets in Georgia. Hillcoat's film burns away at a steady pace, dishing out enough drama and confronting violence for the viewer that has patiently waited for a strong crime show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Good Corrupt Cop Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been excited for this movie ever since I saw those grimy trailers they released and I have to admit that they definitely delivered on the dark atmosphere that was promised. Nearly everyone in this film is corrupt in some way but it's nice to see that almost all of them have their own reasons for doing what they do. I'm surprised how much hate I've been hearing about this movie since I thought it was actually pretty good. It's certainly not perfect but it has some good action and a decently suspenseful story. I'm also a big fan of John Hillcoat's other films so this was a bit of a no-brainer for me.The story focuses on a group of criminals that includes a few corrupt cops that are being coerced into working for a Russian mob boss. Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet) is bribing one of the criminals, a man named Michael (Chiwetel Ejiofor), to work for her by keeping a close eye on Michael's son, who just so happens to also be Irina's nephew. Their most recent job requires a distraction to keep Atlanta's police officers busy and they decide that a triple nine is what is needed. In other words, they decide a police officer needs to be shot.I have to say that I'm incredibly impressed they were able to get this kind of cast together for this film. All five of the criminals are played by some recognizable names. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul, and Clifton Collins Jr. comprise the five man group made up of corrupt officers and even ex-military. All of them have very different personalities with the bulk of them being varying degrees of volatile. These are some truly wretched human beings and the bulk of the movie revolves around their little group. We also get solid performances by Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson and I have to say that I pretty much love everything Harrelson does. Affleck gives us a much more subtle performance but Harrelson just steals every scene he's in with his over the top attitude. Finally, I need to give it up to Kate Winslet as Irina. I didn't even recognize Winslet when I first saw the movie but it's definitely her. She's easily one of the most terrifying people in this film and that's saying a lot considering the lengths some of these people will go to get what they want.Everything about this movie just looks grimy and dirty and it really helps to set the mood for the kind of world we're dropped into. Nothing is sacred here and these people are willing to kill others like its not a big deal at all. We see housing projects and poor neighborhoods that have pretty much turned into havens for crime and even meat factories where the more organized crime takes place. I don't know if Atlanta is actually this bad but I'm now interested to find out.I enjoyed the story for the most part but it felt like there wasn't enough time spent on some of the characters to really give us a good feel for their motivations. This is particularly true for the characters played by Norman Reedus and Anthony Mackie. These guys seemed to be bothered by the acts they were committing but we never really found out why they were committing them like we did for Ejiofor and Winslet. Another problem is that when we do get to find out a character's motivation it's usually revealed to us in an awkward conversation that seems to be a bit forced at times. I actually didn't mind a good deal of the dialogue but it got a lot more awkward when two characters were having an argument or a heartfelt conversation. It didn't bother me too much but it was noticeable in a few scenes.If you're looking for a good corrupt cop movie filled with all kinds of deranged stuff going on then look no further. This film will definitely help to scratch that itch. The dialogue isn't exactly Training Day but it gets the job done and there were only a few scenes that came off as awkward because of it. It's not Shakespeare but I still have to recommend it if you're in the mood for a good dose of suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Triple 9 is directed by John Hillcoat and packs a star-studded cast; Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet.A group of corrupt cops and criminals blackmailed by the Russian mob manufacture a 999 - police code for "officer down" - as a distraction during their biggest and most challenging heist yet.Firstly, I went to see this film specifically for the names attached. Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Chiwetel Ejiofor &amp; Woody Harrelson, to name a few. Then there's the director, Hillcoat, who has created some great films in the past; Lawless and The Road. With so much greatness working on this film, I wonder how it felt so messy. The actors did a terrific job, there's a lot of focus on their characters and their backgrounds. I love a film that keeps you guessing who the good guy is, and even by the end you're still not entirely sure. I think the problem is that there's so much going on, often too much at times. The pacing is quick at first but slowly dies down towards the third act, which may leave you questioning the reasons for this. It had a great blend of grittiness and darkness which I loved, but because the story seemed to lack any kind of meaningful substance, it lost me. In some ways, I found this story similar to Villenueve's Sicario, but that dealt with everything so much better and kept me entertained throughout. I'm not speaking about action here, I'm talking about actual drama. Something was missing, I don't quite know what it was yet, but maybe another watch or two may help with understanding the vision the director had.The original score by Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross, Claudia Sarne &amp; Bobby Krlic is pumping with energy. Atticus has always implemented a very atmospheric and distorted sound to his music, which I've come to love and be very fond of. The music works extremely well with the action sequences and dialogue scenes, using sound design as a way of layering and texturing, ultimately completing the overall feel of the film.The editing by Dylan Tichenor is substantial, very simple and easy to follow. Writing by Matt Cook wasn't the greatest, and I'm thinking that's partly why the film didn't completely win me over. Having said that, all of the actors did a splendid job and managed to keep my attention even though I wasn't entirely feeling it.There's one scene I really loved with Casey Affleck's character scoping through a safe house containing secret government files, in a raid shot beautifully with care, capturing the tension at its finest. Among the mess that occurs half way through the film, there's still a few little charms.My verdict; Triple 9 is tense thriller that will keep you on your feet, leaving you with a finale that sustains a sense of unease that will remain for hours after. Although the screenplay doesn't enthral you, it's still an entertaining film. Don't make it an absolute must-watch, though. There are far more superior stories to be told.Triple 9, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see the movie because I remembered in the trailer that Antony Mackie was going to be in it as a crooked cop. He's becoming the man you want to check out in movies, so I checked it out.the movie ends up having a stellar ensemble cast which included Casey Affleck, Woody Harrison, That dude from Breaking Bad (bitch) and Dale from Walking dead. A lot of people capable of being the main character of the film but no one too big not to complement the ensemble. Everyone mixed together equally to make a fantastic piece of storytelling. Overall, the story was well done with a cast truly focus on bringing out a great story, and it had a lot of interesting elements. Reminds me a little of Martin Scorsese's remake of Infernal Affairs, The Departed, but the violence is not nearly as romanced and glamorized, it was more vengeful. Great cop drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good heist film even if better heist films can be found.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting through a screening of the heist film Triple 9, the film Heat from 1995 popped into my head immediately. Heat was 1995 and directed by Micheal Mann who had his fair share of good films. Heat has it's fan for so long after so many years due to it's cast and it was well made above everything else. Triple 9 is directed by John Hillcoat who's had a nice quiet career in Hollywood. I've seen many films from many genres not work because they are too similar to something else. Triple 9 is not as good as Heat or another similar heist film The Town from 2009 but Triple 9 works well though even if doesn't have originality.Set in Atlanta, a group of corrupt cops lead and an ex-military leader, who are known for robbing banks and heist gets blackmailed by the Russian mob to perform a difficult heist. All the same, police officer Jeffery Allen (Woody Harrelson) tries to stop this group while really realizing he's in the middle of it.It's getting more cliché to keep putting an all-star cast together but Triple 9 is surely an all-star cast. From Anthony Mackie, Casey Affleck, Arron Paul, Norman Reedus, Chiwetel Ejiofor, you have basically everyone here. Even Kate Winslet is here playing a Russian mob leader Irina Vlaslov even if casting as Winslet as a Russian character makes not a whole lot of sense. It's very hard to make sense of who's and what relationship is to everyone at times but you have too much power not to succeed nor acting is not an issue as expected.Maybe even more why Triple 9 works so well is because of it's action scenes. From the rough kill scenes that surprising how gruesome they are or how rough Atlanta culture is presented to us which is a surprise. It's action scenes has a lot of energy and it's shows John Hillcoat power. A film that really wants to be gritty and it doesn't come short of it. Right from the first act, you know what your getting with Triple 9 and eventually, it all speaks for itself. Much like Pretty in Pink was a cousin film to Some Kind of Wonderful, Triple 9 is the cousin film to Heat. Triple 9 will be forgotten down the road due to I don't see it having a lot of staying power but still nothing to not make note of it. A pretty good heist film even if better heist films can be found.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Barely Passable Movie with a Good Movie Struggling to Break Free</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There comes a point about halfway through watching Triple 9 where I wondered "who should I be rooting for here?" Director John Hillcoat and screenwriter Matt Cook do a marvelous job enveloping the audience into their dark and cynical world of warring gangs, corrupt cops, and hastily executed heists. They attempt to evoke a visual vocabulary similar to Heat (1995) yet the proceedings end up feeling more like Takers (2010) lacking the basic pacing and characters that leave any lasting impact.The term triple 9 is police code meaning Officer down/urgent help needed. This is the plot element that hangs precariously in the air for nearly one hour of screen time as a congress of corrupt cops (Ejiofor, Mackie, Paul, Reedus and Collins) plan a heist for the Russian mob. Blackmailed and desperate, the group finds an unwitting patsy in rookie cop Chris Allen (Affleck); nephew to notorious Detective Jeffrey Allen (Harrelson). Chris's death would result in the entire police department hunting down a cop killer leaving the crew to pull their heist in peace. What they didn't count on was Chris being so...smart? Crafty? Resourceful?Truth is the character of Chris does very little except absorb the myriad of coincidences that culminate in his setup. He's not admirable nor interesting nor particularly adept at police work and despite having comparable screen time to the rest of the ensemble, we know very little about him; other than he's into Black Sabbath. The mortality of his character is dependent not on cloak and dagger intrigue or a sense of indemnity but on blind, stupid luck. Only near the end does Chris have an opportunity to act on anything of consequence yet that heroes moment is robbed by Woody Harrelson who has pieced together everything and wraps it in a neat little bow for Chris.Well if the movie isn't interested in Chris then surely it's interested in the corrupt cops, right? Yeah, not so much; only Ejiofor is given more than a cursory glance and even then the movie seems to hinge his character's motivation on extensive moments of exposition. Those moments are provided by Ejiofor sharing over-the- shoulder shots with the incredibly underutilized Kate Winslet. While every other character enters and exits the film with little fanfare, her Russian mob wife character is a scarlet draped exclamation point to the otherwise stodgy ensemble. All the story elements that merge into the climactic final heist are lovingly pieced together for the audience. We are privy to all the information early on and watch as the unavoidable fates of all involved unravel; no one being wiser as a result. But to what end, is the million dollar question. The film seems poised to give an uncompromising view of brutality complete with dirty cops, ski- masked robbers, habitual drug use, poverty, degradation and lots and lots of grime. But while these images bombard the viewer, there's no depth to it. The editing, the story beats, the ever obnoxious shaky- cam, all work against this film to make a dirty, steamy hodgepodge of who cares.Triple 9 is a barely passable crime drama with a decent movie struggling to break free underneath bad pacing and bad character development. Boasting an ensemble cast of one Emmy winner, one Academy Award winner and three nominees, you'd think this movie would be much better than it is. Sadly, it's purely a time-waster worthy of a rental tops. On a side note, for a city located in post- 9/11 U.S.A., you'd think Atlanta would be a little more serious about its car-bomb situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Cast in a Decent Intense Heist Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson, Kate Winslet, Aaron Paul, and Norman Reedus. To say I was excited to see this film is an understatement. Directed by John Hillcoat, Triple 9 is about a crew of criminals and corrupt cops that have to pull off one last heist and the best way to distract the police is to kill one of there own. For the most part this film delivered. There are three awesome action set pieces that happen in the film. Each time the stakes intensify and things slowly start to fall apart. The corruption and betrayal results in a blood path, with the film doing a great job by never letting a character feel safe. I really liked how the film is mainly focused on our criminals. It makes the scenes with Casey Affleck being the only good cop really intense. Woody Harrelson plays a version of the character from True Detecitve only in this he's x3 the mess. Lastly mentioning the criminals and corrupt cops. Every one does there job really well with Ejiofor and Mackie being the stand out. The cinematography and score is really well done. When people's life is endanger it's extremely intense. If this film would of stuck the landing it would of been a great film instead of just a good film. There are typical cop tropes in the film but it's forgivable. The third act loses a lot of it's momentum and isn't as exciting as the scenes prior to it. The characters left standing and the resolution is a little unsatisfying. At the end of the day the ensemble charges this film forward and solid action makes it an entertaining watch. If you catch it in theaters, I say wait for a weekday or matinée showing.7 out of 10 ReelsPros - Awesome Cast- Action - Intense Cons - Third Act - Typical Cop Tropes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well shot and directed, but lacking any emotional impact...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The impossibly bleak "Triple 9" is directed by John Hillcoat who, in the past, has worked with some pretty sombre material in ultra-hopeless films like "The Road". He's also worked with a cast of big-name actors in the western thriller "Lawless", something which he of course brings to this star-studded feature as well. The cast here is almost too long to list; reliable performers such as Casey Affleck, a.k.a Batman's brother, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are probably the leads, A- Listers Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet are given supporting roles, and "Triple 9" also features some television icons in the form of Aaron Paul, known for his role as Jesse in "Breaking Bad", and Norman Reedus, the almost invincible, crossbow-wielding hero Daryl Dixon from "The Walking Dead". The story, which attempts to cover a whole lot of ground, follows a band of criminals, lead by Ejiofor's Michael Belmont, who find themselves under the thumb of the Russian mafia, and are subsequently forced into carrying out increasingly problematic heists. We also meet Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), a rookie cop who finds himself partnered up with rogue officer Marcus Atwood (Anthony Mackie) in the most dangerous precinct in town, and with Belmont's crew needing a good distraction to carry out their latest raid, he finds himself in the unknowingly precarious position of being the target for a 'Triple 9': officer down. If there's one thing that "Triple 9" does particularly well, then it's the hostile and crime-infested atmosphere it is able to create throughout its near-two hour runtime. While the movie might be better suited taking place in a Los Angeles or a Boston, it is somewhat refreshing to see a new city get a grisly makeover, and they do a hell of a job. The neon lighting of Atlanta bars and eerie streets of the night lend the film a rather gloomy and ominous gravitas, and the portrayal of the disenfranchised and unruly neighbourhoods is striking, motivated and, most importantly, appears very real. The version of Atlanta presented in this movie feels truly lived in, and you can't help but sympathise with the characters for having to go about their lives in such unstable conditions. No one person in this movie ever seems safe from the cold grip of death that seems to be lurking around the city, and "Triple 9" is curious, if only for the mystery of who will survive such a dire situation. Atticus Ross's music is pulsating and biting in the best way, and the David Fincher-collaborator's score not only does a tremendous job of building tension, but also perfectly complements the gritty and unrelenting darkness of the feature. The film, much like the excellent "Sicario" from last year, really comes into its own during its set-pieces, and Hillcoat proves himself adept at managing them from the very first sequence of the movie. The highlight though, without a doubt, is a police raid on a gangster's hideout which, set to absolutely no score whatsoever, is exciting, unnerving and the most engaging scene in the entire movie. The strong cast do deserve some credit as well; Chiwetel Ejiofor is actually rather likable as a worn-down criminal forced to do the dirty jobs for the good of his son, even if the relationship between him and his partner Elena (Gal Gadot), which leaves him intimately linked to the Russian mafia, isn't fleshed out whatsoever. Speaking of the Russian mafia, it's quite evident how much fun Kate Winslet has playing the hyper-realised and rather cold mob boss Irina, and even then her exchanges with Ejiofor's Michael feel the most emotionally and narratively impactful. There's a lot going on in "Triple 9" and, quite honestly, it's all a bit too much. In prospect, such a huge and well-known cast seems rather tantalising yet, in practice, the film is left in dire need of some focus. We have the crew of modern bandits at the centre of the story, and they are the ones who really hold your interest. It's frustrating then that the movie spends all of its time jumping back and forth, in rather erratic fashion, between them, the Russian mafia, Woody Harrelson's Woody Harrelson type character carrying out a rather fruitless and unnecessary investigation, bent cops played by Mackie and Collins Jr. abusing the system, and Affleck's Chris getting used to some pretty nasty streets. It's too bloated and half of those plot-lines could quite easily be dropped or reworked to make "Triple 9" a much more cohesive thriller. This also contributes to the problem of paper-thin characterisation, which is a similar issue to that faced by "Black Mass" from last year. We spend so little time with even the main characters that it's hard to care about them or even understand their motivations particularly well. Take Aaron Paul for instance. Besides the fact that he is essentially reprising the role of Jesse Pinkman, to the extent that he even deploys his famous catchphrase 'Bitch' at one point, there is no explanation offered or established as to why he would act in the desperate way he does. Woody Harrelson phones it in with the most typical performance you can imagine from him. Even Casey Affleck is struggling to add anything to the stereotypical role he is given to work with. The problem: everyone is just too far inside their comfort zone and, quite frankly, it gets a little boring. Apart from Ejiofor and perhaps Winslet, I've seen these performances on numerous occasions before. The glue between the set pieces is also quite weak and, with very few characters to feel emotionally invested in, your left waiting for something exciting to come along and pick up the narrative. The film's conclusion is rather unsatisfying and haphazard, tying up the knots in the most by-the-numbers and unoriginal fashion possible. There's a lot of style and probably too much substance, and more than that, it's the substance that we've seen a hundred times before anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More light needed - and subtitles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"More light," Goethe is reported to have said on his deathbed. He may have been watching a picture like TRIPLE 9: it's almost entirely shot in darkened rooms, cars, warehouses, underpasses. And - as so often now, not just in cops-and-mobsters movies - the dialogue is mumbled, impossible to understand without subtitles.Set (I think) in Atlanta, this is another story about good cops and bad cops; we aren't (I think) meant to know which are which. The good cops are fighting the local Russian mafia who have suborned the bad cops. Casey Affleck, looking a lot like like Bruce Willis in DIE HARD mode, is definitely a good guy, but I wasn't sure about Woody Harrelson in a phoned-in performance as a police captain. Kate Winslet, sporting a blonde version of Monica Lewinsky's collapsed beehive, (can Kate be this hard up for money?) has a souped-up cameo as a mobster's moll or possibly missus: her accent, somewhere between Golders Green and St Petersburg, was easier to understand than any of the Americans. There's a bank robbery, some car chases, several shoot-ups: nothing new here.My companion walked out two-thirds of the way through. I managed to stay to the end but wish I hadn't. I'm sure there are worse movies around than this muddled and mumbled mishmash, but I wouldn't want to sit through them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Triple 9 is a crime drama directed by John Hillcoat and written by Matt Cook. It surprisingly has some very big well known cast members, like Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul, Clifton Collins, Jr., Norman Reedus, Teresa Palmer, Michael K. Williams, Gal Gadot, with Woody Harrelson, and Kate Winslet. In TRIPLE 9, a crew of dirty cops is blackmailed by the Russian mob to execute a virtually impossible heist. The only way to pull it off is to manufacture a 999, police code for "officer down". Their plan is turned upside down when the unsuspecting rookie they set up to die foils the attack, triggering a breakneck, action-packed finale filled with double-crosses, greed and revenge. I'm just going to start the review by saying what anyone who has seen the movie was thinking, (for the most part) it is extremely boring. It has such a convoluted plot that feels so muddled and just, unfortunately, uninteresting. The cast members do a decent job, with the lead Anthony Mackie, who in my opinion was the best in this movie, as far as acting is concerned. Casey Affleck is fine too, but really nobody else brings their A game here as it is obvious as soon as you lay eyes on the movie. The cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis is really nice though, I will give it that. But it is just not enough, as the movie fails on so many levels and has so many apparent flaws that just can't be ignored. It has very few action sequences, especially for an "action" movie, but those few are actually very well handled by the director John Hillcoat. Especially in the middle of the movie when they're trying to catch a drug dealer of some sort. The ending is a total disappointment, overall I think it is a meh movie that had so much potential but very little to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Hillcoat, of 'The Proposition', 'The Road', 'Lawless' tries his hand at something like 'The Town', 'The Departed', 'Heat', 'Inside Man', 'Thief' and 'Brooklyn's Finest', and comes out on top, with a fantastic ensemble including Casey Affleck (not as much to do as initially surmised, though the irony of the movie's title is played out with his, and other important characters), Chiwetel Ejiofor (going for broke with letting it all go, rather than play the calm/collected soul he's become typecast with thus far), Anthony Mackie (chewing the scenery for a change - coiled snake ready to spring kinda thing), Woody Harrelson (actually chewing up all the scenery around, right from the first intro sequence with him and his necktie), Kate Winslet (German-Russian accent), Aaron Paul (On 'Speed' for most of the time, not 'needing' it anymore) and Gal Gadot (who gets more runtime than Norman Reedus, and though Gadot is relatively more easy on the eyes, I could've done with more Reedus on screen), but the bulk of the heavy-lifting going to the severely underrated Clifton Collins Jr. (more on that in a bit).The score, camera work and cinematography complement the flick perfectly and only serve the whole.What's with (and I mean this in a nice, good way) the great Hillcoat being able to adeptly deal with illustrious ensemble casts, every bleeding time ('Proposition' and 'Lawless' both had eclectic ensemble casts)? Everyone brings nothing but their A-game to the table, and that's what's always needed, rather than just paycheck work.Filmmakers could borrow a page or 2 from this movie of his (not just his older ones) on characterization and such.However, as with most of the flicks I looked forward to watching this year, dreaded to visit the cinema for doing that, and finally ended up burning my hard-early moolah in any case, my theatrical viewing was consistently/frequently made tortuous due to the heavy- handed visual/aural edits made, that, on occasion, excised entire sentences, not to mention all of the nudity and most of the gory violence. If one thought that watching similarly excised versions of Deadpool and Hateful 8 were painful experiences in the recent past, not to mention '45 Years', they have to watch this one at the local cinema, and it's a completely different, nee, depressing experience, to put it mildly.If I were to review this version of the movie that was, I'd give it -1/10. However, if I were to imagine those phrases and visuals magically present, I'd give it a 9, since this is the flick that I've been waiting for William Monahan to write, and Scorsese to direct, after their remake of 'Infernal Affairs'.Casey Affleck has been having the run of great characters to chose from, but, to be fair, this is not his flick. Like I mentioned earlier, it belongs to characters played by Ejiofor, Collins Jr. and Harrelson, ably supported by the likes of Mackie and Paul.Teresa Palmer, another Kristen Stewart lookalike, is in a thankless role, but has been ubiquitous this year, what with the crappy 'Choice' and the decent 'Point Break' remake. Gal Gadot does something remarkable, that I've never seen her do before.We've all seen Winslet lose herself in her roles, and this one's no different, but Gadot fares better compared to her, with her characterization. Michael Kenneth Williams (Wire's Omar) is woefully underused, but surprises in his 1 scene. Where are the meaty roles for this guy?Now, to the one who's finally got one of the most meatiest roles of his career, perhaps without meaning to? Considering he's nowhere in the trailers or features prominently in the credits, this is a remarkable feat, as in recognizing the man's presence and talent finally! I remember Clifton Collins Jr. mostly from 'Traffic' and 'Capote' (and also from 'Sunshine cleaning' and 'Babel'), and always thought he got a raw deal. Here's to hoping this is a precursor of good things to come for this talented actor.The score has been spoken about, but Atticus Ross makes the one in this unique, and it soars, in spite of the censors-induced crappy sound-design (actually, the sound designers could sue the conservative editors of this flick and other such works). Even the end credits track (Pigs) that plays in 2 of the movie's trailers, deserves special mention, building the mood effectively. Glad they finally used Atlanta (or what passed for it) instead of sticking to NY/LA/NO/Boston etc. The on-location production design is serviceable, and adds an element of local flavor to the goings- on. One of the best things? It neatly wraps up all its threads, and does not leave anything hanging. Love it when they're considerate that way. Thanks to writer Cook and director Hillcoat. There are 2 sequences that introduce and keep piling on a strong feeling of dread in the audience (that has no clue how each will turn out eventually), that offer something unique to the ravaged-by- now thriller genre, that seems to be revitalized by this work, and the works of Denis Villeneuve (with this comparing favorably to both of Villeneuve's works - his excellent 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' - and though 'Enemy' belongs to a different genre, it did pile on the dread-factor too). Having said that though, and this is a hardcore spoiler of sorts for 1st time viewers, but only for those who've also seen many in this genre, along with Monahan-Scorsese's 'Departed', like I was, knowing about that kinda takes the punch away from the ending of this powerful little flick. I admit being a little surprised at some of the twists that came earlier, but the ending did not surprise, given the context elaborated on above. All in all, a fantastic viewing, if you are not saddled with the edited version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About what I expected. Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a criminal that is working for the Russian Jewish mob. Ran by Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet) the mob is using Michael because of his ties to Irina's sister Elena (Gal Gadot) which Michael has a son with. Michael is stealing valuable information from banks and government locations in order to free Irina's husband who is held prisoner in Europe. This is literally just one of the many subplots of this film, but mostly the main point. Michael works with his best friend Russell Welch (Norman Reedus) and his ex-cop brother Gabe (Aaron Paul). The bring in two dirty cops to help them with a heist which includes Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) a street detective and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr) a homicide detective. Things get complicated when Marcus gets a new partner in Chris Allen (Casey Affleck) who's a straight laced to good cop. On top of all that Chris's uncle (who's a higher level detective) Jeffrey (Woody Harrelson) is on the trail of the crew getting closer to the source of it all. The crew has one last heist that they need to pull off and decide to do a Triple 9 which means that a cop has been killed and all forces rush to that area leaving the other areas of the city aka the heist to have more time to be successful. They decide to kill Chris, but Marcus starts to have some doubts. The movie is predictable. I know it seems like I stated a lot of what the movie is, but this is just the tip of it all there's a lot of twists to it that are easily seen. The movie actually slows down quite a bit in the middle. The characters go back and forth on the same kind of subjects and it seems like it could have been edited down. One major problem for me is the fact that there isn't a strong main character. Yes we follow Chris, but we don't know much about him. I never felt for any of the characters and didn't care when people started dying off. Overall, not a recommendation to see in theaters, but I would say wait to rent this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Triple 9</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atlanta, GA as a locale, almost projected itself to be the main character in 1981's Sharky's Machine. Cut to 2016 and Triple 9 (my latest review) portrays ATL as modern-day Beirut.With assured direction by John Hillcoat (Lawless), a capable cast, and Kate Winslet going almost unrecognizable as a Russian Mafia associate, "9" belongs in a cinematic guilty pleasure of mine: The crime thriller drama. Immediately after viewing its trailer (in December), I was reminded of Illinois native/badass screenwriter David Ayer. Granted, this isn't the David Ayer of Training Day and Street Kings (two of my favorites in the genre). Triple 9 is more like Sabotage David Ayer being Georgia- based, dirtied up, and lacking in emotional resonance not to mention secreted tension. Yeah heads are dismembered, officers go rogue, tats are abundant, and street gang initiations get mucky. "9" doesn't however, shake you with these images. It's just another day where actors talk tough and draw blood.Including a lot of troupers that fade in and out while harboring admirable screen time, Triple 9 tells the story of two corrupt cops (Anthony Mackie as Marcus Atwood and Clifton Collins, Jr. as Jorge Rodriguez) teaming up with three hardened criminals (played by actors Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Norman Reedus). Their initial mission: Commit robbery by stealing a safety deposit box holding information that could help a Russky mob boss get out of prison. Their next mission: Commit the same volatile act yet with much higher stakes. The five gentlemen have to pull off a Triple 9 to get it done. A Triple 9 according to the film's title, is a maneuver where an officer down call sends every member of the heat to the location of the relegated incident. Casey Affleck (as Chris Allen) plays the honest cop who gets embroiled in said Triple 9, Woody Harrelson (as detective Jerry Allen) plays his concerning uncle, and Hotlanta plays atmospheric chic with its view of destitution and click click multitude. Viktor Bout called and he wants his guns back (ha ha).Now director John Hillcoat with his excessive use of close-ups, shoots "9" as if it's a horror snuff pic. He turns Atlanta's unsavory environment into a complete war zone. Most of the homicidal sequences featured are in broad daylight. And in staging several car chases and gunfights, Hillcoat renders every effect sloppy if not realistic and lifelike. His work behind the camera isn't necessarily the problem. It's the script by unknown Matt Cook and some rushed editing by Dylan Tichenor (Child 44) that become Triple 9's main Achilles' heel. Instead of effectively spouting long-winded soliloquies about (authentic) PoPo corruption and partaking in juicy one-liners (revert back to David Ayer, paragraph two), "9's" characters mire every word of dialogue in the form of F-bombs and muddled, good cop/bad cop arguments. Bottom line: With Triple 9's every stand alone kill, every obvious double-cross, and every exploding body part, you feel Denzel Washington did it better fifteen years ago by simply saying, "King Kong ain't got sh*t on me!" Rating: A mixed but strong 2 and a half stars. "Number 9, number 9, number 9". Natch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Triple 9The worst thing about working for a Russian boss is their zero-tolerance policy towards bathroom breaks.But as the thieves in this thriller have learned, working alongside them is even worse.The wife of a convicted Russian crime boss (Kate Winslet) hires a coalition of career criminals (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul) and crooked cops (Anthony Mackie, Clifton Collins, Jr.) to obtain a safe-deposit box from a bank for her.But before she hands over payment, she now wants them to infiltrate a government building to steal more evidence to help overturn her husband's sentence.Meanwhile, two straight cops (Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson) work the case from different angels.Action-packed with some intriguing relationships and colorful characters, Triple 9 defies its numerous crime story clichés to formulate a forceful but ultimately forgettable heist picture.Furthermore, cops and robs only work well together when it comes to fixing their marriage.

		<shortDescription>Triple 9 has everything i want in a heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Triple 9 is about 3 criminals and two corrupt cops who are attempting to free a Russian Mafia boss. The wife of the boss is offering money for information that could possibly overturn his conviction. Let me just get this out of the way, to accurately explain this film would require a lot of time (and a lot of Advil) because it's not as simple as just 3 criminals and two corrupt cops trying to get a lot of money. Well, actually that's all it is but there's so much going on it's hard to explain it properly and in a concise fashion. The guys need to get a hold of a deposit box that contains information which could possibly get the mob boss out of prison. The box is located in one of the many banks in Atlanta, Georgia. In typical heist movie fashion there's double crossing, shady characters and a whole lot of drama. The boss's wife withholds the reward money after receiving the info and sends them on a second mission,forcing the guys to break into a government building. Chris Allen (Casey Affleck) get's brought onto the squad to try and assist with the investigation. He gets partnered up with Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie), who's one of the crooked cops. They hit the streets and search for answers. Triple 9 is a fantastic film. It's not exactly mind blowing but it had everything i wanted. Violence,drama,sex,nudity,smoking,drinking and a whole lot of corruption. The cast is full of stars and they all shined. If your looking for a raw heist film with fantastic actors then you MUST check out this movie.The music is also really good, shout out to everyone who produced the score. It was very electronic and took the already tense moments and jacked them up about 400 notches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally like movies involving heists and corrupt cops, but this movie just confused the hell out of me. The movie started off promising, but then sunk into a deep hole of sub-plot and confusion. There wasn't a single moment of a captivating moment to warrant a change of pace midway throughout, instead we were left with a slow moving slime of events where I just sat there hoping for someone to die (even the protagonist) so that something will happen and/or the movie will simply end. If you're watching this movie hoping a resemblance to Training Day or The Town, I have already warned you, don't expect anything like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense in places. But it Was no ABE LINCOLN Zombie Killer . no depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It didn't take much convincing to get me into the cinema for this one. I've been looking forward to it for a while, not for it's content and concept, but purely for the names attached. John Hillcoat has yet to make a bad movie, and I figured him finally tackling present day could yield some interesting results. Pairing him with his biggest and most impressive cast yet could only bring further promise.Unsurprisingly, Triple 9 is driven by it's characters, with a handful of impressive, gritty action setpieces to keep the audience's attention. We follow characters on both sides of the law, including the murky grey in the middle, but no-one is particularly likable. We have Mike, head of the criminal crew plotting an officer down code as a distraction. He's in with the (Jewish?) mob more than he'd like by way of having had a son with the boss' sister, Elena, giving Irina, the boss, more leverage over him than he'd like. His crew is made up of army buddy Russel, his deadbeat brother Gabe, Gabe's Gang Unit cop friend Marcus, and another dirty, somewhat psychotic cop Franco. Marcus has just been assigned a newbie as a partner; Chris, who just so happens to be the nephew of Jeff; the head of the Homicide division. Of course with such ties, it's the newbie who ends up as the target of the triple nine.Each one gets varying degrees of character development, but due to their being so many characters, it's unsurprising that there might not be as much as you might hope. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mike as a sharp leader who's just unhappy with his situation and what he's made to do for the sake of his own son. Kate Winslet hams it up a little bit as Irina, but never quite reaches the amount of intimidation required for the role, and you wonder why Mike doesn't just shoot her in the face and be done with it. Casey Affleck is a little dull as Chris, who's probably the most likable character by accident, having no discernible character beyond being the guy thrown into a world he doesn't entirely understand. Anthony Mackie, however, manages to bring a bit more depth to Marcus than any other character/actor. As the guy tasked with initiating the triple nine, he suffers a strike of conscience at inconvenient times, but is still ultimately a corrupt cop. Aaron Paul does what he does best with Gabe, which is walk around lost with tears welling up the whole time, although in Triple 9, at least his character has good reason. Clifton Collins Jr. plays the semi-psychotic Franco with as much cold heart as is necessary without making the audience wonder how he got passed the police tests in the first place. Woody Harrelson's Jeff is the well- meaning drunkard, who is as close to a show- stealer as Triple 9 gets. Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot, and Michael K. Williams all make small and underdeveloped appearances throughout, as Russel (the only guy on the crew who seems to have his head screwed on), Elena (who exudes bad mother), and Sweet Pea (transvestite pimp who has her ear to the ground) respectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Triple 9" is triple bad, which is pretty good (mostly).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reliable statistics regarding how many corrupt cops there are in America are hard to come by, but by all accounts, the vast majority of all law enforcement officials are well-trained, hard-working, honest individuals who do the best job they can under challenging, complicated and sometimes life-threatening conditions. Unfortunately for them, there aren't many movies made (or cell phone videos, for that matter) about good cops doing the right things. Gritty stories about corrupt cops sell more movie tickets. And why not? Those of us who respect the police still enjoy the occasional crooked cop film ? if it has a good story ? and the bad guys get what they deserve. So, does "Triple 9" (R, 1:55) fit the bill? The first big scene in the movie shows us a gang of masked men robbing an Atlanta bank with military-style planning and precision ? and a clear understanding of how long they have to take care of their business in the bank before police will arrive. Even when we get to know these men, we don't know how they initially got together, but they're clearly professionals? well, most of them are. Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is the leader of this gang of five. He's a former military special operator, as is fellow gang member Russell Welch (Norman Reedus), who was the driver at the bank job. These two work with two corrupt cops, Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins, Jr.). The last member of the crew is Russell's little brother, Gabe (Aaron Paul), who is the one sensitive criminal in this gang, and also the biggest screw-up. Although none of these guys are winning a Man of the Year Award any time soon, the reasons they pull the jobs in the movie extended beyond just pure greed. They have become entangled with Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), the wife of an imprisoned Russian mob boss ? and she threatens the lives of the families of the members of Michael's gang in order to get what she wants.What Irina wanted from the bank was a single safe deposit box, which contained information that could free her husband? but the contents of the box end up containing only part of what Irina needed. She refuses to pay Michael and company until they pull one more heist for her, a demand that she backs up with threats and violence. The second job involves the gang breaking into a facility run by the Department of Homeland Security. They agree that they'll never be able to get in and out before Atlanta's finest arrived on the scene... unless the police response could be somehow delayed. Marcus suggests killing a cop to create the necessary diversion. He explains that "Code 999" means "officer down", a radio call that would send every available cop in the city racing to the scene. The others agree with the plan, but they're not all exactly enthusiastic about it. Marcus suggests his new straight-arrow partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), as the sacrificial lamb and uses the investigation of a gang killing (that left three severed heads on the hood of a car) to talk to bad dudes like Luis Pinto (Luis Da Silva) who might help out with his plan. Hovering over this scenario is Chris' uncle, Detective Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) who himself has gotten pretty jaded over the years, but is determined to protect his young nephew. Let's just say that the goals and desires of all these characters become? challenging."Triple 9" is original and entertaining, but very dark. Its gritty reality reminds me of 2006's "Miami Vice" film and the impressive heists reminded me of a hardened version of the "Oceans" films. Putting corrupt cops together with former military in a single gang is interesting, and almost as unusual as seeing orthodox Jews as Irina's henchmen. The ensemble cast is great (and, according to director John Hillcoat, pretty tough to get together considering how in demand they all are). Watching them is especially entertaining when you realize that this is the first time that you've seen some of them playing such nasty characters. (The last time Affleck was in a movie with Harrelson ? in 2013's "Out of the Furnace" ? Harrelson was trying to kill Affleck. Besides that, the dedicated detective from "Secret in Their Eyes" and Falcon from those Marvel movies have both turned out to be downright unheroic. And to think that Young Rose from "Titanic" ended up as a Jewish Russian mob boss. Jack would be so very disappointed!) Come to think of it, these characters may just be a bit too nasty. It's a little hard to believe that a gang of people with such a low average morality quotient would include police officers and former military members ? and the number of unanswered questions in the story makes it even harder to believe (or completely understand) what we're seeing. I also found the ending unsatisfying and anti-climactic. Either way, if you watch this movie as if you were involved in a high-speed police chase through a bad neighborhood, ignoring the distractions, keeping your eyes on the road and not worrying about what happens when the chase comes to an end, you'll be in for a pretty wild ride. If you like cop movies (even if they're dark) and heist films (even if there are hardly any good guys), this is the movie for you. "B"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bad guys are bad, the good guys are bad, and the background characters are worse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Hillcoat entertains a distinct vision of the seedier facets of humanity. Everyone existing within his twisted worlds exudes depravity ? including the protagonists. In "Triple 9," the good guys wear black, but so do the villains, the victims, and the bystanders. While the construction of his strikingly flawed characters beckons with a macabre intrigue, the faults don't stop with just their morals. An illogicality engulfs their motives and decisions, leading the audience towards a conclusion both predictable and unconvincing, only peppered with brief moments of exhilaration instead of dowsed in memorably evocative musings on criminality.Former black ops soldiers Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Russell Welch (Norman Reedus) have joined with Atlanta, Georgia police detectives Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie), Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.), and Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul), to carry out a bank job for devious mobster Irina Vaslov (Kate Winslet). Though the burglary is successful, their situation quickly sours when Belmont is partnered with new transfer Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), whose uncle, Sergeant Jeff Allen (Woody Harrelson), leads the investigation into the robbery. As the two Allens steadily close in on the identities of the crooked cops and their accomplices, Irina makes new demands on Atwood, forcing the gang of thieves to risk everything on one last heist.It begins with a rather tepid cold open, establishing the major motif that "Triple 9" almost unintentionally cements; it's not going for action or "The Fast and the Furious" styled adventure fantasies that this cast would suggest, but rather stark, brutal reality. Or, at least, director John Hillcoat's perception of reality. Here, the exercise is about unveiling the most repulsive side of cops and robbers or police versus criminals - the sordid underbelly of corrupt officials and anarchic gangsters. It's evident that a film is in trouble when the only moral compass is a doped-up drunk with a penchant for crack-addicted hookers. In his attempt to deglamorize the world of high-stakes heists, Hillcoat has gone so far as to remove all glimmer of compassion; in exposing the ruthlessness of humankind, he's also forgotten to craft even a single sympathetic character. Although Affleck's Allen is intended to be somewhat innocent, the role is practically that of an extra - he's not the center of anything except randomness, or being in the wrong place at the wrong time.On the subject of realism, Hillcoat chooses to detail subtle grotesqueries instead of character development or absorbing story lines. An early bank holdup sequence highlights this with a shot of a woman lying in a pool of her own urine, utterly petrified by the discharged weapons and ski-masked terrorizers. These are certainly not the lovable likes of Butch Cassidy and Sundance or even Bonnie and Clyde. But when everything is ugly (the people, the locations, the activities, the motives), audiences are likely to become indifferent to who lives or dies and who wins or loses. Even Gal Gadot (briefly appearing as a former lover), who is too physically attractive in that unfitting Hollywood way, inhabits a detestable persona.The bad guys are bad, the good guys are bad, and the background characters are worse; even the dancers in a strip club are devoid of the usual glamor. It's particularly unfortunate that Kate Winslet took part in this dour venture, as her donning of a Russian accent to squeeze a hint of a challenge from her one-dimensional character does nothing except detract from her previously exceptional performance in "Steve Jobs." But perhaps more unforgivable than the morbidity of every scenario and the disagreeableness of every participant is the lack of a creative plot. The heists, filled with unaffecting violence and cruelty, aren't thrilling or unique. As a result, it never seems to matter whether or not they're completed - and whether or not casualties are incurred.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

Triple 9 is clearly made with Heat in mind and comes MUCH closer to it than I expected based on the reviews.There a few problems for sure. Kate Winslet is very badly cast and Woody Harrelson's character is weird. But the mood of the film is pitch perfect. Dark, tense, seedy and gripping.

		<fullReview>-Triple 9 is a 2016 American crime thriller drama film directed by John Hillcoat and written by Matt Cook. The film stars an ensemble cast featuring Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul, Clifton Collins, Jr., Norman Reedus, Teresa Palmer, Michael K. Williams, Gal Gadot, with Woody Harrelson, and Kate Winslet. The film was released on February 26, 2016 in the United States by Open Road Films. In the United Kingdom the film was released by eOne. The film received mixed reviews; its plot was criticised by some critics, but its performances, direction, and cinematography were praised.--Filming: -Principal photography began on May 28, 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia. On June 5, filming took place the at St. Regis in Buckhead, Atlanta, with Winslet. Filming took place at Centennial Olympic Park Drive, Atlanta from June 23 to June 25, 2014. In early July, filming moved to Decatur, scenes were shot from July 9?12, 2014 in the 200 block of Kings Highway. Additionally stretches of Ansley Street and Kings Highway were also be used as establishing shots. Scenes were also shot on White Street, South East of Westview Cemetery, Atlanta. On July 17, 2014, a scene was shot in Atlanta with real paramedics, SWAT Officers and Police Officers along with the principal cast. Due to heavy rain, some scenes remained unfinished while shooting at Centennial Olympic Park, where filming again took place from August 5 to 6, 2014. After that, filming was wrapped.--Critical response: -Triple 9 has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 53%, based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's consensus reads, "Triple 9's pulpy potboiler thrills don't quite live up to the ferocious talents of its cast, but the film's efficient, solidly crafted genre fun is often enough to balance its troublesome flaws." Metacritic gives the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.-Tom Huddleston of Time Out gave Triple 9 four out of five stars, positively comparing the film to Michael Mann's Heat. Huddleston praised the ensemble cast and concluded that the film is "carried off with brashness and momentum by a director who genuinely seems to be having a blast." Variety's Justin Chang was less receptive towards the film's narrative, but applauded its action sequences and wrote that the "result is a film that conveys the eerie sense of lying in wait for all its characters, and the paranoia is infectious, with at least two scenes certain to have viewers checking their car backseats upon exiting the theater.-In a mixed review, Empire's Ian Freer gave Triple 9 three out of five stars. Freer praised the casts' performance, but criticized the film's screenplay and second half, surmising that "the interesting world of the film doesn't get the story it deserves." While praising Anthony Mackie's performance and Nicholas Karakatsanis' cinematography, Indiewire's Oliver Lyttelton criticized the film's narrative structure as unsatisfying, suggesting that "perhaps there's a longer cut out there... perhaps that cut led to a film that felt like it was actually about something." Alonso Duralde of TheWrap also panned Triple 9, in particular disapproving of the film's screenplay and third act. Duralde writes: "...(Triple 9) somehow managed to collect an impressively A-list cast on its way toward becoming a cop movie that's not just dumb, it's disastrous."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Triple 9 follows a gang of criminals, including Aaron Paul, Anthony Mackie, the dude from 12 years a slave (can never spell his name), Norman Reedus and more. They rob a bank, but for their next job they have to actually kill a police officer. Anthony Mackie's character though is a slippery snake police officer as well as criminal and they decide to target his new partner, Casey Affleck. Now that premise is an intriguing one and when the film focuses purely on this aspect it becomes an intriguing film. However, there was more than one time that i was bored in this movie.To me among an all star cast Aaron Paul and Anthony Mackie really stood out. But when you have such a big cast with Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet also included, it means some big stars get a lot less screen time. For example i don't really watch the walking dead but i did want to see Norman Reedus show me his acting range, yet he just wasn't in this film long enough to even be credited among the main cast. But the stories of the two before i mentioned in particular were great, Aaron Paul's performance was sort of similar to the way he portrays Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad but it worked and he shined in the role. Kate Winslet though, i don't really know what she was trying to get across with her character but whatever it was didn't really work for me. I'll be honest, i didn't even recognise her at first.So anyway, to wrap it up, Triple 9 isn't bad. The opening of this film is great but then you start to hope the film wraps up soon because it starts to drag and feel longer than it is and when a film makes you feel like that it doesn't make you want to see it again. But when the story kicks in it gives some good twists and turns and it is solid. So whilst this film is far from perfect, it is an okay film and i'd say if you were to catch it on TV then try it out, just don't expect it to go out all guns blazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Disappointing Films of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had so much going for it. John Hillcoat is in my opinion a pretty underrated director. It has an excellent cast and I love gritty crime thrillers such as this. Unfortunately, it doesn't work.First off, John Hillcoat does do a great job as far as creating atmosphere and environment go. He does an excellent job of creating a dark and gritty urban atmosphere and mood right from the start of the film. The cast also does a really good job given what material they have to work with. The action scene also are pretty well done.That's about where the positives end. The big issue with this film that keeps it from working is it's incredibly shallow plot and script. The plot at first glance seems really simple, but it's executed in such a way where it quickly becomes convoluted mess. This is because the film follows several characters all of which have little-to-no development at all and gives us nothing to invest in. It also doesn't help that the plot is hitting all too familiar beats to the genre which only reminds you that you've seen this film done before and much better.I wasn't expecting the next Training Day, but this film should have been a lot better considering the talent that was involved which just makes it all the more disappointing. Hillcoat and the cast try their best to work with what they are given, but there's only so much they can do when working with a script and story this weak. If you are really interested in this film, I recommend the Schwazeneger flick Sabotage from a few years ago that tackles this kind genre much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing at the dollar theater was 95 cents too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Triple 9. "A gang of criminals and corrupt cops plan the murder of a police officer in order to pull off their biggest heist yet across town." The synopsis sounded interesting. Don't let it fool you. Featuring Kate Winslet, who would have been better off going down with the Titanic than appearing even momentarily in this, it was a bloody snoozefest. When it ended, seemingly 6 3/4 hours after it started, the audience gave a gasp of relief and ran out of the theater like hostages finally freed with only minor injuries. The idea was good if only they had an interesting story to go with it. It was a predictable shoot-em up corrupt cop movie that dragged on in too many places and never really engaged the viewer. I know why it was called Triple 9. It must be a German title. Nine! Nine! Nine! No, no, no. Don't go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'TRIPLE 9': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Gritty crime thriller; about a gang of criminals (including two corrupt cops) that are forced into performing two dangerous heists, for a Russian mob boss's wife. It was directed by John Hillcoat (who also directed the outstanding 'LAWLESS' and 'THE ROAD'), and it was scripted by first time feature film writer Matt Cook. The all- star cast includes Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson, Clifton Collins, Jr., Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Teresa Palmer and Cal Gadot. I enjoyed it immensely. The story takes place in Atlanta, Georgia; where Michael Atwood (Ejiofor) leads a team of criminals in a daring bank robbery. They're objective is to retrieve a safe deposit box; which contains information vital to freeing a convicted Russian Mafia boss. Michael takes the box to Irina Vlaslov (Winslet), the mob boss's wife, but she insists they perform another job for her. She next wants the gang to steal more important data (on her husband), from a secured government building. Irina kills one gang member, and threatens to take Michael's son; in order to get the criminals to cooperate. The group devises a plan to kill a cop (a Triple 9 police call), as a diversion. Gang member Marcus Belmont (Mackie), a corrupt cop, suggests they kill his new partner, Chris Allen (Affleck).The movie is very dark, gritty and graphically violent; it also contains explicit sex, nudity, disturbing drug use and lots of foul language. It's definitely not a movie for everyone, but the right audience should get a big kick out of it. Some of it seems pretty intense and hard to watch; but it also feels like a movie (like a really good crime action flick). The pacing is great, the performances are all good and the dialogue is witty. The film definitely has it's flaws too though. It's an especially odd mix of genre pleasing action formula, and realistic crime thriller; but I really enjoyed it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could be one of the finest ensemble casts of the year, turns a mundane script, in to a mundane, seen it all before heist thriller.a crew of corrupt cops and career criminals, are blackmailed by the Russian Mob to rob a bank in broad daylight. The leader of the crew is an ex-special forces operator turned private sector. Unsatisfied with the job, the head of the mob, kidnaps his family and forces him to rob a Special Forces safe house that contains secret government files. The crew must figure out a way to manufacture a 999, police code for officer down, to use during their heist. When of the corrupt cops gets a new rookie partner, the crew decides that he is the perfect target. But the rookie survives the attack, and suspects the dirty cops. Meanwhile the police chief begins to track down the Russian Mob, and starts finding evidence of corruption among the cops. The pressure starts mounting and the crew begins to turn on each other and reveal dark secrets.....The opening robbery has its moments, but it doesn't stimulate you in the way it should do. Opening set pieces are there to eat the tone of the film, to let you know that things are going to be a lot more dangerous and riskier than this one.For a good example, see the opening of Heat, for a poor example, stick with this. Because this is the poor mans Heat, with extra special guest stars.But the biggest problem is, there is literally not one character to root for. The corrupt cops are vile, the criminals try to be good in the sense that they don't trust the cops, but are also horrid, and the good guys are either very loud drunks, or moody brothers of the new Batman who couldn't care about anything other than his own backside.And then there is Kate Winslet, in a baffling turn as a Mob boss with the most hilarious accent she has delivered on screen.By the third act,you couldn't care less who lives, dies, gets written out of the film in another way, because it's just bland and. Mundane for its own good.Kudos though to Clifton Collins Jr. though, he's been playing the same role now for heaven knows how long, and he doesn't change here.It's all a bit meh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Do We Root For?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that has specific moments that could be considered great, but the sum of its parts is a little messy, convoluted, and a bit of a disappointed. John Hillcoat's direction is unsurprisingly effective when it needs to be, including a few incredibly intense action sequences. He also brought a great amount of realism to a film that could have felt over-the-top. Triple 9 is by no means a great film, but it's hard to deny that enjoyment I had watching this film.With probably the biggest ensemble cast of the year so far, it doesn't suffer from any acting problems. Anthony Mackie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot and a few others round out the accomplished cast. As great as some of their performances are, particularly, Casey Affleck and Anthony Mackie, I feel like most of them have played a similar role in the past (in a better movie). Affleck played a similar cop/detective character in Gone Baby Gone. Norman Reedus essentially plays Daryl Dixon. Harrelson plays his True Detective character with a slight spin, and I swear Aaron Paul was playing Jesse Pinkman. That's not to say they all don't do their jobs in the film, but at times I found myself wishing I was watching some of these actors other films instead.The film takes a little while to get going too. The opening heist scene is cool, including an intense highway sequence, but there's so many moving pieces that it can be hard to keep track of who is who and who is on whose side at first. The greatest strength of the film is its realism, however. The entire plot feels like it's being played out in present day Atlanta and the heists, deaths, and characters don't feel hyper-real. The characters are written well enough that at times you don't know who to root for and who to trust.Even the unrecognizable Kate Winslet, never takes her character further than the story asks her to. When there are surprising shifts with characters, they felt necessary within the constructs of their personality. I think the film could of definitely spotlighted focus on a few characters instead of making it more of an ensemble, so that the film's overall quality could have potentially improved. But at the same time, I loved all of the performances. This is a hard film to pinpoint its quality. The characters are in fact more interesting than any of the heists themselves, and I think that's a tribute to Hillcoat's direction and the screenplay, but it can also be uneven and convoluted at times. Overall, I think people can have a good time with Triple 9.+Affleck's standout performance+Ensemble cast is very good as well+Meticulously crafted intense action sequences+Realistic feel-Most of the actors have played similar roles (in better films/TV)-Ensemble proves to be overwhelming at times7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing Winslet has ever done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" To survive out here you've got to out monster the monster" is one of the tag lines to Triple 9 and it pretty much sums up this film. It's a hard hitting thriller about a group of cops who are being blackmailed by the Russian mafia to pull off a robbery and the only way they can do it is set up a 999 as a distraction which in America means a man down but as usual not everything goes to plan. I really liked this film. It doesn't pull any punches and it had me involved from the very start . The story isn't complicated and the acting is first class. especially from Casey Affleck and Kate Winslet and I will go as far to say that this is the best thing I have seen her do. I'm not sure why this wasn't a bigger hit when it was first released , perhaps the timing didn't help but for me it's the best thing I have seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense cops and robbers thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Hillcoat (The Road, Lawless) takes his Wild West vision to the mean streets of Atlanta, GA, my old home town. The cast was stacked with big names like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson, Aaron Paul, and Kate Winslet. This long list isn't used to their total potential but still this movie is full of tense scenes and an entertaining heist movie. This cops and robbers drama works with the shades of gray when the cops turn out to be working with the bad guys. The tension heats up when Anthony Mackie's Marcus and Clifton Collins Jr.'s Franco as the two corrupt cops decide that the best way to distract from a robbery is to kill a fellow office, in this case Casey Affleck's Chris who also happens to be a major crimes detective's nephew. The uncle is played by a pot smoking dope snorting Woody Harrelson.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Triple 9", starring Chiwetel Ejiofor-The Martian, Salt; Casey Affleck-The Finest Hours, Gone Baby Gone; Anthony Mackie-The Falcon in the Marvel movies, Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter; Woody Harrelson-The Hunger Games movies, No Country For Old Men and Kate Winslet-The Divergent movies, Finding Neverland.This is a star filled cast in a cops &amp; robbers story full of characters with varying degrees of badness. There are dirty cops, of course, but there are also good cops with bad ..... I guess you would say habits? Chiwetel plays the leader of a gang of criminals that uses military style techniques to pull off their heists. Anthony is one of the dirty cops on Chiwetel's parole and guess who he gets for his new partner on the police force? Yep, good, clean cop Casey, whose first job is to take down Chiwetel's gang. Woody is Casey's uncle and Woody is one of those inbetweeners; he is a good cop but sometimes, he will use drugs confiscated from busts. Kate plays the wife of a Russian Mafioso that is trying to get her husband out of prison by using Chiwetel's gang to procure items she needs for hubby's release. FYI: The movie title 999 is police code for an officer down. Chiwetel plans on having a police officer killed on one side of town, drawing all available units to that location and then he and his men can heist all they want in the opposite direction with little or no interference. I think I mentioned earlier about a star filled cast; I also recall seeing AAron Paul, Gal Gadot/the new Wonder Woman, Norman Reedus/The Walking Dead and Teresa Palmer. It's rated "R" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 55 minutes. I enjoyed this one enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

Before going to see this movie I had never heard of and never seen any commercials or trailers. I did not pay to see this movie but I would. Honestly I'd buy it on DVD too.John Hillcoat did an amazing job directing this movie. His use of short cuts added suspense to many scenes. And Michael Kenneth Williams character was unexpected and hilarious. Lastly, I do not recommend taking ANY children to see this movie. It contains drug use, sex, and A LOT of violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gritty heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 January 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Triple 9. Controlled by the Russian Mob, a gang of corrupt cops carry out crimes in Atlanta and try to cover their tracks by staging a Triple 9, which means police officer down. However, when they are double crossed by the Russian Matriarch played superbly (but rather unusually) by Kate Winslet, they are desperate to find a way out of their rapidly imploding situation. A little hard to follow, it's worth sticking with as the plot twists and turns throughout. I'm sure Atlanta has some good points but in this film we saw nothing but the seedy underworld of the gangland city and the corruption in the police department......even the city itself looked neglected and dangerous. The innocent rookie in all this was played by Casey Affleck, and he brought a raw energy to his character as he was flung back and forth throughout the story. As previously mentioned, the unusual choice of Kate Winslet showed another side to her acting talents, as she ruled her Mobster Family with a strong hand and slightly dodgy accent. A mention must also go for Woody Harrelson who played Casey Affleck's uncle. He brought two sides to the role, both the mean gritty cop and the caring uncle who looks out for his nephew, an understated role in the body of the film but played with his usual flair. It's worth sitting through this film as it keeps drawing you in right to the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, evil feeling, all of the characters are bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dark and evil feeling film. As of the 45 minute mark, when I walked out, every character in the film is evil. There isn't any good guy except maybe for the one cop who shows up late in the story and obviously doesn't matter much having had about 1 minute if screen time by the 45 minute mark. It is a hopeless and pointless film that brings up nothing but negative emotion in the viewer. I've always found it troubling that so many people like that kind of thing. I do not agree with other reviewers who compare it to Sicaro. Sicaro had a few characters who were good, and that film is all about those characters trying to do good in the face of evil. Sicaro is a very disturbing film, but watchable and well done. This film is nothing at all like that. It's just evil on top of pointless evil.</fullReview>

The moment when a new cop who gets transferred to the unit hears "This ain't Buckhead" you just know, Training Day meets Takers for Atlanta folks this illustration of the South Atlanta region slightly exaggerates. There is an increase of crimes in the Latin American community, but there is a proportional rise in the Latin American general population. Persecution of influentially sensitive cultural paradigms surface as the city's protectors face corruption. Basing this portrait on the thought that there exist shattered neighbors in Atlanta is only acceptable within prudent reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Triple 9 tells the story of a bunch of dirty cops. These cops mainly, Marcus Belmont(Anthony Mackie) &amp; Franco Rodriguez(Clifton Collins Jr.) work for the Russian mob led by, Irina Vlaslov(Kate Winslet). The other members on Marcus' crew are, Michael Atwood(Chiwetel Ejiofor), Gabe Welch(Aaron Paul) &amp; Russell Welch(Norman Reedus). Irina orders the crew to pull off their most complicated heist, to date. In order to execute this heist, the crew plans to shoot a police officer &amp; initiate a code 999 which means, officer down. This will distract all the cops in the city &amp; the crew will be able to pull off the heist, without any difficulty. However, this plan is not as easy as it sounds. Triple 9 is a great film. The screenplay by Matt Cook, is a breath of fresh air in this industry of adaptations, sequels, reboots &amp; remakes. There are tons of twists &amp; turns in the movie, that will keep you guessing, right till the end. The first thirty minutes of the film are a little slow, compared to the breakneck pace of the remaining ninety minutes. This is the only flaw in the movie. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Michael Atwood. It is nice to see Ejiofor portray a character, with gray shades. Casey Affleck is great as Chris Allen. Anthony Mackie is spectacular as Marcus Belmont. Mackie's questionable character, is a far cry from his superhero turn as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Woody Harrelson is amazing as Jeffrey Allen. Aaron Paul is excellent as Gabe Welch. Kate Winslet is awesome as Irina Vlaslov. Gal Gadot is impressive as Elena Vlaslov. Norman Reedus &amp; Teresa Palmer are effective in their minor roles as Russell Welch &amp; Michelle Allen, respectively. Clifton Collins Jr. is superb as Franco Rodriguez. Triple 9 is a must watch for everyone who loves action thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some early complaints but an overall very engaging film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Triple 9 was a surprisingly very enjoyable film that played out like you average every day crime film with some differences here and there that made it quite unique. It is essentially about some criminals, corrupt cops, and the Russian mafia and how they all tie together in a mission to set up a seemingly impossible heist. One of the first things to note is the huge talented cast in this film, they include: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Winslet, Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson, Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot, and Clifton Collins Jr. And every single one of them i thought put in solid, convincing performances that helped me to stay invested in the early parts of the film. The film has an overall very dark and grim tone throughout that i really liked. There is not much fun to be had at all but it worked for the story they were trying to tell. The story is also very interesting for the most part which was great. But not everything was smooth sailing. The story mainly after the first act of the film was very engaging and it did a great job at blending the heist/crime elements with the action/thriller themes. There were some very intense moments that did have me holding my breath in anticipation of what may happen, which was great. Apart from maybe one or two instances the events of the film were not at all predictable, which allows you to anticipate and look forward to what was happening next. Some of the latter portions of the film introduced some mystery/thriller themes and reminded me a lot of Prisoners which is an incredible film. The film suited having a very dark tone as it doesn't sugar-coat any of the violent moments. It does get a little violent and gruesome at times but the gore didn't feel overdone or out of place like it does in many other action/thrillers. Here it added more of a sense of realism to the film and added to the gritty nature. It also had an interesting visual style that came through at certain times throughout the film that i really admired. This was most likely the work of Director John Hillcoat who has done some other very visually engaging films, although that isn't what he is known for. I wouldn't mind seeing the film again just to see some of the foreshadowing and little details that hint to events later in the film that i may have missed. The majority of the issues with the film occur in the first 30 minutes and it is mainly down to the pacing. There were some very exciting moments but there were also moments where it was starting to drag quite a bit and it took its time to move along. If it wasn't for the performances the initial parts of the film would have been very hard to watch. Some of the story elements early on were thrown at you a little too quick and it did get a little overwhelming. It did make more sense a little later but it was kinda messy at times in the first act of the film. One thing i wish the film did a little better was getting invested in some of the characters early on. Some characters it does a great job with getting you to care about their agendas and their situation but there were moments where it was trying to get you to feel more for some of the characters but because of the nature of the film or those characters you kinda don't... But that's just a minor thing. So in the end, apart from some complaints about the early parts of the film, it actually shaped up to be a very good one that you can definitely enjoy if you like the crime/heist genre. I don't know where a lot of the highly negative reviews for this film are coming from because this was in no way anything less than a good film. The ensemble cast was great, the story was engaging and it kept you invested in the character right till the very end. 7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blistering romp in the uber violent crime fields</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hillcoat's Triple 9. Bloody. Nasty. Blistering. Nihilistic. And surprisingly deft in its presentation of character. The only clear cut, out and out protagonist is Casey Affleck's Marcus Allen, a young detective with a wife and kid, brutally unaware that he's been targeted by a group of stunningly dirty cops and a few ex special forces hardcases to bite the dust in a planned homicide, sparking an 'officer down' over the airwaves to distract the force from what's really going down. With the exception of his straight arrow heroics, the entire rest of the cast is a snake pit of depraved, slimy, reprehensible degenerates, populating a decayed, gang infested Atlanta where the cops are just as likely to empty a clip into your skull as the cholos. Chiwetel Efjor plays Atwood, leader of a most unfortunate crew of misfits who are forced to perform near suicidal heists for tyrannical Israeli-Russian mafia witch Irena (a bleach blond, terrifying Kate Winslet). Their newest venture is so impossible that they're attempting to use a slain officer as a ditch effort to get their stake. Of course it all goes to high hell, as we've come to expect and love in these type of films, with bullets, profanity, self destructive behaviour and wanton violence languishing all over the screen in glorious excess. Efjor is crackling good, showing brief glimpses of humanity in a dude who has lost his soul down a deep dark well, a caged animal fighting tooth and nail to no avail. The rest of his crew spend the film savagely trying to out - sleaze each other, and I mean that in the best way possible. They are really a bunch of snot rags, and this is a group of outstanding actors having bushels of fun being irredeemable bad boys. Anthony Mackie is walking C-4 as Efjor's right hand, a guy rotten to the marrow with moral conflict. Norman Reedus leaks grease as an ex special ops prick and their getaway driver. I didn't think Aaron Paul could be anymore despicable than in breaking bad, but somehow manages it here, playing a dude so grungy you'll squirm. It's Clifton Collins Jr. who scores the points though. He hasn't had a great role in years and he comes out blazing as the icy sociopath of the group. Then there's Woody Harrelson. Oh, Woody. He's clearly having a ball as Affleck's stoner uncle and high ranking cop. He spends the entire film ripped off his gourd on joint after joint, and take it from me, he knows how to play stoned impeccably. Despite the laconic bumbling, he shows that fire and ferocity we've come to know from him in brief unmistakable flashes, especially where it matters. Throw in Teresa Palmer as Affleck's loving wife and Gal Gadot in full slut mode and you've got a cast for the time capsule. Hillcoat wastes not a second in propelling his narrative forward with the force of a bulldozer, giving us minute moments of respite amongst the surging monsoon of bloodshed and dirty deeds. Composer Atticus Ross whips up a foreboding, hair raising war cry of a score that kicks in from the first frame and doesn't quit till the last shell casing has hit the ground. The only misstep the film makes is killing off its best actor way too early on, but its not enough to be an actual concern or hurt it overall. If sickeningly satisfying ballets of blood, broken limbs and morally bankrupt people engaging in all kinds of giddily fun criminal activities are your thing, this is a great way to kick off the year, cinematically speaking. Hell even if it's not your thing go check it out. It'll shake you up and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, that was certainly a movie that I watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the signs were good for this movie. I like heist movies, and I couldn't imagine being bored by one, at least. I kind of liked the director's previous movie, Lawless, though it wasn't without flaws. But most of all, there's that cast: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Daryll off of The Walking Dead, that guy from Breaking Bad, Clifton Collins Jr sleazing it up, Woody Harrelson hamming it up, and Kate Winslet vamping it up. Here's a note for any would-be directors out there: if you manage to get a stellar cast, you might want to try giving them something to do. Here, everyone gets exactly one characteristic, so Ejiofor is mopey, Mackie is angry, Collins is sleazy (obviously) and Woody Harrelson is off in his own little world, cheerfully ignoring everyone else. None of them gets time to really develop a character, and because there are so many people competing for screen time, none of them even gets that long to do his thing before we're off to someone else. The editing is choppy, and when Winslet isn't on screen, most of the movie consists of men growling incomprehensibly at each other. The heist scenes are well-executed, but the linking scenes are insufferably dull.That problem isn't helped by some baffling narrative choices. Norman Reedus is an effortlessly charismatic screen presence, but all his scenes here are shot inside vehicles. I'm not joking - I can't remember if he even gets to stand up. And then there's poor old Casey Affleck, a dreary bore who's inexplicably made the centre of attention instead of much more interesting actors. Come to think of it, that was my main complaint about Lawless, too, that the action concentrated on the most boring character.Triple Nine isn't hateful, and it isn't hopeless. The heist scenes do work well, and Vampy Winslet is fun, but there's way too much gunk to plough through in order to reach the good bits.</fullReview>
