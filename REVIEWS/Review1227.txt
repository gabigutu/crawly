		<shortDescription>Some intelligent film-making there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you've seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you've been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that's me.Notwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.?creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish ? just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to "move" me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan's room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That's for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don't know and I don't care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don't watch this film if you're looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don't even skip this film thinking it's children's movie ? no it isn't. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people's lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.Okay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it's two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They're there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.Aamir Khan, however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That's the surprise but you don't miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.All in all, I'd say go and watch the film. I wouldn't recommend if you're addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making, then Taare Zameen Par is a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a special film for the special child in all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for a mainstream Hindi film, the following is rare: 1. a film for children2. the only star of the film getting a limited screen space 3. high quality animation4. choosing undertones over melodrama, 5. no regular masala stuff 6. strong message that can actually change lives of people 7. conviction and honesty of the makers palpable in every frame 8. and in spite of all this, the movie offering complete, healthy entertainment...the only problem with the audience is that although we keep shouting on the extreme want of quality cinema, meaningful cinema, when a good film actually comes, we tend to find more flaws in it than appreciating it. Are we insecure of accepting somebodies honesty and creative genius?Sure, Taare Zameen Par has moments that could have been better, but shouldn't we just try to overlook those and once, for all, applaud the effort the makers have put...and believe me it is not difficult... for there are innumerable other moments that leave you spellbound, a wet film over your eyes, a strange pain down your throat, a mild ache at your heart, but a pure smile on your lips... there are times you wish you were a kid... may be it takes a child to love simple tales told with honesty and warmth... may be we grown ups have lost that quality we all once had... but Taare Zameen Par should touch a chord somewhere in every one's heart... we all have been after all, at least for some beautiful part of our lives, special. the film is dedicated to that special child in all of us...P.S- no one can hate it...at least i would like to think that way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendid effort..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First point: Taare Zameen Par is not a movie for children. Its also not a movie only about 'special' children. What it stands for and depicts stunningly is how the cruel world outside is stealing away our children's precious childhood. It is about how our parents are turning into monsters and imposing their own dreams and aspirations on their children which eventually destroys our children's confidence and can only create a generation of hate. Its about how each child needs attention and care and how we so lack those qualities in this life thats bounded by time.Aamir Khan does a fabulous job both behind and in front of the camera. There are scenes in which just his facial expressions tugs at our hearts and moves us. That is truly the hallmark of a great actor. But then, Taare Zameen Par is not about Aamir. Its truly owned by Darsheel Safary. Right from the first scene to the very end he steals the show and our hearts with his endearing acting.Taare Zameen Par is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile, laugh, cry, nod in agreement and seethe with anger.. everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think.. to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more. Watch it if you like watching meaningful movies.- Sreejith - dailyrium.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aamir scores an Ace, TZP a natural delight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ghost (director) has been resurrected in human flesh and yes, Mr Perfectionist has got it all perfect. His maiden directorial venture is a delight for one and all. Whether you are a kid, or a teenager, just married, or if you are a parent -- Yes... You'll love it! Pre-release in what appeared to be a non mainstream film, shines like a UNIVERSAL film which will keep the box office abuzz.The story moves along at a very natural pace at which the viewer is able to connect to the 8 year old dyslexic boy played by Darsheel Safary. That is the biggest plus point of the movie, the viewer draws parallel with the boys character connecting with him at a very high emotional level. You'll reminisce and be transported back to those wonderful years of your childhood and will have more than a tear in the eye. The scene where the boy is admitted in the boarding school and bidding goodbye to his parents and brother followed by the 'Maa' song is a real tear jerker. But tears is not all what you are going to have, the screenplay makes sure that those tear jerking moments are followed by heavy doses of laughter with some lovely and innocent humorous moments.If you thought that only Sanjay Leela Bhansali knew how to capture art on celluloid then watch TZP. The boy's bunked day at school, his room, classroom decor, and the painting competition in the end are a colorful visual delight expressing a million words to the viewers.Yes, its true. Aamir's character appears just before the end of the first half, but one is so engrossed that Aamir - The actor's absence is not felt. Thats remarkable! All the credit goes to the protagonist played by Darsheel who in my books gives the best performance till date by a child artist in Hindi Cinema. He is the heart and soul of the movie and how naturally this boy handles scenes of intense emotions with such ease in his first movie is stunning. Tisca Chopra as the boy's mother gives a top notch performance at par, if not above the likes of roles played by Nirupa Roy, Rakhi and Kirron Kher.Aamir the actor has a shorter but powerful role which he performs decently. But at the end of the day its Aamir - The Director who wins hands down by extracting 'A GRADE' performances from all the cast, and making a movie which connects to the heart of the viewer. The second half becomes a little slow in between and it could have been more crisp. But thats negligible because in the end the movie manages convincingly to convey a very important message to today's parents - Your kids are not race horses of a derby. Let them travel life at their pace as each has their unique mission which only they can fulfill.Lastly, TZP just made 2007 better and interesting. The award season is knocking and well, watch out, TZP may just pull off a surprise or two by upsetting the favorites so far...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly the best Hindi movie of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen Taare Zameen Par, you are missing out. The best Hindi movie of 2007 without doubt. Extremely sensitively handled, and flawlessly executed performances, especially by Darsheel Safary. This movie really hits you.In a way, everyone can relate to it, especially if you have grown up in India where most children are classified as dumb or unintelligent if they "can't" become engineers or doctors. I went in with huge expectations, and this movie exceeded them.Some reviews have complained about situations in the movie being too simple or repetitive in parts, but I have absolutely no problems with that. This is no thriller. You know what's going to happen, but you are looking forward to it too.The songs might not be great hits, but they gel really well with the movie. They are beautifully worded, and capture the emotions of the characters perfectly.When the end credits started rolling, most people started walking towards the exit, but even when they had almost stopped rolling, most of them were still standing near the exit, watching the images in the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch for every parent.....!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Taare Zameen Par" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director (Aamir). Aamir does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character (Ishan), and making the audience experience the reality of children's paradise &amp; their inner world. The story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial &amp; cinematography mastery exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Ishan on his journey and awareness of his weakness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject. Aamir is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental dimension's while maintaining the humanity and essence of the subject. Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Tanay Chheda (ishaan) and cast, this film succeeds on every level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Perfectionist proves the fact he can be perfectionist in anything he does, Acting or Direction. TZP is definitely worth a watch for Matured Genre more than the kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He is known as the most versatile and talented actor Bollywood has ever known. He can carry on any role with Nth degree of perfection and Charisma, may it be a Tapori in Ghulam or a mutineer in Lagaan or even a love struck terrorist in Fanaa. That is why Bollywood calls him the Mr. Perfectionist. A movie buff can never get enough of this acting pioneer. Now what if this acting legend puts on a shoe of a director? Will he be able to do the same level of justice and perfection to direction as he does as an actor? Well an intelligent man once told, An perfectionist is not the one who finds perfection in something, but rather a perfectionist is the one who imparts perfection to anything and everything that he does. And Aamir Khan, the Mr. Perfect lives no fissure to comment about his direction or the movie in his debut movie as a Director, Taare Zameen Par. A Brilliantly done movie by this Megastar of the Tinsel Town, with a perfect message for humanity.Taare Zameen Par is a story of a young Dyslexic Kid Ishaan Awasthi, who is unable to comprehend things that is taught to him in school and ends up being a duffer, unworthy child in his entire School. His parents too fail to realize his real problem and held's his carelessness and negligence responsible for his derogatory performance in his studies. He is shifted to a boarding school by his Dad after his Dad gets enough of Ishaan's complaints from the school. This breaks Ishaan fully and he loses all his young budding hopes filled in those innocent eyes of his, until he meets his new Art teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) in his Boarding school. Ram understands the problem Ishaan faces and also discovers an amazing talent hidden in Ishaan. Ram very soon realizes the fact that he is the only Hope in the sinking life of Ishaan. Now he has to help Ishaan in making him realize his Young dreams once again, he has to fill new hopes in Ishaan's life once again, he has to prove the fact that 95.5% score and a first rank in class is not what life's all about in a student, there is a much more than being just a Doctor, Engineer or a MBA.Aamir has just done a brilliant piece of direction and proved the fact that there is no end for his perfection. He has won the hearts of the audience once again, this time it's both as a director and as an actor. What was considered as a movie for Kids has much more to tell for elder genre than for the younger. Darsheel Safary just does a double justice to his role as a dyslexic kid Ishaan and why not, afterall Mr. Perfectionist himself has directed him. This is a movie you truly are gonna remember much after you have watched it in a theater. Don't you miss it?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oxygen to Revive the Soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good film on children has always been much needed for Indian film-goers. And when in this moment of dearth one gets treated to a movie that simply touches the soul - needless to say - Taare Zameen Par - does just that.Aamir Khan proves his mettle as a director. As an actor he is fabulous. The story captures a look at a middle class family who feel the younger kid (Darsheel Safary) is not a patch on the elder one who is a topper at class. The younger one is always struggling with his ABCs and spends more time out of his class rather than inside.Its only when he is sent to boarding school with the hope that an iron fist will help him improve that he comes across art teacher (Aamir Khan) who correctly identities his problem of suffering from dyslexia and decides to unleash his creativity and make him an achiever.To know more one should watch this movie since it has elements that everyone could relate towards while at school or boarding, and brings into focus the need for underprivileged and slow learning children to be given the chance to prove themselves with patience and love that would help them merge with mainstream education and become worthwhile contributors.Brilliant job Aamir and your team for treating the subject with respect, honesty and flair. Darsheel Safary as the struggling kid has done total justice to his role and puts in a performance that will always be remembered.The movie will make you cry, make you laugh, make you rejoice and come out feeling that there are some people out there who take Indian cinema several notches higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great inspiring movie for all, Every child is special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Bollywood releases 100s of movies every year but few of them has really left a mark on the audience for a long time. I am pretty much sure that this movie has done an excellent job for all those people who are creative but not good in academics. Many people think things differently but in India like country where competition begins at the age of 4 they are just a dumb in the society. Amir khan has done a very good job on both sides on the screen and off the screen besides he doesn't appear too often on the screen but Darsheel Safary steals the whole movie show.What a nice performance by a 8-9 year old child you are really gonna love this child. The movie brings our sweet childhood memories back.Its a mix of emotion, laugh and cry. We can imagine how we exploit children because they are not like us or they are not able to do what their parents want them to do.At the start, movie shows that how a little child(Darsheel Safary) is forced to do what he can't understand. He gets lowest marks in the class and he has failed once in class three.Sometimes he bunk the class and most of the time he has been out of the class because he don't understand how to turn a page number of the book or while reading letters dance so he can't read. After fear of being thrown him out of the school his parents put him in a boarding school.They think he is lazy and notorious.But in boarding school situation gets worse until a drawing teacher(Amir khan) gets an appointment as a temporary teacher. After that Amir teaches him in different way and ultimately he gets the success.In this movie director has taken two child one who always gets first and who is punctual for his work and other one is Darsheel Safary who is not good in academics because he can't understand letters and can't memorize too much things at a time. This movie is a motivation for all kind of child and their parents. Everyone should must watch this movie at least once. If you are too emotional then u may cry with Amir khan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Depiction of Dyslexia Ever in a Fictional Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I just became aware of this film a few weeks ago, and ordered a DVD and watched it today (10-9-11) this review is unlikely to be seen by many because the film is 4 years old and there are nearly 250 user reviews already. So rather than rehash the plot, I will first mention that I have been an Educational Therapist for over 45 years, and have worked extensively with dyslexic and ADD and ADHD children in my practice, so this film had intrinsic interest to me going in. But despite seeing many films on learning problems through the years, some very good, I have never seen any movie that can come close to this one both in emotional power and subject accuracy. When I saw that the film is 165 minutes long, I was expecting to watch it in two sittings, but I never once felt the need to take a break, and in the second half of the film, when the director Aamir Khan enters the story, I was riveted continuously, and embarrassingly shed more than a few tears. If you have any interest in education and the problems the outsiders face, this is a must-see. And if you just want to see an intelligent drama with no car chases, explosions, sex scenes, or ultra violence, then you will be glad you saw this wonderful film, which, by the way, while it is about children, is not really for children, unless they are over about 11 or 12, or have suffered the experience of failing due to undiagnosed or treated reading or similar learning difference. Don't let the Disney Studio name fool you, this does not feel like a typical Disney movie, but the film does point out that Walt Disney himself had school learning problems as a child. Another aspect of the film is something I always try to impart to my clients: There is life after school. And it is not necessary to be the best at everything to be successful. Just become the best you are able and try to find something you like doing that makes you happy.The rest will take care of itself. What a great film!Since I first wrote this review, I have rewatched it 5 more times, and now consider it the best film I have ever seen, and that encompasses about 2500 films.</fullReview>

At no point in the movie does he overshadow the kid. The best thing I love about the movie is the facial expressions of Kid. This kid is a genius and has filled life into the role of a dyslexic. Movie is so perfect, doting mom, lovable brother and a strict dad. The manifestation of problems has been toned beautifully and the way the kid is helped to get out the problems is artistic.

		<shortDescription>This has rocked the core in me !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down in my local theatre with no expectations at all, and what I was in for, for the coming couple of hours, was just mind boggling. Taare Zameen Par might not win any awards, might not get the praise it so surely deserves, but don't let that fool you. For this movie is not just a story about Ishaan, but a masterpiece ! Ishaan is a 8 year old boy who suffers from dyslexia, no matter how hard he tries he just doesn't succeed in day to day activities. But what is mostly the case in our hard society is that people don't understand him and his shortcomings. Most of the times they paint him off as a lazy-no good-brat and this drives his father so far that he will have no more of this nonsense and sends young Ishaan off to boarding school, where he gets treatened even worse. But one day arrives Mr Ramshankar Nikumbh, a temporary art-teacher and the only person in the world that understands Ishaan's problem. Taare Zameen Par moves on as Mr Nikumbh tries to understand and help out Ishaan with his problem. This starts a journey far greater and more beautiful we could ever imagine.I have seen a thousand movies and I must say that I haven't seen a script acted out so well for quite a while now. For non-movie buffs let me explain good acting, there are a few ways to tell brilliant acting from good acting . Just look for the quality, view every character as the character itself and not as the actor behind it acting the part out. If you don't see the actor, only the character that means you are convinced of the quality of acting. A view examples, Marlon Brando played The godfather so convincingly that for years to come people didn't see Brando but Vito Corleone same goes for Pacino when he played Scarface and so forth. Taare Zameen Par is a work of great acting by everyone, it feels so real and the characters grow on to you as the movie continues. And this is very strange for a Bollywood movie. Let's be real this is the film industry who had us believing that Hritik was a jewel thief and that Abishek was a police officer, how entertaining it might be, but it just doesn't feel real. For a character to feel real, like they do in Taare Zameen Par, there is need for a great written script and clever dialogue. The actors just do what they are supposed to and the movie plays out nicely. Then there's only the editing, the background score, the location, ... to worry about. And if everything is according to a pallet, compare it to a painting, where every element blends in with the other we get a great movie. And only once in a while we witness a masterpiece and that's exactly what TZP is, and this time it's not because of Mr Khan but because of his apprentice Darsheel Safary. The young boy who played Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) is one of the best child- artists I've seen coming out of Bollywood and what a first starrer this kid got. I surely would like to see more of him in the near future. And for Aamir Khan's first movie TZP wouldn't have been the same without Safary. Although some credit goes to Mr Khan himself as well. Known to be a perfectionist, his directional debut is a clear-cut proof of this. TZP is not just a movie about kids, it's a movie about life, society and yourself as a personality. The story moves you, into nostalgic days of your childhood when you were forced and pressured by your parents or teachers, into the world of a child who is ill-treated an misunderstood, into the hard truths of our society were failure is looked down on. If there ever was a movie who could make you smile, cry and enjoy the trip it's Taare Zameen Par. A great watch for everyone. This doesn't feel like a movie coming from Bollywood, but a movie for the masses. I surely hope this does well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the film is about children,it shouldn't be confused as a film for children.The film excelled with fine performances from Darsheel Safary and Aamir Khan.The first part of the film dealt mainly with the problems faced by the protagonist Ishaan.He is a bundle of creativity,but is not able to fare well academically being dyslexic.His father,tired of the numerous complaints from teachers and other parents sends him to the boarding school to get disciplined.There he gets even more lonely and dejected,being away from his family.Aamir Khan steps in as the new art teacher,Ram Shankar Nikhumb.He encourages the children to think differently and act on their true potential.He soon realizes the reason why Ishaan is so unhappy.The rest of the film is about Ishaan realizing his true potential.The film is a must see for this Christmas!!So what are u waiting for...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Every child is an artist." -- Picasso"The child must know that he is a miracle, that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been, and until the end of the world there will not be, another child like him." -- Pablo CasalsIt's a little while after intermission in the movie Taare Zameen Par. By this time we (the audience) have already seen that Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is a kid who's been failing his classes at day school and is mocked as an idiot by both teachers and classmates. He has now been packed and sent to a boarding school. His parents hope this will improve his grades. In the new environment, Ishaan finds it all the more harder to understand concepts that are easy for his peers. The teachers who rap on his knuckles and the rules at the school have broken into him. He has lost the zest of a kid, he's become a zombie, deaf to the world.It's the Arts class, being taught by the temporary Arts teacher Ram Nikumbh (Aamir Khan). In the quest to understand what's been eating Ishaan, he has examined his notebooks, talked to his parents and discovered that the silent pupil in his class might be dyslexic. In this class, he starts to tell a story to the students. "Once upon a time, there was a kid. He had trouble understanding numbers and alphabets. He couldn't read, write and study like his classmates." He pauses, then asks "Do you know whom I'm talking about?" The camera now slips down to the level of the class desks and zeroes in onto the face of Ishaan. His mouth is agape, his sad eyes are looking down, and as the silent tension in the class rises, tears form, ready to roll down his face. His name will be mentioned and the students at this school too will mock him now.Ram answers his own question, "that kid was the great scientist Albert Einstein." Ishaan looks up and is surprised, he looks relieved that his own name wasn't brought up. Ram smiles at him and continues to tell the class how Einstein, Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and even Abhishek Bachchan had trouble with reading and writing in their youth. As we learn later, Ishaan and Einstein are not the only two possible answers to Ram's question. Ram himself is a third.That's just one of the scenes from this movie about a dyslexic kid and a teacher who discovers and helps him. It is the first directorial attempt by Aamir Khan. AK is the only Bollywood hero I admire and I saw the movie today on its release weekend. And loved it! It's a bit long, it might be AK's baby, but he should've edited it a bit. Other that that, I was positively moved by it. There were many scenes that were absolutely golden, some even brought a tear to my eye. Watch out for the one where Ishaan floats his propeller boat (made of sticks, pencils, corks and rubber-bands) in the school pond and it slowly makes its way towards Ram. That scene is both moving and metaphorical. There are many more like that.How do you even attempt to show the audience how the world looks to a kid, a dyslexic one? Using beautiful cinematography, attention to detail (observe how the camera is usually at the kid's height, not adult height) and sometimes story-telling animation (remember Calvin and his space adventures?) we get to see how Ishaan relishes the simple sights and sounds of the real world, while at the same time is being hounded by the terrors of his textbooks. This is the finest attempt I've ever seen in a movie (Hollywood or Bollywood) to show how a kid sees the adult world. Brilliant scripting and story-telling, AK the director rules!The background music is top notch, the title track and its music is superb, but the other songs are just OK. AK doesn't even enter the movie until the intermission and even after that he is just a secondary character. Darsheel Safary owns this movie!!! It's his show all the way from the start to the end. Acting that is so brilliant that you can't call it acting. Ishaan has a strict (but caring) father, a loving mother and a helpful elder brother, all of whom are characterized very realistically. I'm willing to bet that you will laugh in some scenes and cry in some of the moving scenes, especially with his mom and him.I found the movie to be both inspiring and introspective. Dyslexia actually occupies a very small piece of the movie and its message -- that each kid is unique and his/her creative imagination needs to be handled with care by parents, teachers and society. A highly recommended watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was impressed with this movie. Even more than with the Kite Runner. Mainly because it is one of the most sensitive and realistic Hindi movies that I have ever seen in my life. The first thing my sister said when we were out of the theater was "I want that kid's autograph." Darsheel Safary did a brilliant job as the dyslexic but cute Ishaan. I recommend that ALL parents watch this movie WITH their kids. This movie shows the effects of parental pressure, social isolation, and?inspiration, of course. Aamir Khan was very provoking as the caring art teacher, Nikumbh, that recognizes young Ishaan's mental withdrawal yet his amazing ability to paint and build. It is one thing to imagine such bizarre things, but to put it on paper or construct things in an appealing way is definitely a gift. I thought that no part of the movie was melodramatic or overly done which is a major concern in Indian movies. Instead, I thought that there was a lot of promise in this movie just like how there is a promise in every child that has the motivation and faith to achieve something. And the title translated as "Little Stars on Earth" describes all children that are looking for this promise although they may not have everything that most children have. Wow?what an effect this movie had on me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has rated Tare Zameen Par lower than 8 out of 10 (especially those who have given it a 1 out of 10 rating) either has not seen the movie or has a heart of stone because this was an absolute beautiful and heart touching film about a relationship between a teacher and a student. I felt really sorry for the boy Eshaan and his main problem was that he has a learning disability and is always lost in his fantasy world. The film gave a terrific insight to his fantasy world by showing spinning objects around his head and by an animated sequence. The best scene was the first appearance of Aamir Khan. I have always liked Aamir Khan's films and I would put Tare Zameen Par number 2 on his top 5 best movies &amp; number 1 would be Lagaan. The story was very uplifting, which shows that even the worst student can become the best. It was already on the IMDb top 250 when it came out and was on about 180 place but sadly not anymore and I'm disappointed. There is a huge list of crappy films that are on the top 250 but not a single Bollywood movie and this gem is original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well no words can describe this awesome movie, had a chance to watch it a couple of days back but the feeling is yet to sink in. Aamir scores and how, when his colleagues in the industry are dishing out nothing but junk. This man has dared to be different, how else could one describe the first half of the film where a kid is the only spotlight. A kid who was an unknown identity until the promos lashed on the TV screens. Yes the kid has delivered big time and holds the viewers attention through the first half with aplomb.There are many scenes which stay through, the first scene where Ishaan is fishing in the gutter, the scene where Ishaan is punished by the teacher and he makes some animal noises and licks the frame in the corridor, then the scene where he finds out that his dad was just joking about leaving the home, then the diwali scene ... just too good these are the few scenes, others have seem to missed.Stop reading reviews, Go watch it man.

		<shortDescription>Every child is special!!! (Our answer to 400 Blows)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I notice that there are many spoilers here already,therefore I wont go much into the plot detail)There seems to be an implied understanding that Aamir Khan represents the last word on intellectual mainstream cinema.It was many years back when he decided to curtail the number of projects he takes up in an year which was considered suicidal then but now is the norm for most of the top stars.For last 14 years this man has pushed the envelope for mainstream by taking some unprecedented risks with young directors and pulling it off time and time again.For some of us who have followed his career choices,there was a feeling that he would make a great director.His choices of films are a testimony to his understanding of the medium and the audience within the mainstream perspective."Taare Zameen Par" is his first directorial venture,less by design and more by circumstances.Based on the brilliant script by Amol Gupte who is one of the innovative painters and theater personalities,the story dwells into the life of boy struggling to find himself in this ruthless world.Briefly,the boy "Ishan" who suffers from dyslexia comes from a middle class Indian family who is unable to read/learn or identify letters.Constantly bombarded with unrelenting taunts for his poor academics and being labeled as a "duffer",he is isolated into his world of colors which is the only place he can seek solace in.But Ishan reaches a new low when he is packed off to boarding school by his father.The hard regimen and discipline of the school frustrates the boy out of his wits and he is finding drastic ways to put an end to his misery.He no longer feels th need to communicate .Just when things seem irrevocable,comes the art teacher,Aamir Khan,who being a dyslexic himself and working with the "less privileged" children identifies Ishan's troubles and can read through his silence,is sanitized by the apathy towards him.Then starts the process of resurrecting the boy's dying self belief and charting out a way for him to read and learn.The boy starts to slowly but surely come out of his shell and become a "child" again.One of the many aspects of a perfect film is that nothing seems to stand out,every aspect whether it be the performances,the camera work,the sound mixing,the lighting,the editing etc everything seems in sync.Same can be said about this movie.But the thing that I found overwhelming as a viewer is the music by "Shankar"-Ehsaan-Loy" and the lyrics by "Prasoon Joshi".Watch out for "taare zameen par","Meri Maa",these will definitely break you down.The cinematography by Setu is flawless and Aamir does not fall into the trap of being slick or showing off in his debut effort.(Watch how the camera is usually at Ishan's height to show his perspective,watch how slowly the camera pans into Ishan's space and how still and focused it is on his face when he is about to bare his emotions) The performances are top draw.Darsheel who plays Ishan is the crux of the film.Being the main protagonist his performance was critical to the film.I dare say,we have found a new star.The boy is brilliant in his joy,in his enthusiasm,in his loneliness as he allows us to enter his world.I feel he represents children all over the world and more critically the "child" within all of us.Of the support cast Tisca Chopra and Aamir Khan are brilliant as his mother and teacher respectively.Because the movie revolves around a middle class family in suburban Mumbai,I guess these characters and their emotions are something I can relate to.Finally(on the movie),kudos to Amol Gupte and Aamir Khan.Let us not forget this was Amol's baby and he had worked with children and done research for 7 years.What he came with was a near perfect script and it is only fair that he was credited as a creative director.What can I say about Aamir Khan that hasn't been said before?I think with every movie he is setting new yardsticks for Indian cinema.His movies clearly have elaborated that our movies can have all the commercial trappings yet need not be "dumbed down".They can be as intellectually stimulating.All I can say is that it is privilege to be in an era where this champion actor is at the absolute peak of his powers.With this movie he goes into the elite list of actors who happen to be great story tellers.But is this movie about dyslexia?Is this movie about the failure of our education system in not nurturing the individual talent but creating assembly line products?Are we as a society so obsessed with the "idea" of security through academics that creativity is of no accord to us?Are we preparing our children for a rat race or we preparing them for life?Are parents right in imposing their ambitions on the life they bring to this earth ?Some question that I have asked of myself before and some that I ask now.I guess the main motive of the film is as the tag line says "every child is special" for the talent he has.Our job is to nurture it,not mold it.p.s. I have been a frequent movie goer for last 7-8 years.But haven't seen a response like I did for this one.Everyone in the theater was in tears and simultaneous applause and is not because it was a sad film but it was "overwhelming".I guess there some part of Ishan in all of our lives.The second aspect that I have never witnessed in theaters before was that nobody moved till the credits were over.There is documentary on children at the end(do not miss it for anything,it is as moving as the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A children's film that would make Robin Williams proud!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being Aamir's directorial debut, one was sure of a didactic film. Somehow, Aamir never sets out to just tell a story or make a movie; the social message is never far away. He would almost be a Shyam Benegal if not for the dollops of humor he manages to sprinkle in his movies. The archaic belief that humor stains the "purity" of a serious message is the biggest mistake made, I feel, by "art movie" makers. A brilliant work like "Khoya Khoya Chand (2007)" was ruined by its droning pace and monotonic atmosphere. You look forward to Aamir's cinema because he uses humor, songs-- even pretty heroines-- to make sure his serious cinema is taken seriously!The movie is straightforward. Tells the story of a misunderstood dyslexic kid who leads a tortured life till new Teacher Aamir uncle comes and makes everything OK. Everyone is sorry they treated him bad. Happy ending! Blah Blah. Hardly a spoiler, I'd say, but you'd been warned.What I was not ready for was the dollops of tears that forced their way out of my eyes. I am a "Kill Bill" type of viewer and any movie with less than 100 explosions and 35 gallons of blood is usually not worth my while. Imagine my surprise when TZP easily squeezed those emotions I never knew I had. So much for "predictability"!What makes it stick with you is the uncanny acting of the kid. I must commend Aamir's direction, in the absence of any other reason, to get so many kids to act so naturally. Move over, Mr.India! The repressed anger, the fear, the small joys and the yearning to belong. Ishaan displays everything so effortlessly it would put many matine idols to shame. He manages all this without being corny or melodramatic. Then there is Setu's photography that captures the tiny details we all remember having watched as kids. Then forgotten in the rush to to attend the next con-call. Like the ripples made in a puddle after a car runs over, the aggressive spray of shower in the bathroom, the miracle of watching "ice gola" being made at Juhu beach...Finally there is Prasoon Joshi. The only reason one would watch this (like, RDB) many times over-- in theatres! Simple, non-complicated (Gulzarji, you listening?) and pedestrian lyrics. Stuff you can identify with, stuff that makes so much sense and yet sounds so poetic! Funny and sad at the same time. Added to Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music and Ram Madhvani's (of "Let's Talk" fame) cameo direction, each song tells a story.The innovative start credits and lovely collage during end-credits are not to be missed. The movie got a standing ovation at the Bangalore theatre we visited, from a predominantly college crowd at that.I hope it sensitizes Indian schools and society to treat all children as mere "children". We have to let them enjoy the colors and miracle of nature that adult life requires us to ignore. I loved this movie not so much for its message on dyslexia (although it makes a powerful statement) as for how it reminded me that I was a kid once. It reminded me how I wished those damn adults would just "understand"! I remembered how I'd decided to "remember" my childhood and not change into an "adult". Now that I have a kid of my own, TZP is just what I needed to make sure I treat my little star with the respect he deserves and not as a "race horse".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In simple words ? THAT'S CINEMA IN ITS PUREST FORM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par ? Words fell short as I start writing about this impressive emotional movie from "Aamir Khan" &amp; his team. Unarguably the film deserves a standing ovation for its unusual content and for its near perfect execution. The impact I felt after viewing it was quite similar to what I felt after watching movies of great film makers like Bimol Roy and Guru Dutt. Aamir Khan delivers what was expected from him, an out of the routine, emotional, memorable and enlightening film which is capable of bringing changes in the lives of many families. The film revolves around a boy who is facing difficulties in studies and his teacher who comes in his life as a morning breeze. The film emphasizes completely on the character of the child, his thoughts and it's a journey into the imaginative world of his mind. The visual interpretation of what he is thinking is innovatively shot and is a visual treat to watch . Aamir Khan is a thinking brain with a heart of gold and that he has proved with his directorial venture. He has the guts of following his heart and coming out with an unconventional film like this. Another merit of the film is that it is not preachy, it teaches along with providing the required entertainment to the viewers. The film talks about a condition of a child who is finding tough to compete with his classmates but it never talks about it as a disease or a mental disorder to cure. Aamir focuses on the fact that we got to give proper attention to all kids as everyone has his own areas of abilities. He also pin points on to the parents who always want their children to score in their studies and just ignore the other aspects of life relating to art and culture. Darsheel Safary, the eight year old child has given a stunning performance. He is not acting, he is emoting his character and has done his part so well that he even overshadows the subtle and cool performance of Aamir. Another actor to watch out is Tisca Chopra as the mother of the child. She is just perfect and makes you remember the motherly touch in your childhood days. The scenes of Aamir with the father of the child are the most effective in the movie. The lyrics of Prasoon Joshi are above than the music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. They both are more impressive while watching the movie. In short, it's the movie which should be watched as a compulsion by all parents along with their children (would be parents too) and also by all the teachers who should feel the responsibility they have towards each &amp; every child they teach. Concluding my review I would like to request my Indian film lovers that this is a movie which is meant to be watched without munching the popcorn and rightfully deserves a respectful viewing. Hats off to Aamir Khan &amp; Thanks for giving us "Taare Zameen Par". The movie is simply above the star rating system??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a great surprise. It was creative, beautiful, and intelligent. It is difficult to find flaws with a movie which promotes good and shows the way forward.Being from a western culture, there was things in the movie I struggled to accept such as the dialogue, music and length of the movie but as I watched it, the message or spirit of the movie caused me to see it in a different light and to see the struggle as my own limitation.A very touching movie about two of the most important things in life, learning and love. It may not be a movie for everyone, but I hope it will be for I believe whats taught in this movie would do wonders in improving the quality of life.Judged by western eyes "flaws" can be found in the movie as it is very different, but it promotes me to wonder if the true "flaws" are not in only accepting what is "normal" or what we are familiar with, a judging it in a similar way as the boy in movie was judged.This may be the best movie I have seen all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood, innocence, and the joy of little things...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par is a film about childhood, about dreams, about love, about innocence, about the joy of little things. It is about the simple things in life, things that are most beautiful, yet most often missed by the eye. This is a film that will make you cry, make you laugh, entertain you, and make you love every moment of it.Amol Gupte has written a brilliant story, and the director, Aamir Khan, has only matched up to it. I am sure the film will appeal to the mass audience, yet ever individual who watches it will identify with it very personally. That is the magic of cinema, and because in this film the entire process, beginning from the concept, to the post-production, has been so honest, it has happened flawlessly. It is about an 8 year old dyslexic boy, Ishaan Awasthi, enacted by Darsheel Safary, who lives in a world of his own. He is not good with academics, but excellent at painting. His family cannot understand or accept his problem, and they try to set things right with the use of force. The boy is sent to a boarding school, which only distances him further from his family, and he grows more and more into himself. He withdraws himself from people, from painting, even from his little pleasures and simple things that once brought him joy. And then, a new temporary art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh is inducted, and everything starts to change.We all live in our shells. We live in denial, till the time a problem hits us directly. We need to open our eyes. It is not just about dyslexia, but a lot more. I think the film shows people what they refuse to see, and while it entertains, it subconsciously makes them accept. I honestly feel, India really needed a film like this.The narrative, the way the story unfolds, is excellent. The pace is just right, it moves along with the boy, and takes you with it. It is a visual treat, with the attention to detail and slick editing in Jame Raho to Tarkovsky's Stalker like shots of the drain. Darsheel has given an excellent performance, and Aamir Khan has definitely done a great job of his directorial debut. Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy's music and Prasoon Joshi's lyrics fit the film, and the world of childhood, just perfectly. The film is sure to touch the lives of anybody and everybody who watches it. And I definitely recommend it to everyone, it is a must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taare Zameen Par: Rated "PRG" (Parents Required Guidance)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If all start living on their own terms, this world will be altogether a different place. Childhood is that juvenile period in life when the dreams have no boundaries and sky is the limit. It's only when the weight of someone else's dream comes on your shoulder; life turns full circle and you start as if there was no past. Resisting sticking with past raises questions to your capabilities as in this world there is only one way to get praised which is to perform the best in all the fields.This is not just a movie but this is a world from a child's view. Here 3*9 can be 3 and yes it's logical since Pluto (The 9th planet) has no more existence. Ishaan is an eight year old boy who is little different from others. Lost in his own world, always short of words but yet understands every single aspect of life. Problem with him is to express himself loudly, no one understands the way he behaves since he himself is puzzled the way things are going around him. Unclear in expressing himself, he presses his parents and teachers to start thinking that he is not one of the normal child but someone who requires special attention. This forces his demanding father to sent him to a boarding school, an eight year old boy who always lived his life in shadow of his mother couldn't adjust to this abrupt distance from her and goes into mental trauma which makes him a speechless kid, Berated by the teachers and friends around, this new world takes every color from his life until his new art teacher Ram comes in and helps him to get outside the nutshell to prove that Ishaan is no less than a brilliant artist in making.It's a lesson for all those parents who expect their child to win all the races; one has to accept that you can't have no# 1 in every house, someone has to be in lower down the order. Actual problem starts when parents start pushing their child to fulfill their own dreams which they saw but couldn't convert into realities. It's not always about being in the race and finishing first, sometimes finishing it gracefully also matters. In a way, everyone can relate to it, especially if you have grown up in India where most children are classified as dumb or unintelligent if they "can't" become engineers or doctors. Movie is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile, laugh, cry, nod in agreement and seethe with anger; everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think; to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more. This is outstanding heart-warming stuff, hats off to Aamir for once again taking on an off- beat topic and bringing it to life in his directorial debut. This movie surely belongs to children and their childhood.I myself have worked with kids who require help like Ishaan and I know it very well how do they feel when the world is too demanding and there is less power in you to fulfill them. I am happy that I saw this movie well in advance, now surely I am going to do justice to the new age coming. I rated this movie as PRG and surely it's a must watch for each parent and future parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully made, and full of inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows Aamir Khan the actor - now they have seen Aamir Khan the director - a sensitive and artistic director with a fine eye for detail. A maker of true quality cinema; a director who extracts the best from every actor, every department, every person contributing to his movie.Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary), is a young boy of eight who admires and adores the simple things in life, such as Nature, colours, animals and toys. The 'real' world - as his parents tell him - which consists of grades, neatness, and homework, is just too tiring and boring for Ishaan to deal with and he spends his time daydreaming and having fun. Unlike his older brother Yohaan, who has earned an admirable reputation for his top marks and studious attitude, Ishaan cannot seem to focus, however hard he tries, and reading and writing are torture on his mind. Ishaan starts a reputation of his own, one of mischief and bad behaviour, and is ultimately packed off to boarding school, to be "disciplined". Torn away from his family, and isolated in a world of bright, prim-proper children, Ishaan is lost in a new world, of misery and and tears. His impressive talent for painting and drawing is barely recognized - he cannot fit in academically and this is causing him to succumb to stress and fear, not to mention killing his self esteem completely. One day a new art teacher joins his school, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan), who encourages the children to think bright an bold; fill their minds with imagination; dance, sing, express themselves. As the other kids grow to love Nikumbh, Ishaan barely acknowledges his new teacher, and remains in his daze of homesickness and gloom. Nikumbh sees past Ishaan, and views the pain in his eyes, and using his kind, patient nature, he discovers that Ishaan suffers from Dyslexia - a learning disorder which is the cause of his low marks. Nikumbh holds out a helping hand to Ishaan, and becomes the one person to look past the grades and see the boy inside, resulting in a close and caring friendship, and exulting Ishaan into the clouds once more - but this time to find his foothold.Taare Zameen Par is Aamir Khan's directorial debut, as well as his debut as a producer. One very impressive thing about his direction is the pace of the movie, which progresses naturally until the very end. The cinematography and production design were superb, as was the music. The added animation, which surprised me, was better than anything I expected for a Bollywood movie; much crisper and sharper, transporting the viewer to the world of Ishaan's dreams. The A-Grade script by Amol Gupte also contributes greatly, and I did not find the ending to be "cheesy" or too dramatic in the slightest.The fine performance by Darsheel Safary stands out, and the little one is sure to be remembered for his fantastic portrayal of Ishaan Awasthi. Though I found he didn't speak much throughout the movie, he brought a life to his role and endeared himself to the audience. His performance brought a lump to my throat on more than one occasion, and reminded me of certain parts of my childhood. Whenever anyone says 'CHILD STAR', I will think of him. Aamir surprised me once more by letting the little one carry the movie forward, and only appearing just about halfway. Even then, Aamir did not steal the film, though he did give a powerful performance, and the spotlight was kept on Darsheel. The two actors playing Ishaan's parents, Tisca Chopra and Vipin Sharma, were adequate, though I was more impressed with Chopra than her male counterpart. The chemistry between the cast seemed good, though I thought Darsheel and Aamir's on screen connection could have seemed stronger.The soundtrack amazed me. My favourite song, had to be 'Maa'. The amount tears I shed during that one song is hard to explain. The beautiful lyrics added to the charm of the song, and even hearing it now makes me want to cry my heart out. 'Bum Bum Bole' is a lighthearted and catchy track picturised on Aamir, and 'Jame Raho' is an addictive number which was used and picturised very well. 'Kholo Kholo' is a soulful song with again, gorgeous lyrics, leaving 'Bheja Kum', an interesting track, used to show Ishaan's trouble at Boarding School. The title track was also lovely.I really regret not having seen this when it released. After viewing it, I strongly believe this is the best movie that came out in 2007, every film seems weak before Taare Zameen Par, it overshadows almost every movie by far.A great and inspiring experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Congrats Aamir Khan!!!! Kudos!! A very very touching movie..!! Not a typical commercial movie, not an Aamir-Khan movie either... you will not even remember to note how smart Aamir is looking; the story will take you away.Strangely, the story line is not very unpredictable. I mean, we all know what is going to happen to the kid. But, somehow so much reality and feeling has been poured into the story line, you will not even blink.Ishaan is a 8 year old kid, who is a complete day-dreamer and study-phobic, literally. His attitude towards reality and conventional study becomes torture to his parents as regular complaints are received from teachers, neighbors. Ishaan's strict father sends him to hostel overnight. Ishaan is suddenly burdened with all the discipline and conventional ways. When he cannot cope up with that, he is continuously discouraged by everybody, which breaks his confidence. In addition, he isolates himself from his family, as they left him in this insensitive world of disciplined humans, who do not care about his problem and only want proper standard textbook behavior, by cane or pain.At this point a sensitive and understanding temporary teacher joins the school, which changes peoples lives and way of thinking. Sorry, don't want to give away any more than this.Aamir Khan did a splendid job, both in acting and directing. Tisca Chopra looked and acted exactly like a vulnerable mother of a young confused child. Other actors in the movie were properly chosen and none of them did leave a chance to criticize. However, the best Part is Darsheel Safary. This little kid is so realistic and so convincing, that you CANNOT control your tears. God....!!! Where did he learn that much acting!! He is the hero of the movie and the backbone too.Anybody having even a nut-sized heart will love this movie. After all, we were kids too!!!</fullReview>

I don't think there is a single bollywood actor that could make me relate to them as this boy did. His pain, torment, confusing, hesitation.. every emotional he feels you feel it too.Amir Khan has out done himself. Not only is he a phenomenal actor but now he is a master as a director.Yes all is well at the end of the movie and this by no means is how it is realistically but when you are watching a movie you have to keep one thing in mind IT IS A MOVIE it is OK if the director/story-writer wants you to leave the cinema with a good feeling it is not necessary to put reality into everything.Final words... you don't have to watch this in a cinema in fact i think you should buy/rent it on DVD and watch it with the family.. and a word for the wise HAVE LOTS OF TISSUES HANDY because this film guarantees water works :D 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, some films are bad, some are good. Some films are great, some are superb. But there are a handful of films that come once in a while to create a new landmark in the history of Cinema. They are above of those mere 'good' 'great' adjectives and the only way to describe them is by telling the person "Go and see for yourself!" Taare Zameen Par is among those rare &amp; remarkable films that may change your life once you see it.So I'm not going to spend anymore words describing how brilliant the movie is and how you may end up crying not in sadness but in joy instead, the only thing I can say is watching Taare Zameen Par is mandatory regardless of whoever you are and whatever you do.

		<fullReview>People were clapping, girls were crying with tears rolling down their cheeks, boys were spell bound and every child, every person in the hall seemed to be taken aback by the brilliance of this movie. This is a class act, a marvelous concept and direction to perfection makes this flick different from others, which is always the quality of an 'A' movie. It is the movie of a lifetime; sincerely I would say this is one of the best Hindi movies I have ever seen. It is not a roller coaster of emotions or just another emotional drama; this is the story of a child who was just left alone with his misery. Aamir comes to his help and becomes his only hope. Aamir is not the hero he comes in the second half, actually Darsheel Safari can be described in one word as "Outstanding".This is a serious Oscar attempt. I am happy that this time if we nominate this, we have a movie which we will not be shy of sending for Oscars. Aamir once again proves that film making is not everyone's job. One class act, one nice movie is all I want from a year; I don't want a pile of crap. As it finished, people were not ready to go, they were still there, sitting and watching those credits rolling.If you miss this, I have no words to tell you what you will miss. GO FOR IT.</fullReview>

The movie talks about a boy that has dyslexia and is miss interpreted by everything he cares about. It is touching at the same time it is critic. The entire history is permeated with subtle irony and heavy criticism about the contemporary way of doing things and solving problems. Talks about the objectification of persons in order the achieve our own personal goals... well, there is so much to this movie that I believe I just got lost here.

		<shortDescription>Aamir Khan delivers yet a satisfying film, which exceeds every expectation you will have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par, which spells "Stars on Earth" in English is probably one of the most anticipated films of the year 2007 by Bollywood. It came out in December last year, and it got received with a blast, and director Aamir Khan was extremely happy with the final outcome. One of the factors which distinguishes TZP from other Indian movies, is that it is not based on the regular clich of two individuals falling in love, but rather puts a real subject in the limelight. The story follows the nine-year-old protagonist called "Ishaan"(Darsheel Safary). Ishaan is a brisky young boy, with a wild imagination. He loves to admire nature, and enjoys painting with bright freshening colors. The one thing he hates the most is to sit down and do his homework. He never manages to write a word correctly and letters seem to dance in front of his eyes, whenever he attempts to read a sentence. This rare condition sets a barrier between Ishaan and education, and leads to frustration. Ishaan eventually tries to ignore his homework and school because of countless episodes of outbursts from teachers and his parents. His exam papers are a pity for the human eye and Ishaan's teachers say that there is no hope for him. Ishaan's father takes this personally and decides to send Ishaan to a boarding school.Ishaan disagrees with his father of course, as he is not accustomed to living without his mother. Ishaan's mother falls in a dilemma, but ultimately decides that sending Ishaan to boarding school would be the wisest choice.Things get even worse when Ishaan gets into boarding school. It is a strict school with discipline as their main principle. Ishaan is welcomed by strict teachers in every class, and receiving punishment from every teacher soon becomes a part of his daily routine. Ishaan eventually stops talking to anyone and usually meets everyone with a scared eye.One day, a substitute teacher replaces Ishaan's regular arts teacher. Ram Shankar Nikumbh(Aamir Khan) is his name, and he makes a grand entrance with a song. He is well received among Ishaan's fellow students, but Ishaan is still upset with a sore face. Ram instructs his students to paint anything which comes to their mind using vivid colors. Every child paints whatever comes to their mind, with the exception of Ishaan, who usually loves to paint. Ram is a little worried for Ishaan, but he does not torture him with questions and lets him go. However, Ram's concern over Ishaan's behavior is intensified after several days of his reticence.Ram tries further investigation and analyzes Ishaan's textbooks in all of his subjects. He discovers something unusual. It seems to him that Ishaan always misspells certain words and letters in a particular way. He has trouble identifying himself with different letters and their sound. Ram is stunned by seeing Ishaan's textbooks, and wants to investigate even further, and decides to visit Ishaan's family.When Ram tries to explain that Ishaan has difficulties identifying himself with letters and words he is met with rude comments from Ishaan's father. Ishaan's father has always assumed that Ishaan was avoiding doing homework because of his laziness. After a dialog between Ram and Ishaan's father, Ram tries to convince him that Ishaan really has a disability. After his investigation, he concludes the problem as dyslexia. Of course, Ishaan's parent are not aware of this learning disability and are scared for their sons future. Ram responds to this comment by saying that nowadays all parents care about is how to make their sons and daughters toppers of their classes. How they can make them excel in every subject, even though they have to work day and night. Every child is special, and should be allowed to pursue their dreams.When Ram begins his arts class back at school he begins by telling a story. A story about a boy, a boy who had difficulties during childhood. Letters and numbers seem to dance before his eyes and he never remembered that "y" comes after "x". After countless attempts he failed once at school and got dishearted. He decided to take the defeat as a man and continued working. After a time his mind brightened and his mind discovered a treasure. After telling the story, Ram asks his class which boy he is talking about. Ishaan's heart starts to beat much faster, as he is doubts that it is him, Ram is talking about. Ram shows a picture of Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein also had dyslexia, but he managed to overcome it and is considered one of the biggest scientists of human history. These encouraging words brightens Ishaan and he becomes really good friends with Ram. Ram goes to the principle of the school to discuss Ishaan's dyslexia. The principle is shocked at first, and then assembles the puzzles and sees the picture. He appreciates Ram's work with Ishaan and suggests to send Ishaan to a special school for children with disabilities. Ram disagrees to his suggestion and requests him to tell all the teachers to ignore his mistakes for a few weeks. In that period of time, Ram can work with Ishaan and improve his skills.I think I have revealed more than necessary, but I will leave it here and let you watch the movie for yourself.TZP is a film which combines emotions with real life situations and the outcome is mind- blowing. It delivers a great message and has opened eyes of millions of parents around the world. This film exceeded all of my high expectations and I came out satisfied after watching it. Darsheel Safary has done a great job as a child artist and his performance has earned him a handful of Indian awards. I really hope to see more of him. Aamir Khan is great as always as an actor, but has also done a excellent job as a director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie is about to release, i saw the promos and thought the movie will be good for serious cine-goers who believe in quality cinema. But it proved me wrong when i saw the movie. Though Aamir Khan directed the movie, the script and dialogues belong to Amol Gupte. I would like to thank both Amol and Aamir, first the former for getting involved with the script so much and enlightening us and kudos to Aamir for bringing out stellar performances from almost all the artists. Most of them lived their character rather than acting in it.Everybody knows Aamir always tries to bring best music in his movies which he act. So its no surprise that the music is great in the movie. Thanks to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and prasoon joshi for those amazing lyrics.P.S: I donno Hindi, i watched the movie first in theatre without subtitles . This movie proved the saying "language is no barrier for good cinema". Later i watched so many times with subtitles. I love the lyrics of the songs.But how many ever times i watch my eyes fill with tears at the climax scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another one from the Aamir Khan stable with him in his elements. Amir Khan has been, from the launch of his first movie, a little ahead of contemporary Hindi cinema. He has proved one more time that he is maturing in the art of movie making/acting. Simply said that's his way of sharing his evolving experience. Much in contrast to actors who tend to stagnate. It's about a special child "Ishaan Awasthi", who seems to see life from a different perspective, not because he wants to, but thats the way God perhaps created him. His ambitious father however sees him, as they say in the movie, as another horse that he needs to breed for the "race called life &amp; career". An illustration of middle-class India in its battle for survival of the fittest. The father overlooks the probability that his 8-year old is perhaps not meant for the regular races, and pushes him further into isolation by packing him off to a boarding school. While the kid battles the indifference and taunts thrown at him, Amir Khan, his art teacher, lets him free his imagination and creativity and bring forth the special quality Ishaan has and not the other so-called regular kids.Ishaan wins an art competition, gets on the cover of his school's year book and begins to be coveted by all. That's quickly said, but watching the movie is bit of a dramatic experience especially if you are watching with women around. Man!! they cry a lot!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Aamir Khan movie since Lagaan!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me commence by saying that I rarely see Hindi movies for one main reason. And that is a majority of them are mainly 'love stories'. Love story between a boy and a girl (and vice versa). No matter how many twists and turns there may be, the essence of the film revolves around the boy and girl end up being together and loving each other and 'living happily ever after'.But this movie is not the case and if you are into seeing Amir Khan love story films than you will be bitterly disappointed. Let me warn you right now that this movie will not be for you. This movie is for the Amir Khan fans who admire him for his versatile film types and also for movie critics who has to rate movies for the sake of rating them. By far this is the best film I have seen starring Amir Khan. For the record, I am not an Amir Khan fan.It a movie that displays three human characteristics that is so prominent in our human society. They are: i) Not everyone is born equal with the same intelligence, cognitive and learning level; ii) How much of an a**hole and blind parents can be when they selfishly and eagerly want their children to achieve something that they (they as in the children) may not want to achieve because it is not in their heart; and iii) A child's imagination, wonders and thoughts is something that was in all of us when we were little but is lost as we are exposed to the corrupt elements of the world.The character build up within the film was great. The main attraction of the film was Ishaan Awasthi played by Darsheel Safary. The film was well crafter and progressed at a pace that really made you realize what the world is and can be like from a child's point of view who has trouble reading, writing and understanding things of general. Darsheel Safary was brilliant as the leading character. The expression on his face said it all when he was being put down by his parents, neighbourhood kids and teachers. His performance really makes your mind and eyes open to issues that intellectually disabled kids face on a daily basis. It gave a view of the dangers people with disability/ies may face if they are not properly looked after to build up a base for them.As mentioned above, not everyone is born equal. But given the chance, opportunity and support by people, then the person with disability can head towards the right direction and be successful in life in his/her own way and rights. And this is the most important element that this movie was able to show.The key to success is not by how much money or materialistic things that you may have, but rather what you have achieved how you have achieved it. And this is something else the film displays. Ishan not only achieved the basic understanding of school literacy within his year level but achieved even greater success with something that came naturally to him. And that is his passion for art. His teacher played by Amir Kahn achieved success by bringing out this talent in his student and showing to his colleagues and Ishan's peers the great potential that he has inside of him.On a personal note, its funny how as parents, most of them don't see the potential talents that their children have inside of them. To them if their children are not doctors, lawyers or engineers then they are nothing. That is dead wrong!! If you think about it, most of the successful people in the world were not straight A students at school but rather they struggled during their school years. Rupert Murdoch, John Major (former British Prime Minister), Sylvester Stallone and Richard Branson are just to name a few.For those of you who are struggling or have struggled in school with homework, watch this movie as it may be an inspiration to you to pursue with what is inside your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bollywood has always been deprived of such movies. Aamir Khan, a talented actor, ventures into directing a movie, a movie which is a bit different, and does it brilliantly. The movie starts with story of 8 year old, naughty kid, Ishan. Ishan has played a role of a boy who is very poor at studies. But his thought process is a bit different than others and his mind, very creative!! His parents are really worried about his future. Due to regular complaints about him from School, building etc his dad decides to send him to a boarding school. And this is where the movie takes a real turn. The story then takes us to the problems faced by the boy, his mental stress and then very emotional relationship between him and his arts teacher (Aamir). The flow of movie is just awesome. It is full of emotions. Though the movie is about a kid, it is meant to be watched by parents along with their children. I think this movie certainly deserves a spot in IMDb top 250. Also after so many years, a Bollywood movie has given hope for an Oscar.</fullReview>

The child artist has done great justice to the role.

		<fullReview>If Bheja Fry asked questions to Hindi contemporary cinema, Taare Zameen Par should answer it. A movie is not worth watching unless it has a purpose. This purpose is encapsulated in a message, and delivered. Its simple.The purpose is to spread awareness about the pressure normal child carries at an age he should be experiencing completely the opposite, to highlight child labour, to what extent parents' expect a child to deliver and most importantly because of competition (population?) there is no place for failure, &amp; the best way to avoid failure is to study.The message is encapsulated in the story of Ishant Awasthi(Darsheel Safary), who expresses solace in randomness, trusts his capacity to pluck symphony from noise. But every system has to be imperfect, and his unparalleled advantages arise from a congenital condition of mind. His hobbies are unentertained, his sufferings are treated excuses and he is about to be labeled incompetent by the world. His teacher (Aamir Khan), could be his only saviour.The delivery occurs through unique cinematography, expressions over whelming our hearts and Darsheel Safary.As it should be, the director(Aamir Khan) wants us to only ponder. After experiencing his effort, its not a choice most of us will have..</fullReview>

Something like that..But even then, Aamir has managed to pull a rabbit out of the hat again. He made me cry my eyes out!The disorder here is dyslexia... the pointed comment on today's parents goading on their children relentlessly to be toppers. The lesson... each child is different.He got a new kid who holds the movie on his own till the interval, after which Aamir joins into the act. The movie begins with a frisky lil kid who lives in his own world.. how he can't read.. doesn't fit in with the rest... soon how he recedes into a shell. Finally how the new art teacher finds him again and brings him out. The music fits well into the movie and switches with the mood in the film. You feel for the kid, his mother, his family,Aamir may be accused of perfectionism and hijacking directors... but then he has proved he is too damn good at it. So shut up and watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Delight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aamir Khan's debut directorial performance is an astounding feat. Its product is one of the best films of 2007. And I'm not just talking about Bollywood. Taare Zameen Par is a different type of film that does not conform to the typical norms of the masala industry. It is a breath of fresh air that does just enough on the predictable side to reel in typical Hindi film audiences. However, at no point does Taare Zameen Par conform to the standards of melodrama or impossibility and fantasy. The characters are of a different mold. The actors and actresses that portray the roles are even more different. There are no big-budget stars in this movie besides Aamir himself. The main character, Ishaan Awasthi, portrayed by Darsheel Safary is a young dyslexic boy who struggles to read and write. Hidden underneath his math and reading difficulties, lies a talent unnoticed by the "Jame Raho" lifestyle. Darsheel does a fantastic job as Ishaan who reminds us of our old childhood days and evokes tons of emotion from the audience. He is in fact the main character of the film with Aamir Khan appearing only after the intermission. The scenes and settings are colorful and vibrant. The crowded streets of Mumbai are beautifully shot while the New Era boarding school also possesses its own sense of foreboding upon Ishaan's entrance. The songs are also quite a treat. I can't say that I really minded any of the songs of the movie although a few seemed unnecessary. The lyrics in some of the songs are fantastic and the music throughout the film is coherent of the theme: light and simple yet bewilderingly and colorfully complex. The story itself is a great one. Aamir plays the unorthodox temporary art teacher who changes the life of Ishaan through his unconventional practices. We are reminded to appreciate our childhood and remember that every child is special. The film does at some points tend to get a little melodramatic and slightly predictable; however, these are the elements that adhere to the standards of the majority of Hindi films. Therefore, it isn't necessarily a bad thing but it isn't a good thing either. Moreover, Ishaan's volte-face from a confused, misunderstood child to an overachieving and talented painter is brushed over a little too quickly. In my opinion, the scenes when Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) works with Ishaan are some of the best of the film and I would have appreciated it if they would have made his learning experience even more believable. Nonetheless, those scenes still carry a powerful resonance like most of the film. Overall, the film is a delight. It isn't the conventional Hindi film nor does it stray too far from accepted norms. It's always good to see a different type of film especially one that is so emotionally resounding. It reminds us that we all have purpose and most importantly, that children are the most precious thing we can lose and our only measure of wealth. The film has certainly given me a new outlook on life as well as entertained me. What more could I ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Quality Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is one of the best movie produced by Hindi Cinema. And i wish this one gets nominated for Oscar and wins the same. Best part about this movie is that somewhere in your life, you have faced each and every character of this movie. You can relate yourself to a child who has gone through sweet and bitter time of school age. Or you can relate yourself to parents who is trying their best to keep their children to get prepared for competitive world. This movie can remind you of all strict, result oriented school teachers whose punishments you can never forget. Personally i liked two best scenes in the movie: 1. When aamir khan finds out about the troubled boy at his parents home and trying to convince them to help this child. 2. When Aamir tells the story of Solemon island where people curse the trees to let them die. i recommend each and every individual to watch this movie at least once in their lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When someone goes to watch an Aamir Khan movie, what does he\she expect?1. Brilliant performance\efforts 2. Tight story 3. Some relevant social message 4. and the USP ...something different that will blow your mind!! Here the USP is Aamir's direction and his total commitment to his script.This latest effort of Aamir is simply brilliant! Told in a very simplistic manner the film touches your heart and takes you through a roller-coaster of emotions. Even though the protagonist has dyslexia the story could have been of any child. The movie speaks about the pressure a child faces in today's competitive world and how he\she tries to match parents' expectations. But, never once does it get preachy.There are many brilliant moments in the movie and will not spoil them for you by highlighting any one specifically. Watch this movie to realize a reality which most are oblivious to. Watch this movie for it's brilliant story, performance and direction. Watch this movie if u r an Aamir fan.. Watch this movie if u r not an Aamir fan and I promise u will become one after watching...and watch this movie to encourage such movies to be made in India and let the world acknowledge our cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Taare Zammen Par" is not just a movie, its a emotional journey into the life of an ordinary Indian child. This truly depicts the life of an average Indian household, its very true that a lot of stress is being paid on being on the top, ranking first in studies. Parents don't want to admit that their child needs help just because they don't want others(family, friends, neighbors...) to say anything. They feel as if such thing reflects on themselves: "How can my son/daughter be so and so". They ignore the needs of the child to maintain their false ego in front of others. This movie takes the viewer into a life an average person can relate to, nothing fantasy. Its a must see for the parents who believe their child is infallible. A wonderful movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but a Wonderful Look at a Child's Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had just watched the film last night and after that, I was discussing it with a friend, a fellow IMDb member. For me 'Taare Zameen Par' was indeed an enjoyable film and I liked how the research was done on dyslexia as many Hindi films seem to lack that. Also technically it's quite well made. The use of animation is endearing and cinematography is brilliant. I love the songs too.As a director, Aamir Khan does a fine job. Amole Gupte deserves equal credit for giving the film a heart of gold. The screenplay isn't bad but I found the placement of the title song awkward. I mean it seemed to drag things a little. The sequences in the song may have been necessary but the song itself was a strange placement.Also the character development especially of the parents and the few plot holes could have been improved. For instance, how is it that a stay-at-home mom not know at all that her son has learning problems? How did he make it to third grade? The parents are shown to be from an educated family. The parents claim to have thought that the reading problems were a result of his lack of interest and perhaps, they were in denial too as they didn't want to accept that he cannot read because it would mean that he's 'mentally retarded' but none of this is explored and we just get the impression that they didn't know. The child's also shown to repeat the 3rd grade but his classmates look older than him. Even Aamir Khan's characterization seems a little flawed. The character might be that of a very sensitive person but the way he broke down at all the children was a little unbelievable especially since he's known as an experienced teacher in India who would be used to seeing such problems.While some may argue that the teachers are demons, I have gone to school in that part of the world and myself have encountered such 'demons'. Hence it's not completely unbelievable but I agree that not every single teacher should have been shown as demons. However, I find the sudden transformation of the teachers from 'demonhood' very unbelievable. Also, that Hindi literature teacher is mind-numbingly stupid. The kid gave a simple yet fantastic interpretation of the poem and he doesn't get that? What a moron! And this is supposed to be in a prestigious school? I also thought it was awkward bringing Abhishek Bachchan as an Indian example of a 'dyslexic super-achiever' especially since he's mentioned with names like Picasso, da Vinci, Christie and Einstein.Though some may argue that the competition sequence mislead the viewer regarding children with learning disabilities in one area can be supremely gifted in other areas, I think it was probably there to move the story further and give it a happy ending. Perhaps at the end, they could have also stressed on the fact that every child deserves love (no matter what) and attention and effort so that he can achieve his true potential. This point was brought up in the conversations between the teacher and the parents but if it was stressed at the end of the film, it would have made 'Taare Zameen Par' more impactive. Then again, the film is more Ishaan's story and with this competition he has to get back his confidence, that was previously shattered. What about this for an alternative ending? The kid loses the competition but his work is praised and everyone appreciates his effort, his parents still accept and love him and he's happy? 'Taare Zameen Par' belongs to child actor Darsheel Safari. His performance is very natural and he shines throughout the whole film. It's one of the best acting by a child actor. His bunny tooth smile is adorable. Aamir Khan is mostly decent although he does seem to go over the top in some scenes. The actor who plays the dad is awful and Tisca Chopra is okay. The teachers are caricatures.In spite of its flaws, 'Taare Zameen Par' might be a called manipulative but in my humble opinion it is a sincere film. I just loved how it portrays the mind and imagination of a child using animation and art (note the wonderful reference to Calvin and Hobbes) and also the natural behaviour we see in young Safary especially when he bunks class. Some other examples are how he tried his best to read but just can't be bothered anymore because he simply cannot do it, how he's fascinated by things others take for granted or simply ignore, how his confidence is broken when his parents leave him and teachers beat him, the look on his face when someone calls him 'duffer', his lack of interest in daily activities (e.g. playing with water when he's supposed to take a shower). All his scenes are worth watching and that alone makes 'Taare Zameen Par' a pleasant viewing.</fullReview>

Many parents wouldn't even believe such children exist. And I think movie doesn't touch those parents. I really believe Aamir experienced similar childhood, as he reflected that unbelievably comprehensively - I really see my son there. Really.That's a healing movie. I recommend it to all parents and especially to Teachers. It also reminds me Pink Floyd's - just another brick in the wall - thats what school wants to make of each child.Absolute masterpiece - 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of an Artist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Darsheel Safary, Amir Khan. Screenplay by: Amol Gupte. Directed by: Amir Khan.A drop of a red paint falls on a canvas. Then a finger comes and adds some yellow color to that drop. The drop shows some light turbulent mixing of smaller pigments of yellow and red, then that same finger starts mixing those colors. Then appears a creation of color on canvas as seen by Ishaan (Darsheel Safary), an 8-year old kid who just destroyed his graded exam solution of non-art subjects. Well, because he failed in those. There is something that drives Ishaan away from the books and exams to painting, to catching fishes in the gutter, to jigsaw puzzles, to almost anything that catches his eyes. He mentions his teacher that the letters in the book are dancing. That would make him dyslexic. But not dumb. Perhaps his vision is different than an average human being. When he has been send to a boarding school hundreds of miles away from his home then it appears as a child departing from his parents in his flip book. Can we help Ishaan? Perhaps professor Nikumbh has the answer. You have to watch Taare Zameen Par, to know what that answer is.Amol Gupte wrote the screenplay for this beautiful and powerful film. He also was a creative director and I guess that is the basic need of this film. The number one thing expected from any filmmaker is to create sympathy for his protagonist. May it be emotional, but definitely has to be psychological. Amol Gupte puts you right where you are able to observe through Ishaan's eyes at a kid sitting on his father's shoulder and slurping a shaved ice cone. So much indulgence that it makes you unaware of the cone in your 'own' hand that melts and falls. There are so many sequences like those and Amir Khan (also the dbutant Director) understands the conveyance need of those visuals as much as Amol Gupte and creates an impact. Slow motion gives us time to understand Ishaan's fast grasping. The connection of images, surreal, if I may, of the solar system to the math problem in Ishaan's exams is simply brilliant. How Ishaan thinks and imagines and applies it to his real world creates sympathy. Not to forget the confrontation by professor Nikhumb to Ishaan's parents is one of the scenes with convincing words. Perhaps convincing for any parent. There does exist get-beaten-first-followed-by-triumph-later-superhero psychology which works. Amol Gupte and Amir Khan both have done a great job.But how much ever you write or direct a movie, it is useless without the actors who make you feel what they are feeling in all the situations in the movie. Darsheel Safary as Ishaan falls short at nothing. He is an actor that has not been bound by anything. He excites at fishes in the gutter, he fights a bully twice his size, he feels guilty and apologizes to his father at first and gets angry with strained eyebrows later at revelation of father's lie. He cries with the sorrows that you will feel and laughs with joys that shake you. Sight of a dawn over mountains and a lake creates an image in his mind that later shows up on a canvas that screams his urge to see what people don't see and you will stand beside him all the way. He deserves all the accolades he stands nominated for.Amir Khan has chosen a unique tale of parent-kids relationship, that is sad, because that relationship has been ignored long enough to make a movie but at least now we have a movie. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy give music to songs written by Prasoon Joshi that add to the surreal environment of this child. This movie is a great attempt to look at every child because he/she is special beyond our comprehension.My Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Revelation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw the rushes of Taare Zameen Par on TV, I didn't give it much thought. I thought, OK, this looks like a small budget movie with no star cast, a bunch of kids, doesn't look like it has any songs and possibly an educational message (how frightening...as if we didn't have enough of that already!!!). In one word - 'BORING'. But when I was dragged along to the movie, I realized how wrong I was! Taare Zameen Par is a wonderfully made movie. For once, I can say that it really is 'different' (A term often grossly misused by the Bollywood film fraternity!). The fact that the film doesn't have a big star cast (with the exception of Aamir Khan of course) is a good thing because we get to see some seasoned performances by lesser known actors like Tisca Chopra &amp; Vipin Sharma. They make the character of a middle class couple coping with the day to day stresses of life look very real and believable. The child actor Darsheel Safary has done a brilliant job. There are some scenes in the movie that are truly touching. I must confess I didn't know anything about dyslexia before watching the movie but after watching it, I'm glad that I'm aware of this condition which I'm sure leaves parents of such children confused and very distressed.This educational and social message I didn't mind one bit! In today's world, when everyone wants to join the rat race, its refreshing to see a different perspective and take on life. It is an eye opener and in my opinion every parent should watch it. I'd like to say kudos to Aamir Khan for making such a good movie. Wish more movies like this were made. Go watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important film for Educators Everywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very important film dealing with dyslexia, a problem well-known but not often put front and centre. This film should be seen by educators everywhere, and by parents with children who have reading difficulties. It should be seen in theatres everywhere, not just in those specializing in Hindi movies. The story is about a young boy suffering desperately because he can neither read nor write, and is tormented in school by both students and teachers. We watch as the poor boy (who comes from a well-off family) deteriorates into practically a non-communicative state, and re-experience our own childhood sufferings. So a lot of the movie is excruciating for us too. There is progress and hope when a special teacher (Amir Khan) comes into the picture, but there is no magic fix, thank goodness. Amir Khan's passion is clear, and I say Bravo! to him for taking this neglected subject on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This child is SPECIAL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This directorial debut by the "perfectionist" Aamir Khan carries the tag-line "Every Child is Special". Ishaan Avasthi, an 8 year-old, is a dreamer and dreams best in class. He is repeating 3rd grade and under-performing by a lot. He has a superstar sibling who aces all his tests and badminton. Ishaan is ridiculed by his teachers and classmates, berated by his ambitious father and pushed along by his harried mother. One day he bunks school and is packed off to an expensive boarding school, but things are no better for him there. He has but one friend, and the teachers continue to be tartars and caricatures - until a colorful sensitive substitute art teacher, Mr. Nikumbh, arrives and sees that Ishaan is locked up in his inward looking universe. Nikumbh is dyslexic and immediately knows that Ishaan too is suffering from dyslexia. He champions Ishaan's cause most vociferously ? this includes telling the class that dyslexics can be geniuses ? like Einstein, DaVinci, Abhishek Bachchan (???). Ishaan builds a most DaVinci like transport vehicle model out of twigs and knick-knacks he collects, begins to learn letters from Mr. Nikumbh, and eventually to READ. Then there is an art competition in which we see how fun filled and normal the teachers and kids really are, we see Ishaan winning and becoming the hero of the school and his parents. The movie ends with Ishaan running back in slow motion towards Nikumbh!! To call this well-intentioned fare bland would be unkind, after all it deals with learning disabilities and the message that parents need to love their kids no matter what, and kids need love to develop a sense of self worth. The film delivers the message in a fairly decent way that is several notches above public service messages. What is most likable is the protagonist Ishaan, played very well by Darsheel Safary. His buck toothed smile is used most effectively (not unlike the use of Michelle's wide eyes and duck walk in Black). Aamir plays Nikumbh in a preachy way that ranges from weeping at the drop of a hat to thunderous speeches delivered to the parents. Tisca Chopra is good as the harried and browbeaten mother. The father and all the other people associated with the educational system are caricatured to the maximum - they do help generate a lot of sympathy for Ishaan, but also some for the teaching profession that has been uniformly vilified here. The message gets muddled by Ishaan's winning the art competition ? was it not that every child is special whether he has something special in him or not? Special schools are not spared either and branded as schools for retarded children. Again this is a less than desirable message about such schools that can focus expert teachers around kids that need them.The film does touch the child within all of us ? that same child who did most of his thinking while sitting on the potty, spent time day dreaming about being Spaceman Spiff, did not care much about studies, and was sometimes sent out of class ? for me it was with my desk and chair, for an entire day!! The music is excellent, and 'Maa' is heartrending. The art competition sequence is very well staged. But in the end one is less than satisfied with this story that has lots of black and white, but no shadows or nuances to many of the characters. We are not told much about Nikumbh (or any other character except the protagonist) and there is no enigma to him to make us care to know more. Overall this movie is a decent effort, well intentioned and exceptionally well shot in parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathbreaking !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, let me make it very clear that I am a fan of Aamir Khan's acting. I was waiting for Aamir Khan's latest movie as I have feel that there is always something extraordinary about his films. Rangeela, Sarfarosh, Ghulam, Lagaan, Rang De Basanti and even Mangal Pandey (which I thought had a strong performance from him) are all a testament to that belief. I was a little skeptical about this film as it appeared from the promos to be a very ordinary film.I was also wary of the film having an overdose of melodrama. So I was a little unsure entering into the cinema hall to watch the movie. The opening credits of the movie have an imaginative style. It was clear that something creative and beautiful was in store. I was proved right. The movie opens with an introduction to the main character Ishant Awasthi, staring wide eyed at fishes in a drain. The opening shot gives you an insight into the nature of the boy. It is revealed that Ishaan has already failed in Class III and is struggling to cope with his academics even in his 2nd year. The movie takes a very interesting and amusing ride through his adventures in school while giving a glimpses of his artistic capabilities and some hints of his problems. Ishaan's parents get fed up of his careless attitude to studies and send him to a boarding school. Move to a boarding school, away from the protective shell of his parents has a crushing effect on Ishaan and as a result he completely switches off and goes into a shell. His cheerful smile and fascination for arts completely vanishes. At this stage a new part time arts teacher - Ram Shankar Nikumbh enters the scene. He has captures the imagination of the students trough his innovative style of teaching and introduces the children to a completely new perspective, forcing them to think and imagine for themselves. Ram notices that Ishaan is not responding to any of his attempts at attracting interaction. He is curious about Ishaan and investigates about him and his performance in School. Ram discovers his problems and goes about bringing Ishaan out of his troubles and face life again. The 2nd half of the movie is awe-inspiring as the events unfold and some startling revelations are made. The scene where the teacher confronts Ishaan's parents to explain them about Ishaan's problem is very delicately done and brings out some very strong elements of Aamir's acting. The movie finally ends with a truly breathtaking finale, which serves to reinforce your faith in miracles. The pace of the movie is gentle and moves beautifully without slipping into melodrama. There are a million breathtaking moments in the film. The intense scenes are handled with subtlety. Aamir Khan as the teacher gives in an endearing performance without trying to outdo or overshadow anyone else. He comfortably stays in the background without stealing any scenes and at the same time coming to the fore when needed. The star of the movie is undoubtedly Darsheel Safary as Ishaan Awasthi who displays a wide range of emotions through his expressive eyes. He looks very believable and steals your heart within the first few minutes of the movie. To conclude, the movie is a winner mainly on 4 counts - a very strong and well written script by Amol Gupte, sensitive and simplistic storytelling at just the right pace, intense and brilliant performances by the cast of the movie, a lively and catchy music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Aamir Khan, the Director has truly arrived and I am pretty sure the movie is gonna bag a few awards. The movie is worth watching once and many times over. I can't wait for the DVDs to come out so I can lay my hands over one.</fullReview>

He takes his movies so seriously (rang DE basanti). TZP is what I call great cinema,so much effort has gone in to this movie the music is superb and the acting is great. I just hope it gets in to the Oscar so everyone can appreciate how good this movie is. The message is portrayed so well by all the actors especially the little boy and his ''loving'' parents.It is easily on my list up with the great movies like Juno, stranger than fiction, matrix, spirited away i can't wait for Amir khan's next project. so please do watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so i may be a little biased as this movie is still fresh on my mind from last night. But when i look back on all the movies that I have seen, world cinema or mainstream bollywood, the one thing I can tell you for sure is that I have never cried so much throughout a movie! This movie makes you feel. I am not a mother, yet I could feel the separation during Ishaan's first day in hostel. I am not dyslexic and yet I could feel the humiliation and helplessness that Ishaan must've felt when mocked by the others...The movie has tackled the issue of dyslexia brilliantly. Subtly highlighting the obstacles a parent faces when accepting a dyslexic child and most importantly what a child goes through when he just cannot fit in... every scene is cinematic brilliance. The dream sequences, the paintings, the imagination... wonderfully done.Technically I am not even gonna comment. All I can say is that it is a Masterpiece. Every scene is going to take your breath away. I mean it.Go ahead and treat yourself to this piece of cinematic brilliance. And I am not saying it 'cos of the films superstar director, but really, TZP just goes to show what good cinema with a strong message can achieve.PS: The critic in me couldn't believe that I'd give any movie a 10. But really, as I write this I cant help admitting that this is one movie which I cannot rate. Any kind of rating will just belittle it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Parents has to See this movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows how to understand our children's feelings and it is like a lesson as I said first parents has to watch this movie, Children have different view for this life and sometimes this view is not as same as for ours, movie show us how they have huge imagination, small things are not important for us but it might be very important for them. Ishaan actually try to tell something to his parents at the beginning but communication type was not usual and parent did not accept professional help, Ishaan is really very important example for parents who not understand children's behaviors. Aamir Khan is always try to show small points in life with his works which is we start to forget in this days. Musics are like always wonderful, acting is very good, and I have to say boys in school did very good job. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome, Funny, but Inspiring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Stars On earth is a very inspiring movie. It is about Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is an eight-year-old boy who dislikes school and fails every test or exam. He finds all subjects difficult, and is belittled by his teachers and classmates. But Ishaan's internal world is rich with wonders that he is unable to convey to others, magical lands filled with colour and animated animals. He is an artist whose talent is unrecognised.Ishaan's father, Nandkishore Awasthi (Vipin Sharma), is a successful executive who expects his children to excel. His mother, housewife Maya Awasthi (Tisca Chopra), is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan (Sachet Engineer), is an exemplary scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of.After receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's parents send him to a boarding school. There he sinks into a state of fear and depression, despite being befriended by Rajan (Tanay Chheda), physically disabled and one of the top students in his class. Ishaan's situation changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan), joins the school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia. On his day off, Nikumbh visits Ishaan's parents and asks if he can see more of their son's work. He is stunned by the sophistication of one of Ishaan's paintings, and tells his parents that Ishaan is a bright child who processes information differently from other children in his class, but Ishaan's father is suspicious that the explanation is simply an excuse for his son's poor performance. Nikumbh demands that he read some Japanese text on a box and berates him when he cannot, giving him a glimpse into Ishaan's experience of school. Nikumbh describes dyslexia to them and explains that it is not a sign of low intelligence. He tells them he can provide extra tutoring that will help Ishaan, highlighting the boy's artistic ability evident in his many paintings and other creative works.Nikumbh subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in class, and offers a list of famous people who were dyslexic. As the students are leaving the classroom, Nikumbh asks Ishaan to remain behind and reveals to him that he too experienced the same difficulties with dyslexia. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.Towards the end of the school year Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan is getting into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh. The film ends with a freeze frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know cinema is the one of the most popular arts on today. There are movies look like real arts like "Tarkovski" movies, always in a message and philosophy is in there. Those movies are like a guide to us to thinking,questioning and answering, .But many of Hint movies give us it's messages clearly however that doesn't mean they're bad or missing movies or arts. There's a beautiful example. "Taare Zameen Par" is a "good times" movie you can finish it with a smile on your face and tears on your eyes. You can reach so many people with a movie like that. I think you can steel the hearts of many picturegoer. I liked Aamir Khan as a director, i can say if i direct a movie, probably i can apply many of scene as Aamir Khan. He's talent, respectful and likable actor. He's the reason of why i love Bolywood films. I think every person should watch this movie. It's a fantastic,hilarious and one of the best this "good times" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ishaan Awasthi is an 8 year old boy struggling in his second time as a 3rd grade student. He is unfocused easily distracted. He is frustrated and horrible in the classroom. He gets into a fight with a school bully. His father is angry at his perceived laziness. His mother is concerned. When the parents meet the school teachers, it's obvious that Ishaan will never pass 3rd grade. The parents send him away to a strict boarding school. His spirit is broken down until substitute teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh arrives. Ram soon figures out that the boy has dyslexia.The boy lead is amazing. I completely buy his acting. He is adorable and believable. His relationship with his mother is heart breaking. The movie up to the point with Ram is absolutely riveting. I do have a couple of minor problems with Ram. Being an Indian movie, he does too much song and dance for me. I also don't like Ram's attitude towards the parents. He should dial down the self-righteous anger and dial up the sympathy. What I do like is the great realistic performance of the boy. He could help melt the most hardened heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This touches on me! The movie is about Ishaan, a little lonely boy, who no one understood..., actually till he met an art teacher, Aamir Khan...He, Ishaan, is a good example of that life is not a discipline that we have been learned and not fixed in a standardized framework! This is an example of freedom of thoughts. I cried much during the movie... It is fulled with mercy, tenderness, love, humanity and success. It also encourages people who have different abilities than other people. Famous people who were mentioned in the movie made me search about the problem of Ishaan. I learned much about this, and concluded "differences are what we need". I wish that all teachers are like Aamir Khan in this movie which would save the world! I think that the movie lets people see life from another window! Thank you all for making this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film refers to a little child who has learning disorder. His family and teachers do not understand him. The child constantly misbehaves, do not study their lessons. He is a bad-tempered child. His parents scold him due to his behaviors and they compare him with his older brother. Finally, his parents send him to a boarding school. The child's parents do not try to understand him, instead, they punish him. This situation causes to lose his self-confidence. The child does not believe that he is able to succeed. Thanks to his art teacher, he realizes that he is so much successful. And, he wins the contest of painting. Finally, his special talent is discovered. The film tells us every child has a special talent. Generally, parents criticize their children, they do not try to discover their different talents. We infer that we should not evaluate children as unnecessary person. We should not forget that every child have a talent which is big or small. This drama film affects people about this matter. Maybe, it can be a warning for people who behave in this manner.I am sure, while you are watching it, you will evaluate yourself in this matter. If you watch it, you may realize to behave so. Thanks to this film, you can pay attention not to behave so.I think, a film which needs to be watched, especially for parents.</fullReview>

It has a message to deliver to every teacher, mother and father. "Every Child Has A Talent" This is the message. I loved the movie, it affected me and made me cry. I recommend this movie for all of you. Actually I have to say that Bollywood had a very good progress in the last 10 years I will watch all Aamir Khan movies. I'm fond of this man. And for the child he was a very good actor. He managed to act the dyslexia patient very professionally. He will be a very good actor in the future.

		<fullReview>From the very beginning I've been an Aamir Khan fan. His acting skills are beyond comparison. And now his he has also established himself as a fine director. Taare Zameen Par is not only an emotional and heart-warming movie, but also is very sensible, unlike most bollywood mind-bogglers. The real show stealer, however, was Darsheel Safary. I gotta admit, Aamir Khan was indeed lucky to get a fine kid like him. He's the one who holds the movie together. He put spirit in Ishaan's character. The plot is very unique as compared to most bollywood films. However, in actuality, dyslexia is very common among children, and this movie has been instrumental in spreading awareness about dyslexia and various other disabilities. Everything in this movie has been put together so well. The reactions schools, teachers and parents have towards children who are *unconventional* or more commonly described as *different* has been portrayed with exceptional skill. Bottomline: Masterpiece of a film, wonderful acting, great music. Definitely a must watch for kids and especially parents and teachers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Match Ki Pahli Ball Or Ye Laga Sixer. Amir Phir Champion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An 8 years old child is having a hard time in his school and home as he can hardly cope up with studies . Even worse he has a meritorious elder brother and a demanding father. A temporary painting teacher 'Nikumb' comprehends the situation and help the boy recover his lost self-confidence.TZP is definitely one of the finest films ever came from Indian film Industry. Film has a perfect social and political timing too as India sees kids committing suicide because of exam pressure. Unfortunately I myself have attended one such funeral where a 9th class student committed suicide and his mom on his death bed kept calling Shiva for restoration of his life. "Agar Tu Bhagwan Hai To Lauta De, Maine Janam Diya Tu Kaun Hota Hai Lene Wala". Hope this incident is never repeated in a close minded society like ours. Its an intelligent pondering over an extremely sensitive issue. Hope teachers and parents also take a positive lead from this film. If a single child is saved from committing suicide because of this film I would call it the best film ever made. There is a possibility of that.Acting wise everything is perfect. Amir's first few scenes are mind blowing specially where Ishaan isn't painting and Amir says "Koi Baat Nahin Koi Jaldi Nahin Hai". He sets the mood there it self. Thats how you deal with kids. In the making of TZP also Amir says "Bachchon KO Maza Ana Chahiye". Music of the film is mediocre except for the title song. I found lyrics of the songs very irritating. Being casual is one thing and being out of meter is another. Prasoon is fresh air but without a genuine meter I hope he doesn't blow out fast. While Ishaan's moon walk scene left me rolling on the floor, title song have me shed a few tears. May be there are a few things which aren't right like animated situations, animated characters, over enthusiastic climax but I take it as a drama par excellence. To me it wasn't a film. It was a classroom lesson which will help me become a better person and so my teacher took examples of extremities so that the message doesn't get lost somewhere in trying to make a 'hatke' film or too modest or honest to digest. TZP has left me thinking if we are doing enough for children. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Honest Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the director knows from the beginning what the start, plot and the end is, has a brilliantly simple, straight forward, yet so rare, so close to life and touching story at hand, who can make a mistake. I would credit the story writer, Amol Gupte, much more than the fabulous director Aamir Khan for the amazing output they have produced. I am sure Aamir, the true sport he is, will never ever mind anyone praising Amol more than him. The honesty of the story shows in each and every shot. It is clearly evident that the writer / director have thought about every take millions n millions of times before calling it final.Already equipped with a very good screenplay, when you have a kid who is so expressive, Darsheel rocks ! The director Aamit realizes so well that it is a movie about the child and not a movie to show his 6 packs ! ,hence he limits his screen time to what is needed. Never does he get carried away by the emotions flowing and create ham scenes out of any of the situations. The supporting cast also compliments the main story-line very well. You feel close to the movie because it is a story you can always imagine happening around you. The subtle undertone in the acting rather than the melodrama is what made the whole difference.Prasoon Joshi &amp; Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy need a special mention for so so beautiful songs. I am not against Gulzar writing complex lyrics, which many can't even comprehend, but when a lyricist creates the same magic with relatively commonly used easy words which we talk in our daily lives, it not only leaves a bigger impact, but makes me wonder, are those heavy words needed ???All-in-all it is a movie everyone should watch. We treat our kids as race horses we breed to race against other similar horses in the race of life, and spoil their childhood. Every child deserves a beautiful and fun-filled childhood. This is what i got from the movie, and will always be with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Taare Zameen Par is an experience in itself. All throughout watching it i was wondering why has Aamir Khan not directed a movie till date because he seems so accomplished at the job that you wonder that this movie is directed by a first timer. The way he portrays the character of Ishaan Awasthi is just brilliant and showing the kid a dreamer has been brilliantly put forth. More laudable and commendable is his effort because he tackles a subject which has never before been attempted in world cinema let alone Indian cinema. Dyslexia is a more serious disorder than we often think of it as and i being a doctor is more happy that Aamir made this film. Not only has he took up a socially relevant issue, he has made an entertaining film nevertheless. There is never a dull moment and I guarantee there wouldn't be a single dry eye left in the theater in the climax. All kudos to Darsheel Safary for bringing out Ishaan such beautifully and in an utterly believable way. You wonder if the kid is only 8 years old. Aamir Khan also deserves the special mention for restraining the actor in him and portraying a supporting role albeit full gusto. The only problem I had with the film was that he showed the problem alright but the solution was just rushed over and I would have been happier if treatment of Dyslexia was more stressed upon, but you cant ask for everything in a film, so thats just a minor blemish on this superbly crafted and enacted film..Waiting for Aamir's directorial next with bated breath!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a critic I find it extremely difficult to write about movies which touch me, cause it is impossible to be detached. You tend to forget the follies and focus on how you loved the movie rather than providing a critique.In the same vein reviewing TZP is not easy, the topic is sensitive, the script quite powerful and the performances quite flawless. But after watching the movie I feel compelled to write about it. TZP is essentially about an 8 year old dreamer who is branded a looser by the big bad world obsessed with results. The story focuses on his plight and how hope in form of a teacher resurrects the kid. Essentially a very simple story, where Mr. Khan excels is the way he has treated the subject, the way everything looks so natural that we begin to laugh and cry with the characters.To lend such credibility to a story is indeed a herculean task. It helps that the songs are spot on and are almost poetic flowing seamlessly through the narrative. Performance wise Aamir Khan as Ram Shankar Nikhumb acts with full honesty and becomes the character with effortless ease. The scene where he looks moist eyed at the disabled is worth his weight in gold. The angst and the helplessness he shows through his eyes makes one feel claustrophobic and bound. Every time you feel SRK is improving Aamir Khan reinvents himself. With Shahrukh Khan you see Shahrukh Khan, with Aamir you see DJ, Ram Shankar Nikhumb or the numerous character he portrays.The show stealer is of course Darsheel Safary as Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi. With Ishaan, he does a remarkable job in performing a very complex character so effortlessly, that one can't help but marvel. He speaks through his actions, he speaks through his eyes, he is always conveying something. Pain, anger, disgust. His ability to show twisted emotion of feeling the pain yet not wanting sympathy is something very rare to see in someone so raw. His presence is so overwhelming that other characters just serve as fillers. One can just hope that he doesn't randomly pick up movies. Darsheel has immortalized himself as Ishan Nandkishore Awasthi with this one performance.It will be a benchmark performance for years to come. Other characters are well etched and perform ably. The scripts has a few clichs like the painting competition and the final predictable victory but they don't put you off. You are addicted. You don't notice. You are blinded. Even after the movie ended I saw nobody moving, everyone was watching the end credits rolling silently. Almost everyone wiped a tear or two and silently walked out. They must have promised themselves to be a better person,better parents,to be more understanding, to be more human! Do yourself a favour watch Taare Zameen Par. Not tomorrow, but today, not later but NOW! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

The endearing kid has an acute sense of performance never letting the viewer think he's acting it out. All the characters just fit in perfectly never getting an inch more or lesser on the reel. The highlight of it all is excellent music. In recent times this is one of the few movies having "situational" songs and pulling it off with such grace, timing and completeness. An excellent watch, entertaining, enlightening and at the end worth appreciating Aamir Khan directorial Debut, Aamir is great at direction as much as his perfection at acting. KUDOS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aamir&#x2019;s Rang De Basanti was according to me one of the best movies last year. IMHO, it&#x2019;s Aamir again with his TZP which could be called the best of 2007 narrowly beating King Khan&#x2019;s Chak De. In line with the standards he had set with his acting skills, Aamir the Perfectionist has delivered a masterpiece in his first movie as a Director.The protagonist of the story, Ishaan (Darsheel) is an eight year old who sees the world differently from the left brained majority. His world is full of color with fishes, space stuff, dancing letters and art work flowing from unbridled imagination. When it comes to academics he trails behind with single digit marks and is a repeater in Standard III.What the parents, the Awasthis ponder is that while Ishaan&#x2019;s elder sibling is a topper throughout and also accomplished at Tennis, how could the younger one be so poor. They soon conclude that the little boy is a brat and the best way to set him right is to put him in a boarding school. Here, the boy becomes even more a recluse.Things change for Ishaan when substitute art teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir) identifies the boy&#x2019;s problem as dyslexia, which he had himself suffered during childhood. Soon, Nikumbh works out innovative ways to help little Ishaan discover himself.The strongest point is Amol Gupte&#x2019;s masterful script. Attribute it to the director or his protg, Darsheel is amazing. Those who play parents are apt and real. The movie has many special moments. My favorites are when Awasthis leave the boy at the boarding school and one where Nikumbh makes Awasthis understand about the boy&#x2019;s condition.TZP deals with a protagonist with a brain condition, but it is surely not a film on dyslexia. It is more about children and nurture. It emphasizes that being a topper at academics and sport is not everything in life, but every kid is special. It presents an alternative view that it is in fact, those who see the world in a different light that change the world.Comparisons with black seem inevitable since both have protagonists with a congenital condition and both have a mentor played by a superstar. TZP simply scores over Black, with its no-nonsense screenplay and realistic characters as against unreal setting and over-action by the lead star. Moreover, as known, TZP is not inspired by Hollywood.Maybe I tend to appreciate movies with boarding schools because it gives me a sense of nostalgia about my days in one! But, for sure, TZP is a very lovable film. You&#x2019;ll love it for the story, performances, the music, use of color and the locales. Hope Aamir goes on doing what he does best and continues to deliver such gems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most moving stories ever seen on the big screen. A tissue is a necessary accessory while watching this movie, since you won't leave the hall without shedding a few tears; these tears are not of sorrow, but are just symbolic of the feelings that really touched each and every heart that saw it.It is impossible to find a fault with this movie. The acting, direction screenplay and even the music have been impeccable. Few movies on socially relevant subjects have been able to make it big at the BOX office. Awards beckon for this movie: Best Movie (at least the best foreign movie at Oscars) BEST Actor in Lead Role for Darsheel Safary, Best Director for Amir Khan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creativily beautiful Besides the movie is an example of changing trend of Indian cinema - the movie has a soul. While representing common Indian parents as Mr. &amp; Mrs. Awasthi, the movie also tells what they should be like. Our children are our future - how we can play with it!The consistent level of perfect reactions (especially thru eyes) and dialogs of Amir Khan, Highly noticeable and comparable acting of Darsheel (Ishan) is what makes this movie a must watch. But what really makes me this movie to write this review at 12:26 AM is the creatively beautiful direction. See these - Amir's concept of teaching children as well as handing colleagues, The way he describes Ishan's problem to his father, First vocal conversation of Ishan and Amir (Ishan! can you switch the light?) look how Beautifully and Unnoticed he made the first conversation &#x2013; like giving Ishan base to talk comfortably. Treating Ishan&#x2019;s father (Good to hear! You care your child...) and then the way he tells what really taking care of IS. Third same scene example of Solomon Islands (They shout around the tree and that tree automatically goes to death...) take notice how he is sketching the common Indian parents.If I write all reasons people might even not read this review due to length, but I can&#x2019;t stop me to add this last one &#x2013; The last stilled scene of the end, Amir handing up and Ishan going to sky &#x2013; a great visualization of progress (Ishan as child) and supporting him (Amir as parenting).That&#x2019;s enough said &#x2013; now don&#x2019;t wait go and watch&#x2026; it will change something FOR SURE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TZP is nothing short of a Mona Lisa in Cinema. The emotions this 2 1/2 hour masterpiece gets out of you, leaves you shell shocked and elated. The cast and crew of this movie deserve a standing ovation for bringing out the best in Indian Cinema. SRK KJO YashRaj, Ghai,Barjayta, RGV, Farah Khan and all other so called dream merchants of bollywood need to take direction lessons and acting lessons from Aamir Khan. After RDB he belts out another classy fare which I would rank along with the likes of Forrest Gump, Life is Beautiful, Shaw shank Redemption and Schindlers List. 10/10 hands down. Thank You for this cinematic Classic. P.S: However great TZP is, Its common knowledge that a no brainer like OSO is going to sweep the awards and maybe shamefully head for the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par......!! A masterpiece..and Bollywood must feel proud that such a movie is produced here!!An all time great movie!! TZP.. though,based on dyslexia,an uncommon and rare subject for movie-makers....has an universal appeal. Movie has been dealt with such a perfection that it has become a masterpiece. Aamir khan has dealt with the subject of dyslexia to bring into the focus of parents that how tedious and difficult the life of children become when they are burdened with high-expectations. Even if a child is not dyslexic,he should be dealt like a "CHILD" ,and not just a means of fulfilling his/her parents' expectations. What a child feels and how he tackles the situation when all of a sudden,when he is still merely 9-10 years of age,he is sent to a boarding school.This is presented with such a perfection that it is heart-touching.The movie makes us to ponder,to think and to feel for children!!A must watch movie for all age-groups!!</fullReview>

Then I saw water.And a face. Face with a focused look..innocently sticking his tongue out in concentration.His aim? Kidnap fishes from the gutter.I think I had moist eyes.Was I seeing the 8-yr old...ME? For the next 2.5 hrs I had frequent chocking lumps in my throat with an inability to breathe properly. Sounds like torture. But Felt like magic.. :)I am writing this column only for those who pointed out flaws in the movie.I have a question for you guys.How many movies have you so critically-intellectually-arrogantly-insensitively analysed? Or should I ask,"How many movies have you even analysed?".This movie has got even the non-writers writing for it,discussing the angles,quality,direction,scene details and what not.Can you think why?I didn't find any interesting blog discussing about the technical details of OSO,Welcome,Partner etc etc..What is making us discuss so much about TZP guys?? Its the impact that the movie made on you.The tears which were rolling down your eyes..the helpless expressions of Ishaan which forced you to introspect..and probably the overly critical nature of his father and teachers..which you want to defend.TZP is above any criticism or any cynic who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing(thank you Nikumbh Sir). You guys criticized the movie for being slow,Amir crying too much,having seen some empty beds,unnecessary songs...How come you TZP-critiques forgot to criticize Ishaan's father? How come you guys forgot to criticize the way his art teacher punished him?How come you guys forgot to criticize the sports teacher for fairing pathetically at the painting competition??Probably because these people reflect a little of you all...Get a life friends. If you keep judging TZP,you'll have no time to love it.On a light note..What if I had been razor sharp to stop that counter person from tearing the tickets and had instead taken the tickets of Welcome???? Sigh...Taare Zameen Par.A movie which made me realise thatSometimes in life,it is healthy to be slow and dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first time when I even watched the casting of the movie. It was so enthralling that I didn't want to go. I hoped if there could be a little more left in it. Few movies hit our mind, few move our heart but this movie touched my soul. From starting till end, every second of the movie was worth it. Beginning on a humorous note, the movie slowly moved into a space with an emotional aura and ended on a successful, happy note. The dialogs, the story and the acting of each and every character was very simple and very realistic and thus it didn't feel like that they were acting. At times, there were few scenes in which even I, a guy of 24, couldn't stop my tears. This movie has an international feel and leaves a message on our mind, on parents and on potential parents. This movie will definitely go to Oscar. Go and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aamir khan has done it again.The "artist" has picked up a story no other bollywood director can think of.The actor Aamir shows his prowess as a director in this movie.The serious problem of dyslexia,unnoticed by the Indian society has finally been brought to it's notice.The movie is also able to address the serious issue of "pressure of competition" among the younger genius.But credit has to be given to the boldness of Aamir for making a movie on an issue,generally restricted to the art movie genre.The overall success of the movie not only as one being of critical acclamation but also as a commercial success is the work of a maestro.However due credit has to be provided to the entire team particularly to the young darsheel safary.Shankar Ehsaan Loy also provides a fitting soundtrack to the movie.The movie shows that a child's mind is like a free bird,it needs to explore things around us,it can't be kept captivated within the boundaries of classwork and homework.what needs to be done is channeling this special gift within each and every one of us,so that it doesn't get lost.Finally I want to conclude that not only "srk and sex" but also good direction,brilliant acting,impressive storyline and of course Aamir khan sells.This movie has rightly been made tax free and is a must watch for each and everyone of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have learnt to respect Aamir Khan works. Ever since Lagaan, he has worked in great movies, but 'Taare Zameen Par' stands out among them. Not only as a best debut directorial movie but also the most true to reality Hindi movie ever made.The characters in the movie seem so real, we see them daily in our present lives, in our house, school or neighbors. Darsheel Safary is simply beyond brilliant. A beautiful and true representation of present Indian middle class homes where parents burden their kids with their high expectations. Come on get 100% in all classes!! Many kids simply crumble under the pressure. The movie also shows the true marvel of mother-son relationship really makes you cry. In fact i have seen many parents cry at some of the songs. Be ready to do the same but as Gandalf the Grey said not all tears are evil, feel free.The classroom scenes were a real trip down the memory lane. Me and My friends ended up recounting our own school experiences.On the whole be ready to laugh and ready to cry, because this is an experience touches the depth of your emotional chords. 10/10</fullReview>

It also shows small socio-economical picture from India.This movie reminds e about 2 other movies 1. Munna bhai lage raho and 2. Lagan. Like Munna bhai this movie also tries to build the story on a disease. But the way of presentation is different. It is lot more serious movie than Munna bhai lage raho.It reminds me about Lagan for Amir Khan. He has done a great job with it.The part I liked most in the movie is "by love you can solve many problems." Young children need love and affection from us, not an unhealthy rat race (competition).</fullReview>

I wont go into the story of the movie because i would like every one in India and all over the world to watch this movie. My personally believe that this movie should be send for Oscar nominations. Amir Khan has guts to make such a movie in a country where love-triangle still dominates the charts! He has proved that he is an excellent director!! His experience as an actor is shown how well he can plan a scene and direct it. All the actors, Darsheel Safary, Amir Khan, Tisca Chopra has given their best!!! The best part about this movie is to look around in while the movies going on, you will all see some tears rolling down. But you can all see big smiles while leaving the theater. Finally, one of the best movies made in Bollywood. I salute Amir Khan for taking this initiative and presenting such a wonderful story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahh. Never before and never again. Kudos. What can we say about this movie? The lady who sat besides me has weeped for the Maa song. It stimulates the adulterated mind. The songs are the best assets. They have been placed at the best position in the movie. The Ishaan's acting is obviously the best I had ever seen. No Shahrukh, Amithab or even the Leonardo can make such a film. There is difference between acting and involving. Other act and Aamir involves. Tare Zameen Par is the best example. You could see OSM it is just filled with our sense to touch the fun. But TZP is the one which awakens you as you watch it. The Music is the best one I ever heard. you can see the story line, it is pretty difficult to compose for a less profile film. But SEL has done a tremendous job. Nor even Rahaman can do that. What an Involvement? Amazing. Especially the Maa song is a chart buster, for which a special community is created with 500 members. This is the first strange thing that ever witnessed by me-a community specially for a song in Bollywood. The way a dyslexia child should be treated is pictured in a sensible and also in an emotional way is amazing. Parents should learn the lessons after watching this film. No child is born less intellect, all are geniuses, but it is the parents who make them less intellect through their reviews and behavior.We could make a better society with the best child only. As children is our future who can break the barriers with their innovative thoughts. When we think purely result will be pure. Child is the purest one in Human. This film is the purest one in the Bollywood.Regards, Ravi Kiran Rathod</fullReview>

		<fullReview>India's veteran directors should take a cue from this first time dbutant 'actor turned director'. Aamir Khan. Truly called the Ace Khan. The movie is simple and straight. It is about the struggles of a child suffering from dyslexia, also the main protagonist of the movie Ishant Avasthi. Needless to say that he steals all the show and shines like a star in Stars on Earth. Ishaan is a dyslexic child and has difficulties in reading, writing and understanding letters, words and sentences. His world is filled with wonders that no one else seems to appreciate; colors, fish, dogs and kites are just not important in the world of adults, who are much more interested in things like homework, marks and neatness. And Ishaan just cannot seem to get anything right in class.For that he gets punished every time The story is very simple and very simply told and everybody can relate to it at at least some level.Aamir is truly called a perfectionist. Keep it up Aamir. I recommend this movie to every movie lover. I give this 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a story of Ishaan Awasthi, a young boy who struggles with dyslexia. He could be just another kid in the world: he likes to play with his dogs, daydream in the middle of a class or meal; go around the city and wonder at the busy the environment; watch fishes swim in the aquarium, gutter or pond; make toys out of anything he picks out on the street; and most of all he loves to draw and paint and he's very, very good with colors. But there's one thing, he can't seem to read and write properly. He usually gets low grades in his studies, his teachers would occasionally scold and punish him for being an idiot and his father, who unfortunately is a perfectionist, would sometimes beat him up thinking he was just being lazy in his studies. His mother just didn't have a clue and how to help Ishaan go through with just reading and spelling. When all hope is lost, Ishaan's father sends him to a boarding school thinking that its rigid discipline could help the boy get the marks (like 95.6% in all subjects?). There Ishaan suffers more punishment and psychological torture. Hey, a dyslexic boy sent to a boarding school alone? The boy was almost suicidal at one point but miraculously, one temporary teacher came along, thought about why Ishaan was always sad and frightened, understood Ishaan and helped the kid by treating the boy's dyslexia. Ishaan regains his confidence, passes his school exams and happily reunites with his family at the end of the school year.Taare Zameen Par delivers its message without being preachy in my opinion and treated every scene with much sensitivity and detail. Just check out Ishaan bunking school when he realized his test papers were unsigned. God, his travel through the city and his wonder seeing all those people, buildings, roads and colors was brilliantly captured in every frame--and the accompanying song, Mera Jahan was just bliss. The scene where Ishaan's family was leaving him at the boarding school destroyed my bow never to cry in any movie. I know that feeling when you see your mom leaving you, you know and the lyrics of "Maa" narrated Ishaan's worries and fears about his mom leaving him in a place far away from home so well. I won't be giving every detail of the movie away so..just go and watch the movie yourself.Taare Zameen Par drives home a special message for everyone. It's not about children with dyslexia. It's all about children. It's all about caring and looking after them. It's all about not taking away their childhood, their dreams. It's all about realizing that kids aren't robots that are immune to pressure. We should nurture our kids, not train them to do something they aren't yet capable of. We all had our childhood taken away because of the insane, fast pace of the world. Let's not let our children lose their childhood innocence and let them enjoy every minute of their childhood life. Remember, a good childhood experience often resonates throughout a person's lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my wide experience of watching Bollywood movies, I had never been as pleased as I witnessed the meticulous directing of the film, the immaculate acting and the amazing plot of the storyline. Taare Zameen Par has made a place in my heart through its message about the wonders in a child's brain and the way the message touched my heart. We should not understimate the power of the brain even if it fails in the easiest of works. The brain is a mystery, no one knows how and when it unveils its secret. Through systematic approach, it is possible to remove the mask of incapability that enshrouds the brain and open the windows of ingenuity. Support, care and generosity are the medicine to cure the brain's inability to shine like the sun. Stars are whirling amongst us. It is the duty of the parents and the teachers to recognise them at the appropriate time, provide confidence and inspiration for their lives to succeed in order to make a memorable and useful change to the world. From the disappointment at not being able to overwhelm the rising obstacles to the happiness at having achieved the unpredictable, Taare Zameen Par makes a illustrious mark in the history of the world of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hats off to Aamir Khan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was fantastic. I have no words to say because it was a wonderful gift given by Aamir Khan to lot of parents like us.The entire film made us to imagine our 7yr old child in the place of Eshaan. we thought that the film had been picturised especially on our family. We used to go through all the scenes in the film in our daily life.(In fact we thought to join our child in boarding school for the next academic session). Thanks to Aamir Khan for changing our approach towards our child. I think the film taught lot of parents and teachers to motivate the children like Eshaan. We have already changed our mindset towards our child's future. Now I love my child for what he is.Hats off to Aamir khan for directing such as sensitive subject.Hope he continues to work on typical kind of films like TJP in future. Music was fabulous. The song "Ma" is so emotional and touchy.Great job done by music directors.The total package is worth seeing.All the parents and teachers should watch the film to enlighten the childhood of kids like Eshaan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TZP-A Fabulous Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zamin Par is a fabulous movie with a message for both parents and teachers.It tackles a major problem in a country like ours with a booming population wherein there is a rat race amongst parents to coax their children to do extremely well in academics! But the problems, aspirations and feelings of these very children are probably left wayside? TZP tackles a child's problem in studies in stark comparison to his very bright brother in a manner which can be well understood by both a common parent and a teacher. Aamir khan has yet again made a great movie - his directorial debut- 'KUDOS' to the entire team of Taare Zamin Par. Wishing All Success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary tale of a extraordinary talented boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Taare Zameen par" tells the story of a boy named Ishan, who is having a mental disability named Dyslexia. Due to this people around think that the boy is very dull, stubborn, and irresponsible. But his new drawing teacher Ramkumar Nikumb (Aamir Khan) makes people educate about this and helps the kid not only to overcome this disability, but also takes out the extraordinary drawing and thinking talent from the kid.First the negative points because as for me there is only one, and that is the length of the movie. The movie is unnecessary stretched to its current length. Because of this sometimes it loose the grip. All the songs either could have been removed or could have been shortened. This happens in both half of the movie. Especially at the end when the rest story is clear the movie elongates unnecessary. Having said that other than that the movie is excellent. Hats off to the writer. While watching the movie, it becomes clear that the writer has taken effort for doing some research before writing the script. Also a special thanks to director/actor Aamir Khan. In Indian movies specially when director and leading actor is same, the focus of the movie automatically shifted to his own character. But certainly not in this movie, where the Aamir's entry it self is at the Interval. And even after that the main focus is on the kid, rather than the teacher. This is really difficult as a director to do, and congrats to Aamir for achieving this. The success of the movie is in its execution which sends out the clear message as it intends i.e. "Every child is special". The help of Dyslexia is just to make this message clear. From starting the story revolves around this kid who is dull in study and as a result is always the target of scolding from parents and teachers. The movie has successfully sketched the kids feeling and the audience can exactly feel what the kid is feeling, and the kid starts getting pity from them. And as the movie progresses audience gets more and more attached to the feelings of the kid. Another excellent point of the movie is the movie from start to end concentrate only on main script and nowhere it moves from its original message. No unnecessary characters, jokes or funny situations. It is this reason that even after leaving the theater, you can't take this movie out of your head.Hence I have rated this movie 8/10. The only two points are removed because of the length of the movie, due to which at many points in the movie you feel bored, and wait for when this scene is going end. Other than that it is really good movie and must watch for each person in society who is dealing with the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is this movie? Taare Zameen Par (TZM) has the simplicity of a nursery rhyme but something that remains with you for a long long time to come. The movie is takes you on a journey with Ishaan, an 8-year old who is the central character of this movie. So much so that had Ishaan be a real life person couldn't have bettered this.Is this slow? This movie is not slow unless you expected a 90 min edge of the seat action/thrillers. Hmm I saw this but... Watch it again for the second time and if you are a parent I would urge you to watch it from Ishaan's shoes. It reminds us so much of our on childhood that you choke on it. Simply!Do I take back something? Oh yes. Make no mistake. This movie is on a moral ? It makes a genuine attempt to remind every adults childhood. Pleads them to understand the next time they look at their own children. Strike a chord that life is not a race to the top.One Line It says when you are on the beginning of a long journey walk, saunter you'll get your own time to run, sprintRecommend? If you want to bring back some fond memories of your childhood you'll have to simply see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Taare Zameen Par" is the best movie made in Indian cinema in a long time. Debut Directorial venture of "Aamir Khan" who is the best Indian actor and he handles this movie about a kid,suffering from dyslexia.But this movie is more about the relationship between the parents and children and the unnecessary pressures put on children by the parents and teachers.The First Half of the movie belongs to the exceptional kid(Darsheel Safary) and he performs so well that u have nostalgic moments about your childhood and the kid manages to hold your attention acting brilliantly. The kid fails in exams after exams and cannot study due to his illness but no one realising the creative potential of the kid who is sent to Boarding school.Second half Aamir Khan enters as a Arts Teacher and he bonds with the kid and then the movie moves to the most moving climaxes ever seen on the Indian cinema.This movie will make u Cry and Laugh its a must watch for Indian movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is another master piece from Aamir The ghost (director) has been resurrected in human flesh and yes, Mr Perfectionist has got it all perfect. His maiden directorial venture is a delight for one and all. Whether you are a kid, or a teenager, just married, or if you are a parent -- Yes... You'll love it! Pre-release in what appeared to be a non mainstream film, shines like a UNIVERSAL film which will keep the box office abuzz.The story moves along on a very natural pace at which the viewer is able to connect to the 8 year old dyslexic boy played by Darsheel Safary. That is the biggest plus point of the movie, the viewer draws parallel with the boys character connecting with him at a very high emotional level. You'll reminisce and be transported back to those wonderful years of your childhood and will have more than a tear in the eye. The scene where the boy is admitted in the boarding school and bidding goodbye to his parents and brother followed by the 'Maa' song is a real tear jerker. But tears is not all what you are going to have, the screenplay makes sure that those tear jerking moments are followed by heavy doses of laughter with some lovely and innocent humorous moments.If you thought that only Sanjay Leela Bhansali knew how to capture art on celluloid then watch TZP. The boy's bunked day at school, his room, classroom decor, and the painting competition in the end are a colorful visual delight expressing a million words to the viewers.Yes, its true. Aamir's character appears just before the end of the first half, but one is so engrossed that Aamir - The actor's absence is not felt. Thats remarkable! All the credit goes to the protagonist played by Darsheel who in my books gives the best performance till date by a child artist in Hindi Cinema. He is the heart and soul of the movie and how naturally this boy handles scenes of intense emotions with such ease in his first movie is stunning. Tisca Chopra as the boy's mother gives a top notch performance at par, if not above the likes of roles played by Nirupa Roy, Rakhi and Kirron Kher.Aamir the actor has a shorter but powerful role which he performs decently. But at the end of the day its Aamir - The Director who wins hands down by extracting 'A GRADE' performances from all the cast, and making a movie which connects to the heart of the viewer. The second half becomes a little slow in between and it could have been more crisp. But thats negligible because in the end the movie manages convincingly to convey a very important message to today's parents - Your kids are not race horses of a derby. Let them travel life at their pace as each has their unique mission which only they can fulfill.Lastly, TZP just made 2007 better and interesting. The award season is knocking and well, watch out, TZP may just pull off a surprise or two by upsetting the favorites so far...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>excelling in all departments of movie making ,Taare Zameen Par(tzp) is an excellent depiction of a child's heart and a must watch for all parents ,teachers and children( specially who have siblings).Also it is a must watch for all couples who in years to come will be nurturing a tender mind. Movie is based on a child suffering from dyslexia(disease in which people cannot figure out difference in different letters and more...WATCH TZP for details).Darsheel(Ishaan) the protagonist of the movie suffers from the same disease but no one near him ,parents ,teachers etc realize his problem and just consider him as a spoil brat ,unwilling to study and always making excuses.First half of the movie builds on this ignorance of people and different creative world of Ishaan.Ishaan being surrounded with his world of colors and imaginations(beautiful world) creates problems far mare than his parents can handle, so he is sent to a boarding school(NEW ERA PUBLIC SCHOOL).the internal chaos of Ishaan does not get any opening to escape out here and he gets silent(dull).BUT,here comes Nikumbh(Aamir khan)and whole dull world is transformed to vibrant colors.the fight and passion is for you to see in the movie.EVERY CHILD IS WIN ....WIN..BELIEVE THEM.Acting is good by every one, Darsheel stands out with expressions making every scene worthwhile .Aamir is Brilliant as usual.TIsca chopra also adds to her acting profile. Every character caring brother (DADA),impaired friend(rajan)and a father part of the competitive world are performed well,though some lighter characters like of the teachers at boarding though good could have been better. Music may not stand alone but in the movie it adds a lot as does the animation showing Ishaan's exquisite imagination.Both give a Audio-visual lift without being too fancy. So, on whole we get a movie which should be successful both with audience and at the award galore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taare zameen Par is the much awaited directorial debut of "Perfectionist" Aamir Khan. And he dug gold there too. TZP stood like a tower when compared to all other Bollywood flicks. It has all the potential to become a money grosser at the box office and award bagger as well.TZP is the story of Ishaan, a troubled 9 year old kid. Ishaan has dyslexia, a mental problem resulting in non remembrance of alphabets and numbers. Parents without understanding him and his problems, force studies on him to make him ready to face the merciless competitive world outside. He is sent to a boarding school as they are unable to help the poor soul anymore. Tisca Chopra is worth a special mention in the role of the mother. The rest of the story is how Ishaan comes out as a winner..The music and lyrics for the songs will take you to another world... Always the lyrics from Prasoon Joshi were special in their own sense. The song "Maa" is a true master piece.One thing is for sure...The child oriented movies in mainstream bollywood is a rare sight. Only gutsy people can venture in those arenas..May be it is time for the Academy to consider Indian Cinema for the Oscars. We definitely have potential. Darsheel Safary needs some accolades and awards for his fine performance as Ishaan.</fullReview>

Movie has elements which teaches both parents and teachers, in understanding their children. "Not all can get 95%": which is very much true. Parents should understand this.On the whole, a very good movie to rejoice. After a long long time, I believe, a movie on children is made. Aamir has really taken care of every element of the frame to be more realistic and close to children. GOOD Job Aamir. After seeing this movie, I hope parents would realize the difficulties of their children, take time and solve their problems with love and affection. As such, for their children no "Nikun Sir" would be there to solve their children's problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've probably read the synopsis by now. This is a serious movie that deals with a depressed boy who has had his esteem destroyed by people who don't really take an interest in him. I think the director (and a lead character) did just a marvelous job with this movie. At times you don't know if the boy is going to live or not, he is so depressed. I was in suspense wondering what would happen. Darsheel Safary, who is ten or eleven, in this movie delivers an Oscar worthy performance. The movie also examines (what I think) may be an attitude in Indian life that classical success is the most important thing in life. There are lots of subplots. It's a complicated movie and they did a great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may end up being one of my personal comments on any movie/TV program I have done for IMDb. I first saw Taare Zameen Par way back when it first released and instantly connected with the character of Ishaan(played by Darsheel Safari). The reason being because like Ishaan I am too dyslexic. I will however try not to ramble on too much about my personal experiences. I identified with everything Ishaan went through right down to the fact that he was misunderstood by his family who think of him as lazy. One of my favourite moments from Taare Zameen Par is the part when Aamir Khan goes to Ishaan's parents and Aamir khan forces Ishaan's dad to read Chinese writing on the box of a toy, that was truly a wonderful scene. Taare Zameen Par made an excellent point on what Dyslexic children lack in some areas they make up for in others. Ishaan may have been bad at English but his talents lied in Painting.One memory I have as a child is I was very bad at maths and my dad used to set me Maths challenges at home so that I would do better. Maths just didn't register with me and when I got it wrong he would get increasingly frustrated with me. He thought I was lazy when in fact I had dyslexic and it hadn't been identified yet. What is so incredible about Taare Zameen Par is that it refuses to blame Ishaan's parents for not understanding their son but instead makes a point about how ignorant people in countries like India for example are about Dyslexia. Some Bollywood movies are made just to entertain their audiences but movies like Taare Zameen Par not only entertain but also raise awareness of social issues like Dyslexia and everyone involved with the production of Taare Zameen Par should be congratulated for making such a fine movie with a great social message. I don't know about the education system is in India seeing as I live in the UK but I bet more schools in India are more tolerant of dyslexic children and do their best to help them and they have Taare Zameen Par to thank for that. On a parting note I would just like to say that TZP gives hope and understanding for people with Dyslexia and movies like this one should be encouraged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par is a good emotional story with a message for the parents. The kids and parents will completely enjoy it.The story is unusual but not unknown. The message that the story tries to convey is already known to us, but most of us just remain ignorant to it. Aamir Khan, the director, has handled the delicate theme with dexterity and precision. He has not just succeeded in making every child a hero but actually helped us see a child in ourselves. Just like no man is perfect no matter what position he commands in the society, every child with both their ability and inabilities is special and talented in their own way. The movie isn't just about a child suffering from dyslexia and his challenges, it's also about how parents get carried away by today's competitive world and fail to understand their child's dreams and nurture their inborn talents.Unlike any other enlightening entertainer which focuses more on the hero, Aamir has given the child more footage and captured every emotion deftly thereby focusing on its root cause and maintaining its significance throughout the movie. A number of sequences leave you moist eyed and you feel deeply attached to the child. At the end of the movie you are left speechless and spellbound. Music by Shanker ? Ehsaan - Loy is great and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi are brilliant, they blend well with the movie. However the movie is not without its share of flaws. The editing could have been tighter; it tends to drag a bit while being repetitive at times.Darsheel Safary, the kiddo, delivers a knockout performance. His expressions, body language, eyes, dialogue delivery ? absolutely perfect. The best lead performance of the year, deserves the best actor award. Aamir Khan as usual is excellent in a supporting role. Aamir fans could be disappointed to see him missing in the first half. Tisca Chopra is good. Vipin Sharma overacts a bit.If you believe in meaningful realistic cinema then do please do watch Taare Zameen Par.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taare Zameen Par Is Indian Cinema's Best Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a die-hard Aamir fan and preferred to watch 'Welcome' first instead of 'Taare Zameen Par' on the day of release. Two days later, I finally went to watch Taare Zameen Par in Bahrain with my brother and my sister-in-law.The movie starts of with off-beat backgrounds and a mysterious little child immediately informing the viewer that this isn't one of your super-sized and glamorized "run of the mill" film. Even though I couldn't understand why the little boy neglected studies and why he behaved so differently, there was something about that kid that reminded me of my own wasted childhood. We all know that Aamir is a perfectionist but this is sheer brilliance! Aamir has captured the restless innocence and the spontaneity of the wonder years to perfection. Even the most ordinary street scenes of a typical Indian town have been shot so passionately that you are mesmerized by the extraordinary visuals. Most of the childhood scenes were so natural and moving that my eyes were numb almost throughout the entire movie. And the song 'Maa' is exceptionally sentimental. I had wept a lot while watching movies like 'Mother India' and 'Gandhi'. I even broke down in a couple of scenes in Mahesh Bhat's 'Naam' but I have never wept like a baby like I have done constantly in Taare Zameen Par. When the lights came out in the Interval I wasn't embarrassed by my tears thanks to the fact that almost everyone else's eyes were visibly numb too.Only when Aamir reveals after the first half of the film that the child has Dyslexia, I realized the complexity of the poor child. Yes, I was ignorant of the symptoms until then. I'm sure most people were before this movie. Dyslexia isn't a common cold for everyone to know and neither is it life-threateningly dangerous like AIDS but it is important for us all to know and understand not just Dyslexia but children It's really important to understand everyone including ourselves.Yes, Aamir could have shot the movie in those exotic foreign locations. Signed the biggest names in Bollywood to play the characters in the film, danced around the trees with a heroine, and yes he could have added some comedians to boost the commercial value but he listened to his heart and has created magic with a simple story that touches every sensitive heart. Aamir has acted well and most of the other cast have done a decent job too. But Darsheel Safary steals the show. His lively eyes convey a hundred different things in a minute and his ever-changing facial expressions make you wonder how a child can act so flawlessly? When the movie ended, we were also touched by the Arab women in front of our row who all stood up and clapped for the movie in appreciation. I looked at my brother and his wife and they were crying too. This is not just a great movie that I recommend to every child, parent and teacher but this is an experience I will never forget till I breathe my last. Hats of to Aamir Khan for making such a refreshingly emotional movie. Bravo! I would have given this movie all the stars in the universe for my rating if I had the power. Taare Zameen Par is an emotional roller-coaster ride that every human must watch. I reckon that Taare Zameen Par is better than any Indian or Hollywood flick when it comes to emotion. This is at least Indian Cinema's best yet! Send this one to the Oscars, seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are movies made to entertain people or are they made to send a message? Do our filmmakers have a moral obligation to fulfill in terms of giving social messages to the masses via their movies? I am not sure of the answers to these questions. Some people say that movies are only meant to entertain and some argue that it being a mass media having a great scope to influence, filmmakers ought to make movies which have socially relevant messages. I guess these arguments will keep on happening. But once in a while, there comes a movie which satisfies both the arguments outlined above. It entertains and at the same time successfully transmits a socially relevant message which cuts across societies, class, gender and age. 'Taare Zameer Par' is one such masterpiece. I saw this movie last week. It starred Aamir Khan and Darsheel Safary. Darsheel plays an eight year old dyslexic boy Ishaan. He has trouble reading and writing and scores poorly in almost all of his subjects. His older sibling on the other hand is a brilliant student and a top performer in class. His poor performance in school is troubling his parents a lot and as any Indian middle class parents they hope to see their kids become engineers/doctors when they grow up. Not realizing the basic problem with the child, Ishaan is sent to a hostel thinking this will teach him a lesson and he will improve. This had a negative impact on the kid and he goes into a shell. Enters Aamir Khan, as a temporary arts teacher. He, being a dyslexic cured child himself, is able to understand Ishaan's problem and helps in his recovery. Also, he is able to nurture the kids ability as a painter and encourages him to draw and even manages to make him a celebrity at school because of this. More importantly, he is able to convince his parents that their kid has a problem which needs to be tackled. That not all kids are the same and we should not be imposing our expectations on them. Each child is unique and has a some special talent. As parents its our responsibility to understand this and nurture these talents of our kids rather force them to join the rat race to score well and become engineers and doctors. The movie has some brilliant performances by Aamir, Darsheel and Tisca (Ishaan's mother). But it is Darsheel who steals the show. As a dyslexic but very naughty kid, his natural flair for acting and his facial contours are simply a treat a watch. Aamir as a first time director is awesome. In fact, it is one of the best debuts that I have seen in Mumbai Film Industry for a long time. Its a must watch movie for every kid, for every parent and would be parent. It is specially relevant in India. A country where every lower and middle class parent hopes to see their own unfulfilled dreams through their kids. Its a lesson for those parents who loose sleep when their kids have exams. A lesson for parents who feel if their kid is not in the top percentile at school, then his/her future is doomed. A very relevant film that has the potential to change the way Indians think and act with regards to their children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and my husband like" Taare Zammen Par" movie a lot. The theme is very nice and different than other movies. All parents should watch this movie and try to understand their kids. It is a excellent movie. Amir Khan acted very well in this movie. The kid is very nice. As a parent I learned a lot and I hope this movie will make some difference in everybody's life. I was really cried when saw the movie so I can say the actors acting was really challenging and they did it well. I would like to thanks Mr. Amir Khan for doing such a nice movie. We all should do something for the kids and help them to stand in their life. The title tells the moral of the movie and it make some sense. Even after the movie finished as was thinking on it. I was just thinking on this movie the whole night. This movie will surely engage all the parents who have had similar incidents in their lives. Writer Amol Gupte delivered a grate script. The Maa song made me cried. It really took me back to my childhood.I love this movie...:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are funny movies, and then there are romantic ones, there are epic-saga's and there are family films. There are patriotic flicks and there are action thrillers....Most of the time Bollywood directors lose the plot in trying to mix-n-match all of above in one package to please every kind of audience. It is very rare in Indian Cinema that a director goes beyond getting bound by compulsion-to-tickle-and-obsession-to-amuse. Very few producers/directors walk on the sword-edge to actually deliver a strong social message while providing a wholesome family entertainment.It is in this background that 'Taare Zameen Par' is a masterpiece and work of art by Aamir Khan. No one else could have taken the courage to direct his first movie which is not the usual hip&amp;happening-glamorous movie. Hats off to Aamir and he has again proved that he is different and will always remain different. He is Bollywood's answer to Tom Hanks.Enough about Amir, the movie touches your heart to the core. Story flows naturally and audience can identify with characters. There is a beautiful portrayal of emotions. The child actor Darsheel Safari depicts any normal naughty kid. An immaculate acting by such a small kid is praiseworthy.A movie which has a social message, is a replica of the society and a must watch for all parents..! Cinematography is excellent and songs are appropriate to the situations.SO what is the best thing about this movie? Unlike most big-budget-glamorous Bollywood flicks, this movie entertains you, and still makes you think.It carries a message for today's generation Must watch..Strongly recommended..!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can expect nothing but the best from perfectionist Aamir Khan, and he does just that in his directorial debut. While so many of his movies have been entertaining, profound, etc., Taare Zameen Par also deals with an extremely important issue.TZP is the story of a dyslexic child. Many children with special needs in India are not being given the special care and attention that they need. However, while arranging facilities, proper education, and ample attention is a great challenge to combat, the more difficult and frustrating obstacle is to convince parents of these children that these needs exist. Out of fear of shame and "genetic ego," the parents refuse to hear/deny the truth. We must learn that it is wrong to look at such children as disabled or being a burden to a society. Instead we must recognize that they are special, encourage their unique talents, and accept them for who they are.The film educates its viewers about dyslexia; people such as Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, and even Abhishek Bachchan are dyslexic. There are endless such conditions that people refuse to accept exist in their families resulting in ruining the lives of so many innocent and able people.All performances are stellar. Songs are not bad; the title track is nice. Everything is great from the cinematography to the animation sequences. Must-see for all parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately in bollywood suddenly everyone is talking about thinking outside the box..making different movies...but to be frank most of the different movies had there core concept already available....Then comes Taare Zameen par .... i went to see it yesterday ... i went inside the hall with all the 4/5 * ratings in my mind and even then it surpassed all my expectations...I was little apprehensive becoz many review talks about bucket full of tear emotions...which thankfully is not the case the emotions are completely according to the story...Ishaan is 9 year old kid facing the problem of dyslexia, but he makes up for that with vivid imagination and wonderful talent of painting.....he sees star wars in numbers.....spiders in alphabets....His parents like any other wants the kid to be a topper like his elder brother(he is class topper and tennis player) the movie strongly criticize the present rat race world where everyone wants winners .....so as Ishaan fail to win he is sent away to boarding school......he loose all confidence and interest and even gives away painting..then enters temporary art teacher Ram Nikumb(Aamir Khan) ...he understands the situation and help Ishaan regain himself.The direction and camera work is amazing....all the animation and camera angle work was used whenever story demands it or to enhance the effect of the situation......sometimes the movie is slow but then again it would only take you to another strong scene which will make you realize the waiting was worth It's a movie for everyone and anyone.....go watch it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Masterpiece Its been a long long time since I can call a movie "an Experience" or should I call it a Masterpiece. Its feels so complete in every way. Aamir is one man who is known for his perfection and versatility, has just made his impact as the director, an impact so strong, its going to resonate for a long long time. I know lot of people feel, I am exaggerating; time, is going answer them...Everything about the movie is so fantastically crafted, so fantastically fit into its place, I was literally at my peak after this movie. A complete high!! For an example, the song "Jame raho" literally meaning "Stick on" is a work of a genius. Notice the change of the tone, the change of tempo, You will know the reason with the visuals in the movie. So subtle yet, so effective.. Shankar Mahadevan is one guy who can match Aamir with quality, with the ingenuity... Other songs also are pretty casual, and fantastically worded. Well something very unique; again very effective...Aamir has not been at his supreme best unlike Sarfarosh or Dil Chahta Hai. I probably feel this way because of the performance of the Kid overshadowing Aamir's performance. Or Maybe Aamir was disguising by subduing himself just like his character in the movie.. But his performance is quite sufficient to bring in several drops of tears ..On the whole a complete 10.. Watch it and be a part of the experience. There's a lot in the movie for all the people in the entire world for their entire lifetime, and more.. a lot lot more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant think of any other movie in the recent past which has evoked such a response without any glamor quotient attached to it.The movie is so natural and real that you tend to look at the characters on screen and match them with the real life characters you come across everyday in your life.The child actor Darsheel is a revelation.He has come up with one of the best performances by any actor in a long time.The last performances that bowled me over were Shreyas and Naseeruddin Shah(in Iqbal).But this kid,Darsheel,has beaten them by a distance i guess.For a 9 year old kid to come up with such subtle and amazing expressions was nothing sort of unbelievable.He is the star of the movie. Credit must go to Aamir who lets the boy take all the credit.He,in spite of being a superstar,seems happy to let the boy dominate the movie.Kudos to him...!!!! This is one movie no one can afford to miss.You are sure to cry at the end-not because of drama,but because of the overwhelming feeling and joy.A must watch for everyone immaterial of country,caste and age..!!!Don't miss it!!</fullReview>

Hats off to Darsheel who acted brilliantly and carries the first half on his shoulders alone. His expressions were just brilliant, watch out we have a great artist in making. Scenes between mother and son simply moist ur eyes. All the songs are too good and suites to theme of movie. Specially Maa song is just superb. About Aamir's performance don't think I have to say anything just perfect as always. Scenes between Aamir and father are just awesome and make you think.

AND I MEAN IT EVERY PARENT AND CHILD!! Parents who think their child is lazy or not working hard to do a progress should see this movie if they really want to transform their relationship with child or want that their child should get a success.i saw an old man beside me in hall. he was making comments during the movie on the mentally disabled child. he said "this child should be treated like this only then he will be fine with studies". "he is not working hard". i saw this man crying allot after the interval. he continuously cried till whole movie.One more thing please keep your hankies with you i saw 100% parents crying in cinema hall. no joke people.At last the movie goes to an ending that will definitely fill your hearts.I THINK THIS AN Oscar WINNING MOVIE FOR SURE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding - Mr. Khan, stand up and take a bow !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par is the story of little Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) who is suffering from Dyslexia. He is a bottom ranker in his class and his parents are clueless about his problem and how to deal with him. He is deported to a boarding school. Ishan is shattered. But then arrives a temporary drawing teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan). He spots Ishaan's problem and his hidden talent. How does the teacher turn the kid around is the rest of the story.It takes courage to make a film like Taare Zameen Par. History has it that the chances of such a film failing at box-office are very high. It is no less than putting his reputation at stake for Aamir Khan to choose such a subject to make his directorial debut. All this only adds to the sheen of the film.Most parents in India are not informed on problems like dyslexia. In a country that is still fighting child malnutrition and where primary education for every child is still a distant dream, that is not a surprise. This film, however, should especially shake the educated upper and middle class of India awake. Malnutrition and primary education is of course not a problem for them - they are only coffee table discussion topics. But are they really equipped on child psychology? What are we, as a society doing, to control the pressure of competition mounting on the children day by day? Taare Zameen Par asks us to introspect.The film establishes its pace very soon. That is its high point. You cannot separate out the most crucial or most happening fifteen minutes of the film. The pace is slow but well established and uniform. Credit goes the screen writer Amol Gupte and editor Deepa Bhatia.The casting is precise. Tisca Chopra as the mother and Vipin Sharma as the father are brilliant. They come out as very natural Indian parents, with their expectations, behavior and prejudices. Aamir Khan is content to play second fiddle to a kid. It only indicates his faith in the subject and his confidence in himself. But the real star, of course, is Darsheel Safary. What a performance ! The kid rips your heart as much as he soothes it. Outstanding, probably the finest performance by a child actor ever in Hindi cinema.Aamir Khan makes a directorial debut worthy of his reputation. Most fist time directors who excel in their debut attempt usually work on their own story. They have the script shaped in their minds over the years. But when somebody excels on a story penned by another person (Amol Gupte, in this case) the very first time, it shows his or her mettle. I'm excited to see what Aamir Khan comes up with next.Prasoon Joshi has written outstanding lyrics for the film. Gulzar, finally, has a rightful heir. The poetry stands in stature as high as the film itself. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have interpreted the subject and the lyrics in their own way. This is very different from their regular work. Background score is brilliant.Taare Zameen Par is, hands down, the best film of 2007. I can say that safely with a day left to end December. I'm sure it will make parents go to their kids' bedroom and tuck them in, the night they see this film or hold them a little longer when they give them a hug the next morning. Taare Zameen Par is a triumph all the way. Mr. Khan and crew - great job and thank you !</fullReview>

He has done a marvellous job as a actor and tremendous job as a Director. As without his proper direction we would have to being able to see Darsheel daftary super performance. Script of the movie by amol gupte was brilliant. All the artist have performed well.Songs were brilliant specially Mera Jahan, Maa, Title track, Jame raho, Bheja Kum and who can forget Bam Bole.

		<shortDescription>Now Aamir will be called as finest Director of Bollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, when I came to know that Aamir's next film is based on children's, I was a bit disappointed since children's movies are not appreciated in India and neither does they run at box office. And later when I read that Aamir is directing it, I was completely shocked and thought this is not a right step from Aamir Khan.But when I saw the movie, I realized how wrong I was. After watching this movie I should say that Aamir Khan should have taken director's seat few year's back since Bollywood lack's good director's and fine story teller's.Taare Zameen Par is definitely the great film of 2007. I have watched the movie trice on a same day in order to find some flaws in the movie, but didn't find any but on other hand the movie was more interesting the third time when compared to first time. This is the magic of the movie.Amol Gupte has written a powerful script and full justice has been done to the script by dbutant director Aamir Khan. I think a lot of research on children's has been done by Aamir Khan and Amol Gupte before making the film which you find rarely in Bollywood film maker's these days.Thank you Aamir Khan Production's Private Limited for producing such a great film and keep going. You guy's really rock.</fullReview>

And i never felt his absence...Darsheel excels and couldn't have been better. Aamir khan, as usually delivers the best. Somehow i felt the kid's father's character could have been moderated a bit but it never impacted the flow and storyline.

		<fullReview>MY REVIEW -After an Average Fanaa,Great RDB i was in a hungry to see next Aamir movie. as we know Aamir do less movies in one year i had to wait almost like 1 and half year to watch his Next Movie called TZP.. being an Die hard Aamir Fan we had that experience since Lagaan days.. I kinda get angry at Aamir sometimes because of his huge releasing gap and doing less movies. But TZP destroy my all minus, angry feelings about Aamir and it made me a PROUD Aamir fan. :) Now i can even wait more 4 years to see an Aamir movie if he makes more Classic movies like TZP.OK some peoples might not believe it but this is my first Aamir movie in a theater ever, and woo-ow what a Great DAY it was. Speaical NOTE - I'm not very good at giving reviews so be patient :) Thanks.STORY -Everyone knows the story it is about Dylexia, and an Art teacher trying to Help a kid who suffering from dyslexia while his parents, rest peoples Trashin him.ABOUT THE MOVIE -What Aamir said in interviews was dam true. "In my opinion it is THE most important film on children to come out of India." Simply it is The Best movie on children in Bollywood ever IMO. it's really change how u look at the children's. If i become a father someday i will try ma best to caring ma kids properly. That's the Meassege what i got from the movie. That's what Aamir, the writer trying to give to peoples. BEST Scenes -# All Scenes between Darsheel ( the kid ) and parents# When Darsheel Start to read the book in the class ( ah-aha everyone in the theater laughed ) # Darsheel's Entry to Boarding School &amp; MAA song.. ( i cried ) # Aamir's Entry, Aamir and Darsheel's First Meet# When mother looking at Darsheel's Art books# The scenes in Taare Zameen par title song ( Amazing )# When Aamir meets Ishaan's parents ( A Classic scene ) # When father comes to meet Aamir at the school &amp; The Conversation between Aamir and father ( BRILLIANT ) # All scenes in Art MELA# The ClimaxActually almost every single scene was too Emotional, Touching simply Amazing. As a Director Aamir have done an Awesome job. he made that Kid act, his camera angels, the way camera moves really great.. Directing and Acting in a movie together isn't that easy thing. Only few peoples in Bolly did that, Few Succeeded. I gotta say Aamir is the BEST Actor Turn director in Bolly. If anyone think i'm being biased please go watch the movie and decide yourself. HATS OFF To Aamir for making an OUTSTANDING Movie like this. MUSIC - Amazing. it suits very well to the movie. MAA, TZP title songs are very touching. Mera Jaahan was very good.. a good energy song. Bum Bole an Great Entertaining song. Khoolo Khoolo is AWESOME. rest were alrightDIRECTING - One WORD TOP NOTCH PERFORMANCES - What can i say about performances ? Almost everyone was PERFECT in it. only the English teacher didn't seems very comfortable when he jokes, but that was nothing.. just nothing.. It is Ture The Movie Belongs to the KID Darsheel. What a Great Talent. HATS OFF To Aamir again for finding such an Amazing talented kid like him. His facial expressions, body language everything was just GREAT. He make u laugh in first 40 minutes and he will make u Cry in Rest. He deserve a Special Award for this Mindblowing performance. He was just brilliant in every single scene. Rate - 5 / 5 Now comes to the ACE Aamir as always he gives his best. When he talks to kid's parents his facial expressions was just PERFECT. i don't have words to describe how good he was. same as the kid make u cry Aamir make u cry whenever he enter..

		<fullReview>Aamir has proved with this movie, what a perfectionist he is. This movies is a classic example of what an "uncompromising movie making" is all about.I walked into the theater with my 8 family members and very high expectations and after three hours, we all were entertained to the very core. In the last scene, all 8 /9 of us were crying, and believe me it was in the sparkle in the eye but it was big tears. About the content, movie has an excellent story line, great performances, fantastic music and neat direction. Only thing which has some room for improvement is the length of the movie. Editing could have been a much better especially the fist 70 % of the movie. There were quiet a few scenes, situations, emotions which are repeated more than twice. But this, does not in any way take away , what this movie has achieved.Not to mention, The subject of the movies is as relevant as anything else.KUDOS TO THE MAKER ON PRODUCING THIS GEM !!!</fullReview>

It is one of those few films that can make a difference in the lives of people.The only irritating performance is that of the child's father else, the overall performance by the main characters is praise worthy.some songs are really slowing down the film. Using animations to evoke a child's feelings has worked out well.Finally, some may shed a tear and some may laugh,but none can ignore the film and its issues.It will be nice of it is included in the curriculum of the schools.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains only minor spoilers, nothing about the plot.I saw this movie in my birthday, December 21st and after coming out I thought,"I couldn't have asked for a better present!" This movie is an epic in all respects. Aamir Khan will definitely get best directorial debut and he will also surely get a nod for best director nomination, but he might lose to a less worthy film due to bias in the industry. I also see Darsheel Safary getting a nomination if not win in the best supporting actor category, even though he was the main protagonist of the film. Aamir doesn't even make his entry until the interval so until then Darsheel carries the entire movie on his little shoulders alone. I won't go into details about the plot you should go see the movie for that.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taare Zameen Par broadens your outlook towards everything!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not everyday that a movie takes you with itself on a journey and lives you in a state of mind, where you don't know whether to appreciate the simple narration that touched your heart or to get thinking on the questions raised in your mind. Come to express what you felt, no words can do any justice to the experience called "Taare Zameen Par". No doubt it was a untold story with great potential. But, we always have great untold stories around us, which are waiting to see the daylight or should I say screen light. What we don't have is people who can venture into these projects and make sure that they build a strong bridge or should I say screenplay, that connects the story and the audience. Thanks to prior attempted bridges devastated by box office cinematic conditions. Aamir not only decided to swim against the tide with this story , but also did a great job as a first time director. Aamir's presence did made sure that audience makes it to the movie hall. But, from that point on it's Amole Gupte's screenplay and Darsheel Safary's performance that holds the movie together. Darsheel Safary plays the central character of the movie "Ishaan", who is a 8 year old boy, who lacks complete interest in studies. The movie starts with the outside world of Ishaan, where no one seems to understand his problem and eventually takes the audience into Ishaan's inside world. Once you are into his world, your ears can hear the silence on his lips and eyes can feel the pain in his tears. But you're not sure how to help him. Yes, I said "help him" because now Ishaan's journey is no more on screen. You are into the journey along with him and that's why you start thinking for him , instead waiting to see what unfolds on screen. The screenplay holds you so tight that you are only and only with Ishaan. Even when the songs come , they flow so smoothly in and out of the movie that you don't bother to tap your foot or think if the music is good or if this song was required. Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy have added lot of feathers to their musical cap, but "Taare Zameen Par" is a precious stone added to their cap. That's how beautiful their work is. Prasoon Joshi's lyrics feel like they are embedded into the script of the movie. They don't stand out as songs. Prasoon has proved his way with words before, but this movie demanded more than writing caliber and he does come out with flying colors. Setu's cinematography perfectly balanced the inner and outer world of Ishaan. The camera work did complete justice to the screenplay, by making sure we see the movie thru Ishaan's eyes. The great film captured on lens got perfect scissors on editing table. Deepa Bhatia's editing was so smooth that you just don't feel the presence of her scissors throughout the narration and that tells me she knows her job too well. Coming to background score, sometimes they are so overwhelming that take over the scene and sometimes they take backseat and softly add to the feel good or feel sad mood of the scene. But here, I seriously don't remember getting any feel for the presence of background score. It was neither in the background nor foreground, it was part of the scene and that too me was quite amazing. Coming to the performances, as I said before Darsheel Safary is a great find and Aamir as always is Aamir. One actor who really surprised me was "Tisca Chopra" , extremely delighted with her portrayal of Ishaan's mom. I think, more than kids this movie is a must see for parents. Back in India, even before the child enjoys the childhood , he is thrown into the competitive world and expected to excel only in academics. Hopefully this movie will bring in some change in the way we look at kids who don't come out with flying colors in their exams. Finally, Aamir's bridge connecting Ishaan and audience totally ROCKS..! and I hope we will walk on more bridges like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Should Not Be Missed By Anyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Taare Zameen Par" means stars on ground and Aamir Khan has proved to be one of those stars capable of projecting a good and decent story on to the screens as well as being a good actor, An eight year old boy, Ishaan, is in a world that seems to be filled with what no one else can understand - not even his teachers at the school that he goes to. They all punish him for the mistakes that he makes and one day, this leads to him missing his school as well as Maths test. Later, on returning home, he informs his elder brother about it and asks him to write a sick note to the teacher. Next day, the note is found after school time and his parents, after meeting the teachers and the headmistress, decide that it is time to send him to a Boarding School.After "Fanna", "Rang De Basanti" and "The Rising - Ballad Of Mangal Pandey," Aamir Khan has come with an excellent story tag: "Every child is special" in this movie and I would not hesitate to agree with him. Not only that, but the child actors can be considered to be the real stars of this movie as well as all the other cast, including Aamir Khan himself, who doesn't appear until almost intermission. Filmed in the hill station area of Panchgini and Mumbai, not all songs are good but one that is worth listening to is the title song it self. Written by Amole Gupte, Aamir khan, in his first Directorial debut, has accomplished something unique in this movie and has gone onto highlight as to what a child, as well as an adult can be suffering from - Dyslexia, which is a Greek word and means "difficulty with words." Not only that but it is varying in severity, from person to person and it can range from difficulties with spelling to severe problems with reading." But people with this problem, sometimes have either normal or above average intelligence but yet perform below that ability in reading and writing than in other tasks such as those of no reading. It is estimated, that here in the UK, 4% of the population is dyslexic and a further 6% suffer from mild to moderate problems related to this. A lot of people may not even know that they have this condition, or, even that their child has it. This is mainly existent in male than in a female and it is genetic and therefore tends to be passed on. Just recently, there was a case, which I had heard about in India, where a woman did not know that her son was suffering from Dyslexia until she did some research when she was informed. Today her son is at a university in the USA. This just shows how many more people there are in the world who may be suffering from this and may not know about it.The child artist, Darsheel Safferey has been nominated for this year's award for "Best Actor" for his role as "Ishaan," while Amir Khan has been nominated for "Best Supporting actor. Darsheel, aged nine, is the first child artist to have been nominated in this category in the history of "Bollywood" and will be against the likes of Shah Rukh "King" Khan (for "Chak De India" and "Om Shanti Om"), Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Kumar.I praise Aamir Khan for making such a movie. There have been other movies relating to children stories but only this one has really been so touchy, it has brought a change to the normal movies that have been released and contain glamour, glitz, catchy tunes and music. This is a movie that is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo Mr. Khan !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is always a hype surrounding an Amir Khan movie. It's not the commonly masala type movie which we are used to seeing featuring the likes of Sharukh Khan or Akshay Kumar. Nor are they overtly stereotyped like movies of Kay Kay Menon or Manoj Bajpai. When it comes to Amir Khan it's all about being in the mean, and it's all about perfectionism. This is his directorial debut, and he duly delivers the goods.He chose the topic of the movie very carefully, combo-ed it with a master script. Add to the fact, he had Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy to o some amazing tunes, and lastly he sought out a cast, which is almost unknown, yet gave a stellar performance. I mean, really, I cannot recall any of the actors apart from Amir Khan from any movie, TV show, etc. And the kid Darsheel, deserves to go into the Hall of Fame. I cannot recall someone giving such a good debut performance ever since Amjad Khan in Sholay, and that's telling something, since there has been loads of brilliant actors since then.The story is relatively simple. There is this boy, who is disinterested in anything that is remotely related to academics. When he fails in third grade, his parents shift him to a boarding school against his wishes. This breaks his mental state and he goes into a shell. But with the help of a new teacher, who convinces his parents that he suffers from a rare state of neural disorder called Dyslexia, he helps him on the path to recovery. In the end all his well, the boy is treated as a rare genius, the teacher becomes his closest confidant.This all appears to be a simple story, but it is culminated to a treat to the eyes with some magnificent direction and some mind boggling acting both on the part of young Darsheel and Amir. Add to that the fact that there was some serious good visual effects, something which is totally absent in all Bollywood movies, and superb music from Shankaar-Ehsaan-Loy. The tracks were brilliant and cleverly used throughout the movie. There's this rebellious track, much similar to Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall", which mirrors the turmoil state of mind of our young friend when he is sent to a boarding school. Also, there's the sad track which tells us about the sense of loneliness, of betrayal, when he is left at the boarding school in his first night.A lot of word has been spoken about Amir Khan's credibility as a director, about his overtly sense of perfectionism. Well, if this is his first test, then he gets flying colors. Apart from a very short sequence in the movie which is animated, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The photography, and the direction is impeccable. And once again I have to say that young Darsheel was fabulous. There are fanatics who are craving to give Deepica Padukone the best dbutante award. I'd say after Taare Zameen Par, "Deepica who ?? Give the award to Darsheel, its a walkaway."I'd like to touch up on another point. This movie was an emotional experience for many. I found many people leaving the theaters with tears in their eyes. I can understand their state of mind. There may be many parents, whose child did not turn up as brilliant as they assumed they would. I also found hordes of children flocking to see this movie. Well, after seeing it, I didn't find any reason to think that this is a movie for children. I mean sure, this movie features a kid, but it isn't for kids, its a film about kids, but not the other way around.A superb experience. 9/10 !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still overwhelmed after the show has long ended. It's has been an enriching roller coaster ride back to my childhood days. The emotions of the child artiste in the movie has left a big impression in me.He is truly amazing to say the least (the real hero of the movie).We all know the movie is all about a child who fails to impress one and all due to a disease (dyslexic) which no one realizes or try to realize. He is packed off to a boarding school to get it right and that's when the world is teared apart for the child. He seems to be betrayed, he goes into a shell till to the point when a new teacher re-discovers his inability and helps him fight back to the main stream of life.Many may think it to be non-entertaining stuff or non-masala but once credit comes up at the end of the movie, they will bite there words as it is both entertains and enriches us. As I said it will be overwhelming experience for one and all.Watch it, it will worth every penny you spend. Thanks Aamir for showing us a sensible, emotional, enriching movie like TZP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bollywood is the eternal caricature of flamboyant glitterati and endless dance sequences to woo audiences with mindless aberrations from the mundane. The greatest achievement of Taare Zameen Par is that this film has effortlessly achieved all of this with just sheer sensitivity.It takes you out of the world of the mundane, only to turn you back to the little nuances that make the mundane so special.A drop of orange, with swirling highlights of red and yellow, another drop, and it grows larger and more enchanting, the spirals of antagonistic colours form a crescendo of light against the white blankness of paper.Its just a drop of paint, a miniscule drop in the subdued night-light,that Ishaan stares at,enraptured into a trance.His eyes glow bright and in that instant you realize that this is what makes this film so special.This film holds forth the enchanting beauty of the world around us, seen best through the eyes of a child.Ishaan is a dyslexic child, but this in no way a film about dyslexia or for that matter any disability.Ishaan is just any other child,the child in all of us.He is naughty, he is arrogant and he is desperately in need of recognition.Like the way he recognizes the beauty in a drop of paint,Ram Nikumbh, his art teacher sees in him his own past,sees in him the potential for greatness.Having gone through the pangs of separation and utter disregard,Ishaan loses this spark and its up to Nikumbh to discover it for him and make him overcome his troubles.The heartfelt emotions of Ishaan moisten the eyes of even the hardiest of viewers.The audience will cry not because this is a sad movie(which it is not),they will do so because the emotions are portrayed with such utter honesty and childlike simplicity. There is no embellishment of the script.This movie is spontaneously slow.All the emotions of Ishaan are polarized in that simple flip-book,where he finds himself slowly shifted out of frame from the picture of his idyllic family.At one point, when made to face his parents,Ishaan runs away, not into the sunset, but hysterically in circles around the school playground, giving vent to all his emotions.The sheer pain in his shining eyes grabs you by the heart.The film is so entirely honest and involving that you don't even realize until Aamir Khan finally turns up,that you have come to see the movie to watch him.All moralist films with a message end up doing so with philosophical contractions and mighty story lines.This film does so by a simple childlike "Yes or No" and no presumptuous "Let me see"'s.No amount of accolades is enough for this film.Be it Aamir's simplicity in direction,his deliberately subdued acting style,Amole Gupte's script,SEL's "different" original score and last but not least the awe-inspiring performance by the "Taare" of the film-Darsheel Safari.Every child is special in an unique way.In an age when parents are churning out "assembly line products" ,"toppers,rankers"... there is little space for those who fall behind-the "duffer"s.This movie simply tells society to stand up and recognize the simplicity in a child and the overwhelming potential each and every child possesses,be it a dyslexic child or otherwise.For all children are truly shining "Taare" in this darkness of "Zameen".It is up to each and every one of us to nurture this star around, and more importantly, within us.</fullReview>

Aamir Khan s acting was brilliant as usual but in the end .

		<fullReview>Being a keen observer of the art of movie making (mostly self observed and learned) I as a student of this genre was eager to see the product coming out of the stable of Aamir Khan ? the Director. His venture as Producer, in Lagaan ? did fetch him accolades worldwide, including the Oscar nomination. So would this next product also be so special? The story is about a 8 year old boy Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) who finds it difficult to concentrate on his studies and finds innocent pleasures in the worldly things around him. This attitude of Ishaan makes him a centre of laugh and taunt that leads to his cranky and odd behavior. His parents decide to send Ishaan to boarding school to improve his studies. Being away from parents Ishaan goes into a shell and looses all interest in everything around him. There enters a drawing teacher Ram Nikubh (Aamir Khan) who recognizes Ishaan's state and takes it on himself to bring back life in the boy's life.Aamir says that he worked with his friend, painter, writer, and Creative Director of the movie Amole Gupte for 3 years to make Taare Jameen Par. Credit to Aamir to take this simple, delicate and difficult subject in the first place and standing ovation for preciously presenting the simplicity of the story in the way it has to be presented. Aamir had with him all the star power and resources to hog the lime-light of the movie, but he renders himself to play a pivotal but side and supporting role. He gives the real burden of the movie on the tender shoulders of Ishaan, uff Darsheel ? a great search by the casting crew. Darsheel carries the movie along with him, and drags us into his world with such an ease that the moments of Ishaan will remain in-grained in our memories forever as twinkling starlights. Kudos to this young and gifted actor! Wow ? what a performance.Similar credit to the master script and screenplay ? which is so strong in its narration, that it required somebody as sensitive as Aamir to produce and direct the movie. The story evolves slowly and sucks us into the movie. The background score and music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is superb. The lyrics by Prasoon Joshi are worth hearing and reciting.I was thinking as a movie maker ? what would I have changed in TJP? I think, I would have surely added 5-7 minutes in the recovery phase of Ishaan with an added sub-plot event. I would had made the teachers less clichd and caricatured. I would have used a little more of long shots for the enormity of the emotional pleasure and loss of childhood.Understanding that Aamir must have made this movie in a shoe string budget ? with mostly unknown or little known cast.This movie may not do great business like other Bollywood commercial movies, but it has its heart in the right place ? where it should be. It gives out a very important message of seeing children and childhood ? with immense treasure and not destroy it in today's cut throat competitive world we live in.My only comment to Aamir is that if he had released the movie in Europe, I would not have had seen a pirated copy of the movie (which I do not mind watching anyways), but I regret not going for big screen experience (that I love) for this wonderful gem of a movie that should be watched by every parent and teacher.(Stars 7.75 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have we ever thought about how easy it would be for a Pied Piper to come and steal all our kids away ? It wouldn't take much, would it ? What do we really offer them, right now ? A life full of discipline and homework, an unyielding drive for progress, bound to timings, curriculum and the ever pervasive rat race ? Even when we do extra-curricular activities, we make it as bad as work - are we on time, are there special classes, how good are they, will they be successful ? When do we really let them just be kids, with their own special time ? Can't we just let them enjoy childhood, before they enter this big bad world of grown-ups and of adult rules ?Such are the thoughts that flit through the mind as you watch this Aamir Khan masterpiece, borne out of a lovely story woven by Amole Gupta and his wife Deepa Bhatia through their work with children over the years. Its about a eight year old kid, Ishaan Awasthi, who finds it difficult to focus on letters or numbers, to catch or throw a ball, to generally do the things we expect children to do. He has failed in the third standard, which is a major source of misery to his middle class parents, whose other son, Yohan, is a topper. The school is now threatening to throw him out since everything points to his failing again. He is a misfit, preferring to live in his world of dreams, finding solace in the company of animals or anything else that catches his fancy. He loves to paint, is good with jig-saws etc but these things of course, will not help you pass the exams. Borne out of frustration, as a kind of punishment, and also with a intent to help him improve through greater discipline, he is put in a boarding school. The discipline, rules and punishments there though, break his spirit instead, making him retreat into his shell. He stops communicating, stops painting, stops talking to his parents. And then a temporary art teacher joins, Ram Shanker Nikumbh, who has his own theories on how to teach children. This is outstanding heart-warming stuff, hats off to Aamir for once again taking on an off- beat topic and bringing it to life in his directorial debut. As he says in his note on the official site, to children and to childhood....And if they dare send another movie to the Oscars, they'll have to deal with me !

		<fullReview>Bollywood has felt the need for Child Themed movies as much as the fish needs the bicycle. Considering that, this movie comes as a fresh change, something that every movie lover could love forward to. Aamir Khan is his usual brilliant self but it is Darsheel Safary, the kid that steals the show all the way.Taare Zameen Par is a movie every young couple should watch -- Its a movie every parent with a teenage child must watch. Its a beautiful movie because it shows us how parents, with all the good intentions in their hearts, can still go wrong.The reason why I did not give this a "9" is because I thought the parents role could have been a little more defining. Since for most of the first half, the family of the child plays a role of importance, one hoped that they could carry some of it, if not all, to the second half as well. But overall, by the second half, the story has a good foundation and the protagonist of the movie takes it off from there. The songs are well sequenced and not "just put there". This has been an area that Bollywood has really improved over the last few years.Aamir Khan impresses with his behind the screen antics and considering that he directed himself and a nine year old kid while working on a very sensitive subject that must have involved a lot of background research -- all for the first time, I think he has done a brilliant job. I will not take away one thing from this man, who for all his brilliance, has often been misunderstood in the industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Taare Zameen Par" is impressive and emotional movie from "Aamir Khan" &amp; his team. It was creative, beautiful, and intelligent. This film is about childhood, dreams, love, about the joy of small things.This is film that will make you cry,make you laugh and make you love every moment of it. "Taare Zameen Par" is a movie about the lives of children and their parents' expectations. In this movie, a eight- year old child Ishaan wants to live in a world full of happiness and dreams that no one else seems to appreciate. Nowadays, adults are much more interested in competition in academics, sports etc. Ishan, however is least interested.He does not seem to get anything right and has failed twice in third class itself. When his parents consider that he is now getting out of control, he is admitted to a Bording School where he would learn to be disciplined. But, this however makes the situation, even worse.One day, a new art teacher Nikumbh is recruited who inspires the students and fills them with joy and optimism. He tries to change the rules of school and helps the students by learning them to think, dream and imagine. Nikumbh soon realizes that Ishaan is not comfortable. He meets Ishaan and believes that he has a solution that can change his life. He sets out to discover the reason behind the condition of Ishan . With time, patience and care, he ultimately helps Ishaan to find himself.This movie has done an excellent job for all those who are creative but not good in academics and other conventional fields. "Taare Zameen Par" -is the most beautiful movie that I have ever seen. It is a film about love, childhood, dreams, emotions, creativity and enjoying life.This movie is about the reality of parents' expectation. This movie really hits you in the heart. Most Parents, especially in India, want to make his/her child to either a doctor or an engineer. According to them, this is what a child's' life is all about. It delivers a great message and has opened eyes of millions of parents around the world. Aamir Khan does an amazing job as the teacher. He is truly a great actor. Also, a nice performance by the eight year old would make you fall in love with him. He turns out to be such an amazing actor that one feels the same emotion that the character, the child feels.</fullReview>

It engages with sensitive issues and is very touching. I loved the visual style of the film-I thought it was really creative and perfectly portrayed the mindset of the dyslexic protagonist Ishaan. But I didn't like all of the song numbers. I found them cheesy and unengaging. They hurt the viewing experience of the film for me, which is a shame, as otherwise I really did enjoy Stars on Earth.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/Coqped</fullReview>

They won't address to everyone as they might sound a little bit weird but i think they are perfectly created.

		<fullReview>First off, Aamir Khan deserves credit for trying to shed light on what I'm sure is a problem in India. As it was when I saw 3 Idiots and had to take the movie's word for it about the problems with suicides, I had to also take it that in this case, Like Stars on Earth, there's no real perception from teachers about dyslexia and other cognitive disorders (the young boy in this story, Ishaan, played by Safary, is this kid, and I have to wonder if he also had un-diagnosed ADD and/or aspergers, the latter being more about social awkwardness which Ishaan also is). In the United States its something that gets tackled when kids are very young in schools - and, of course, even in the lamest public schools there's a guidance counselor of some sort, which seems to be a deficiency in the schools depicted here - so I can understand why it would be something to shine a light on. And, as a first time director, Khan is very good at drawing out (mostly) strong performances from his actors, even if they only have a few minutes of screen time.I know you're waiting for the 'but' with all this (hence why it's a 6/10 and not higher, as I was hoping for), however I'll give some praise before I get to that. The first hour or so of this movie is actually quite compelling; there's only one or maybe two musical sequences, though they don't really POP out the way that other Bollywood movies seem to (there's one sequence, where we follow Ishaan as he wanders the city in a daze as he cuts classes, unsure what to do with himself, and it is actually very interesting just in the little details of what he comes across are striking). There's melodrama, but it unfolds as a character study first and foremost.It's a simple enough set-up, and I think the idea is that many in the audience could or will be able to actually identify with Ishaan: he's the day-dreamer, staring out the window in class, and not necessarily always fitting in with what's expected. He doesn't have what US kids might have like, say, Ritalin or other drugs to pump up for attention. His imagination is much freer than that, and the child actor playing him is a joy to watch, whether he's being cheeky or angry or glaring or really having to pull out the water-works, which is what happens especially when he is sent off by his (to say the least) uptight father to boarding school.Where the movie kind of gets into being not as strong is ironically with the (first time) director and other star: Aamir Khan. He is wonderful as far as the writing lets him be, which is kind of like as the perfect, super-open-minded type of teacher and bursts into the film almost like some wild and crazy clown for his students. It's also the one truly obnoxious Bollywood-musical type of number, though made somewhat interesting by Ishaan being quiet/depressed at his desk. It's from here that Like Stars on Earth hits its message home like a sledgehammer - which is frustrating since Khan is still delivering very well as an actor, and it's kind of heartwarming to see a kid really start to learn and grow (which is not unexpected, you can see the plot a mile away).But there's a lot of moralizing and preaching in the second half that, while always with the best of intentions, drowns out some of the stronger, simpler drama that was unfolding in the first hour/sort of the first half of the movie, where we also got to see more variety in Safary's performance. After a certain point he just becomes a sobbing/catatonic mess, or a cheerful-happy sort of guy, and worst is his father who is so one-note until he grows one other note and sticks with that (the Parent-Who-Won't-Understand-Until-It's-Jammed-Down-His-Throat clich, which exists I'm sure).Some of the music varies between tolerable (the guitar stuff as the giant, climactic painting event at the school is decent) and not so tolerable (you'll know it when you hear it). And lastly, I thought the reveal of Ishaan being a genius painter came slightly out of nowhere; we see a flip-book at one point, but not much else. It would be one thing if Khan showed the kid painting and no one recognizing it, but the first half is so front-loaded with the pain of not-recognizing letters and numbers that the art element comes as a surprise come midway through the movie.I wrestled with what I would give the movie, and in a way I give it a very slight recommendation, and if you know you love "feel-good" movies that ultimately deliver a strong, heart-felt message, have at it. But it's too long by at least half an hour/45 minutes for my own taste (and I know I might not "get" Bollywood, but this wasn't really as wild and crazy as a lot of them so the length wasn't as justified for the excessive musical numbers and so on), and there's wasted potential with what is deep down a very powerful message about education and understanding disabilities in a rational way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, my debut in Bollywood couldn't have been more auspicious: I met Ishan, a very lovable young boy whose inner world we learn to know and appreciate within the extension of the movie. And what can I say about that art teacher that we all wanted to have? A marvelous character, overflowing with love as we can see. Besides these great characters, there's a super enjoyable soundtrack, with songs whose lyrics are perfect for the moment depicted in screen. More than one will defy you not to spill a tear.This film offers also a beautiful message of empathy, of seeing the other person's point of view, his perspective of things, his hardships and flaws, so we can understand his behavior and failures.Each one of us is talented in a very different way, so the same treatment to us all sometimes simply don't work. That's a reflection of my own I owe to this delightful movie, this rare jewel named TAARE ZAMEEN PAR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two years before Aamir Khan starred the masterpiece "Three Idiots" , he produced, directed and starred this other masterpiece that as "Three Idiots" covered the topic of education but in a deeper and touching way telling the story of Ishaan, a dyslexic eight year old kid, who his teachers and family are unable to understand until he meets a new teacher ( Aamir Khan) who will help him with his dyslexia problem and also will help him to develop his talented skills for painting...The film is simply perfect, it has some musical moments and just one musical number but is AWESOME and fits perfectly with the film, the kid who plays the leading role is fantastic and Aamir Khan is brilliant as always... The movie is almost three hours long but time passes so fast while watching it that you don't even notice...the touching story contains a very deep inner message , tells that education is not indoctrination and every child is special in its own way...Is sad to see how our educational system don't find for efficiency over results and leave out to those students who in some way don't blindly follow the established norms....Aamir Khan was the man who made me feel interested and love the Hindi cinema when I first watched "Three idiots" and this film just made me admire him even more...He is an awesome artist...BRILLIANT, MASTERPIECE, GREAT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taare zameen par is a story about a child played by Darsheel Safari who suffers from dyslexia. As a result of which he is unable to cope with daily life, during his early childhood. Improvement in his life is made by teacher played by aamir khan, who explains the problem to darsheel's parents and gradually puts in efforts himself to improve life of that poor child.Story is very emotional. Everybody associated with the movie has done a terrific job. Hats off to aamir khan for his direction and acting.. executing perfection as always. Darsheel is tremendous.. he shines because of the direction given to him.The story conveys message that we are humans meant to live like humans and not some bred animals. Every human being is different, grows at his own pace. To force someone into this competitive world to live upto others expectation is wrong. everybody deserves a proper environment as per his own needs and its duty of guardians to provide them something nearing that if not something which can be called as perfection.Yes I strongly recommend this film to everyone! rating: 9.5/10</fullReview>

Almost every one's heart istouch by this movie.In This movie the main character is ISSAN AWASTI. He is a eight year old boy, who is struggling with his studies. But he is good at painting. Due to study problems his father decided to send him to a boarding school. As he is already struggling with studies so in school he feels very lonely and also then he stopped painting. In school he has gone bad to very bad condition. The reason that he is not good at studies is that he has a disease called 'Dyslexia' so he can't recognize the words in properly.The eight year old Darsheel Safary who is playing the character of Isshan is able to present the character excellently through perfect delivery of dialog, body language, expression and etc. The directors Aamir Khan, Amole Gupte, Ram Madhvani have putted scenes in very logic way. The work of all the casts is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Like Stars on Earth" is a drama movie in which we watch a kid who has a trouble on learning and reading and his parents think that he is lazy and a troublemaker. So they put him in a different kind of school, a school for different children. There his new teachers have the same opinion about him as his parents except one teacher. This teacher is teaching art and from the first time he understood many things about this kid and he thinks that he is a special kid and not lazy or troublemaker.I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found just magnificent. I also liked the direction which made by Aamir Khan and Amole Gupte. About the interpretation I have to mention the interpretation of Aamir Khan who played as Ram Shankar Nikumbh and he was simply outstanding for one more time. I also believe that this interpretation of him in this movie is one of his best. I also liked the interpretation of Darsheel Safary who played as Ishaan Awasthi. One other interpretation that I liked was Vipin Sharma's who played as Nandkishore Awasthi and I believe that his interpretation is very important in this movie.Finally I believe that "Like Stars on Earth" is a great movie to watch and everyone has to watch it because you can take many things from this movie. I strongly recommend it and I believe that is a must see movie because it learns you many things and makes you understand even more for the relationships between family but also the importance of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Overview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par, translated to "Like Stars on Earth," tells the story, in India, of an eight- year-old boy named Ishan Awasthi, played by Darsheel Safary, who battles dyslexia. Ishan is seen as a troubled child that is lazy and misbehaves in school; however, no one realizes these problems stem from his dyslexia. In school, teachers fail him repeatedly because they claim he is "dumb" and "stupid" for not being able to complete remedial tasks that his remaining classmates have no trouble doing, including writing simple words like "dog," and "pig ." The teachers are trained to discipline the students until satisfactory results are achieved, but this method does not work with Ishan. The teachers do not realize that Ishan cannot understand the material because of the wiring in his brain and not because of a negative attitude. Nandkishore Awasthi (played by Vipin Sharma), Ishan's father, comes down on Ishan the hardest because he wants Ishan to be like his older brother, Yohaan (played by Sachet Engineer) who is much more successful academically. Nandkishore repeatedly states that Ishan will not be able to compete in the real world if he does not start doing well in school. After Nandkishore's last straw has been reached, he sends Ishan to a boarding school to improve his grades. Ishan meets his influential art teacher, Shankar Nikumbh, (played by Aamir Khan) at the boarding school. Nikumbh, as he is referred to in the movie, previously taught at a school for mentally handicapped children and realizes Ishan is dyslexic. Nikumbh also discovers Ishan's talent of painting which acts as a release for Ishan from the everyday struggles he encounters because of his dyslexia. In the end, Ishan learns to deal with his dyslexia, with the help of Nikumbh, and greatly improves in his academics. Equally as important, Nandkishore learns the error of his ways in not supporting his son though his difficulties and promises to strive to be a more encouraging father.</fullReview>

It made me have faith in humanity and see how just a little understanding can go a long way. I got very emotional watching the performances in the film. The cast was awesome. I wanted to go into the film and place my arms around Ishaan and give him a big hug. The world would be a better place if people took the time to watch this film and apply it to life. I know that I try to every day. The beauty of this film is in its simple yet powerful story and how well it is directed and acted out for you to enjoy. Highly recommend.

		<fullReview>One of the best amir khan's movie so far. he really did a good job to direct and write a movie. in my opinion, he still the best director in India since now and no other Indian director can reach his level for one future decade.besides khan's hard work to made this movie. still, this movie not good enough to compete against classic masterpiece of European/American movies. but it reach a standard to be a entertaining and sentimentalist yet with moral lessons. first thing first i want to explain whats good and bad from this movie.the movie's first scene is really good and beautiful. a fish-pond shot and ishaan solo performance in the beginning really convincing and sentimentalist. even in the first scene, this movie already guide the viewers to be shaken. a story centered to ishaan as a lead role which performed good. safary's characterization is good, but he was not good enough to perform a "very hard character" role inside ishaan. he cant carry a dark and lonely character but he did well the humor. some scenes were not needed which can be shorten the movie duration or exact to the main plot. as far as i know, amir khan was a director whose likely to continuously repeat to manipulate the viewers with sentimental scenes or photography like what he did in 3 idiots. if thats for people whose movie amateur or movie-goers or bollywod lovers or drama-genre lovers, it will works to do the repeating sentimental shot. but as movie experts who already watch so many legendary and classic movies which have a powerful and strong plot (no need a mainstream sentimental scene) it will not works. and some musical scene were not needed in certain scenes, when the scene already drive deeper, adding a musical will just break the temper and concentration. also the music was too long, with no great movement by amirkhan's dance, its just a repeating movement and the hilarious impact was just small. but some shot also good, like when the camera shot the entire classroom dancing, the students and nikumbh, it brings a hilarious impact to the viewers.besides my bad opinion, this movie still have a good decoration setting, the story is rich, good moral impact, and good leading and supporting performance. but by only an average director this movie suffering. with more darker leading role, shorter duration, more serious and darker setting and script, and drama specialist director this movie can reach 85-89 rating and considered as one of the best. but in its current condition, maybe only reach 66-72 no more.i recommend this movie for a bollywod movie lovers. this movie have no age criteria, entertaining to all ages. good for wasting your weekend time with friends or couple. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding production!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was told about this movie about two years ago and have only just managed to get it from my local video shop. It is an outstanding movie! It completely blew me away. Darsheel Safary's performance was magnificent! His portrayal of the emotions of the Dyslexic Ishaan struggling with life, his family's despair, and an unprepared and therefore unsympathetic education system was perfect! I should know as I have been there. I have experienced the same at school and reacted in the same way. I have a son who although does not have Dyslexia, has Attention Deficit Disorder (as I have) and his responses to conflict and beauty was a mirror image as portrayed by Ishaan played by actor Darsheel Safary. The devastatingly sensitive portrayal of Ishaan's reactions to the variety of situations he had to contend with and the very insightful descriptions on what was going on in his head, made me weep in a way I have never done at any movie. Ishaan's facial expressions and body movements took me right back to the time when my boy was that age.Aamir Khan was perfect in his role as the sensitive and concerned teacher. One really felt his involvement in the boy's struggle - his clear portrayal of the teacher's awareness of Ishaan's disturbing state of mind was moving and real. He really got it! I am of course referring to the actor Aamir Khan's keen insight into the condition. Hat's off as well to the writer Amole Gupta to come up with such truisms on what goes on in the mind of a child struggling with a cognitive impairment and how he or she comes across to the unaware - slow minded, stupid, stubborn and deliberately difficult! Darsheel was the mirror image of my boy and I used to despair and worry so much for him. This is a tear jerker yes, (as one commentator has remarked), but it is not in the least bit far-fetched. It is a crying reality. What a child with an undiscovered cognitive impairment can go through when there is no support is just that, and in many cases worse. It was no exaggeration to suggest that at one stage Ishaan was so depressed that he was contemplating suicide. This happens ? nothing could be closer to the truth ? painfully we witness the depths of Ishaan's depression brought on by his feelings of utter hopelessness and heart wrenching despair at being what he understood to be, abandoned by his parents. He was put into in an environment that was constantly tough on his senses and made him feel less than inadequate ? all this, coupled by feelings of utter loneliness and a sensation of permanent alienation is enough to drive even an adult to contemplate suicide. Well done Darsheel! Your acting was spot on! An amazing performance! I have to also comment that this film would not have stood out so much, if the performance of the rest of the cast had not been so strong. Sachet Engineer, Tisca Chopra and Vipin Sharma as a family unit you were again spot on! Excellent work! This happens, and not every child is fortunate to have supportive parents ? my parents were, and I tried to be, but we did not have the good fortune to come across a teacher like Ram Shanker Nikumbh. Roles played by the teachers ? what can I say? Excellent performance. I went to school in India, my teachers would say "she can do the work, she is very intelligent but she is lazy!" My son went to school in Australia and I was constantly hauled up in his primary years for his disobedience and cheek. Not one teacher picked out the problem in both our cases. Despite everything my son actually accomplished a Masters in Environmental Engineering in Japanese and yet no teacher ever picked up his handicap. Like Ishaan he is artistic (often the case with cognitive impairment conditions) in music, art and acting. I was always bottom of the class and even failed in one of my school years but I still managed to finish school and university ? it happens. We were the lucky ones, all thanks to having supportive parents. Thanks Aamir for putting out such a fabulous film! A must see for every child, parent and teacher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An eight year old boy is thought to be lazy and a troublemaker, until the new art teacher has the patience and compassion to discover the real problem behind his struggles in school.Since this film's debut in 2007, up through today (2015), it has consistently remained on the IMDb Top 250 list. Now, there are a great number of questionable things about the list -- films that did not make the cut and ones that did. This is one of those that makes the list, but the reason why is unclear.As far as Bollywood goes, this is probably the best they have to offer. Decent budget, good songs. But it is still rather weak, with a plot that hardly seems to try. Sure, the kid is dyslexic. And the father calls him an idiot (repeatedly). And then the teacher swoops in... there needs to be something more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so wonderful, so beautiful, and so important. What a masterpiece and rare jewel among the usual crap we get served from Hollywood. After '3 Idiots' this is the second Bollywood movie I've seen, and if Indian cinema proceeds in this way then Hollywood's days are numbered. Not only is the movie superbly done, very creative, and with an outstanding main actor, but the depth of the plot, the importance of the subject makes it stand out like a lighthouse. Finally a director who dares to pick up a truly important topic almost everybody can identify with. In a time where babies have to watch Baby Einstein, unborn are 'treated' with classical music, parents tow their toddlers to psychologists for IQ testing, etc., the message of the movie is most refreshing. I'm dyslexic, my daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia, and my son also shows strong signs of dyslexia. Living in Europe, fortunately dyslexia today is no big deal anymore. Teachers usually recognize dyslexic children pretty fast and act appropriately. But in my generation it was as unknown as it is portrayed in the movie. Out of my experience I can very much identify with the boy, as teachers and parents never stopped telling me how lazy and dumb I was because I had trouble with handwriting and spelling, and made tons of stupid mistakes in math tests. Today I hold a PhD, but the demons from my childhood have never disappeared. My innate believe, despite all achievements, is still that I'm lazy and stupid, and that shows how important it is that we support and love our children no matter what.Bravo for an excellent and important movie. I can't wait to see how Indian cinema will further evolve. Taare Zameen Par has not only sparked a fountain of stars on IMDb, but it will hopefully also spark a fountain of more Indian star directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Taare Zameen Par is about an eight - year - old child Ishaan Awasti who performs poorly in academics due to dyslexia (a mental disorder) and fails in the third standard in school. In contrast to that , his elder brother is brilliant in academics. It is a wonderful movie that appeals to people from every age group of the society. One of the main reasons behind this is that the person who is watching the movie can relate the incidents happening in the movie with his real life. It has a lot of resemblance with the Indian society. Aamir Khan, the director of the film, plays the role of Ishaan's art teacher. The way he brings about a transformation in Ishaan is truly heart - touching . On the first day, the teacher introduces unconventional teaching methods to which all the students respond with great enthusiasm, except Ishaan. As a director, Aamir deserves a lot of praise for bringing out an awesome performance from the child and handling the plot with remarkable sensitivity. Darsheel Safary plays the role of the central character of Ishaan Awasti. He has realized the character of Ishaan very well. The story is simple and connects immediately with every child and adult in the auditorium. It has a profound emotional impact on the audience . However, it is hard to believe that the child was performing so badly in academics and still his parents could not discover the actual reason behind it. The cinematography is excellent. All emotion s have been captured by the camera very well. The music by Shankar - Ehsaan - Loy is also very soothing. T he story clearly brings out the thought process going on in the mind of a kid, his interests, his strengths and his weaknesses. The movie not only entertains us but also enlighten s us to the plight of dyslexic people . It is a must - watch for parents, teachers and students alike .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par, reissued as Like Stars on Earth for Disney's international DVD, is a 2007 Indian drama film directed by Aamir Khan. The film explores the life and imagination of eight-year-old Ishaan (Darsheel Safary). Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a boarding school. Ishaan's new art teacher (Aamir Khan) suspects that he is dyslexic, and helps him to overcome his disability. Towards the end of the school year Nikumbh organizes an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan is getting into the car to leave with his parents, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh. The film ends with a freeze frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Stars on Earth (2007) which has its Hindi version "Tare Zameen Par" is a inspiring and fabulous Movie for Bollywood. Darsheel Safary who play Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi's role in movie and prove that he is king in child artist and of-course Aamir khan (As a art teacher ) also acting fantastic.The film Shows the life and imagination of eight-year-old Ishaan (Darsheel Safary). Taare Zameen Par is one film that makes you peep into a child's mind and how some parents, in their pursuit to make them 'stronger' academically, forget that there's hitherto untapped talent that needs to be nourished and encouraged. This is a super blockbuster Movie, You must watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, This is a bollywood movie that's thought provoking. Even though this is yet another movie of an underdog who finally is able surprise all others; this movie is a bit different. This talks of a real world issue that prevails in 1% to 33% of the population. This movie also portrays the extend of child labor homelessness in India quite brilliantly. There are parts in the movie that will definitely trigger a tear in your eyes. Especially the last scene. I hate the way songs are incorporated in most of the bollywood movies. This movie is an exception. Especially the song means "you know everything, mom". It truly is an incredible movie to watch. In a world of cutthroat competition people usually forget who they are, and even more frighteningly forget what their kid is capable of and his limits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed, children are stars on earth and yes, every child is special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, children are stars on earth and yes, every child is special.Aamir Khan is a good man and he proved it again by taking up this project and anchoring this till it reaches its viewers. To perceive the story of a child, make the child as a protagonist and then only appear in the second half of the film although being a mainstream commercial actor should have been very tough for Aamir Khan. But considering that he is a sensitive human and a great actor who puts the script above the actors, perhaps he put in the form it is today. The writer-lyricist Amole Gupte who produced a wonderful script with fine nuances of children put in there. Their emotions, their childishness, their mischief and even their stubbornness are stupendously written in this script. It is near flawless in terms of emotional quotient and makes me weep whenever I see this. Kudos to Amole Gupte for giving us a memorable film. Barring one scene where Aamir as Nikumbh (the painting teacher) preaches the parents of Ishaan (Darsheel Safary), about running for marks and forgetting the essence of childhood, the rest of the script was mellifluous.There is a touch of melancholy in Ishaan's life but that's genuine and is not overboard. There is a joy of accomplishment at the end and makes me as viewer very happy and triumphant. I was enjoying the win of Ishaan, that's how this film moved me and it continues to do so even after 6 years of release. Music is a special thing for this film. From the title song to the Bheja Kum number on teachers, everything is in place. Perhaps, Bum Bum Bole, the song of Aamir Khan might have been the only hindrance, but even that has wonderful lyrics asking many questions so that's also beautiful and falls in place. My favorite though is "Mera Jahaan" where Ishaan explores the world outside and is wondered by the incidents. Editing is good and so is the cinematography. The camera does its job adequately by showing us the required emotions in the right way. Neither too many close ups nor too many long shots. The shots are composed well. There are a few subplots which add emotions too, they seem to be sensitive and bring some good tears. Like Nikumbh (Aamir) teaching the under privileged children and making an even for those children. This is definitely a feel good film, where by the end, I felt really very good and was happy enjoying the fact that a child who was having a psychic problem could overcome that by sheer hard work and by the right guidance. this is a testimony in Indian Cinema of how good a message can be told without ever being preachy. If done the right way, we can go many miles in reach and scope. This is a film that I hope every parent a child will see all over the globe and hopefully they connect with it.A 5/5 for one my favorite films. I loved it, because I connected with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aamir Khan's great directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Taare Zameen par' hits the screen with lot of hype and expectations around it. Frankly, it supersedes them and stands out as one of the best ever made bollywood films of recent times. A movie about a child with Dyslexia is a new concept and the treatment that 'Director' Aamir Khan gives to it wonderful. Aamir, the long celebrated 'Perfectionist' of Bollywood, does stand up to the expectations as a Director ? Actor and a producer. The movie starts with the child Ishaan (Darsheel Safary), and slowly educates the audience with the problems faced by him. It is not revealed at this stage to the audience about Dyslexia. When packed off to a boarding school and the child's metamorphosis into an introvert from being an active kid, and the subsequent entry of the 'Temporary' art teacher in Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) is where the real problem of Dyslexia is revealed in good detail, with examples that sounds like the 'Who's Who List'. The rest of the movie is about the teachers efforts in making the child, his parents and the school faculty on how to deal with the kid.First, kudos and praises for Aamir Khan, to have directed a masterpiece in his debut as a director. The actor Aamir too has every reason to smile for his splendid yet non-overshadowing portrayal of the teacher's character. The child artiste Darsheel Safary is the real hero of the film, rightly depicted in the title credits with his name appearing before that of aamir. Darsheel does act naturally with all the innocence of an 8-9 year old.The movie is captured in a very poetic way. The photography, the music by the very talented trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, the story flow, everything is so poetic that it feels like traveling with a small kid with his own problems and a 'Pied Piper' to help him out. The music and the songs have also boldly created for the script and not for the audio sales. The title track 'Taare Zameen Par' and the tearful 'Maa', both rendered by Shankar Mahadevan do stand out.Actors other than Darsheel and Aamir, to have been true to their roles, be it the mother or the always supporting elder brother, the characterization seems so non-bollywoodish. This is also one of the plus points to this film; being natural and realistic without the 'Drama' feeling.As many have said, there are lots of scenes from the film that remains with you even when out of the cinema. Like, the 'Ishaan's Day out in the city alone' scene, 'Don't send me to boarding, mein sab kuch seekhoonga' scene, 'Aamir explaining Ishaan's problem to his parents' scene and the final 'Revealing of the two paintings' scene. It was an emotional journey into the life of a kid with Dyslexia. Personally, this movie seems like the next best one after Anjali by Mani Ratnam. The movie goes with a tagline 'Every Child is Special'; so is this movie. A MUST WATCH FOR ALL, NO AGE BAR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ghost (director) has been resurrected in human flesh and yes, Mr Perfectionist has got it all perfect. His maiden directorial venture is a delight for one and all. Whether you are a kid, or a teenager, just married, or if you are a parent -- Yes... You'll love it! Pre-release in what appeared to be a non mainstream film, shines like a UNIVERSAL film which will keep the box office abuzz.The story moves along at a very natural pace at which the viewer is able to connect to the 8 year old dyslexic boy played by Darsheel Safary. That is the biggest plus point of the movie, the viewer draws parallel with the boys character connecting with him at a very high emotional level. You'll reminisce and be transported back to those wonderful years of your childhood and will have more than a tear in the eye. The scene where the boy is admitted in the boarding school and bidding goodbye to his parents and brother followed by the 'Maa' song is a real tear jerker. But tears is not all what you are going to have, the screenplay makes sure that those tear jerking moments are followed by heavy doses of laughter with some lovely and innocent humorous moments.If you thought that only Sanjay Leela Bhansali knew how to capture art on celluloid then watch TZP. The boy's bunked day at school, his room, classroom decor, and the painting competition in the end are a colorful visual delight expressing a million words to the viewers.Yes, its true. Aamir's character appears just before the end of the first half, but one is so engrossed that Aamir - The actor's absence is not felt. Thats remarkable! All the credit goes to the protagonist played by Darsheel who in my books gives the best performance till date by a child artist in Hindi Cinema. He is the heart and soul of the movie and how naturally this boy handles scenes of intense emotions with such ease in his first movie is stunning. Tisca Chopra as the boy's mother gives a top notch performance at par, if not above the likes of roles played by Nirupa Roy, Rakhi and Kirron Kher.Aamir the actor has a shorter but powerful role which he performs decently. But at the end of the day its Aamir - The Director who wins hands down by extracting 'A GRADE' performances from all the cast, and making a movie which connects to the heart of the viewer. The second half becomes a little slow in between and it could have been more crisp. But thats negligible because in the end the movie manages convincingly to convey a very important message to today's parents - Your kids are not race horses of a derby. Let them travel life at their pace as each has their unique mission which only they can fulfill.Lastly, TZP just made 2007 better and interesting. The award season is knocking and well, watch out, TZP may just pull off a surprise or two by upsetting the favorites so far...</fullReview>

AAMIR created this film with one purpose kept firmly in mind: to raise awareness about dyslexia. (great film, it speaks out to anyone with Dyslexic disorders. and is a relatable story to anyone. definitely an award worthy film.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a Hindi film and its actor is Amir Khan. Like the other films of Amir Khan, this film is very creative and imaginative. This film tells us relationship between a teacher and a student. Actually this movie is related with special children. Film is about a 8 years old dyslexic child Ishann. He finds it difficult to read or write correctly. His parents and teachers unable to realize his disorder. And his family sends him to a boarding school. And Amir Khan is the temporary art teacher who encourages him to extend his boundaries of opinions and imaginations.He shows special interest in finding out the difficult of Ishann.We can see the importance of teachers in our life. To sum up, this movie will make you cry and simultaneously make you laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last half an hour were the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing innumerable praises for this movie and a dozen of awards, I felt that I had to watch this movie at least once. My thoughts on this movie are very uneven and contrasting as I felt that if there was no Aamir Khan in it, it would have failed at the box office and also at the 'critic's office'.The thing that lacked in the first half was emotions. Most of the acting seemed superficial and dull. I kept shifting on my couch, singing songs to myself like a hysterical being and was indulging in other activities as the movie didn't get to me at that time.I felt that the first have could have been much stronger and more firm in its approach towards the boy's woes. Tisca exceeds a concerned yet clueless mother who doesn't exactly cope up with her son's problems. I felt that there was a boy who acted better than Darsheel, and that was his elder brother who was very supportive in the movie and did a really good job. Ishan's father does a fine job in the latter half where there are some moving scenes. Darsheel's acting is good and award worthy but I felt that there were better child actors than him, for example,, the girl in Makdee or Malcolm from Sixth Sense. Yet, he improves in the latter half of the movie where he actually comprehends with his character and makes it look real.In the first half, I was not much interested when they showed him tormented by his teachers and parents because I get they didn't get the right grip to make the movie more powerful. Aamir Khan too delivers and his debut direction is applaud worthy. There were some plot holes such as Darsheel already in third grade and how he managed to reach it but yet its a feel good film. I do not think that it would win an Oscar though because it just doesn't click during the first hour.I'm going to go with a seven out of ten for this movie. Watch it for the latter half which is filled with emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting great things from this movie, since it is an Aamir Khan production after all, and he has never let us down. Well, all I can say is that I got much more than I expected.Darsheel Safaray is brilliant as the child; he excels in a role every child would struggle to handle, and this is the best performance from a child artist I've ever seen, that too by a long way. What can I say about Aamir Khan? His performance is near perfect as the teacher, and the strange thing is that he's only in half of the movie yet still makes an impact. He truly is a genius.The film's message is universal. Of course, all of us already know what children are like, but not all of us are aware of the factors that influence how children think, and we definitely don't know what is going through their minds all the time. This film explores how children think, and looks at the attitudes of adults towards children. The cinematography is wonderful, and the direction by Aamir Khan is superb. Kudos to the screenplay writers for giving us such a wonderful and touching film.The music is wonderful, and the songs do actually help the story along.Finally like to emphasise that this film is not just for kids, and that everyone should watch it. Verdict: unmissable - one of the finest movies ever made. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What your getting into: A young boy who just can't seem to be excel in school is constantly pressed by his parents who think he is just being naughty or lazy. Just when i thought my 3 idiots would never budge as my Bollywood showcase a film much deeper appeared. The film itself altered my perception of Bollywood films, about things just being different, and needing more time(a sort of theme in the movie). Aamir Khan is wonderful, just like in 3 idiots, the child performances are also among the best I've seen in awhile. Films like this make me feel as though even countries that have become heavily americanized in their structure, still have a lot of heart, and realize that being competitive isn't what it's really about... though i could be just looking at the tree and not the whole forest. Although there are moments when the movie moves to song and singing(ala Disney), unlike other Bollywood movies, th majority of the time the singing/dancing is NOT done by the actors. I thought the songs matched the rhythm of the movie perfectly, and actually contributed to the wonderful atmosphere. I give this movie a 9, only because it might lack some more advanced cinematographic techniques, and the directing is probably nothing spectacular. Though i do recommend it to anyone, it is a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off the bat, let me say that I'm really really really not a fan of Bollywood or Indian cinema. But when I watched this movie, I was very pleasantly surprised. It wasn't a clichd plot, and the movie never got cheesy. This movie is an emotional roller coaster, and I'm normally quite stone faced when I watch a movie. Fantastic. One complaint I do have; however, is Aamir Khan's entrance into the movie. It's kind of a blatant ripoff of "Dead Poets Society," but if you treat it as a reference or homage, you don't get put off. Absolutely great, not for kids. Early teens and upwards.</fullReview>

Like any other kid,Ishaan faces the same pressure -Study Well,Score More by everyone.But Ishaan lives in a different world of his own,which no one seems to Understand.Till Aamir Khan comes to the movie.. The first part of the movie is somewhat boring according to me.The second part is MINDBLOWING and I mean it.Aamir Khan as usual is excellent...Darsheel Safary is amazing.and the other cast have given a wonderful performance.Climax is noteworthy and really touches your heart.Teachers and students-Watch this movie,it is mandatory.Aamir Khan excellently captures today's education scenario in India(especially).The message of the movie is pretty simple-Allow students to follow their dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are very few movies which has made me cry. In fact in the last one decade, only 2 movies have made me really cry. One was lage raho munnabhai and the second one was taare zameen par. It is a simple story of a dyslexia and how Aamir Khan helps the child overcome this problem. But the execution and screen play was what enhanced this normal movie into a brilliant one. The climax sequence (The painting competition) is so touching that hardly anyone was left with dry eyes. The star was Darsheel Safary who portrayed the character very well. Aamir Khan was competent in his portrayal of the teacher's role but his contribution towards directing this movie excellently cannot be missed.

		<fullReview>Aamir magic works again and this time his directorial debut excels all his previous work. This is a not any ordinary love story or sports flick or villains-killing action movie and bollywood proves from time to time that it can think out of the box to give movies like TZP. The story revolves around one kid whose mind is filled with colors, characters and objects. But he can't understand why the world wants him to study because he can't understand studies. His parents are not happy, his friends mock at him, he is thrown away from his school and he can't take it anymore. He then meets a new teacher in his new school who help him evolve into a person whom the world can accept and at the same be a person who can be himself.Ishaan (Darseel Safary), the kid, keeps you woven tightly to the screen. The kid has shown pure talent in every frame of the movie. Without a bit of over-acting, he plays his role just-right. He has represented not only kids with Dyslexia, but also every kid in the world who has some sort of dream playing in the background of his head. He had made his role look like a cake walk, but technically and practically, he has achieved a great feat which many child artists fail to do. A standing ovation to Darseel! I can't help noticing Tisca Chopra, who has played the role of Ishaan's mother. Her role is of a perfect housewife, struggling to balance the household, Dad's chores, 2 kids, their homework, food, etc? Her expressions are remarkable, especially when she is parted with Ishaan. She is a nice find for this role.Aamir Khan, though enters the screen only at intermission, makes his presence felt throughout the length of the film with directorial touches. He is an epitome of pure talent. Leaving out the praise for his acting talent (which is obvious?) he has given us an is outstanding heart-warming stuff, hats off to him for once again for taking on an off- beat topic and bringing it to life in his directorial debut. As he says in his note on the official site, to children and to childhood? Aamir has ensured that all the cast in the movie give out their best for an A-Grade performance. The second half of the movie might slightly be elastic, because everything happens over lengthy music tracks. But this goes unnoticed because the movie manages convincingly to convey a very important message.Probably this movie can bring you back your childhood memories. The movie will make you cry, make you laugh, make you rejoice and come out feeling that there are some people out there who take Indian cinema several notches higher.Don't even think of missing it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film Taare Zameen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So touched by this film, so well directed and executed with the help of others of course.I am really amazed never thought this would touch me so much and actually this good, really felt that this film has won many Indian awards and should be up for more really.Congrats to Aamir khan in bringing this type of film to the Indian audience and to the world in a brilliant way he has.The film shows how a family and school does not recognise a boy with dyslexia, then a teacher finds this problem and helps the child at the end. The story shows how the child goes through days with his problems and what goes through his mind. This is really for ages over 18+ as some children do not understand. I hope we all see this and appreciate more about children and how we can help them. Much respect to Aamir Khan, my regards Altaaf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of best films produced in India</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this was a Hollywood production, I would have probably rated it at 9.But this film stands out (refreshingly so) as a hopeful savior in the Indian film industry: . By not compromising with commercial elements . By discussing the subject honestly . By conveying the message clearly not obscuring it with unnecessary elements. It works successfully at different levels. Sure it is a children film which the kids will enjoy.. but it is directed at adults.Sure there have been honest watchable attempts before. But I don't remember any of them dealing with such a contemporary issue related to children; an issue dealing with an inefficiency/evil at the root of our society.Hopefully this will be the first of the series of great films.. that will be inspired by its success in spite of its content/presentation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvelous masterpiece !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this movie Bollywood has stepped into a glorious chapter in it's history. There is nothing more to be told about the theme and story of this movie , because other readers comments says it all. In a nut shell, this is a story about the relationship between a child with some learning disabilities and his creative and sensitive teacher. Very poignantly told and very beautifully portrayed. Aamir Khan is very controlled in his expressions , his direction is very sensitive but above all it is the kid who steals the show. A great debut for a great actor turned director and a splendid debut for a child actor.The screen play, the music especially the title song and everything else about this movie is measured, lacking in any melodramatics and minus any distractions , that are usually the bane of Bollywood movies. We finish viewing this movie with a feeling of pity for those innumerable gifted children who don't seem to fall in line with the rest of the world , who don't have any Ram Nikumbhs to save them and who ultimately fall on the wayside without anyone lending them a helping hand.What a tragedy but it is the world that loses in the bargain !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent!!! Aamir take a risk to make a film on children's emotional but essential side. Most of credit goes to creative director and writer of this film Amol Gupte,he do well study and observation on children's problems about school and education.This film is a perfect answer to those people who always make critics that all children movies that they are not commercial..but Aamir makes magic and prove that if subject is good and story is strong then make a good film like 'Tare Zameen Par'.. The lead actor of this movie is child artist Darsheel Safary,good expressions as well as understanding the depth of role,an example of talent and natural acting. Music is another plus point of movie,good work by Shankar-Ehsaan -Loy.all other actors performs good work. The cinematography and background score is excellent.also the some animation is good.aamir give a good message in this movie and all audience are agree with him. The hopeful thing about movie is it gives a advice to all those parents and teachers that don't think about the feelings and thoughts o child. The tagline of the movie that 'Every Child is Special' is perfect and catchy.Now people think more maturely about the children after see this movie. The success credit goes to whole team of Tare Zameen Par... I wish that if Aamir make his next movie have to represent the other social problems of India,and should give a best movie. I think Taare Zameen Par should go for National Awards as well as Oscar!! All the best to team of Taare Zameen Par...a must watch movie..don't miss it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par is a wonderfully directed, well guided movie. The story moves at a wonderful pace. The boy Ishaan who is the main lead in the movie has done the best act of this decade. No Shahrukh, No Aamir its Ishaan who has acted the best. Ishaan's problem is so very neatly conveyed to the audience with examples and the solution too is very crisply and easily portrayed to the audience, that is the hallmark of the movie. Everyone has acted to perfection or should i say the Director has got the near perfect performance from each actor or actress. The best thing of course once again is the kid Ishaan and the Songs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for all Indian parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely you come across a movie which has a very deep impact. TZP is not the first one, there have been many such wonderful films I have experienced so in my life, and I have seen quite a lot. One of the finest of 2007, and also one of the finest of Bollywood's entire portfolio. A must see for every Indian parents.Darsheel Safary is a wonderful actor, and is the heart and soul of the movie. You look at the boy, his eyes has the million watts spark. Someone CAN express so well through his eyes. Also reminds me of Jugal Hansraj in Shekhar Kapoor's "Masoom". Given he is the central character of the movie, he doesn't talk a whole lot. So all the acting in his body language, facial expression and, eyes! And so matured, controlled, acting by such a young boy is hardly seen in Bollywood movies.We have come a long way with Aamir Khan to expect nothing but best of him. But as an actor! But how many have transitioned into a directors role from a super successful acting career? Brilliant debut! Very talented. (please do not talk about three Khans of Bollywood, other two don't measure up)! Music: Amar Akbar Anthony of Bollywood music industry, Shankar Ehsaan &amp; Loy have created a set of songs which compliments the movie so well. Adnan Sami's crooning of Mera Jahan has wonderful children chorus, Maa is yet another single straight from the heart, Kholo Kholo, a great track with beautiful acoustic guitar playing. The song words are by Prasoon Joshi, simply beautiful. The songs like Bheja Kam is somewhat out of the ordinary and has got a great sound. And a BIG thanks for not doing a remix/lounge-mix/trip-hop-mix/techno-mix of any of the songs.One complain, when Aamir's entry happened in the movie, I didn't like the very commercial type entry with a song ('Bum Bum Bole') - ONLY that part in the entire movie was a bit filmy. Else the movie excelled in every aspect.Some people have expressed displeasure of movie appearing in IMDb top 250 for sometime, and then falling. Well, IMDb is a worldwide database, and caters to movie that are internationally released. I don't care TZP not being there, because if we ever make an Indian IMDb, this movie surely will appear in top.I heard in some parts of India, it was made tax-free, but wonder why it didn't happen everywhere. Every Indian parent must see this! In technical dept, the editing, cinematography are fine, if not outstanding. Hence I give 9/10. In supporting cast, Tisca Chopra does a very memorable acting.I also visited Aamir's blog (http://aamirkhan.com/blog.html) to read many of the comments people are pouring from all over, and so obviously the movie has touched many hearts. God bless you Aamir to create such a masterpiece!</fullReview>

I watched it in the theater and thoroughly enjoyed.This movie has attempted to point out the constant rat race life has become and the lack of attention towards the our children. We are forcing the younger generation also to behave in a competitive manner all the time. We all need to "stop and sniff the roses" and spend more time with children.A good attempt to highlight Dyslexia and the problems it causes.The music is very timely and nice. "Maa" and the Title track are the best of the lot (the others are good too).Good job by Amir Khan but the star was Darsheel Safary.Overall a very good movie with a great performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has put me in a state of Bliss. Cried all the way ... in happiness and sorrow. Felt light when movie was over like someone took off tons of weight from my shoulder ....Reminded me of quote from Sean Penn's new directed film .... INTO THE WILD:There is a pleasure in the Pathless woods, There is a rapture on the lonely shore, There is a society where none intrudes, By the deep sea and music in its roar , I love not the man less , But nature more....... - Lord ByronFor me the message was - We need to break free from the Golden Cage that we have put ourselves into ..... (This false corporate professional world .. Ohh I hate it so much). Working "hard" , putting 101% , for some abstract concept of achieving success.....(who know what that is ...) more salary than others .. Compromising our health in this modern industrial world ....running on treadmills than in free woods (cant find more confused species than humans),pressure of living up to others expectations .... fulfill our parents dreams .... and most of all getting distanced from the Nature ! Ishaan is in more in tune with his feelings , Nature and inner-himself . Sees the wonderful world which rest can't . Ishaan finds the pleasure in the Pathless woods.... a Bliss.PS:I always enjoyed reading reviews . This is the first time I ever written a review, I was forced by my conscious. Would like to recommend other movies : Color of Paradise and Children of Heaven by Majid Majidi. Into the Wild by Sean Penn . This is new movie where after graduating from colleges (for sake of his parents wish).. Chris donates his $24,000 savings and heads into the wild to lose him self ?. And to be free?.</fullReview>

The depth of direction is too deep and it takes you actually in Ishaan's world. Aamir has done a splendid job. It is a must movie to watch. The emotions cradled in the movie touches your heart. I would recommend all parents to watch this movie. This movie will rock your lives and will ask you to think over again and again. The title of the movies tells a lot about the character of Ishaan. Darsheel Safari is truly a gifted actor. He acted the character so beautifully that i could not find a single instance where i could see over acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare film...of substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope what I write does not turn people off from seeing this movie, as there were visually and emotionally powerful positive scenes....But I am still in awe of such a decent movie, heartfelt story, of a beautiful little boy, placed by life into a shameful ignorant hard cold family, filling his life with shame and abusive towards him, because they are ignorant of his disability, impatient with him, eventually abandoning him emotionally and physically by sending him far away. The story on screen was heartbreaking (at times) and I cried many times. Perhaps most hard for me was watching this little boy fall into, sinking depression. Awful seeing that in this young, young soul. Amir Khan's character said it so well - "He is in danger." Many times I thought in this film, this little boy will commit suicide unless someone reaches him. I only wish I could have a teacher like Amir Khan's character in my own life and childhood. The way he gently entered into this young man's world, to lift him from his despair was done with gentleness and mastery.May India learn from this film. From what I can tell, having been born into an Indian family, emotional abusive is common in parenting. Neglect as well. Not in all cases, but it was there in this film. The first half was emotionally difficult because of this, but necessary to display the problem, and alienation the child suffered....I couldn't wait for the HOPE to arrive and though it was endlessly long in comiing, and difficult to endure the suffering in the first half....I was yearning for HOPE, it slowly built and finally arrives in the second half and one breathes a little easier....and is uplifted.Finally, we see this little boy gets what everyone deserves - a little love, compassion, compassion, and more compassion. Somebody who can get inside of him, reach within him and pull him out. There was hope finally. I cried throughout because I too like most people am dying for that, and have not often received much of it in my youth, nor adulthood.Thanks to Amir Khan for making such a powerful, telling, uplifting film. May it educate Indians- parents, teachers alike.</fullReview>

I am very happy for the kind of treatment &amp; the message of the movie and i am more happy that it's a box office hit as this indicates that now the viewers are getting more mature and want to watch something other than the "KKKG" or "KKHH". Pace of the movie is perfect for the kind of topic &amp; special effects used are at right time and in right amount. I would like to congratulate Aamir Khaan for his directorial debut. I liked Aamir with red in his eyes during the whole movie. The message of this film is directly connected to the grass root of the coming world that is children. I wont't utter a word about the storyline because that will spoil your show. I have already watched this movie twice in theater and now i am waiting for the DVD to come. This movie will always remain close to my heart. A perfect family movie, a must watch.Enjoy...........</fullReview>

He was picked up from Shaimak Daivar's dancing school as were most of the children from the film.In the last few years there haven't been many movies that have touched me as much as this movie. The overall message to parents and the attempt to show what a child thinks is really brilliant.Everyone should watch this movie. You'll be a father/mother one day and these types of movies will open your eyes. Really great story and the acting from the child and his mother in the film is perfect. Totally spot on.

		<fullReview>This movie is in the league of RANG DE BASANTI and the likes.. Aamir Khan has done it again.. TZP has a good message and has been pieced together wonderfully. The first half of the movie leaves you laughing at the extremely funny Ishaan; while making sure you break out into tears quite often seeing his plight. The second half (that's when Aamir Khan enters the scene) is even better; Overall; I'd say it has to be one of the BEST Hindi MOVIES EVER; certainly one of the best I've seen.. I rate it a 10/10 for a Bollywood Movie. Cudos, Aamir !! Oh yes, I almost forgot - how can one write a review on a Hindi movie without including some comments on the music. All songs featured in TZP have been chosen really well and fit the situation very aptly. The OST is worth a buy !</fullReview>

Forget all the hype and stories you have heard about the movie and immerse yourself in a child's mind and be ready to proudly wear your tears . It should be added to the gems that Indian cinema has produced for children like Ray's " Gopi gay-an Bagha bay-en " , Gulzar's "Kitab" and Vishal Bhardwaj's "Blue Umbrella" .Some critics may try to compare it with Indian Parallel Cinema . But who watches those silly boring films anyway . This movie on the other hand is highly watchable , entertaining , funny at many times and of course emotional, and very bluntly gets the message across that every child is special .

He was simply outstanding. He had overtook Aamir Khan in the acting too in the movie.The story is a boy Ishaan who always dreams about other things and does not concentrate in studies. He is so poor that he cant even differentiate between 'b' and 'd'. He is suffering from "Dyslexia". Because of his bad behavior his father joins him in the boarding school. Ishaan who loves painting leave drawing and he got always less marks in subjects. Then comes the Temporary drawing teacher Ram (Aamir Khan) he understands Ishaan.Then he makes him study and get good marks.This movie got every thing and Aamir as usual was outstanding and the boy was much better than Aamir. All the characters have done well.Hat's off to the Aamir Khan and his first movie as a director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aamir Khan's directorial debut, Taare Zaamen Par is a true masterpiece. What he has done in his first film is, immortalized himself in the history of cinema.Taare Zaamen Par reminds me of another great debut film by another famous Indian director, Ray. Ray's Pather Panchali is perhaps the best debut film in history, but Taare Zaamen Par comes mighty close. Maybe that sounds a bit too much, but Taare Zaamen Par is almost comparable with Pather Panchali when it comes to portraying human emotions. It's an admitted fact that Ray was a genius. While Aamir Khan can only hope of Ray's genius, but what he has pulled off himself on his first venture is quite a commendable one. The way he handled the boy, the neat storyline, the way the emotions were shown, the music everything was perfect to say the least. It is what a film made in 2007 should be like. It shows the world that Bollywood has the capability to make world class masterpieces.Which, before this one, even I disbelieved.Hats off to Aamir Khan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you feel/felt your child has below average aptitude, you must watch this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dyslexia, a learning disability often is treated and considered to be lack of focus, attitude or laziness. Aamir has done an excellent job on showing the world through the eyes of dyslexic.A person with Dyslexia cannot recognize or frame a word/alphabet like a normal individual. Many studies have suggested that a person suffering from dyslexia has above average intelligence.Main subject of the movie has acted really well. I was touched by his performance. Kudos to Aamir Khan and his team.If you ever feel/felt that your child was below average watch this movie. If may change your and your child's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simply superb kid movie for Parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simply superb movie. Clean, true to its heart and very very close to reality. Thats 'Taare Zameen par' in short for you. Be prepared to re-experience your school days, those memories which you normally would have forgotten by now. The movie was an honest attempt by its team to bring people close to reality and thats just not it! It is just the beginning.The story is about a 9 year old dreamy, creative and dyslexic boy, Ishaan, who enjoys being himself. The problem is, as per the societal norms, he is not performing well in his studies. Poor boy even remarks that "The letters are dancing, I can't read them!" and the teacher thinks it as ridiculous. That results in everyday scoldings &amp; bad remarks from his teachers, constant comparison with his intelligent, all rounder elder brother, disappointed parents, humiliation and shameful remarks from his friends. The parents are unable to accept that their kid has some problem. Like every other parent, they can't see their child as called as "Mentally Challenged", which is not even the case in the story. One incident leads to another and in an attempt to bring discipline in him, they put him in a boarding school, where life is no different for the poor boy. The new change is: lack of his mom, family love and affection. Deeply impacted by the change, the boy stops painting(his solace and passion), stops even talking. Enter the new temporary art teacher who immediately recognizes the shortcomings and the rest is how the teacher with Ishaan himself, bring a revolution in Ishaan's life.The story looks too simple, but its presentation made my heart cry out many times. The story is not only about autism, but also about how insensitive we are turning to every child's emotions, their joys in this madness of competitive world. If permitted, I would have sobbed endlessly for all those moments. There are so many special moments in the movie like, how 3*9 is 3 for the kid because 3 is one planet, while 9 another and * represents a war between them and how 3 wins. Or how insensitive the teachers can become to any child's emotions. The movie also reflects deeply on how today's fathers need not play the same old definition of fatherhood. Being soft, gentle and loving makes a huge difference in a kid's life.The best part of the movie is when the teacher is educating the entire class on autism through a story. Throughout the narration, Ishaan, along with the entire audience thinks its his story, while it turns out to be story of great people from history. That was really well crafted scene. Just explains subtly that all of us are special! The role of Aamir khan is very special and today, we need teachers like his character, who are sensitive, strong, have interest towards children and their needs, who are interested in bringing out the specialty in each kid.The music in the movie is apt and the Song, "Maa" just wringed out all the emotions from my heart. Acting is superb by the new child artist, Darsheel Safary, Aamir Khan and Tisca Chopra. Overall a superb movie and a must for all parents. Great job Aamir! Indeed, every child is special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtly the best Hindi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sets new standards in the movie in Indian film industry. What were all he directors doing all these days? The story, direction, acting, editing... is just flawless. The story revolves around a small boy Ishaan (Darsheel) who has trouble in studying. This boy suffers because everyone feels he is worthless and foolish, including his own family. But his teacher Ram (Aamir) recognizes his special talent and helps him face the challenges. Not all children have similar mental abilities, "Every child is special". People often forget this truth. This movie makes everyone realize this again, and for good.Aamir did excellent acting, as expected, but the superb acting by Darsheel is unbelievable! The pace of story is very grasping. Each minute of the movie makes you think what is going to happen next. Even after 3 hours, you feel wanting for more! Hats off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Debut 2007 - Darsheel Safary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When something is done with heart, it shows. Like everyone else I was also waiting to see Aamir Khan, the Director, since he has already proved himself as an actor and a producer. So it was obvious to have high expectations from the film. The promotions being aired on TV made it clear that it's different and it added even more to the expectations. Finally, after watching the film I can't stop myself from admiring the Director in Aamir Khan.The film got a lot of media attention when it was being made. The film was supposed to be directed by Amol Gupte, writer of the film. Aamir was criticized by some people for taking Amol's film away, but I think Amol should be happy with the way the film has turned up. Amol would have also thought that Aamir is giving a better shape to the mold he has cast and probably that is the reason he has let Aamir direct the film. By the way, I don't think any other film star of recent times would have backed this idea, but Aamir did (that could be another reason for Amol to stick with Aamir) and has pulled it of well.The movie revolves around one dyslexic child Ishan (Darsheel Safary) but it is not about dyslexia. Ishan represents every child who is trying to survive in this competitive world. No body wants to have an underachiever in his/her family and when parents think their child might remain an underachiever, they be hard on him without understanding what child actually wants and sometimes the child is not able to survive the hardness. Every parent can relate with Ishan's parents. When 8 year old Ishan is not able to perform up to the expectations in his school, his parents decide to send him to boarding. There also Ishan is not able to survive the curse of being an underachiever and he even stops doing what he used to love, painting. He is noticed by an unconventional art teacher Nikumbh (Aamir) and Nikumbh decides to take care of that boy and presents a different, more confident and talented Ishan to this world and to Ishan's parents. How he does that is worth a watch.Entire movie belongs to Darsheel and the boy have done a brilliant job. The boy is so good that you don't even realize that Aamir Khan is missing for the entire first half. Second half is a bit slow, but it is bound to happen with this script. Aamir Khan, the actor is good as usual. Direction is first grade, and the way Aamir has pulled of such a difficult subject, hats off to him. All the songs have been pasteurized very well and help the story. Thanks to Prasoon Joshi for beautiful lyrics. Music is refreshing. Over and above everything, this movie is with a message. This movie should be watched by every teacher and parents to learn how to deal with children. They should not be treated as machines, all they need is love and care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cry like baby...and don't be embarrassed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Taare Zameen Par with my younger brother Anmol,who's of the same age as Ishaan,the main protagonist in the movie(played so lovingly,creatively and enthusiastically by Darsheel).Now,some people may feel too embarrassed to show their emotions in front of others,especially their own younger siblings,who consider their elders as their role-models.Even I was one of them.But Aamir Khan had other plans.He made me cry in front of my brother.And as the movie progressed,he made me cry again.And again.I had filled buckets in the cinema hall.I was too ashamed to face others sitting in the hall,let alone my brother.But voila!What do I see!!The cinema's flooded with tears.Youth,middle-age,old.Doesn't matter!Rivers flowing out of the tough-looking uncles,the 40+ aunts can't get enough of their already-wet handkerchiefs.Even the local mafia gang members are trying to hide their disfigured faces in oblivion!I haven't seen such a site.A silent atmosphere beckons when Ishaan Awasthi cries out to his mother with unconditional love.He even manages to make you feel nostalgic when he's thrown out of the classroom for not doing his homework.I always knew about Dyslexia,but I never realised that it could make me cry with sadness and joy all at once.Talking of Aamir Khan, Probably the thing that I loved the most about him(even more than him helping Ishaan realising his purpose in life),was his late entry,that is,just before the interval crept in.Being such a big superstar,he could've come a bit earlier in the flick to command a bit more screen-time but he actually did not.He gave more importance to the content of the movie,unlike what most of the Indian stars or directors woud not have risked doing!Taare Zameen Par(TZP) is a very valiant take on the plight of the delicate children in India,who,even before knowing how to stand on their legs probably,have to undergo through the grueling trauma of their parents' infinite expectations.The expectations of their children doing well academically and going on to be 'sensible and responsible' citizens of their country when they grow up,so that they can be 'accepted' by the 'Indian social norms'.This is a bitter truth &amp; every parent can relate to it,and hopefully can get some notion of letting their wards relax a bit to enjoy their youth to the fullest and also encouraging them to pursue the career of their choice and not be mere mannequins.Go,see this wonderful tale of a little dyslexic boy being helped by a cool teacher,reminded of his own similar past,to follow his dreams.The movie's ended in the cinema hall.What do I see?My young 8-year brother has tears in his eyes too.The movie has touched his tiny heart very deeply.And I've more than accomplished my aim of making his Sunday better.Thank You Mr. Aamir Khan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aamir Khan is a genius with his directorial debut movie. A thought provoking movie that tugs at your heart strings. This forces one to think at various levels. As a child it takes you back to your childhood and the problems that you or your classmates might have faced. As a parent it shows you the stark reality how today's parents pressurize their children in performing well in the rat race we are in, therefore at times killing the spontaneity and creative genius within a child. There weren't any kind of exaggerations or melodrama of any sought. Aamir Khan was fantastic in his role and also the little boy was perfect in every way. I would advise the thinking audience to see it more than once to truly appreciate the message in it. In fact this movie should be entered for the Oscar's under "Best Foreign Film" category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different kind of movie Taare Zameen Par (TZP)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't given this movie 10/10 because of the excellent direction or acting but the very fact of dealing with a new idea blew me off. Whole movie revolves around a 12 years old kid and his imaginations. Acting could have been more perfect but still it was appreciable. TZP remind me of the 80's art movies such as Sparsh.Every Parent should go and watch this movie with their kids. It is indeed a thought provoking movie with a preaching in its core. Indian subcontinent including China is facing a fierce sense of competition due to population explosion. The direct effect of the competition can be seen on small kids. This movie if not all but I am sure will kindle some fire inside the hearts of the parents. It is an eye opener.....I hope you will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Taare Zameen Par is a masterpiece. Great script, Great performances, Outstanding direction and I can go on and on. For script the credit should definitely go to Amol Gupte. Its really beautiful. Darsheel is outstanding. Performance at its peak. Hats off to him. Tisca Chopra is great. Aamir, the actor, all I can say is as brilliant as ever. In fact brilliance is a norm for this guy. Trust me any other Indian actor who would have been in his place and had not even performed half as good as him would have been praised by media and himself like he is some kinda god and would have tried to hog the limelight towards himself from the wonder kid darsheel. But for Aamir, such performances are just regular. That's the standard of this man. And he doesn't have any pressure of hogging the limelight. He is only worried about the end product i.e. the movie and how will audience react to it. And the movie has been treated beautifully. Simple yet complex. Lovely direction. Perfect treatment for the script. Guys vote 10 for this movie. And Aamir, Thank God u made Taare Zameen Par.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie today for the second time and felt that I need to write a review as a viewer. I come to IMDb and I see over hundred comments given ! Enough said about the class of the movie. I am not going to say anything more that my friends have said. I just wanted to jot down the reasons why this film was different from all the other year releases. 1. Great story line said straight from the heart, clean and without any melodrama. 2. Great direction and casting. Aamir proves his strength in direction as well. 3. Wonderful dialogs. Aamir's dialogs to Darsheel's father are all direct and every one of them hits the spot. 4. The story is said from the child's view and not the teacher who helps him. This I thought was the greatest feature of all.5. The film has a message. It tries to assert the fact that all children, mentally challenged or not, has their own strengths and they must be groomed so that they excel in their strengths. 6. Schools feed a lot of stuff even at a tender age. Children need to have time to explore, innovate, understand and more over PLAY. 7. Parents must care about their children and not their marks or grades. 8. Most of the people relate themselves to the movie. They find that there is some part of himself in Ishaan. 9. Just proves that a film without elaborate sets, without a vast set of actors (say 25 !), without spending a fortune, without having over acting but having a great story line, with a fine piece of direction, with great casting (right people), with great dialogs and presentation, and overall an appalling message would be one of the best films ever made.Thanks Aamir for this visual treat. Three Cheers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is officially the best Hindi movie and deserves to win an Oscar for the best movie of the year. AAmir Khan has proved himself again and so has the young artist who acted naturally without overdoing his task. I ended up crying in between due to the emotional scenes. I could actually put myself in his shoes cause I have seen many more who have gone through similar emotions. This story basically evolves around the pressure parents put on their children without realizing what they are going through. While we have other films like the golden compass , chronicles of narnia and many others that have become famous we should really honour this film as this is something that is based on reality and not on fantasy. Overall i give it a 10/10 and of course my respects to aamir khan , darsheel Safary and all the others who have made this film so wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a way to end the year. This is by far one of the best movie Hindi Cinema has come across. The explanation of the title 'Taare Zameen Par' is so perfect that it made me think how important the title is.Now the lead role is played by a new kid Darsheel. His expressions were so real that for one second i forget that he was doing his first movie and that to with the best actor in our industry Aamir khan. One scene which made me laugh and cry at same time was when he bunked his school. It was really heartening to see the director capturing the faces of children which really matters to our country.Aamir khan has again proved that he is the real actor in our industry. After two blockbuster movies RDB and Fanaa, he could have done any masala movie, but he choose most diverse movie that to on kids which unfortunately had not performed well except one or two. His art of story telling is awesome and his acting too. Tisca chopra has done well as mother. Father and brother were also good.All in all best movie of 2007. One of my best along with Munna bhai series. Best of luck to aamir for his next movies and praying to god that he should keep on trying exploring cinema with his hattke movies.Thanks Aamir!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what a sensible movie is. Aamir khan has shown us that Bollywood can also make sensible movies which can also do good business on Box Office.Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) a victim of dyslexia, in which patient has difficulty with written language, particularly with reading and spelling. This movie shows how his parents treats him and doesn't understands him, also always compares him with his elder brother who always comes 1st in class. They also neglects him passion towards arts. When nothing works they send him to boarding School just at the age of 9.Their also he is treated the same but then their is a change in post of Art teacher and comes Aamir Khan who had also suffered from the same problem in his childhood and who is also a teacher in TULIP school. He understands him and helps him to get rid of his problem and also brings out his painting skills in front of everyone by the help of art competition.Brilliant acting Darsheel Safary and Aamir khan. They will surely bring tears in your eyes. Aamir Khan is Tom Hanks of Bollywood. what a touching movie on such topic. I hope that parents learn from this movie and never force or compare their child with others.finally I must say that a must watch for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of kudos to Aamir Khan for the sensitivity and sincerity with which he has handled the matters like 'dyslexia' and 'special children'. It is quite visible that he has done his homework well. But as producer and director if he had curtailed the first half to just 15-20 minutes, then the movie would have been more gripping. Rather too long first part becomes even boring at times, but the second part is well done and is gripping. Overall a good movie to watch. Acting wise Aamir Khan is superb as usual, Darsheel is excellent, while other casts are OK. Apart from the story and script, lyrics and soundtracks are quite excellent. I hope and wish this time Aamir Khan makes it for an Oscar with TZP.</fullReview>

Never has any Hindi movie moved the audience so much, and made them watch the movie with a tear in their eyes. Never has there been any Hindi movie with so much emotional appeal and the credit for it goes to the director Aamir Khan and of course to the young lad Darsheel Safary who shines throughout. Every scene has something to say. I do not wish to describe the movie scene by scene, I will instead appreciate it if the person reading this watches the movie to experience the 'Taare' effect. 10/10 A must watch for everyone young and old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The films a must to watch for each one no matter what age or sex one belongs to. I heard a lot of people saying that the story's based on "Special" Children but it's not and even if it is it's an effort to promote them, their qualities &amp; abilities rather than over shadowing them. Dislexia, isn't a sickness but in a way a blessing in disguise, for all those mentioned in the film like Leonardo Da Vinci, Einstein &amp; zillion of others have after all done wonders for us. coming to the cinematic aspects, as a film student i would grade 10/10 when it comes to production,direction, music as well as animation. simple &amp; to the point.the story's just what we all go through in our childhood, some of us go through it in an extensive manner, others just seem to have a taste of it but we do. Parent's should definitely watch it since it'll make them realise that if they have a bunch of children none of them would be having equal abilities; like they say "5 Fingers are not alike" so same goes for the children. So, enjoy watching it &amp; beware it makes you cry as many times as you watch it!!! &amp; emotions are what are needed; if you're not emotional you're not a film maker!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you cry... a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked quite a few films this year that included Eklavya, Dharm, blue umbrella, Johny Gaddar, Chak De India, etc but after watching TZP, I felt the other movies except Dharm and blue umbrella are pointless.If you are a Pankaj Kapoor fan, you cannot ever dislike Dharm and blue umbrella. But this one's stands above all the movies made this year.There were some bad movies this year that included Tara Rum Pum, Laga Chunari Mein Daag, etc and some comedies that seemed so cheap, there was nothing to see in those movies.But you will laugh and CRY watching this movie and most importantly learn so much from it.The movie shows how the kid learns from looking around rather than from books. He catches fish from gutter, plays with dogs rather than cricket with other boys, is always in the world of color, watches the people on streets, spends a lot of time alone at lakes and spends more time in dreams than in reality.It captures the look of the world from a kid's view and what he likes, dislikes and the way he learns stuff. Darsheel acts superbly as Ishaan who though is poor in studies, never reveals his problems and stands up to face his demons. The songs are not the usual one where you have guys dancing around with girls, these are meaningful songs played at right situations. Every actor has given a very natural performance with no Bollywood touches given to their acting.I will be disappointed if anyone else gets the best actor award this year for some non-sense movie which lack any script, rationality or natural acting.Aamir is brilliant and Tisca is beautiful in the movie. The roles of principal, Rajan, Yohaan and Mr. Awasthi are A-Grade. Will give a 10 on 10 for the movie. The only proper contender that Darsheel has in terms of awards is the legendary Big B for his yet another stupendous show in Eklavya.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Awesome Movie. Most sensitive Hindi movie i have even seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to know how good Taare is, just go to your nearest theater and watch the people coming out after the show. The cacophony that surrounds a crowd exiting a theater will be missing. Some would be walking in slow motion. Some would look petrified. At least that's what happened in the theater I went to. Not a single soul was talking after the movie, probably because what everyone saw on screen was not fiction, but a semi-biography of his/her own life. In fact, the normally rowdiest gang in a theater (ie my friends and I) that is good vocal at the end of a film left the theater in pin drop silence. The first thing we said to each other - 'Aamir Bhai has done it again.' Aamir (and Amol Gupte) has made a pure film, without giving into the temptation of masala or 'what would the audience like to see' philosophy; for giving chance to fantastic yet unknown actors like Vipin Sharma and Tisca Chopra (I love Tisca); for riding against the tide; for not trying to hog the limelight in the film by happily playing second fiddle to the boy (even Aamir Khan's name comes after Darsheel Sarfi, the boy, in the credits); for giving the audience something different once again as an entertainer; and for truly caring about the society and using the medium to bring a change.I remember earlier this year SRK made a statement: 'films are for entertainment; messages are for post offices.' Well Aamir Khan has proved that cinema is probably the best medium for giving a message and I can say that looking at the face of every person in the cinema hall. Not only that, he has proved (yet again!) that a message can be entertaining.Behold Bollywood big shots, Aamir the director has arrived. With just one film, he has set the bar higher than most of you can only dream of reaching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zameen Par is a perfect 10 pointer movie. It is flawlessly directed with meticulous attention to detail. The performance of the kid (Dharsheel Safary) is awesome. Its just unbelievable for a small kid to give such a matured performance. Aamir Khan rocks in every department. He was brave enough to accept a concept like this which doesn't include commercial aspects. It shows the behavior of parents towards their wards in the existing Indian educational system. The movie delivers a strong message in an effective way. Songs of the movie are very situational and are apt. Job well done by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy. All in all a very heart touching movie. Taare Zameen Par is the best movie for at least the past and next 10 years. It is a must watch movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insightful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long time, we are manifested with a message so nicely put up by the movie which comes out as an overall winner. Amir shows of his mettle as a nice upcoming director as well. He is already considered a perfectionist in acting. This movie is not just another movie which is made to entertain the audience. This movie simply puts across this nice message before all the parents that each child has something different, unique in him/her. Their mind is really very innocent and requires unconditional love and care that can bring out the best in them.'Taare Zameen Par' spends a good half-an-hour introducing us to the world of 8 yrs old Ishaan Awasthi (a truly brilliant Darsheel Safary). A world that is made up of all that most of us, as-kids desired, &amp; as-adults wished, but fell way short of achieving. Ishaans interests &amp; aspirations are, at best, misunderstood &amp; reprimanded while automatically being compared to a non-bully of an older brother and to the rest of the children. The first half is a major triumph in form, intent &amp; storytelling. It is heartening to experience the measured-pacing of the narrative. And the assured generous digressions to details (as grasped by young Ishaan's mind) that still continues to be a taboo in the Bollywood rulebook.Aamir Khan walks into the film at its intermission, waits for the audience to return to their seats, &amp; successfully manages to play them, almost, a different film. His Ram Shankar Nikumbh investigates Ishaan's problem to be Dyslexia, what once used to be his exact problem that didn't receive reverse reprimansion that he is now delivering to the rest of the world vis-?-vis Ishaan. The second half is constructed entirely with one Aamir Khan scene after another. The film now has become Aamir Khan's ? his tears, his tribulations, his travels, his speeches, his righteousness &amp; finally his triumph snatched away from the kid's victory that he himself had, as director, set up.The movie really touches your soul and brings tears. Songs are nicely composed and fit in the scenes quite well..In all a very nice movie to watch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is by far the best Hindi movie of 2007..hands down !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I had more than 2 thumbs up to show to the entire crew of this thoroughly engrossing film. The best part about this film is how the directors and the story writer have taken ordinary examples from our daily life and portrayed them to the T. There were times when I was able to correlate with the actors regarding todays growing competition, pressures that students at such a young age face and are expected to cope with.Darsheel Safary is simply superb !!. This film makes you laugh, cry and at times leaves you in awe with how Darsheel is able to portray his character.Emotions run high at times and its very good.Way to go Aamir and Mr Gupte, hope to see more of Aamir directed films in the future !!</fullReview>

It has answers to all the questions why each child is special. Only studying good and securing good marks is not the target for kids, there are far more things in his life to achieve. When i was watching this movie, all the incidents and movements, situations and behavior of the child, I thought it is taken from my activity when I was child. It is real and heart touching.These types of movies are made once in a century! I say, this is the best movie of the century!! Mr. Perfectionist has proved his perfection in this rare movie.

		<fullReview>The kind of nonsensical cinema (can we call it so?) that the Indian industry has Benn serving us had really exhausted my patience. Movies like golmaal(with "seasoned" actors like Devgan) were being hailed as hits. To further add to our woes was the fact that decency had taken a deep plunge in the recent months. The arrival of taare zameen par has relieved many of us of our doubts that serious and meaningful cinema has finally left India for good.The movie has, undoubtedly, been made in good taste. The direction is not stupendous(understandable, as aamir is not a professional) although it is incomparably better than any of those beloved kohlis,yash raj icons or any of the pathetic breed of ruffians who dare to call themselves "Directors".The greatest and the strongest point about the movie is it's story and concept. The screenplay is refreshing and beautifully carved out.To come to acting, I feel Tisca Chopra was the pick of the actors.Her skills were natural and not once did she exude any of those artificial glamorous oohs that many actresses do under the pious garb of simplicity(Vidya Balanto be clear) Sharma's acting was excellent. But then it was the skill exhibited by the two siblings that stole the show. Perfect symphony,a great online understanding such genuineness that they both can easily pass off as fullblood brothers in a town where they are not known. All this due to the exquisitely written movie. I mean the characters are so well painted that there is no room for mediocrity to set in.Ahhh..... and now Amir. well he is a good actor. What makes him so is his knack for awkwardly fitting into things and creating open characters. Characters which have many interpretations and can be unpredictable with their tone. This ingredient , is the most important element o good cinematic personas. The technical aspects of the movie were good. The music was good.The locales good. but, really it was the creative job and incorrigible editing which made this movie what it was- excellent! I hope all the actors of this movie don't succumb to the evil charms of commercial cinema as our industry specialises in wasting TIME ,MONEY AND TALENT, and all these actors and writers and editors o this movie shouldn't be lost to our Beloved bollywood. (the supporting cast too was great, then it may be the lady befriending khan in his school or the academic staff of the residential school and all the rest- great work!)</fullReview>

Om Shanti Om, Saawariya, Aja Nachle and many other weren't even half as good as this one.

		<fullReview>This movie not only touches but directly cuts my heart. Aamir has always been a perfectionist and perfection cannot be improved. I controlled a lot not to cry when started watching this movie, but when the song "Maa" describing what a "mother" really means to her child came on the screen, it was impossible for me not to cry. My tears just didn't stop afterwards until the movie ended. Words cannot express what I felt after the movie, really touchy, purely perfect and natural emotions captured. Not only me, I think everybody can relate themselves with the kid in someway or another. The affection and love for mother and that pain of leaving her and staying alone without your mom!!!! Hats off Aamir Sir!! u rock !! 10 on 10. Highly recommended. Please go and watch the movie at this instant.</fullReview>

In the boarding school there's no one 2 listen 2 his controlled sobs that is affecting his mental freedom slowly but steadily.

One line remark for this movie is that, it will be a sin not to see this movie. It will make you laugh and cry. If you have kids you are bound to hug them after the movie.

		<fullReview>Dalsheer should definitely be nominated for an Oscar. This movie should also be mandatory for all school teachers right before schools begin.Having said that, the story of the movie is just like the real life story in "Thank you Mr. Falker" by Patricia Polacco. The movie has a slight variation: instead of a girl, there's a boy. Even scenes like writing on the sand, mirror images are in the book.At least give credit to the original author where you get the story from.For those who haven't read the book you can read more at the author's website: www.patriciapolacco.com/books/falker/falker_index.html Here's what the author has to say: "I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber.When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school.Of course , now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every human life, in the way it's lived, holds, &amp; makes for, at least one feature-length film. While Brando popularized Method Acting, Tarantino the Method Writing, Novelists/Filmmakers living their book/film (much before it becomes the final work) has been in vogue through the entire course of both the disciplines. In that sense could we term this phenomenon Method Film-making? Not Quite, &amp; Not Just Yet. Because the Method about it would be to imagine being that other life while directing; it would be about summoning that other while inhabiting the distanced, present self. Excellent and a must watch movie. A movie on a different subject, still close to people. The concept of the movie is its greatest strength. Also the way it has been presented by the perfectionist director and actor Aamir Khan is commendable.Everything looks very real, the classroom, school. No makeover is given to anything and everything is used as it was. All being in its natural form. This touch of reality is also an eminent feature of Aamir. And it is not a movie for children only, but for everyone.</fullReview>

You cant forget the brilliant acting of the little kid (Ishaan's character). The message of the film, "Every Child is special" has been portrayed in the best way possible. The music of Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy is amazing; especially the song- Bum Bum Bole, which is full of masti and fun. Its touched my heart. I would rate it at the same level as Rang De Basanti. This signifies the revolution in Indian cinema and other directors &amp; movie makers should take a lesson from it.My choice for India's nomination for the Oscars.

		<fullReview>Long ago, i read in some magazine that Hum Hain Raahii Pyaar Ke, was actually directed by Aamir, not Mahesh Bhatt.Now, I truly believe that statement.Aamir seems to know kids very well, and he has made a truly heart-wrenching, soul stirring film, which reminds us that in a world where people are more worried about corruption, politics, deceit, assassinations, hate, lust, somewhere down the line, the child is being neglected.Bollywood is churning out idiotic cinema of the likes of Welcome, OSO, Partner, while Aamir has still not lost all hopes and gave us stars on earth...literally.This year, Jab We Met, Black Friday (Bheja Fry i liked very much, but rajeev masand says it's a scene by scene rip-off of some french flick) and TZP made us realize how wonderful the Indian Film Industry is...Now, for the actors, Darsheel the kid was spot on, and he gave the performance of a lifetime, anyone who has been in a hostel or boarding would've shared the agony...Aamir's was wonderful as usual, and even the theatrics of his being a singing, dancing, encouraging young art teacher, taunting the parents at times to make them realize the truth, his little tokens of interaction with a co-teacher at tulips, and the climax where darsheel disappears and the re-appears, makes you realize to be ready for some wonderful cinema from Director Aamir Khan.... Eagerly waiting for Ghajini remake....</fullReview>

TZP is one such masterpiece which brings tears into your eyes every time you watch it, and these are tears of hope, love, fear etc. You feel the power of hope and belief in you when you watch this movie.It happens rarely that a mainstream movie gives you a message which has the power to change the way you think. I hope every academician of India watch this movie to understand the flaws in our education system, and every parent watch this movie to understand the flaw in their handling of the competitive world outside the house. "Freedom of thought and expression" is what is one of the fundamental rights of a human. But why is this fundamental right not given to a child who wants to follow his heart? Why a cut throat competition from the age of 3? Why such a sense of insecurity in us? And many such questions this movie poses to the so called "thinking minds and intellectuals" of India.Brilliant direction, touching music and excellent script make this movie a milestone in Indian cinema.I hope this movie helps, to some extent, in changing the world around us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good start for Aamir Khan, the director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Taare Zameen Par last night and I walked out of the theatre feeling that we're finally maturing as a movie making and watching country. For too long Bollywood has been associated with the typical "masala" movie. Its heartening to see that in the past 5 years or so, film makers have taken to making films about real issues without killing the fun of the entire celluloid experience. TZP would have probably been categorised as a "art" film about 6-8 years ago. TZP is about a child (Darsheel Safary) who suffers from dyslexia and his painting teacher (Aamir Khan) who helps him thru it. Safary is pretty good in his role as the confused yet earnest kid exuding innocence and mischief at the same time. Aamir Khan was absolutely terrible and thoroughly unconvincing in his role and if you believe that, you also believe that little green people orbiting Earth in flying saucers are about to abduct you. I've been a big fan of this particular Khan for a long time now. Despite being a fine actor, he's been part of some cinematic disasters. That being said, TZP is NOT one of them. I think long time fans of Aamir's work realise there was always some ghost-directing by him in a lot of his movies. It seemed inevitable that he would don the director's mantle at some point. Fortunately he had something that a lot of first time directors don't have - Aamir Khan the actor. On a side-note, the soundtrack is pretty cool. Prasoon Joshi's lyrics are simple and yet they strike a chord no matter what the mood of the song. Once again Shanker-Ehsaan-Loy prove why they are at the top of the game. I'm listening to my favourite song Kholo Kholo while writing this. Great stuff!Lastly, I've rated this movie an 8/10 only because i felt it was a tad too long. Perhaps I'm being a fussy nit... I'm not a regular Hindi movie watcher but i believe in the paisa-vasool philosophy completely. This is one of them. Go watch it with your parents and maybe you'll come out with a grand ole feeling of nostalgia like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you know that movie comes from Bollywood you are expecting some gravity defying special effects and very predictable, boring story line. This movie is showing how wrong stereotypes can be. Movie is two and half hours long and released in 2007, but if you aren't afraid of sitting long time in one spot I can pretty sure it won't be a waste of time.Movie is about an eight year old boy named Ishan who is thought to be lazy troublemaker, until new young art teacher arrives and he is determinate to discover the real problem behind his struggles in school and of course help Ishan, but in the same time other teachers don't even care why he can't write simple words because they think that Ishan is just stupid, but lucky for Ishan Shankar thinks different. When Shankar founds out that answer to Ishans problems is dyslexia, he goes to Ishans family and explains why Ishan isn't so good with academics like his brother. After this meeting Ishans father regrets his actions against his son and is ready to be a more encouraging father. When Ishans parents meet his teacher on the last day of school they are left speechless by transformation they see in Ishan, also main weapon to fight dyslexia was Ishans art skills. Dulled with emotions, Ishans father thanks Shankar Nikumbh for helping Ishan. Movie ends with freeze frame shot of Shankar tossing Ishan in to air, and this was the last emotional moment out of many beautiful moments before.In movie we can find some flaws, for example, beginning is little bit too slow and some scenes are too long, but other half of the movie picks it up a bit booth in pace and entertainment value. If movie would been below two hours long, there wouldn't be reason to write any of this. In conclusion I want to say that this movie is showing third world problems with children's who not only have dyslexia, but also kids who aren't "good enough" and they have other sicknesses that can ruin their chances to live proper life. It isn't problem in Europe so much anymore, because our teachers are qualified to discover it pretty fast, but we need to understand it wasn't always like that and many children's from last century knows that, and it still knows many kids from third world, movie makes us think about another problem that we have in our world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a brilliant movie... brilliant for Indian standards..... nothing was unrealistic...performances were outstanding....its good to see the Indian film industry getting in touch with reality... real stories.. real lives... TZP touches you in a very gentle way.... its a sensitive subject and its handled in a very sensitive way the downside is that i do believe the first half was stretched a tad more than it should have been... overall its a must see.....do watch out Tanay Chheda.... he did understand his character very well... aamir as usual a perfectionist and thats seen in both his direction and acting... the music score of this movie was good too...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stars (Taare) of Cinema - An unforgettable Indian cinema experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who are new to Indian cinema, it might be worth mentioning that Aamir Khan's films are always eagerly anticipated. What made this anticipation all the more dramatic was the fact that Taare Zameen Par was Aamir's first film as director. Story So what's the film all about? Taare Zameen Par (translated: Stars on Earth) is the story of a boy who suffers from dyslexia (Darsheel Safary who plays Ishaan Awasthi), told from his viewpoint. The film portrays the trials and tribulations of a dyslexic child and how people such as his parents and teachers around him deal with the situation. Aamir Khan plays his art teacher who helps him see the light at the end of a seemingly endless tunnel. Review I'd like to start by stating that Taare Zameen Par is one of the best films ever made in Hindi Cinema. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a children's film. Sure, the protagonist is an eight-year old boy but this film is for everyone to see. What makes this film particularly important in today's India is that it deals with the country's changing socio-economic context - India's middle-class is growing, with growing stress on competitive education and high performance in every aspect of life. The Awasthi family reflects this context - work hard and succeed at work and school, whatever the cost might be. Enter Ishaan, who feels lost in the real world and prefers to live with friends such as paint colours, fish in a bowl and "dancing letters" (beautifully described in the song "Jame Raho"). Ishaan is played brilliantly by Darsheel Safary - perhaps the best performance by a child actor since the 'Masoom' trio. There are hardly any dialogues for the character, but Darsheel is able to portray the troubled character splendidly through his expressions. His parents played by Tisca Chopra and Vipin Sharma and brother Sachet Engineer have done a great job as the supporting cast, although one wishes that the mother (played by Chopra) could have played a more proactive role in her son's future. The film is very-well scripted and one pities the original creator of this venture - Amole Gupte. Although he is given due credit as the film's creative director, it doesn't mention the fact that he was the original director, has studied this subject for years and was involved deeply in every aspect of the film, especially the script and late-night sessions with the music directors to get it right.And what can one say about Aamir Khan? 'Brilliant' and 'unprecedented' come to mind immediately. Dealing with a topic such as dyslexia is difficult and I'm sure a lot of people might not agree with the way Ishaan is treated in the film or with some of the answers to dyslexia. But its important to remember that this is a film, not a documentary and it has been set in an Indian context. Some of the greatest directors in the world (Spielberg, Satyajit Ray, etc) have been credited for their ability to deal with the child actors. Aamir Khan has not only taken on a difficult subject but also brought out a terrific performance from Darsheel Safary. Aamir has presented the film from the eyes of Ishaan and has so effectively used animation to describe Ishaan's thought process. Unlike many other Indian directors, he has used the music so well to push the story ahead, especially with the song "Maa". It goes without saying that the film is technically perfect, considering Aamir regards himself a perfectionist. Overall, a near-flawless film that appeals to the sensitivities of Indian audiences. Haunting, melodic music. Good acting. Great direction. Bravo Aamir, what a start!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great amount of research and efforts went into this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If for nothing, this movie is worth watching for the child's acting. I heard the crew put in about some 6-7 years of research before making this movie. And Amir Khan's direction is easily comparable to Imtiaz Ali's, Vishal Bharadwaj's and Michael Bay's. (If you're not into direction and those names are not familiar, then I'll tell you that these are one of the best directors that are alive today. They don't make spicy movies - no highly acclaimed director does.) The movie is not only to educate the Indian folks on dyslexia, but also to portray a message that a dyslexic child can still be very successful in life. Great thinkers, filmmakers and scientists were dyslexic viz. Kurosawa (great Japanese filmmaker), Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci, Walt Disney, Agatha Christie, Thomas Edison, Pablo Picasso and Abhishek Bachchan. It's an educational film and has much melancholy in it so if you are looking for mere entertainment, you won't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the best movie ever made in Bollywood. There have been good movies but none of them, I can recollect as complete as this one. This movie has everything. It's an eye opener. It conveys a strong message to our still-not-so educated society that "every child is special". There is more to a child than remembering ABCD and 1..9. We should let these children IMAGINE! THINK! Only then they can come up with something original and change this whole white world. The direction was spotless (except the entry of Aamir khan perhaps was a little too stretched).The music was soothing, acting of all the members were fantastic, specially the young boy. Aamir khan is really trying to bring some quality in Bollywood. Finally, the pace of the movie was perfect. I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies somehow lose their way because of poor script. This one is an exception. I really wish this trend be continued. Everyone knows there are lot of trash movies in Hollywood also just like Bollywood every year. But there are always 2-3 really good movies are made every year in Hollywood. I hope this is just a beginning of that trend, if not better! 10 out 10 for TZP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the movies getting more and more snazzy by the day in bollywood, I for one never expected to see a movie like Tare Zameen Par. I must say its hats off to Mr Aamir Khan for bringing to us this ray of hope in the mist of the never-ending Hollywood "inspired" movies. The movie successfully captures the characters, who seem to be very clearly described by the script. The movie brings forth a new idea to the Indian cinema and manages to convey it to the masses with a fanatical ease.It might be a directorial debut for Aamir Khan, but for not one instance has the movie failed to depict what it wants to. It is a very straight forward movie with animation being used as a prop for conveying what one couldn't even imagine. The character of Ishaan Awasthi is very well depicted by Darsheel Safary and hats off to him too for his gala performance. The movie being more than two and a half hours long, never seems like a drag and the story keeps on progressing giving the movie new meaning as it passes. Aamir Khan was also incredible and has done a very good job (as always) in the acting department too. Performances of the parents of Ishan Awasthi is also commendable.The Music department was handled by the talents of Shankar Ehsaan Loy, who have done a good job too. The lyrics of the songs aptly described the situations in the movie. Title Song Taare Zameen par was wonderful.The movie scores perfectly in all fronts possible and is a must watch for some really starved Audiences in India, who can only wish to see more films like these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amir Khan is a Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taare Zameen par is the directorial debut of Amir Khan and he surely impresses.Amir Khan who is indisputably among the finest actors comes across as a magnificent story teller.The story is of an eight year old boy Ishaan Awasthi. Ishaan has some snag with studies. He lags behind in class and most of the time he is standing outside after being punished. Ishaan loves to paints he lives in his own small world where fishes can talk, trains can fly and yeah he brings everything to life with the help of his paint brush. Lost in his own world Ishaan merrily play with fishes, street dogs and fantasize about fictitious characters. Ishaan's elder brother is the class topper and a tennis champ and hence it invites comparison. Driven by strong service class mentality Ishaan's parents want their kid to excel in studies and concentrate more on academics. Ishaan fails in class 3 and faces rustication from school because of chances of getting failed two times in a row.Desperate time calls for desperate measure and Ishaan's father enrolls him in a boarding school against his will and his mother's. Ishaan feels betrayed, he is hurt he goes into this shock stage where he hardly talks to anybody and more importantly he stops painting. Here also he lags behind in studies but more importantly he loses the will to be happy. Then comes a temporary art teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh( Amir Khan), he tries to figure out the reason of Ishaan's silence and disinterest. He finds few symptoms of dyslexia in Ishaan, and then decides to help him out. He educates his parents about dyslexia, convinces the principal to be liberal with his marks. Being a dyslexic himself, Ram Shankar relates with Ishaan's problem. He not only helps Ishaan's to deal with dyslexic but also builds up Ishaan's lost self confidence.Taare Zaameen Par strikes right chords because of an amazing script, meticulous direction, magnificent performances and Simplicity. Everybody would be able to relate with Ishaan. Ishaan's problems his life at some moment will definitely become yours. Every character is beautifully written and Amir Khan makes sure you are acquainted with all of them. This is the beauty of TZP because everything is so believable and realistic that after some time you become a part of it.TZP triumphs because of its simplicity. The characters are so believable that they feel like people living next door. Darsheel Safary is brilliant. Amir intelligently handled his screen time and he never overshadows the script or any other character. It's the master story teller Amir Khan's sheer brilliance that he is being able to bring to life some of the most touching and heart warming scenes on celluloid. Amol Gupte's sensitively written script indulges you into each and every emotion. SEL gives a melodious heart warming music which not only adds to the narrative of the story but also embarks many unsaid emotions. "Ma" is unarguably among the best shot song of recent times. Hand held camera and sharp editing is vividly used in "Bheja Kum", Date raho introduces all the characters colorfully and off course the title track is sheer melody.TZP never tries to preach anything it's not a movie about dyslexia. But it has a noble feel and an intrinsic kindness. This movie talks to all parents and forces them to introspect. TZP works because it is so relatable we all can see ourselves on screen at some point or another. The only minute shortcoming of TZP is its pace. First half can be cut short by 15 minutes but I will say it doesn't matter because the movie is slow for sure but you enjoy every moment of it.TZP will make you laugh make you look deep into your soul will make you relive few childhood fantasies and it will make you cry. But its not a sad story it's a over whelming experience and when in the final scene Ishaan run towards Ram Shankar you really feel world is a better place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Amir Khan's movies a lot! I liked dil hai ke manta nahin, and even Lagaan was worth watching more times! Lagaan blew me away! Because of that I expected a lot from Taare zameen par. In the first half of the movie there was no Amir Khan. That was not bad. The little boy about who the story goes acts great. The problem about this boy is very good filmed. Then we come to the middle part of the movie. And we all know about Sharuk's movies, the intro is the most important about the movie. I did not like the intro of Amir Khan as a clown teacher.Amir Khan is good looking. The movie is very realistic. He should have kept it this way. No teacher dresses himself as a clown to introduce him like that to his class for the first time. He is no Robin Williams in the movie Patch Adams.With saying this, the camera-work was OK. Acting was OK. There were only two scenes in the movie that were phenomenal! First one was when the little boy gave his painting to his teacher and goes seeing the teacher's painting and cries. That was awesome! Camera-work, acting, background movie was excellent! Second scene had the same ingredients, when the boy leaves the school with his parent, but runs back to his teacher to hug him.But both of the scenes were at the end of the movie! If the whole movie had those ingredients, I would have loved it! Every time I hoped this kid had special powers, but the kid was only dyslectic. It was a little disappointing, but on the other hand very realistic, to make people see that every child is indeed special. Keep up the good work Amir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a must see. story of a misunderstood kid who is living in a dream world . the daily mundane life that an average school going kid lives is not for him. he is dyslexic but could just be a dreamer unwilling to give in to the silly regimen of courses which passes off as education in most Indian schools. his typical middle class parents cannot help but compare him with the elder child who is good at studies and sports.(surprisingly not the typical bully you would expect him to be). the mother is very patient and loving but just does not get it. the father is clueless- busy eking out their middle class existence pay checks.the story is a regular story of the teacher stepping in to help the kid and also does go a long way in building awareness about dyslexia (highly needed in this puppy eat puppy world of childhood).what stands out is the great cinematography, childlike special effects, the dazed kid, and the mind blowing music. i would recommend you listen to soundtrack a couple of times and then see the film. you will love the context. the song words are great and the compositions range from acoustic to operatic to heavy metal and rap. awesome music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie aroused my curiosity since it was Aamir's debut as a director. Mr.Perfectionist taking the director's seat was something to watch out for. Also the story seemed to be very appealing. A dyslexic kid and Aamir with his cool funky hairstyle. The movie was a amazing experience. It showed an Indian family exactly the way it is. Studies have topmost priority and nothing else will help you in life. Dreams and interests take a backseat,nay even chucked out. This is a movie with very little dialogs and more of emotions. You just don't need to know the language to watch this movie. Camera-work is top-notch and so is the music. Kudos to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. A guard of honor for Darsheel Safary, the kid who's simply brilliant in the movie. The National Award for the best child artist is definitely his, Im wondering if there is an Academy Award for child artistes. Its fun to see his antics although i mean no offence. A heart warming story about his struggles with the society. This movie can definitely be termed the movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Give A Shout Out For The Unappreciated Underdog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Indian producers of Bollywood musicals seem to know their fan base and what makes them happy &amp; smiling as they exit out of the cinema. 'Taare Zameen Par' (or as it is better known in the U.S. under it's title translated from the Hindi, 'Little Stars On Earth')is another one of those "feel good" films that will elicit tears &amp; joy from it's target audience. The story:an eight year old boy is failing his classes in school,one after another. His parents are a mixed lot. His Father browbeats him,his Mother mollycoddles him. The boy has an over active imagination. When he is transferred to a private school, he is miserable &amp; depressed. A substitute art teacher (played by the film's director,Aamir Khan)picks up that the boy's failure to comprehend in school is due to dyslexia (a condition that renders numbers &amp; letters in reverse in the person who has it). Although the film dwells in the usual emotional tug of war with the heart strings,it is still worth taking a look at. Some of the musical numbers will have your toe tapping (although,personally I've heard better Bollywood film music in other films I've seen). Spoken in Hindi with English subtitles &amp; heavily accented English. Not rated,the film contains a few rude words,but is basically okay for the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good as a movie, but bad as a movie with message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this review is coming too late...i saw the movie on TV and always wanted to write a review.......but i'm super lazy...with Talaash's release, i felt compelled again to write the review.the basic plot is - ishaan lives with his loving mom, tiger dad and over-achiever brother. ishaan has dyslexia. he lives in his imaginary world, while the whole world around him wonders why he's such an idiot. his pushy tiger dad threatens to send him to boarding school if he performs poorly again in his exams...which he does. the kid is packed off to boarding school, where the whole story is repeated....with teachers reprimanding him for poor scores, unfinished homework. his life is miserable, until an art teacher nikumbh, enters his life and recognises his problem - learning disorder dyslexia. he also realises that ishaan is actually quite a genius and excellent in drawing....and slowly becomes his personal teacher to turn around his life and helping him to cope with his dyslexia.on first look, taare zameen par is a good movie, nicely made. leaves you with a good feeling. darsheel safary has done a wonderful job and surpasses aamir khan in acting. direction is good (but not awesome).but i have a serious problem with the plot and above all, with ppl applauding the movie as a 'brilliant attempt' to educate ppl about dyslexia. i think once ishaan comes to the hostel, he shows symptoms of autism and not dyslexia. by showing ishaan as a hidden gem, the movie becomes less about learning disability and the anxiousness the student may have due to social rejection - and becomes more about hidden gem ishaan and how his teacher shines this gem. dyslexia has nothing to do with IQ...i'm no expert....but ishaan in hostel showed more symptoms of autism - not dyslexia.second, art teacher nikumbh (aamir khan), single-handedly decides to take over ishaan's life and teach him. within one year, ishaan comes up with flying colours. i again have a problem with this. i think a movie about 'dyslexia' should actually teach how others can help a dyslexic child. it doesn't even involve the child's parents! nikumbh is against sending ishaan to a special school....this again is wrong. special schools have teachers who are trained to empathise with kids with learning disabilities and can rightly train and teach such children. at least in special schools, the kid will not have his esteem stamped, beaten and butchered by insulting teachers. the movie shows as if the whole world is bad (including the parents), only the art teacher is pure gold....and is far more concerned about ishaan's life than the parents themselves! that again is a wrong approach....i would have been happier if collectively everyone, in their own special ways, try to help ishaan, which drastically helps him. if it takes a village to raise a child...it should take a whole country to raise a dyslexic child.third, the movie also talks a little bit about parenting. ishaan's father is a tiger-dad, for whom nothing but being #1 earns his love. the movie doesn't much address this wrong attitude. i would have been very, very happy if ishaan would have remained an average student, and with the teacher's help manages to get a decent score in his test...and his father is proud of his son, no matter what. but no....this movie HAD TO show, that the kid everyone thought was a dull idiot...is in fact a BRILLIANT artist....and thus, his parents and all the teachers (who put him down) are "so proud" of him.KIDS (and ppl) should be loved for WHO THEY ARE and not for WHAT THEY DO. But movie goes on to carry forward the wrong notion that you'd get ppl's love and respect only if you are something special...and goes against the movie's motto - every child is special. does one need to have extraordinary talent to be special?? bottom line - on the surface, Taare Zameen Par is a nicely made movie and makes a good watch - especially coz of the kid's performance. but deep down - it's an emotionally exploitative movie that tries to gain maximum sympathy for the child, where "message about dyslexia" takes a backseat and the movie becomes more about how a "pure gold, better than kid's emotionally numb parents" teacher turns the life around of a dyslexic child...who basically attains fame in the school for something he was already was good at!</fullReview>

The audience reaction is also the same: they are overwhelmed by the purity &amp; effect of this magical movie.I watched the movie with my husband &amp; in-laws on 21st Dec.2007. As soon as the movie ended... the whole audience was in silence. They were overwhelmed, because what they witnessed was every-which-way : A MASTERPIECE. Most of them stood till the end credits finished.My father-in-law..(a fan of Narendra Modi) is never affected by any movie. But even he was silent. He confessed that TZP is a unique movie.As soon as i returned home : I said to my husband: "I have never ever seen a movie like this." Its a truly amazing movie.The performances are perfect especially that of the child &amp; Aamir. The music is in perfect blend with the situation.The pace slowly builds up. As soon as you enter the 2nd half of the movie ... you are a part of the movie. Towards the end ... Its simply Magic. The movie has a ever-lasting effect on you.Don't trust any negative review (which i am sure nobody must have written)about this movie. Just go and Watch it.I am 100% confident that by the end of the movie ...you all will fall in love with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily the best Hindi movie i have seen in years. There is not one flaw i found in the movie, the actors have done a tremendous job, the songs are overwhelming, the story, the screenplay, everything is just awesome. But more than anything else what stood out for me was Aamir Khan's direction. The portrayal of the character of Ishaan and the poignant scenes between Aaamir and Ishaan leave indelible imprints on the viewer's mind. Aamir as an actor is a perfectionist but after seeing this movie i feel Aamir as a director has surpassed Aamir as an actor. I have seen other threads comparing this with Black but i think that not only was black borrowed from a Hollywood movie but also TZP is a more real movie. TZP is not about Darsheel Safari, nor is it about Aamir Khan but it is about childhood, and how parents put such tremendous amount of pressure on their children that they lose faith in their abilities. This movie teaches parents how to believe in their kids and let the kids believe in their strengths. I think this is a must watch movie for kids, parents, teenagers and every lover of Hindi cinema.</fullReview>

You are Ishan , you are His father his mother his teachers and when Nikumbh walks in you wish he been in yours life and want to be him. Thats the power of the story which gets its perfect execution by a brilliant direction from Aamir Khan, who unfolds the story in a very simple manner without using any avant grade film technique, just follow the the lead character, his surrounding, his imagination, his frustration , his anger and then his silence. And when it ends you just get stuck to yours theater chair and need some one to nudge you off and yours hands unashamedly wipe tears rolling over yours cheeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie from the Bollywood's perfectionist, Aamir, this time in dual role as the director+actor meets the standards set by him. Aamir is here once again to change the trend of NRI- movies (chopras and johars) and cheap skin shows. 'Taare zameen par' is a movie with a sensitive subject. Aamir is clear about the movie as the director but seemed slightly confused with his character in the movie. Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music powered by Prasoon Joshi's lyrics gave life to the movie. Amazing performance from Darsheel in the main role makes this movie truly wonderful.It's not a regular bollywood movie or I should say Indian movie. There are no duets, no villain and not even a heroin. If you want to watch regular so called entertainers with no brain, this movie is surely not for you. It's a movie that deals with a social problem in sensitive and creative way. I advise to show this movie to all Parents (having school going children) and all primary school teachers for free. It's the right movie to watch with your family for this Christmas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because of its IMDb rating and I find it hard to believe that so many people liked it. Not only liked it, they adored it! To me, it seems like a fabrication. I felt like the movie didn't have heart.Don't get me wrong, it has a very important message and it is not boring or anything, but it is just so phony. All the characters are one dimensional and all the messages are very idyllic, it's almost like a children's cartoon, only it is supposed to be a grown-up movie.If this is where our standards are for "great" movies now, I think we're in a cinematographic crisis.If you choose not to watch this movie, I don't think you'll really miss on anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by making an admission; Sugary films about kids (and animals, for the record) always touch me, and Taare Zameen Par was no exception. In fact, I'll further admit that I did shed a tear or two at the end, however, being of Indian origin I'm allowed to be over-emotional about everything as it's in my blood. Hell, I even cry watching Oprah sometimes ? come to think of it I might have a problem, maybe I need counselling or something. I might start a club; 'Over-emotional Indians Anonymous', get in touch if you want to join! Anyway back to the film. The performance by the lead 'kid' Ishan, played by Darsheel Safarywas, was outstanding and young Darsheel will certainly have a bright acting future ahead of him. Aamir Khan's direction was very good and the film was, by and large, a good one, which entertained and ticked most of the boxes of a commercial 'feel good' movie. However, was it a classic? Did it resonate so completely with me that I will remember it as one of the best films I've seen? Alas, no.OK, now for the negatives. Unfortunately the film had no subtlety and was often repetitive and consequently rather grating at times. The first 'breakfast' song was a pointless one, and the progress of the film up to the diagnosis of Ishan's dyslexia was far too slow. Then upon Aamir Khan's arrival it went a bit 'Dead Poet's Society' which annoyed me slightly. The film veered towards being a bit too condescending and saccharine and needn't have been. Kids are very intelligent you know, want proof? Well, just watch a movie called Taare Zameen Par! So to conclude, it was of course very important that a movie concerning the stigma surrounding learning difficulties in India should have been made and although the film was good and satisfactorily takes you on an emotional ride and educates at the same time, it could have been so much better. However, with a vast talent evidenced by glimmers of brilliance in his directorial debut we can all rest assured that if anyone can deliver a great film, Aamir Khan can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>400 Blows to Taare Zameen Par</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie - I was stunned by the first hour or so. It was spectacular and made up for all the deficiencies of the 2nd half - and even made the whole movie look brilliant. I rated it 9 here.Then I saw 'The 400 blows'. To sum up my experience:The 400 Blows (+) Dyslexia in place of the existential theme (+) A brother instead of a friend (+) boarding school instead of a military school (+) Silly art competition the expected winner of which is quite obvious (+) One extra hour of film reel wasting (+++) Smugness of Aamir Khan - the messiah, the all seeing prophet, the true leader of all mankind = Taare Zameen ParEvery single detail is a rip off. It's now quite clear why the latter parts of the movie was distinctly average - those were Aamir Khan's additions to the 400 blows! If Aamir Khan's "independent approach to the world of filmmaking," is a ripping off of the 1950's French new wave films, god bless Indian cinema. Amen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice but..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments are always late.. outdated. But then, I let the film sink in.. taken off the theaters, let the hoopla subside. Anyway, to put it in record, AMIR is my favorite actor. Was. I was a great fan of his films like Jo Jeeta Woh Sikandar, Akele Hum, Akele Tum and Sarfarosh. I declare that SARFAROSH was one of the most perfect Bollywood films ever made, after SHOLAY. But then, Amir started going over the top.. letting his character, looks and mannerisms overshadow the successive films. These later films may have been flops or hits..but the charisma of Amir was gone. The ham and the excessive mannerisms remained. And these include Lagaan, Mangal Pandey, Dil Chahta Hai, Fanah and Rang De Basanti. Similarly, is TZM so great? There have been umpteen films on a troubled school or a troubled student or child and a master coming and solving all issues. From Sydney Poitier to Naseeruddin Shah to Nagesh Kukunoor. I think Rockford was a much better film than TZM. What TZM conveniently forgot that an entire school cannot be held at ransom by a teacher (well meaning, no doubt), to cure physiological / psychological problems of a single student. A school is no place for mind games. A great number of students face one problem or the other, in a session and a magic wand of a single teacher cannot solve (and should not solve) these problems. But apparently, not only Master Awasthi, but even the teachers were cured of their problems after Nikumbh, a teacher, entered the school. Preposterous and impractical. The best of intentions but divorced from reality. Hype weds success, but practicality falls by the roadside. Sorry, folks, but Rockford remains my favorite school story, even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional Manipulation at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had just warned a friend that the film is not as great as it has been made out to be, and today after seeing it he called me from Mumbai saying how disappointing it is. We both feel the film is very plastic in its intention and extremely pretentious. There was a perceptible manipulation from the very beginning to make the audience go through the emotional ride,which was made to climax in such a way that most people would not be able to help control their tears. But exactly how honest and true was this film in its endeavor? My friend said he just could not connect with the film, and exactly like the observations of 'Just a red herring', even I realized some time after the initial effects wore off that the entire story-line is a 'one-liner' - "challenges faced by a dyslexic child in a society like India, where understanding about such challenges are limited to say the least'. Trust me, although I found a film like Om Shanti Om absolutely disgusting, meaningless and stupidity epitomized, looking back I think the makers of OSO were more honest and genuine in their approach.They made it absolutely clear that they were making a completely melodramatic,over-the-top,loud and exaggerated 70's spoof.TZP, on the other hand, is also loud,melodramatic and over-the-top in the garb of being sensitive,delicate and intellectual. Its like finding that the lady you always thought to be Audrey Hepburn is none other than a disguised Mallika Sherawat! I'd like all movie lovers to refer to certain comments and reviews made on this site itself about the film 'Munich' by Spielberg. There is this one sequence - famously referred to as the 'little girl in peril' shot. Spielberg showed how some assassins while attempting to eliminate one of their targets get shocked on realizing that they may kill his innocent little daughter instead etc. This single sequence drew widespread negative criticism from movie-watchers, who said that Spielberg was manipulative, unnecessarily dramatic and cheap in using the audience's sentiments to elicit emotional connection by such a pedestrian method. Aamir is no doubt one of the best we have, but if we are truly looking at using the wonderful medium of movie-making to tell stories, and not just a method of proclaiming our intellectual capabilities - we should probably start being a bit more matured at using it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughably Simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I applaud the director for tackling the subject of learning disabilities, the movie was totally black/white and not realistic. It is ridiculous to suggest that none of this boy's teachers has a clue what is wrong with him, and only the saintly art teacher can figure it all out. This might be a good movie for children, but the overly simplistic and predictable storyline did not keep my interest. The music was good; it appears that this production was a labor of love for the director, and I think it is a fine introduction to the topic of dyslexia, but I could not get past the rags-to-riches aspect which is not at all true to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it all that its being made out to be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey guys, Finally saw TZP, and I have to agree that the movie is pretty good, although I do have my share of reservations. Darsheel Safari as Ishaan Awasthi, no doubt takes the cake, and his performance, especially being a child artiste, is nearly flawless. Another gem that this movie unveils is in the performance of Tisca Chopra as Maya Awasthi, who brilliantly portrays the part of a mother torn between conventions and love for her son. Even Vipin Sharma as the belligerent father has done a fairly good job. I found the first half to be particularly good, especially because one is magnificently transported to those days of childhood and it was able to engender truly nostalgic emotions.However, I found that the movie started dropping in the second half (and I really really want to stress that this is not only because Aamir appears at this time), and the second half, could certainly have been treated much better, especially the ending, which left a lot to be desired. I felt that the movie became slightly predictable in the second half, and I have to say that I was a fair bit disappointed in Aamir. The only scene that really burned through was when he treats the poor kid who's cleaning a table, to some "chai and biscuits". But other than that, his emotional variations were quite inconsistent, in quite a few scenes, he was over-subtle when some enthusiasm was warranted, and vice-versa. Aamir's mettle as an actor is unquestionable (even though it doesn't come close to SRK's abilities, as I have often expressed), but in this movie, he leaves a lot to be desired, at least as far as acting is concerned. With regards to direction, as I mentioned before, the first half is really good, though the movie disintegrates slightly in its fag-end, but a pretty good first attempt (though heres another bet, when SRK directs his first, it'll be better ;)).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hearty dose of saccharine - enough for a life time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you really need a dose of saccharine, go and see Taare Zameen Par. Apart from being an obvious (and far from modest) vehicle for the director himself, it's the most maudlin, pathetic tear-jerker even by Bollywood standards. Most of the actors are complete hams (with the exception of Ishaan himself), with the prize going to Big Brother. The film exploits every stereotype imaginable to the extent that the characters are mere cartoons - one wonders whether the episode where the students draw caricatures of their teachers was intended irony or not. Perhaps the film-makers could have taken a few lessons from Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue if they had had any desire to produce something socially conscious and sensitive without the saccharine. Apparently, they didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was gonna be OK and not good and I was right. Sorry if you think opposite of what I think. I just wasn't crazy for this movie. My ratings- Acting - 8/10 (Great acting) Dialogues - 0/10 (Aweful Dialogues. It sometimes screwed up.) Lyrics - 2/10 (Bad lyrics. Just didn't fit right with the kind of movie it was.Critics - 1/10 (Aweful. I mean, some scenes you go like, what the hell just happened there. Some scenes the movie is very slow, sometimes normal, and sometimes it just really speeds up.) Actors taken for the movie - 3/10 (Darshil was a good actor to pick, but I think Akshay Khanna or Shahrukh would've done better acting than Aamir.) Box Office - 2/10 (It doesn't deserve to be where it is. It was placed 5th in the top 10 top grossing movies in 2007. I think it shouldn't have been in even the top 15. Maybe #18 would've been okay.) Plot - 5/10 (Okay plot) Script - 6/10 (Good Script) Overall - 3.5/10 (Very bad)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two thumbs down: over-dramatized and unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea behind this movie is a good one, but carrying it out just didn't work. The kid is great, his distress is clearly communicated (in a very interesting fashion, I might add), some of the songs are great, and the setting is beautiful. Other than those four aspects, I really disliked the movie. For starters, it was much, much too long (and the intermission did not help matters). There were too many songs that made the scenes drag on. The music also contributed to the sense of over-dramatizing/exaggerating the situations. I had trouble believing many aspects of the movie, so it just seemed cheesy and propaganda-ish. It was as if the art teacher was this angel sent from heaven ? the perfect person that would make everything all right for everyone around him, the one who could do no wrong. His character was very over- done and not well-acted. While I acknowledge that I have no experience with the Indian school system, as a teacher, I am familiar with that of North America. There are no dancing/performing teachers unless they teach dance and performance arts (and even then they do not carry out a one- person show), and students do not join in the dance unless they are taught it first. Teachers do not have free time to devote several hours a week to one student. Students with learning difficulties do not progress at the incredible rate shown in this movie, especially not with just one person providing support. Teachers (with professionalism) do not directly criticize parents of their students. In this day and age, if a parent is involved with their child's education, they will clue in that there's something wrong with the brain when all the 'b's are 'd's (and vice versa) by the end of grade one, at the latest end of grade 2. The father's character also changes radically (unbelievably), which really, really bothered me. If I am to enjoy a movie, I need to be drawn into the story, and if the characters are doing things that I don't believe they would do, the story is lost. However powerful the premise of this movie is, however noble the sentiment that each child is unique (one I whole- heartedly agree with, by the way), this movie drowned itself by hugely over-exaggerating the "overcoming obstacles" theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost the Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I accompanied my soon to be 2 year old son to see the "Bom bom bole" movie (He recognizes Amir-dada by its most aired song on TV). My son was mesmerized by the brilliant cinematography in the first half which captures the wild imagination of Ishaan (btw - they share the names). I was taken aback by the simplicity portrayed by him - I guess everyone one of us went back few years to the dreamy world of fantasy. You can so easily identify yourself with Ishaan - who anyway likes to read books, do homeworks, get bullied; but then everyone likes to catch an hour extra sleep, find a way to draw a picture of thought works, have a child's day out. At least, I admit I have done most of them and yeah given a chance would have started bunking schools in my early days.Amir as a director was brilliant; but the story and script was lacking in many sense. I was expecting a generic story of an average intelligence boy who lets down the expectation of his family by not doing that great in academics. I wasn't thinking of such a hard-faced irrational (or sadist?) father who doesn't give a second look when he leaves his son at the gate of the boarding school. I wasn't expecting teachers to be so ill-mannered and ruthless. I wasn't expecting a sing-along and dance-along teacher in a boarding school whose pillars are discipline and hard work. In this movie only Amir and Darsheel has has shades of white; rest all are black (ok..some of them are grey).The issue is relevant in today's society and Amir rakes it up by its nose; but he fails to provide justice by bringing in the dyslexia angle. Why does he need to prove that every fallen angel can be a champion. A child not good in academics need not necessarily suffer from dyslexia; he may excel in other fields or he can just remain as average intelligence person throughout his life. What is the need of proclaiming that the kid is suffering and needs treatment. I would've personally liked that instead of bringing an ailness, accept that the kid needs help - but the help is in form of acceptance from society - that its OK if you fail in academics, but there can be thousand other good things in you which can leave a mark. So what if you don't become Einstien or Da Vinci, but you can become a Tom, Dick &amp; Harry and at least live in this world like a normal human being. You can continue drawing your imagination, writing your poems and throw colors to your dreams.</fullReview>
