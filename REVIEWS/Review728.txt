		<shortDescription>You need a 20 out of 10 ratings to rate Miyazaki's films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney. That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me. Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like? The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true. Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best animated film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen just about all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me!I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly. But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality.Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and hearing) the movie the way it originally was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great animated family adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best animated family films of all time. Moreover, virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other great films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service." Spirited Away is quite good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult. The one thing that sets "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ride.Why is this film so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is truly engaging and compelling.Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and juvenile. None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those trench-coat wearing posers) There is plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore. The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful.The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate, particularly the two leads, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). The sound engineering is great, too. Use your studio sound, if you've got it.One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited, and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters, who are for the most part one-dimensional stock characters (e.g., gruff general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.) Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the "Streamline Dub" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the "streamline" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does. This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta). Maybe best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to "get it" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking). This is just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. The only sour note is the American Dubbing. I found Vander-Geek to be just plain annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two-disc set and it rocks! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a second-grade level then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful fantasy that will bring out the child in anyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy-lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours? This is exactly what Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" is all about. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail. Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it.As it is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers."Castle in the Sky", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming-of-age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the "camera" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality.Even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka/San or Chihiro/Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start. As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame. For that reason, I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple.At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul-mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives. "The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them...The earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet." Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one I've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream. I have found myself near tears just listening to it."Castle in the Sky" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids. Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Release it Disney! The dub is very good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now you've probably heard a bit about the new Disney dub of Miyazaki's classic film, Laputa: Castle In The Sky. During late summer of 1998, Disney released "Kiki's Delivery Service" on video which included a preview of the Laputa dub saying it was due out in "1999". It's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed. And it's not "Laputa: Castle In The Sky", just "Castle In The Sky" for the dub, since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish (even though they use the word Laputa many times throughout the dub). You've also probably heard that world renowned composer, Joe Hisaishi, who scored the movie originally, went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements. Laputa came out before My Neighbor Totoro and after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which began Studio Ghibli and it's long string of hits. And in my opinion, I think it's one of Miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it.For those unfamiliar with Castle in the Sky's story, it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours. The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted, you see Miyazaki's true vision. And believe me, it's one fantastic one. The film begins with Sheeta, a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship. Sheeta holds the key to Laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization. The key to Laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many, namely the government, the military and the air pirate group, the Dola gang (who Sheeta and Pazu later befriend). Soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid. She falls a few thousand feet, but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant. As she floats down from the sky, Pazu, an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines, sees Sheeta and catches her. The two become fast friends, but thanks to her pendant, the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the Dola gang and government try to capture Sheeta. One action sequence after another, we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue. Plus somewhat twisty surprise. I think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time. The story is wonderful, as we peak into Hayao Miyazaki's animation which has no limits. The setting of the film is a combo of many time periods. It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s, but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons. Laputa is also surprisingly a funny film. The film has tons of hilarious moments, almost equal to the drama and action the film holds. I think the funniest part is a fight scene where Pazu's boss faces off against a pirate, and soon after a riot breaks out. It's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly.Now let's talk about how the dub rates. An excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life. Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays the hero Pazu, who has a much more mature voice then in the Japanese version, where in the original he sounded more childlike. Either way, I think his voice is a nice fit with Pazu. Anna Paquin, the young Oscar winner from "The Piano", plays Sheeta. This is also a nice performance, but the voice is a bit uneven, she doesn't stay true to one accent. At times she sounds as American as apple pie, but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand. The performance I most enjoyed however was of Coris Leachman, who played Mama Dola. Not only is this an excellent performance, but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life. If there was ever a live action Laputa movie (G-d forbid), she would be the one to play her, you can just imagine her in the role (well, somewhat). Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill is Muska, and this is another top rate Hamill performance. You may be familiar with Hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original Star Wars movies, but he renders Muska to full evil. His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker, who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series. Rounding out the cast is voice character actor Jim Cummings, who does a great, gruff job as the general and Andy Dick and Mandy Patakin as members of the Dola gang.Now let me talk about what really makes this dub special, Joe Hisaishi's newly arranged music! For those who have never heard of him, Mr. Hisaishi does the music and like all of Miyazaki's films, the music is very memorable. Each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly. Now, these new arrangements he has done are more "American like", which I think was the goal of the new recordings. Don't worry, the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still here in great form. The score, to me, sounds to be arranged like this is a Hollywood blockbuster. It has more power, it has more emphasis, it's clearer and deeper. The film's prologue, the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships, has some new music (I am not sure, but I believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all). But a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy. Things seem very enhanced. In a powerful scene, the music is more stronger then in the original versions. In a calm scene, it's more calmer. Overall, I think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes, I highly did myself, and personally think it helps improve the film. I prefer the new score over the old one, and I hope Disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack.Another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful, and much of the original Japanese lines are intact. In Kiki, I'm sure a few lines where changed, and this is the same way, lines have been changed. But a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue Miyazaki has written. I was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered, but they were there intact. Some new lines have been added as well which help out. But I am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing, Disney DID NOT translate the ending song, it was in Japanese. I was mortified when they did completely new songs for the Kiki dub, but with this version it's the original song... in Japanese. So I guess it's good it's still the original, but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English.There is a big down side to this dub, and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips. Of course in any dub it won't be perfect, but I think in Kiki and Mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed (and Disney had a little bit more time with this one...). Some of the time everything matches perfect, some of the time it doesn't completley match, and in a rare case, someone says something and the lips don't move at all (there's a scene where Sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit).As far as things about the film itself, these are my thoughts. I thought the most amazing part of Laputa was the animation. From the opening sequence to the ending, the animation is so lush and detailed, you just have to watch in awe. You see the true nature of each character, true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action. You have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film. Everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn, it's like a moving piece of art. And to think, this was done in the mid 1980's. The animation is quite different from Disney, Ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different, but very good. And after all these years, the colors look as vibrant as ever. Laputa also has tons of action sequences, lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground. These sequences are so well done and so intriguing, it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film. And the finale is just something you MUST see. The sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions, guns firing and everything else well. And like all Miyazaki films, each one focuses on a different theme (i.g. Kiki: Confidence). This one has a great a lesson on greed and power. People don't realize how greed can take over you, and how having too much power isn't good. People are obsessed with power, and are greedy, and the main villian, Muska, greatly shows this.All in all, Laputa: Castle In The Sky was a great film to begin with, and is now improved for the most part. I am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory. With a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from Joe Hisaishi, Disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy. Though I think the voices matched the mouths better in the Kiki and Princess Mononoke Disney dubs, Castle In The Sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki's finest fantasy epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time i heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, Pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on his own! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I won't give it away, but the end is really great. I rank this as one of Miyazaki's three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also you may want to check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometime next year i hope) If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the USA.

		<shortDescription>The greatest animated film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best,' whether of all time, a certain genre, or what have you, but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact, Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made. It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki, the most talented of Japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes. The version I'm reviewing is the 2003 American dub (I know, sacrilege for a hard-core anime fan to not watch it in its native language); there is at least one other English language dub out there, I have it on VHS (I have no idea from what source), and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film. But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek here), who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta (Anna Paquin) literally drops from the sky. It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent, Colonel Muska (Mark Hamill), who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck. To keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous Dola (Cloris Leachman). The plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa, a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure. It's all very much in keeping with a fairy-tale setting, but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story, and the plot is peppered with 'gosh-wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature.The design work on Laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary. Flying machines of all sorts abound, utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking. The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century, with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines. But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself, and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal, its power, and its danger.Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film, Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography. From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one-man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, Laputa displays a scope that most films ? even with the magic of CGI ? can only daydream about. Though we only see a small fraction of this world, its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it. The film also contains one of my favorite, if not the most exciting, action sequences ever: a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in, all the while trying to protect Sheeta (who was the one who woke it up). Meanwhile, Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her, literally, from the jaws of destruction. From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last-second rescue, the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience.It helps that Laputa has an amazing score. Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world, the dewy innocence, the exciting action, and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians. Though he re-recorded it for this DVD release (which IMO is not an improvement over his original score), adding pieces here and there, the score matches the visuals perfectly, a rare total union of sound and vision.This isn't a bad dub. I'm inordinately fond of the older English dub, and this one over-explains things just a tad in spots, but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those (and those matched the Japanese pretty well). Dola in particular is hard to get right, but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman (her sons aren't quite as good as the original). Paquin does a good job as Sheeta, and Mark Hamill, while I knew it was him early, is more than talented enough to do Muska (I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more, but Hamill's good). Much of the film rests on Pazu's shoulders, and Van Der Beek is wonderful. Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub, because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu. Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful, as much as I love this film, I don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version. John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front, and my suspicion is that he, like so many others, simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality.Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke (one of his few films I didn't care for), but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement. Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work, and again, this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder. I'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen, it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to the success of SPIRITED AWAY, I was recently able to obtain this title. In fact, thanks to SPIRITED, it is now available just about anywhere videos are sold, along with PRINCESS MONONOKE and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. (The warm and fuzzy MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO remains widely available, of course.) This one is a bit different, being a sci-fi adventure, but it retains many of the themes close to the director's heart so that it bears close ties to some of his other works. While not his best work by any means (that honor would fall to PRINCESS and SPIRITED), this is well worth viewing at least once, and possibly a second and third time. Kids of course will watch it over and over again. The music is by far the best of any of his existing films. It absolutely soars. (No pun intended, for those familiar with the plot.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well known store for ?9 I couldn't resist but buy it. The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way).Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork is. I can only assume some influence here.When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta) his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked portion of Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa.This is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground.Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals. The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same.It is incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything.Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one of greatest animated films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone. But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Anime. I've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award; this isn't an exaggeration - I've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who'd only ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three. Personally, I'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing. In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think that that is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Miyazaki's best, as it displays all his strengths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (in order to be able to type this). I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice.I've seen all Miyazaki &amp; Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist (Mononoke). At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one.In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro. Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being. The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it.It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist.Despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact. If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki's screenplay here is just excellent. The story is imaginative and at times quite moving, plus there are many funny moments to be had along the way. The characters are however overly silly and only ever lightly developed, but everything else about the script works so well that it easy to forgive its shortcomings. The music is rather charming and the animation itself is great too. Some of the violence does not quite work, but there are so many other scenes that simply radiate with beauty. The running time of over two hours is a bit lengthy, but watching it is by all means time well spent. If not quite the masterpiece that 'Spirited Away' is, this one comes pretty close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually impressive and engaging adventure with a solid narrative, characters and voice-work ? great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the airship she is on is attacked, Sheeta tries to escape from her would-be captors but falls to her death through the clouds. Fortunately the enchanted and mysterious crystal she is wearing round her neck saves her and floats her to the ground where she is found by young Pazu, who is rushing to get back to his boss in the mine with food. Pazu takes her in and they become friends but quickly learn that the pirates after Sheeta have not given up their chase. Not only do the pair have to deal with the pirates but also the government, led by sinister agent Muska, have their own dark reasons for getting hold of Sheeta. Escaping Pazu's town together is only the start of their adventure together.Hard to believe that this film is twenty years old and yet looks as fresh and is as engaging as anything else you will see today. The sheer visual style and imagination is quite breath-taking and I could not quite believe that this was made by Miyazaki only 7 years after the vastly inferior (but still OK) Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro (or The Castle of Cagliostro as it was in the UK). As writer he has also done well to craft a story that is engaging and enjoyable. It struggles at times with the weight of coincidence needed to make the film move forward but the manner of delivery covers up these little problems by producing regular action and fun characters. The pace of the film is perfectly pitched and things move forward really well and I can't imagine an audience of children or adults will be bothered by the running time. The characters bring out nice relationships as well which adds value to the story but unfortunately points made late in the film about the environment and such are heavily made and clunky.The voice cast in the English dub are mostly very good. Sadly the weakest link is Paquin, she sounds unnatural and a little wooden too often. She probably isn't that weak but she is shown up by an engagingly fresh and natural delivery from Van Der Beek ? not something I expected to be saying when I learnt he was doing the voice of Pazu. Just as good is Leachman's Dola ? blessed with a good character in the first place, her voice is spot on despite sounding a little like Mrs Skinner on the Simpsons. Hamill takes the bad guy role well and shows his experience at animation even if he is a little hammy at the odd point. Everyone works well together and they deliver their characters well to support the narrative and they match the impressive visuals well.Overall this may not have the emotional depth of Spirited Away but it has strong characters and good relationships. These are grown within a engaging story told with pace and a good rate of action. Of course if none of this interests you then it is still worth seeing for Miyazaki's imagination and style, which is impressive and hard to believe that it is 20 years old this year.</fullReview>

I had seen spirited away, so I was somewhat familiar with Miyazaki's work, but this is a masterpiece. The animation is simple but fantastic and magical -a cinematic experience of divine wonderment is created before your trembling eyes. The storyline is complex, but it is centered around the relationship between Sheeta and Pazu. Through the exploration of Laputa, the magical, almost unreal castle in the sky, they find love, happiness, and each other. Prepare to delve into this, the most visually stunning masterwork of the greatest animation director of our feeble and changing time. Face wonder, excitement, romance, and above all else, a backdrop that will inspire even the most weak-hearted, uncreative, and destitute. A+++!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Castle in the sky is probably Miyazaki's second best film (after Spirited Away). It is the film that was my introduction to Anime after I saw a earlier English language dub in the 80's. I had the common sense to tape it back then and still have it (although it is somewhat over-watched).The Disney dub is at least as good as the 80's one (the music sounds richer and some of the voices are better, although Padsu's voice is a little jarring after the voice from the 80's version).As for the plot, Laputa has everything. Robots, airships, levitation stones, flying islands, pirates and Mark Hamill as a bad-guy. Who could ask for more.All in all, I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early masterpiece from Miyazaki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best), 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke-hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'. And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke. While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. And that would be a crime.As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service') - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek (Yeah, the Dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs...), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty) and Mandy Patinkin (Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...) Good for a laugh, or a few laughs really. But watch the Japanese one first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you probably know Miyazaki created many animes. This is one of his works, and like all of his works, it is simply amazing. Many people do not realize this but Most of Miyazaki's movies are intended for older/adult audiences, despite the fact that it seems like for children. Therefore even adults will appreciate his movies. The story is kind of slow in the beginning because it seems that the rising action part has to be long for the audiences to understand. It is after about 1/3 of the movie when it gets exciting. The story is just amazing and watching this will brings all the fantasies that you had when you were kid. The animation is beautiful, although if you saw all of his movies the character shapes and landscapes do start to change. I was little disappointed with animation because it wasn't as sharp and beautiful as his later works but it still surpasses most animations out there. Even if you are not a fan of anime this is a must see for everyone. I would give this movie 9.2/10.BTW: Why is it spelled Rapyuta in Japanese version? Because Japanese language lack certain pronounciation that exist in English/latin, therefore it is easier for them to say "ra" than "la" and "pyu" than "pu".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone for Japanese cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky is a true fantasy masterpiece as well as very well done, and very entertaining. The movie tells the story about a boy named Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek) who finds a girl named Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin)floating down from the sky with some mysterious crystal on her necklace, and then it comes on to a race against time to find the legendary Laputa (aka the castle in the sky) against pirates and foreign agents in order to get to it to prove that it is real before any one else does. The animation for this film is just excellent, as well as the writing, acting, and the story-line to the film. Miyazki directs this film with adventurous passion, and excellence that he fulfills his effort to direct the best animated Japanese film since Grave of the Fireflies (1988). There is also a great supporting voice cast which includes Oscar winner Cloris Leachman as the leader of the pirates Dola, and the original Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill as Muska one of the foreign agents who wants to use the power of the floating castle for evil purposes. But in the end it is one of the best movies ever made and as well as being s film that I consider to be a Miyazaki classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki turns fantasy on its wonderful, conventional head once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castle in the Sky (full title Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is another in the extraordinary works in the cannon of Hayao Miyazaki, who is arguably the master of fantasy in animation, worldwide. It's plot should be able to read through easily, at least for anyone who's seen the main conventional point of either the Dark Crystal or Lord of the Rings (probably the former is a little more accurate). A princess has to get to a location with a sacred object- in this case an rock-amulet- and take it to the main power source on Laputa, a secret castle that can barely be said to exist except in rumor. She goes on an adventure with another curious party, a boy, and the two of them have to contend with pirates and a nefarious man in a suit along the way. The twists are turned on a familiar premise at every step, however, because Miyazaki lets his imagination and influences spring out all over the place. We get vines and clouds and Superman-inspired robots! What Castle in the Sky promises is what it delivers full-throttle; it's action and excitement for a family audience (and it's not to sound patronizing; dudes in their 20s and gals in their 30s will love this as much as the little ones who sought out Spirited Away and Totoro so), and humor in bits and pieces as well (maybe not as much as Totoro, or skewed in a surreal way like Mononoke, but it's still there in a light tone with the pirates). And the design overall should capture everyone's fancy; from the Goliath ship to the little details of the robots to the expanse and crevices of Laputa, to what looks like it MUST have been special visual FX animation, it's all mind-boggling and mind-blowing at the same measure. It might not be Miyazaki's ultimate triumph, but it's still great film-making, a triumph of imagination to deliver on a tale of good vs. evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic animated adventure worth visiting over and over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Animated films can become a lot of things (especially nowadays with updated technology and a newfound respect for the medium), including romantic, life changing, groundbreaking, political, or sometimes just flatout surreal in scale. No longer are animated films just cartoons for kids to watch and enjoy, that stereotype is long gone. However, epic is not a word you can use to describe animated films, because they just don't happen often. Animated movies with the ability to become compared to the likes of Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Ben-Hur, Seven Samurai and other epic films past and present are extremely rare to find. However if there is a man that can weave a blockbuster animated tale, it would be the Japanese answer to America's Walt Disney. Castle in the Sky is epic in scale, with a massive adventure full of lush scenery, incredible action, memorable characters, and a nice dosage of humor. If there is an epic cartoon, it would be this underrated masterpiece.Castle in the Sky follows two kids that met under curious circumstances (Sheeta and Pazu) racing against pirates, the army, and mysterious agents in pursuit of a mythical castle located somewhere in the skies above the clouds. Sheeta is aided by a mysterious necklace given to her by her parents when she was younger. All the competition has their differing reasons on why they want to find the castle, ranging from gold to unleashing God-like powers. The film works mainly because the story is very unique, very original, and quite unpredictable. Written by Hayao Miyazaki, this film is the best evidence that his mind is among the most creative in film-making within the past century.The world displayed here is among the most gorgeous in the history of animation. There are massive airships the size of cities, caves that can look like the bowels of outer space, entire worlds that just float high midair and just entire towns built on the mountainside, leading to some unique and detailed architecture. No computer-work here, as this movie proves that hand-drawn animation's personal touch can be as magical as the best visual effects coming from any computer. The variety in colors and images here trounces those of Miyazaki's more popular works, like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.The epicness can be mainly traced to the consistent amount of peril and action throughout the two hours of pure movie magic. The opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film, while a humorous yet impressive train chase half an hour later provides some of the best thrills ever seen in an animated movie. Every so often humor breaks off the epic taint in the production, but it never dwells or outstays its welcome. Steampunk is a tough sell, since it's a historical and contextual contradiction. But in Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki gives the viewers time to adapt and witness the technological advancements and mannerisms of the characters in the film so you don't become too distracted by the unrealistic nature of it all.Miyazaki is the current Walt Disney, because not only does he avoid sequels (Pixar is unfortunately dwelling in this path) but he does his best to deliver a different animated experience every time he releases something new. Like Walt Disney himself, he can seamlessly blend humor, heart, and suspense all in one. He has the pacing, patience, and abilities of any decent Hollywood director, but with film you can do so much more. You can create shots that real-life cameras could never accomplish; and with animation you can create visuals that not a single CGI machine could ever duplicate. This is perhaps the main reason why Miyazaki avoids too much computer animation and avoids filming real-life altogether. When mentioning great directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, Peter Jackson, and David Fincher, Miyazaki is more than worthy to be mentioned in the sentence.Bottom Line: Castle in the Sky is a flawless work of art that spins audiences into a beautiful world full of steampunk goodness and lush scenery that's obviously influenced by the underrated landscape of Japan. Within the confides of this beautiful world (that travels by sea, land, and air) lies a wonderful story full of humor, heart, action, suspense, and an underlying message that's present in almost all Miyazaki movies. Pixar obviously has taken notes from the works on Japanese Walt Disney, as this movie has scenes and moments that can be compared to those of Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and even Up. If you enjoy excellent animated movies, you cannot miss this gem, as it's entertaining, thrilling, and mystical from the first second to the last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time I viewed this Miyazakian work, I viewed it in the long lost 1986 English dub as I managed to dreg up a VHS from the nether regions of forgotten items. I'm not normally an admirer of dubbings, rather preferring to listen to the film in its truest context, and multi-tasking in the duality required to watch the film. The new dub is not particularly successful however. Optimistic and buoyed by the 86 version, Disney lost the plot. Replacing quintessential humanism and character traits, with big names, for the big return. However, in which ever context you view this film, it is (in a time when the word is so flippantly used) an epic. The humanism and raw emotion coupled with 1930s-esque styled adventure movies provides a sheer hotpot of entertainment ripe for any occasion. The film more than entertains, yet doesn't bare the hallmarks of overrated, nonsensical, unnecessary fight scenes, opting for calmer, yet still thrilling, "chase" and "action" sequences. The plot is encapsulating, checking all the quotas for the Miyazakian masterpiece checklist. Miyazaki is a master of charting adolescent journeying. The emotional growth his characters go through is superbly done, as not to seem condescending or patronising, all the while being simple believable and simply magical.Reviews often delve into the content of the film, revealing spoilers, but merely look at the support for Miyazaki's films on this website alone!!! This doesn't arise from techno-nerds, neo-skaters and all the social sects of pubescent society wishing to carry the cool card by the knowledge of foreign anime. This film is simply stunning. An encapsulating roller-coaster of a journey, with genuine feelings and genuine people (for cartoons). Miyazaki's ratings come from his attention to plot, first and foremost. This is why he's successful, because his movies carry a message but are engrossing and entertaining.This may not be the most helpful review as to the films plot line, but let it be known, once watched you will be addicted. If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, this is a prime tester, with Nausicaa and Mononoke somewhat on the "heavy" side, and whilst Spirited Away is as close to perfection as cinema can be, it is a dish best served til later, to fully appreciate. Laputa is a film for any mood.Yet, the thing that always stands out for me, is the score. The final moments at the end of the film, when the theme Kimi o Nosete begins, is truly exquisite. Yes, it is 80s in its composition, yet coupled with the emotive nature of the film, never fails to jerk a nerve. Superb story-telling. Superb film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Film from THE Hayao Miyazaki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Fantastic and breathe taking at the same time. Castle in the Sky is one of my 5 top personal favorites of Miyazaki's films.The best thing about this movie is that it's taken place in a world containing Aircraft machines of all kinds. This film shows how Miyazaki likes flying machines. It's an old anime film, but it's very well animated for an old movie.The animation, story, background, characters, and voice talents are all great. It's a blend of Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Comedy, and Drama all in one. The voice overs for the English version is very amusing, Mark Hamil is excellent with his role as the main villain Col. Musca. Jim Cumming(Famous Voice actor) plays a General, not a common role but he's just great with the part.The entire movie is all great from beginning to the end. Many of Miyazaki's films don't often have a good vs. bad related story. This movie how ever is like one of his only ones containing an actually villain, and this movie's villain is a cool one too.I give it 8/10, I recommend buying or renting the movie. It's suitable for Ages 8 and up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Does Miazaki Do it ??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miazaki, only great ideas have come out of your head ever since you started some of the best anime films of all time especially this one. This was the first work of yours i have ever seen which may hold the answer to why I like it the best. The characters Pazu, Sheetah, dola were all developed I especially liked the view on colonel Muska in how he was your friend and your enemy at the same time.The idea of a castle floating in the sky is just amazing, Miazaki I'm sure has one of the most creative minds in the world. I especially liked the background of laputa in which Pazu's father saw it which inspired young Pazu and sheetah to find it although Sheetah was already the Queen or Princess of Laputa. This was definitely my favorite Anime of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Hayao Miyazaki`s films since I saw the wonderful "Princess Mononoke", but I did not get a chance to see "Castle in the sky" until a couple of weeks ago. "Castle in the sky" is just a fabolous movie with wonderful animation, a great musical score, great characters and everything that make Miyazaki`s films so great and different from anything else. If you want an anime-adventure, then this is one of the best you could ever wish for.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best again from Hayao Miyazaki...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Castle in the Sky" is an animation movie in which we watch a young boy and a young girl with a magic crystal who are trying to protect themselves but also the crystal from pirates and foreign agents. They are also trying very hard to find a legendary floating castle something that is really difficult to succeed but they are not giving up their tries.In general I like animation movies and when I watch an animation movie which made by the master Hayao Miyazaki then I have to say that I loved it. The direction which made from Hayao Miyazaki of course was as I expected perfect and I also liked it very much. This movie I can compare it only with another movies that made by Hayao Miyazaki and these are: "Spirited Away", "My Neighbor Totoro" and of course "Howl's Moving Castle" in which I found some things in common.Lastly I have to say that "Castle in the Sky" is not a simple animation movie which you would think when you first see it, it's something extremely different than this. It's a lesson for life in general and at the same time especially for each person separately, this is something that makes this movie special. In this the most important reason was that this movie made by Hayao Miyazaki who has the gift to give us many things that we could not think before watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like the studio and Director would be a give away that this would be good. I don't know what to fully talk about as everything about this show is amazing from the story to the animation to the dub. Even the comedy doesn't get in the way of the great story that lies within this show. Only one or two things bother me but they aren't that big, like when Pazu jumps off his house and ends up breaking through bricks into his basement with no broken bones or nothing. Of course, these problems are minor and don't happen all that much.Miyazaki seems to always have a moral to his stories, this is no different. I think the moral is that any civilization can fall if they think they are to powerful. Laputa, a place that seemed like it was a perfect place had power, wealth, and even a sense of magic. They had something special but even they ended up falling. The story line is full of spoilers if I try to explain even more but there is a beautiful story that is as mysterious as it is sad and thoughtful.The animation is so beautiful and stands up even to this day. All hand done with so much detail and the painting of the backgrounds? I could just go on. If you seen others by Miyazaki, you know his style and he never falters. This is one of those times where I just feel speechless to how wonderful his style of art is, the colors just pop even though at times they do end up taking very small short cuts. I also didn't really notice any times where the characters would just stop moving for a very long time with only their mouths moving. He would have them moving even slightly and it would feel realistic. There are even small things like how a character would eat from the dainty way Sheeta eats to the mess that Dola's sons make. One thing I did notice (And it's a slight spoiler I guess) is that his characters sometimes look better with short hair then with long hair. Not telling you what that means but you will find out. The opening is much different then the actual show, feeling more like it was done in a rather old style, highly detailed, even more so then the animation and like they were from detailed renders.The music is so beautiful, with amazing orchestral sounds that you could just fall asleep to. I love everything about Studio Ghibi's work and the music is one of those that I wish I had all the soundtracks. They do not let much go past them that isn't quality controlled. I could listen to it for days without it getting boring. The English dub is spot on, I'm extremely happy it didn't turn into a flop like one of their first tries for English translation.If you have not seen this yet, you have to see it soon. It's a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite animated film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laputa: Castle in the Sky is my favourite animated film and it happens to be my 3rd favourite film of all time. I have seen all 11 of Miyazaki's films and I got to say, this is my favourite by far. I love practically everything about this Anime. The music score, animation, characters, story, humour, creativity and just the sense of adventure and fun are all amazing and create one of the best, if not the best animated film to have ever been made in my opinion. What's also wonderful is the atmosphere. There are some scenes with no dialogue, but the music, animation and the scenery allows you to take in the mystery and wonder that the film and the world it's created has to offer. Castle in the Sky has everything you could want in a film. Even if you don't like Anime, you have to see this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki's Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by "Gulliver's Travels," the fantasy-adventure Castle in the Sky was Hayao Miyazaki's third feature, and helped to establish his reputation as a visionary in both Japan and the United States.The film is about a young boy and a girl with a magic crystal must race against pirates and foreign agents in a search for a legendary floating castle.As for the elements of the film,it echoes in Myazaki's earlier Nausica, and anticipates imagery in his later films, from My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away. The English dub, which features Anna Paquin, James Van Der Beek and Cloris Leachman,is lively and close in tone to the original Japanese, if a bit talkier.Aside from that,the exciting flying sequences, appealing characters, and fantastic vision of a steam- powered future Jules Verne might have imagined make Castle in the Sky a must-have for fans of Japanese and Western animation.The viewer will obviously have an uplifting experience as it's the perfect place to view where Miyazaki has been and where he intends to go.Overall,it is the greatest film he has ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is it people: the best adventure film ever made. The film combines all the good qualities of the Indiana Jones films with greater dramatic deepness, a vastly superior soundtrack, composed by Joe Hisaishi, for me the best film composer ever and a more complex story than the simplistic stories of the Indy films (though, by no means, it is a very complex film). While the main characters are 12-year old kids, one could argued that this film is indeed more adult than the Indy films, as it is handled on a more serious tone and has also a serious underlying message, though not as remotely as serious as Nausicaa.The film also has a massive amount of "cool stuff", such as the technological marvels shown and the incredible quality of the action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely beautiful, and one of Studio Ghibli's most imaginative works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot begin to describe how much I love this film. I love Studio Ghibli, and Castle in the Sky is one of my absolute favourites from them. It has a highly imaginative story for starters, every bit as imaginative as Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind's. Once again, the animation is magnificent, as is the haunting and poignant music score. The dialogue and pacing are fine too, and the characters are never devoid of their likability and are wonderfully voiced by a top notch voice cast. Castle in the Sky is an absolutely beautiful film, but it is also quite haunting helped enormously by the music and visuals. It is an amazing and I think unforgettable film, one of the best animes, perhaps even animated movies I have seen. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent display of animation that is hand drawn. A story of a little girl which harnesses a powerful gem for which some very bad guys want for themselves. This includes pirates who in their own way, are the good guys, yet wanted the gem as well. Yet for a boy who works as a metal miners apprentice he finds this girl floating from the sky as if by magic. Taking her in, only to be chased by the relentless bad guys and pirates. All trekking to a place called Laputa, a mythical city that floats in the sky. The lineage to the girl is that she is the princess and heir to the throne of this legendary city. Yet her parents moved themselves down to the earth where they can live out their days in harmony. Abandoning the city altogether because of the constant hardships and hierarchy battles within the royal family. But as all circles go, she is thrust to her past home along with her friend only to be caught and nearly killed by a power hungry ex royal of the ancient kingdom. I loved the landscapes and beautiful hand drawn complexities for the final destruction to the old floating city. A wonderful story of pirates, the army, the psycho, and the devastating robots which harnessed the most destructive power ever created. To see two people bind closely together along with the help of their friends and overcome the shadow of Laputa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As you wish, I would explain about the pirates' affection with Sheeta.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casting Sheeta as the main character is definitely what made this movie unique after so many years, since Sheeta is a natural charmer. But since many of the users here are asking about the relationship of Sheeta and the pirates, I'd have to explain my understanding.Firstly, a little girl at age 13 is both a sign of purity/innocence and liveliness, so all the characters, despite gender, age or any other demographic characters, would treat her with courtesy. The only exception is the self-imposed king of castle of sky Muska. He is the materialized human mental as greed and ambition, with the pursuit in civilization and unlimited destruction of nature and human/naturally/manufactured lives. He is, naturally, despised by all the good guys in the movie.Compared to him are the goofy/foul/lovely pirates who had a strong mom who always control them and maintained their simple mental and lives. Even though they are death-wish burglars who defy the law, they didn't commit much of the crimes of species-annihilation and mass-murdering own comrades, which were committed by Muska. So, in some certain senses, pirates were only materialized naughty boys who's physically pushing 40 but mentally only 13-15 years old. The appearance and companion of Sheeta, was not only their enlightenment of puppy love, but also a strong reflection to their mom's undefeated personality. The funny thing is they never even dare challenging Pazu and Sheeta's friendship(lovers' relationship?) and close contacts, they salivate for such a relationship but also realized that Pazu's mentally mature and taking heavy responsibilities, which they can't have....So in some senses, they are mummy's good boys.In Japanese culture, men are too much burdened, with responsibility, honor and all kinds of stuff which finally killed him before his old age(like karachi) or destroyed his personality(making him a alcoholic). Hayao Miyazaki created these fearless and trouble-less pirates to reflect on such social status and promote his own value system for men, which was even developed in later projects, all portraying strong women's influences on men.Castle in the sky is a fairy tale about two kids' fellowship which lasted even longer than their civilization. It's also a subtle fable about the direction of all civilizations. The first 5 minutes of the movie were absolutely tear-jerking, with all sorts of sci-fi sky-ships floating and landing and escorting in an ancient wall-paint style. It's marked with 1980's animation technical limit, but it's still so moving and touching after the 1st viewing. Every time the flying stone shines and Sheeta flies, the whole animation were saturated with a kind of beauty and poetry that is not easily described by words. Not to mention the breathtaking final scenes where the structure of the entire castle in the sky fell apart. If you ever look closely, the bricks fell one by one, no kidding.Sheeta and Pazu were, in my and my parents' opinion, too young to have such a relationship. But on earth, what's the wrong with this relationship? They were only kids, more specifically, orphans. But they were both brave, dedicated and much more responsible than most adults in the story. Their love for each other fixed their immaturity by giving them the absolute basis for fighting for each other. So in this way, Castle in the sky is also one of the best love story ever written.Had to mention the robots in the movie. These robots are not emphasized by their robotic movements, rather, they are portrayed as lives with robot mechanics. So their fates were also cared about by all the kids and adults audiences alike.Castle in the Sky is still underachieved on this site and it will receive more attention and higher rating as time goes by. If you haven't seen it, go purchase it on DVD because it's definitely worth buying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great film from Miyazaki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film to be made by Japan's Studio Ghibli and as one would expect from that studio it is an excellent film. The animation is of a very high standard and Joe Hisaishi's music fits the movie very well.The film follows the adventures of Sheeta and Pazu as they search for the titular Laputa. In the opening scenes airborne pirates attack an airship that a young girl (Sheeta) is travelling on as a prisoner of Muska, who appears to be an agent of the government. During the confusion Sheeta manages to escape but while fleeing slips and falls from the airship. As she falls the crystal on her pendant starts to glow and instead of plummeting to her death she slowly drifts to earth where she is caught be a Pazu, a boy about her age.The two of them soon end up on the run from both the pirates and the military. When captured by Muska Pazu is let go and told to forget about Sheeta but can't. When he gets home and finds the pirates already there he joins forces with them as they want Sheeta as she can help them find Laputa, which they believe to be full of treasure. Meanwhile Sheeta says a spell which she was taught as a child and her pendent glows and points a beam of light towards Laputa. It also awakens a giant robot, which had fallen from the sky some time before, it proceeds to escape from the castle basement in which it is stored and help free Sheeta. She is then reunited with Pazu and the pirates and they race against Muska to get to Laputa.That is just a brief summary, I don't wish to say how it ends. The film is exciting though out and should be ideal both for children and who want an exciting story that is well told without excessive violence. Some scenes may be a little frightening for younger children but for the most part it is just exciting. As with most of Hayao Miyazaki's films there are plenty of thrilling flying sequences as well as a chase involving a train and a car on an elevated railway line.The only parts I wasn't so keen on were a couple of scenes that seemed somewhat cartoony such as when two characters flexed their muscles and burst of of their shirts in a way that reminded me of "The Incredible Hulk", that said I'm sure it would amuse younger viewers so I can't really hold it against the film. I think it says something about the quality of the animation and the story that such a detail would stand out, after all it is an animated film.I watched the film in Japanese with English subtitles so can't comment on the quality of the English dub.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They released this film (as a re-release) just after howl's moving castle had visited the cinemas, and at first I didn't want to check it out because the title - a castle in the sky - seemed too similar to the former, but then, because it is miyazaki, after all, i couldn't resist, and i must say i totally loved it. It was like a real time-travel in terms of miyazaki development: you can see where he gets lots of character designs for the future from, especially when it comes to 'grannies' and the soundtrack. The story was very cool, the start was very dramatic and left you asking a lot of questions (like a real appetizer) about what happens. I was very impressed with pazu, especially as a role-model kind of character, and I think the relationship between him and sheeta is the most romantic miyazaki to date. those of you who are well acquainted with miyazaki's other works will recognise certain things as if they were directly taken from here, some of it really is quite uncanny, but you've got to love it all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Studio Ghibli's Greatest - High Praise Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far and away one of the top movies of all time, the awesomely inventive Castle In The Sky also serves as a fine showcase for how spectacular the field of Japanese anime is, a field whose best productions remain, with a couple of exceptions, to be largely unknown to North American audiences.Occupying a spot somewhere between the wonderful Disneyesque animations of the U.S. and darker, more intense animations like the brilliant Princess Mononoke, Castle In The Sky tells the story of a mysterious girl who falls to Earth from a sky train, her descent slowed by a magical gem, and the alliance she makes with a young boy searching for a legendary 'Castle In The Sky', in hopes of finding out more about her true origins. The characters, Sheeta and Pazu, are about 14-16, a common age for protagonists in anime, particularly anime from Studio Ghibli (which has also produced such outstanding fare as Whisper Of The Heart, Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, and the above-mentioned Princess Mononoke, to name just a few). Full of surprise, wonder, adventure and unforgettable characters (all Ghibli staples, actually, as is the 'innocent first romance' angle played so beautifully here) and featuring some of the most beautiful animation imaginable, great voice acting (Anna Paquin as Sheeta and James Van Der Beek as Pazu are especially impressive in the English dubbed version), stunning concept designs and a great musical score, Castle In The Sky is one of the must-see movies of all time. With films like this and the other Ghiblis, as well as non-Ghibli anime like Millennium Actress, the Haibane Renmei series, and Steamboy, I will Never understand how anime has yet to become as huge in most of the rest of the world as it has in Asia. One of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki then you will LOVE 'Laputa castle in the sky'. The story focuses on an Orphan girl Sheeta who literally falls from the sky to be caught by another young orphan boy, Pazu, together the two of them discover that the crystal necklace around Sheeta's neck is no ordinary necklace, it is in fact a relic from the levitation stone on the floating magical island of Laputa. The two of them realise the importance of the necklace when they are chased by crazy pirates and evil government agents all of whom want to capture and harness the power of the crystal for themselves. Together Sheeta and Pazu go in search of the floating island of laputa and encounter many twists and turns on the way! A simply great animated film and one where the dubbed English version is as good if not better than the original Japanese version. A must see for any studio Ghibli fan. Better than 'Spirited away' by far!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki Takes to the Sky: A Review of Castle in the Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki has become the toast of the animation world with his effortless successfully epics, like Princess Monoke and Spirited Away, establishing a reputation of international acclaim. But, long before he made epics with environmental messages and films with more magic than you can shake a magic wand with, he made this; Tenk? no shiro Rapyuta, better known as Castle in the Sky, which pre-dates all of his box-office grossing fantasies he has become renowned for the world over. In addition, in my humble opinion, Castle in the Sky remains his best film by far.For those of you who have not viewed this epic yet, the storyline is a boy becomes friend with this girl, who has fallen from the sky but landed safe fully with a magic medallion she wears. They soon end up being chased by pirates and agents trying to hunt down her medallion, as this is the only artefact to a floating castle known as Laputa; you need to bear in mind that the boy always wanted to explore this legendary castle. So, with his passion in mind, the boy and girl eventually team up with the pirates, and set off to find this castle, although they have been followed by the agents to steal its treasures. I will leave the story there, but will note that the ending is climatic and exciting, as they work out who the girl really is.With such a story that is never that straightforward at times, there is more that such a fantastic story that makes this my all-time favourite animated film. Why, you ask? For starters, there are action-packed sequences, like the chase sequence through the mines, executed with great suspense as well as being entertaining to the audience. There are also some great comic moments, such as the men showing off their muscles before they start a fight in the street. Trust me, with the character designs for these guys, and the character animation done well to exploit their expressions; it is only just the tip of the iceberg of some great comic moments present in Miyazaki's masterpiece. Also, as a member of the audience, the development of the main characters is done brilliantly, as we view a relationship between the boy and the girl throughout this film. This is something you do not see that much in animated cinema, as such schmaltz in over polished western animated films spoil this progression tragically.So, for those who think Hayao Miyazaki is just another celebrated animation director for this current climate of animated cinema in recent years, they better think again. This is because he has been successfully establishing his trademarks, such as the focus on children and his indulgent passion for flight, brilliantly for a long time before he made his truly deserved impact on the international scene. Castle in the Sky shows Miyazaki at his best, which is a standard he has been developing ever since, entertaining and fascinating millions worldwide along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece: visually stunning and full of poetry. Again, Miyazaki shows his ability to rediscover a child's sense of wonder. The plot here, like that of Princess Mononoke, demonstrates his mythopoetic genius: he has taken elements from existing stories and woven them into a compelling, visionary narrative: here we have the world of Dickens married to Swift's floating island Laputa, with dashes of swashbuckling pirate tales. Miyazaki is always fascinated by flight (Kiki, Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, Totoro), but nowhere does he do anything as magical with that theme as here. He has transposed sea-going vessels, and all the imagery associated with it (pirates, ocean liners, great gunships), into the air. This film seems to cancel the real history of flight, and to substitute another, imaginary version. A double anachronism: this is the way the nineteenth century would have imagined flight. It cannot be denied either that the film has a strong emotional dimension: the boy who dreams of flying goes back to the mine and watches as a girl floats down from the sky into his arms! The film is filled with moments of stunning beauty, poetically and visually: Pazu and Sheeta in the gondola over the pirate ship watch the huge gunship emerge below them; the destruction of Laputa - the walls come crumbling down and rain into the sea - Apocalypse; the great tree of Laputa floats away at the end.The more I reflect on Miyazaki's films, the more I am convinced that he is one of the greatest filmmakers, one of the great artists of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, and I have been anxiously awaiting the Disney dub of this film. Luckily, I recently saw a subtitled version at a museum and let me say, it's a great movie. Like all of Miyazaki's films, you expect one thing you get another, but you are never disappointed. The film focuses on Pazu, who into his arms falls Sheeta, who holds the power to Laputa, the castle in the sky. They are chased by government agents and pirates (who they later befriend). It's a thrill ride the whole way through, and it's a wonderful movie. The visuals are amazing, and you have to give a ton of credit to the animators. The script is solid and the film is surprsingly funny, there is a lot of humor. So when Disney releases this one sometime in 2000, don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What dreams are made of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This anime is a pure chef-d'oeuvre. And you can believe a french man saying it. As usual, Miyazaki Hayao brings wonderful drawings, smooth character animation and background pictures have obviously been done with great art and hard work. What makes the difference with any Disney-like anime is the movie-making talent of the Ghibli Studio team. The scenario exists, it has depth and induces reflection. About the hopes of people, their fate, the greed of adults, their lack of imagination and permanent war-making attitude... In the center of the story, 2 children, who fight to find and to preserve Laputa, the flying castle/tree, magnificent and deadly. This movie makes you laugh, think, and it even made me cry (and that's not so frequent). My advice : watch it and go directly to sleep. The movie still runs in your dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Shot That Poor Girl's Hair Off!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: A young miner boy named Pazu, who dreams of proving the existence of the Castle in the Sky known as Laputa, a small part of which his father photographed many years ago, finds his life turned upside down when a mysterious girl named Sheeta (Shita in the original Japanese version) literally falls into his arms with an even more mysterious crystal hanging around her neck. Two factions are after her - a family of goofy pirates led by the elderly yet energetic Dola and government agents led by the sinister Muska allegedly on behalf of the military. But what is Muska truly after? Hayao Miyazaki's second full length animated feature has all the abundant energy and miraculous flying machinery one has come to expect from his colorful and seemingly boundless imagination. Lush, beautiful animation brings a miraculous story of good vs. evil to life in a way that few films can.I have never heard the original English language dub, but from what I've read it was assembled very quickly and was quite poor as a result, with its cast (which included Barbara Goodson and Lara Cody as the child leads) settling for just reading the dialogue without actually performing it. The Disney re-dub, recorded in 1998 but not released until 2003, is very good and will make the adventure enjoyable even for most subtitle purists. The only voice in the English version that doesn't quite work is Anna Pacquin as Sheeta. Anna is not exactly a great actress to begin with, but it doesn't take someone with Katherine Hepburn level talent to maintain a consistent voice, but this is something Anna herself is not able to do in this feature. Her voice is ultimately all over the place, sounding American one moment and then sounding like a British teenager in other parts and sadly not fitting the appearance of Sheeta at all. As Pazu, James Van Der Beek sounds more like a teenager than a little boy, but at least his voice is consistent and even his detractors would have a hard time denying that he brings a lot of energy to the role. However, the real stars of the English dub are Cloris Leachman as Dola and Mark Hamill as Muska. Leachman has plenty of fun with the wily pirate mother, while Hamill delivers a brilliantly sinister and cold blooded performance as Muska, arguably the only real villain Miyazaki has ever featured in any of his films. While Miyazaki's other films feature antagonists who have some redeeming qualities, whether it's showing kindness to the less fortunate (such as Lady Eboshi in "Princess Mononoke") or turn around and become somewhat better people (Witch of the Waste in Miyazaki's adaptation of "Howl's Moving Castle"), Muska has none of these sympathetic qualities. He's not fallen, he's not misguided, he's just bad, I mean he is just plain BAD, a power hungry tyrant who'll stop at nothing to get what he wants, including shooting a little girl's hair off one pigtail at a time (that image is burned into my memory, for better or worse, as one of the most disturbing acts of violence I've ever seen in a film), and Hamill plays him with just the right amount of flamboyant relish. At times the former Star Wars hero's Joker voice (from the various DCAU projects he was a part of) creeps in, but there's certainly nothing wrong with that.But no matter which language you watch it in, "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" is easily in the top 5 of must see Miyazaki films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really interesting movie that bears some resemblance to another great Miyazaki film, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. Like KIKI, the action takes place on some Earth-like world--so much like Earth but different because it had the weirdest flying machines and sky pirates! It was also rather reminiscent of the Dreamcast video game, The Skies of Arcadia. and the X-Box's Crimson Skies. Strange but also pretty intriguing--that's for sure. For fans of airplanes and vintage aviation, this is an especially appealing film.Well, in this world of sky pirates and bizarre flying machines comes the rumor of a floating castle in the sky. And, of course, our intrepid heroes are bent on finding it and unlocking its secrets.The film has amazing animation, a unique style and is very engaging. While kids will enjoy it immensely, unlike some Miyazaki films, I really think that in some cases adults might like this even more than kids. Good stuff well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it incredibly annoying when I'm watching a supposedly "exciting" film and I can see what's going to happen. A particularly bad example was the supposed SF horror-thriller "Pitch Black" when it was possible to work out who was going to be eaten next just by reading the names from the cast list in reverse order: those who had the biggest parts survived longest. "Laputa: Castle In The Sky" manages to be far more exciting and far less predictable, and does it all without foul language, explicit violence, or the kind of criminal superman Hollywood has loved ever since "The Silence of the Lambs". It would be too complicated for small children, but it's eminently suitable for adults as well as teenagers. As usual with Miyazaki's work the characters were well-rounded and believable, and that helped to keep me guessing as to what was going to happen next. I was on the edge of my seat right until the end. It need hardly be said that the film is visually striking too: perhaps the most astonishing of the Ghibli films I have seen, with the vast perspectives of Slagg's Ravine, houses clinging to the edge, the huge and strangely beautiful city of Laputa, the sullen fort which reaches up into the clouds, and the weird flying machines that are the "Goliath" and the "Tiger Moth". From an SF point of view it might be loosely categorised as steampunk?it's set in an alternative past with high technology?but it is a thrilling, well-written, beautiful film well-leavened with humour which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Castle in the Sky is my favorite Miyazaki film, and is as good as movies can get. The story is very accessible and straightforward. A young boy sees a young girl floating down from the sky. From that point on, the two of them share the coolest, wildest adventure that you can imagine. Actually, it exceeds anything you can imagine. They get chased by bad guys, hook up with air pirates, and eventually arrive at the legendary castle that floats in the sky.What I really love about this movie is that most of it takes place in the air. The flying machines, and fortresses, and warships were wonderfully inventive.The animation is not at the same level of brilliance of Miyazaki's later releases, but it will still take your breath away in places.If you love good old fashioned action adventure films, this is one that you have to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Hollywood listening yet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the Hollywood oil tanker continues to sail our cultural seas, spilling Hogwaarts students, aristocratic archaeologists and Charlie's Angels like so much poisonous crude oil, a thought occurs to me... 'why not watch a Miyazaki movie and pretend "Agent Cody Banks Goes To Hades" isn't about to be green lit for $80 million'Laputa is a feast in every way. Very rarely are children's characters so subtly and satisfyingly created on film. The relationship between the two leads, Pazu and Sheeta, is at the heart of this stunning fantasy-adventure, but also seeking the lost floating city (for different reasons) are colourful pirates and government agents who complete an excellent and ambiguous character dynamic.The film sits somewhere between Nausicaa and Totoro in terms of Miyazakis themes. It has the epic (and environmental) feel of the former with the latter's more personal focus on children's relationships and how honest friendship can ease the difficulties inherent in growing up. Sound sickly? Well it isn't. Miyazaki has almost supernatural judgment in these matters.For anyone looking for a film they can watch with the kids, you'll find this hard to beat. Nobody can bridge the generation gap like Miyazaki. Frankly, hardly anybody working today can make movies like Miyazaki.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Miyazaki masterpiece (surprise)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It almost sounds demeaning to call this one of the most enjoyable animated films I've ever seen; it is, in fact, one of the most enjoyable films of any kind I've ever seen. Anyone familiar with the work of Miyazaki will find a lot of familiar territory here: the rural setting, the preoccupation with aircraft, the mythic themes. What separates this (along with the hilarious "Porco Rosso") is its playful brand of movie-serial cliffhanger action. There's much more to smile at here than in its more serious cousins such as Mononoke and Nausicaa. It's one of the handful of films that one can point to when trying to demonstrate the heights of which animation is capable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Miyazaki triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 4th Miyazaki film I have seen so far (the others were "Kiki's Delivery Service", "Spirited Away", and "Princess Mononoke"). All I can say is that the man is a genius. This one is slightly different from his other films in that it leans more towards sci-fi than fantasy ... also, for the most part the focus of the animation is on architecture and structures, whereas most of his films are more about nature (though there are some beautiful natural scenes, especially later in the film). The animation is superb as usual, and the soundtrack is arguably the best of any of the aforementioned films. But the best thing about this movie is the strength of the character relationships; the true love and friendship between Pazu and Sheeta is one the most beautiful and heart-warming things I have EVER seen on film ... (also, the character 'Uncle' provides a rough prelude to one of the best characters in "Spirited Away", Kamagi the boiler-man); the character depth in this film also provides stark contrast to the dark, story-and-message focus of "Princess Mononoke" (probably my favourite Miyazaki film). Overall, this is another simply superb Miyazaki film - another true animated classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a great deal of fun, though the depth of thought behind it does not match that of others by the same director. My primary comment, though, is how very poor Anna Paquin was as the voice of Sheeta. Her accent varied from American to British to New Zealandic and back again with no apparent rhyme or reason. A very bizarre experience. She also seemed to play her character with little of the backbone that the lovely girl the movie portrays actually displayed. Otherwise, a must-see for Japanese animation fans! (And I hope everyone has already seen "My Neighbor Totoro"! A truly great movie in every respect!)</fullReview>

There wasn't a single moment that I was moved or gripped by the storyline. I didn't find it humorous either.The most entertaining part was when Pazu was watching Sheeta floating down to earth and it went downhill from that point.I think kids between 6 to 11 might enjoy it but as a 22 year old I was very, very bored throughout.Maybe I find it dull because it was made in 1986 and I've seen Nausica of the and Princess Mononoke first. Maybe if I watched them in reverse order I would have enjoyed this because I just felt I was watching a very poor version of what I'd already seen before (well the main themes of the story). And it also felt predictable.Big, big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sterling Work from One of the Greatest Directors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so glad John Lasseter is friends with Miyazaki. If he wasn't, we may not have gotten these movies dubbed and formally released stateside. Say what you want about dubs vs subs and blah blah blah, but I often enjoy closing my eyes and immersing myself in movies. And it also allows so many more people to see these movies. And they are movies that deserve to be seen.Lasseter's efforts here combined the fact that he more or less brought CGI animation to the masses have elevated him in my mind to the position of second most important person and third greatest person in animation to me. If you're wondering, the first list is Disney, Lasseter, Miyazaki and the second is Disney, Miyazaki, Lasseter.The crazy thing is that I come into these movies expecting to be blown away. Most movies where this is the case, even the ones I adore, like Shawshank and LOTR, are diminished just a bit by this. Not these movies. Every time I see them, they grab my soul and run with it. Part of it is that the movies are such a stark change from American animation in every regard. The tone, the style; it's all different. The closest American animations I've seen to these masterpieces are the old Disney movies, from which Miyazaki took inspiration. But even those are only half as long as these movies and not nearly as epic. The other part of it is that they are just so good.The images stick in my mind. For example, in the first third of this movie, the main characters go into an underground cave and the crystals react with a medallion that Sheena, one of the leads, is wearing. When they see why, they cut the rocks and it is revealed that there is what is dubbed as aetherium in them. In many other films, it would be a simple, expository scene. In this, it is a stylistic, atmospheric triumph. Scenes like that are littered throughout the movie. And they stick in my mind, as good animation and only good animation can do.Another, more personal reason why I love Miyazaki films is that I share with him a deep love of aviation. The word Ghibli, the name of the studio, even means 'hot wind blowing in from the Sahara.' It is one of his three trademarks, if you will, the other two being environmental messages and strong female protagonists, two things that are done well and subtly here, to the film's credit. The inclusion of aviation, on the other hand, is not subtle, and I love that about it. In fact, the sky and flight are probably featured more here than in any of his other movies, and that is saying something. For a major part of the movie, they don't even touch the earth.The flying scenes are all excellent. But I think my favorite is one near the middle of the film at sunset. It is in full color in my mind even as I write this review. Despite being a short scene, it makes you feel like you're in the sky like no other moment in any movie.It perfectly encapsulates the emotions which come with sunset, flight, and the air itself and mix it together into one bit of atmosphere that is invocative enough to pull your soul from your body, at least for a minute.The plot and pacing remind me, strangely, of Titanic. Not in any obvious way, but in that they both take a conventional tale and make it feel fresh and new, like you are a little kid hearing it for the first time. The characters are fleshed out well and the writing achieves a balance of making you know who they are without bogging the film down. The score is one of Hisaishi's best, and once again, that is saying something. I would compare the partnership between him and Miyazaki to the one between Williams and Spileberg, but, and I mean no offense to the latter pair, these two are above them. While Williams is a fine composer, I would argue that Hisaishi is one of the best composers of any kind over the last century.And the artwork? I've already said enough about how pretty this film is. In fact, the sequence of this movie that won me over is an artistic one. The opening credits sequence ( didn't take the film that long) is done in a different style, one that fits the movie like nothing else could and lays the groundwork for the movie ahead. Wow.This film is centered around the pursuit of a castle in the sky. And while it is stunning, as you know if you have watched this film, it cannot top another castle in the sky: the film itself. It is truly thus; as mystic and potent and artistic as Lapita itself. And unlike the main characters in the film, you don't have to go against a Mark Hamill-led military in order to get to it.</fullReview>

Although I have to admit, herself and Pazu were such a cute couple! I wish they both actually kissed instead of leaving the scene already in the end!I was surprised that Mark Hamil aka Luke Skywalker and Jim Cummings aka Dr Eggman from SatAm (Sonic the hedgehog series) were involved in this anime movie.

		<fullReview>The story and characters of Castle in the Sky (1986) are not wholly original: Miyazaki had already told a story of a plucky boy and a girl with mysterious power against a corrupt villain out to resurrect ancient, apocalyptic technology in his TV series, Future Boy Conan (1978). However, both the world and the characters of CitS are more fleshed out than their TV counterparts.The world-building is phenomenal, a fantastical 19th century world of giant airships and floating islands. It would not surprise me if this film has inspired many a steampunk novel or movie.The animation and backgrounds are superb. The music is equally haunting and whimsical. The characters are so likable, the themes of technology and corruption still relevant. The film is fun and full of action, but there are also meditative moments and poignancy.Overall, Studio Ghibli could not have gotten a better start than with this charming fantasy-adventure.</fullReview>

The animation is wonderful to look at, the characters are worthy of our attention, the voice actors have done a fine job in bringing their given roles to life, the camera-work is pretty fluid &amp; the minimalistic use of score works like an enchantment. Also, the floating castle of Laputa is a sight to behold &amp; its meticulous detailing only evokes more admiration for the effort that went into its creation.On an overall scale, Castle in the Sky is the feature film which commenced the legacy of now- legendary Studio Ghibli on a considerably high note and although it isn't one of Miyazaki's finest films in my opinion but its uplifting story &amp; quality narration is impressive enough to make sure that its viewers are entertained &amp; intrigued throughout its runtime. A powerhouse of creativity &amp; imagination, Castle in the Sky is an awe-inspiring work from a master storyteller that promises an enriching cinematic experience &amp; delivers it effortlessly.

		<shortDescription>First true Ghibli film and a testament to its talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the success of Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were able to found Studio Ghibli, and this was their first official feature film. And what a great film it was and still is, having withstood the test of time remarkable well. Inspired by Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, it's a tale about a world that has fallen into ruin after a golden age - a common theme with Miyazaki - and the miracles of yesterday have become legends and myths. Including Laputa, the eponymous castle in the sky. Yet there are still those that search for it.In a lot of ways, this is a very good introduction into films directed by Miyazaki. It's a relatively simple story, yet it keeps you hooked from the very first scene. It's very kid-friendly, but has deeper themes and even a few dark scenes. The characters are both memorable and identifiable. Pretty much all of them are the kind of people you would like to know and have along on an adventure - with the exception of one or two, but we'll get to them in a moment. And it has flying machines, industrial revolution -inspired populations, gorgeous animation, hauntingly beautiful music, great action scenes, all that good stuff.Yet I would still rank this amongst my least favourite Miyazaki films. (And yeah, I'm still giving this a nine out of ten. The man's that good.) The reason for that is the fact I think the villain's a bit weak. The character design isn't all that interesting, he comes off more pathetic than menacing and he's quite honestly a bit creepy in a way that doesn't match the tone the film is going for. Bad vibes, is all I'm saying. Still, his voice actor does a good job and he has a few good scenes, so I can deal with him. The side villains are a bit on the same boat, but they have less screen time, so they end up on the positive side.But as my rating should indicate, I think this is a very good film. Fun, engaging, beautiful - the perfect kid's film that adults can enjoy as well. Studio Ghibli couldn't have started its career with a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Castle in the Sky is a wonderfully made movie, filled to the brim with fun action scenes and hilarious jokes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the huge success of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, it's writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki, would go on to establish the now famous Studio Ghibli with fellow animator Isao Takahata in 1985. One year after it's establishment, Miyazaki would direct the first movie officially released under the Studio Ghibli name, known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (simply renamed Castle in the Sky in later releases). Also written by Miyazaki, Castle in the Sky is a wonderfully made movie, filled to the brim with fun action scenes and hilarious jokes. According to Castle in the Sky's backstory, human civilization built huge cities floating above the clouds before a catastrophe destroyed all but one city, Laputa. Viewed mostly as a legend by civilization down on the ground, nobody is quite sure if it is real or a hoax. One such person is Pazu, a young boy whose father had searched for Laputa himself. One day, Pazu is heading to work when he discovers a strange blue light falling slowly from the sky. Upon investigating, Pazu finds the most unexpected of things: a young girl.Pazu soon discovers that the girl's name is Sheeta, and she has apparent ties to Laputa, which Pazu has his own fascination with. As the two grow closer as friends, a man by the name of Muska and a group of air- pirates, led by a woman named Dola, both of whom were chasing Sheeta in the film's opening sequence, resume their chase for Sheeta, more specifically the necklace she wears around her neck. As Pazu and Sheeta attempt to escape these two groups, they are sucked into a grand adventure that unleashes the secrets of Laputa itself. Miyazaki's tale in Castle in the Sky is a very whimsical adventure full of adventure and excitement. Like his previous movie, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Miyazaki includes themes of environmentalism and war, but they aren't nearly as obvious as they were in Nausicaa. The real strength of Castle in the Sky, however, is the dialogue itself. The screenplay has a good mix of seriousness and humor that works extremely well throughout the entire movie. Although the pacing seems inconsistent, the story and dialogue itself is superb. The voice talent is good overall. James Van Der Meek is a delightful voice for Pazu, although he may seem to old for the character. Anna Paquin voices Sheeta, who is just OK overall. She almost seems to jump back and forth between an attempted American accent and her native Canadian accent, which can seem a bit obnoxious at times. The two actors create amazing chemistry between their two characters though, which is absolutely charming. Also in the cast is Cloris Leachman as a great Dola, and Mark Hamill as Muska, who arguably steals the show with his amazing performance as the primary antagonist.As Studio Ghibli's first feature film, Castle in the Sky is a huge success. Miyazaki's original story is action packed and humorous, allowing it to be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. The voice talent is solid, particularly Mark Hamill's menacing villain, and the animation is beautiful. The movie may have flaws within its pacing and certain elements of its voice cast, but overall, Castle in the Sky is a solid Miyazaki movie. With two fantastic movies under his belt, Hayao Miyazaki started his career with a bang, and Castle in the Sky was just the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Japanese animated tale of adventure, danger and magic actually happens to be a bit better than average; a rousing and exciting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are there many films that are as flat out exciting, enjoyable, well designed and well-structured as Laputa: Castle in the Sky? In essence, the piece is a B-movie but it's one of those B-movies which happens to throw a dart in generally the right direction only to end up nailing the shot with aplomb. When these sorts of ideas and approaches come off, there is little which doesn't work and Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 animation is one of these: an absolute joy of comedy; fantasy and adventure toying with switching allegiances and imagination in design. I'm a firm believer that animation often works best when it's working with things insurmountable to being ordinarily filmed; a medium which, when applied to cinema, brings to life worlds and people and objects otherwise impossible to create without the need for computer generated imagery to intersperse with the live action. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is one of those films, a project which allows for its creators to just go nuts, although within reason - to do so knowing that they will not be hampered by the potential for effects to overrun creativity and immersion into a fictitious world. There are, of course, instances whereby animated films have tackled "adult" issues (ranging from true to life warfare to the toppling of self-possessed alcoholism and grief) in the form of "Waltz with Bashir"; Franco-Iranian effort "Persepolis" through to "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", and have done so rather well, but they were always preoccupied with bringing a visual flourish to worlds that already existed and the period detail (1980's Vienna, Lebanon and 1940's Los Angeles) additionally helped in elevating them above self-indulgent, vacant of substance, spectacle driven pieces. But these are few and far between, and it's not like the Japanese are immune to droll, often unwatchable, animations which blind you with faux-nostalgia and that terrible quasi-sense of magic and merriment abound in pieces such as "Only Yesterday" and "My Neighbour Totoro", where not an awful lot is happening bar the repetition of steps which had already been taken more rigidly and more enjoyably. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is about a chase and an adventure involving a young, 'farm'-like locale dwelling boy who's propelled into the stratospheres of action, romance and danger. It is, of course, pure escapism but it is charming and it remembers to get the little things right. Opening in an airship flying high in the air above what is later revealed to be the ground below of an alternate Japan on an alternate planet Earth set some time ago, insect-like looking sky bandits invade the affluent surroundings of the vessel in pursuit for a necklace that a young girl surrounded in suited bodyguards is in close contact to. She is Sheeta, a depressed young girl who doesn't feel like eating but is, for some, reason in the company of this small army of men of whom each possess firearms. Amidst the chaos, Sheeta knocks out one of the men guarding her and it's revealed she was, in fact, so fond of their protection that she drops out of the window to fall to what appears to be certain death. Nay, for the item attacked to her necklace has steadied her fall and allowed her to land softly on the grounds below.What she falls into is a rural stretch of land where the young Pazu works, a minor who does the hours and lives simply only to have this Sheeta and her amazing possession come upon his world. Cocksure and boisterous, he is not deterred from maintaining his whipper-snapper attitude in spite of a peer chastising him for something. With Sheeta, Pazu, who's a sort of epitome of the working class man in boy form, embark on this adventure with the elements from before chasing them as they strive to uncover the secrets of the necklace whose purpose is to lead them to the eponymous kingdom in the sky: Laputa. The film's setting, stuck somewhere between the industrial age and a futuristic Utopia wherein rocket propelled jet skis are designed within an inch of their lives, but when a motorcar shows up can only induce reactions of "You don't see those very often(!)", allows perfectly for a rounded; neo-fantastical locale wherein grounded and recognisable characters and attitudes may exist hand in hand with escapist content.One looks past the film's tendency to depict its lead as an all-conquering, all saving epitome of leftist industrial liberalism ? a character whose decision to aid an outsider arriving unexpectedly in a locale alien to them (although familiar and functioning to the lead) very much leads them to a higher and more spiritual plateau of adventure and discovery. Moreover, and where the idea that factory floor/steel mill/coal mine (delete as appropriate) dwelling leftists can vanquish enemies and embrace this new found intruder is inherent, one should look past apparent 'pro' annotations to what waves of Left-induced immigration spins on those already occupying the land, and instead focus on the fact Laputa: Caslte in the Sky is more of a cracking, gratifying action film with a lot of amusing second unit material that works a whole lot more than it should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite Studio Ghibli films!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another in my mini-series of Studio Ghibli films and one I have loved for many years, since I first saw it in fact. I think it is because there is an element of science fiction in this one that doesn't seem to feature a lot in many of the other films I've seen from this studio. If I have one criticism, it's that it's a little too long, but then again it's always interesting and the story does move along at a reasonable pace, so it's not all bad. I'll give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.A girl, Sheeta, has been taken from her home and is being transported by the army and some mysterious men in dark glasses. When their airship is attacked by pirates she retrieves a mysterious stone from one of the men and jumps from the craft. As she approaches land a light comes from the stone and her fall is slowed. She is seen by a boy, Pazu, who catches her and takes her home with him. Pazu's father had snapped a photo of a mysterious castle in the sky, Laputa, and the following day Sheeta tells him her story and how she has a link to this place. The pirates have tracked her, they are looking for her in the village and a chase ensues. Eventually she is captured, not by the pirates, but by the army! A giant robot, help from the pirates, all kinds of flying machines later and Pazu has her free, but can they find Laputa before the army can, and will it be what they expect when they get there? Well, I guess I can't tell you that here or the Spoiler Police will be sending me aloft in an airship (&amp; no parachute) again.I watched this film in the original Japanese (with subtitles) although I believe there is a dubbed version available for those that fear the written word on the screen. It's beautifully animated and stands up well 25 years later. The performances are all good and so honourable mentions must go to the voice talents of; Mayumi Tanaka as Pazu and Keiko Yokozawa as Sheeta. They both gave their characters a lot of life and urgency that was well reflected in the visuals.I love the plot of this film; it starts quite big and just gets bigger! You think you have an idea where it's going, but then it takes a turn and what they come up with is even better than anything I could have thought of! I must admit I would maybe have changed a couple of things, but over all it's quite an excellent piece of work. It's all excellently done, if a little long, and I think the filmmakers stuck to what they do best; telling a good story. You may be able to guess by now, but this one comes pretty highly RECOMMENDED from me.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 30,528 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 17 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

		<fullReview>Castle in the sky is undeniably one of the best animated films of all time. The director once again created a story and world of epic proportions just like he did in Nausicaa.Pros: The story is an epic tale nothing short of masterful. The character adaption is very good, each character has a distinct personality that make it even more enjoyable. The director has designed a fantasy world that best suits the movie.Cons: The movie was made in 1986 so the special effects are a bit dated. The characters mouths don't move in the motions of the words the entire time. The story is very hard to understand at the beginning and might confuse some people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney leaped to animation superiority in 1939 and then stayed there for decades. Warner Bros made a spirited showing but they, and everyone else, were demonstrably lower down the scale. But in the later years of the 20th century Studio Ghibli made a definite play to be an alternate line of animation features - not a competitor, for the Japanese movies were - and continue to be - resolutely un-Disneylike in every possible way.Castle In The Sky from 1986, one of the early Studio Ghibli films, is a case in point. It tells the story of two waifs who are looking for the legendary floating city of Laputa while being pursued by two opposing groups.I can't praise this film highly enough. It is always exciting, and visually stunning with an astonishing level of visual imagination. This is impossible to describe, but the two things it called to mind are the general feel of Jean "Moebius" Giraud's unfamiliar worlds (there is a sequence with a railway chase where the railway tracks run on trestles halfway down a cavernous ravine where dwellings are cantilevered out of the canyon walls), crossed with organic/non-organic hybridisation: the nearest thing I can suggest is the impact of HR Giger's Alien and Species design, although the visual aspect is nothing like that.This film is exciting, involving, and a feast for the eyes. I enjoyed it greatly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laputa is another fun Miyazaki film. It has great animation, a plot that kept me watching, and interesting characters, as well as a good soundtrack.The film stars a little girl named Sheeta, she is in pursuit by the Military and a gang of pirates who are after her powerful crystal. After she escapes the two groups, she comes across a young boy named Patsu. The two quickly become friends, as Sheeta notices a picture of a castle called "Laputa". Patsu explains that he wants to prove it exists, because it will prove that his father wasn't lying about it.The pirates and the Military catch up to them and the young duo escapes into some mines nearby and discover that Sheeta's crystal is made of a mineral that the people of Laputa use, this excites Patsu and the two decide to go looking for Laputa, and they decide to return the crystal there.The military, along with our main Villain Mooscow, catch the two and blackmail Sheeta saying if she doesn't help them find Laputa, they may kill Patsu. She agrees and a confused, angry and sad Patsu leaves to return home as he comes across the pirates, the leader of the Pirates is convinced that Patsu sold Sheeta to the military but he claims thats not the case, he decides to team up with the pirates to save Sheeta.Thats all of the story I will sum up, but I have more to say about the movie itself. The characters are likable and well rounded, and some of the characters do a good job in making me mad. The film's plot is easy to follow and has plenty of twists that make it another brilliant Miyazaki film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way I discovered Miyazaki's movies was with a bit of surprise and curiosity, something that itself is best depicted in his movies. It was "Howl's Castle" that caught my attention while switching channels one Sunday. You can almost always see a sublime English influence in his work- characters with an innocent curiosity exploring a world of immense power and intractable magic. It is intriguing and immersing - a world that I hadn't seen since having read "Alice in the Wonderland" in my childhood for the first time. Music and art-direction is crafted very carefully to give an effect rarely achieved by cinema.Castle-in-the-sky is probably one of the best of his works. We revisit Swift's "Laputa" from the Gulliver's Travels in the movie ? a place far into the unknown that has had a history of the sort of power and intelligence that is unmatched by the modern civilization. The characters of the movie Sheeta and Pazu both find themselves onto an inevitable voyage to Laputa. Their rather exploratory journey to Laputa is full of hurdles and discoveries. As they run into air-pirates, plane-crashes and magical revelations we become a part of their joy, worries, inquisitiveness and amazement.If you're thinking Harry Potter, then you're absolutely mistaken. This might just be the opposite end of the spectrum. The visual effects of the movie are not meant to transcend the limits of the real world by letting you be in a fantasy world of magic and wizardry but instead in a rather unique way to meditate on our being and might in this world, in a way the Gulliver's travel did. That all of it can be achieved through animation is something only Miyazaki can be credited to.One thing that Miyazaki does very well is to not let somewhat sentimental moments in the movie become too sappy or theatrical. The story might have had a tendency to become that way but script kept it entertaining with jokes and "quirkiness" of its characters at times. The dubbing artists did a wonderful job in making this movie appear seamlessly "English". It would remain rather incomprehensible to me how movies from Far East can be enjoyed without any conscious attempt to overcome cultural boundaries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second Miyazaki film I have ever seen and it was a experience I will never forget. I am so grateful that my friend forced me to watch my first anime film (which was Spirited Away) because it got me so addicted that I had to see as many of Miyazaki's films as I possibly could. After Spirited Away I came across Castle in the sky and as I said, it will probably be one of the most memorable experiences of my life. This film captivates you in a way you could never imagine. The way Miyazaki makes his films is like he knows what fascinates everyone. The voice acting in this film is amazing and it makes you feel very connected to the characters and their emotions. Miyazaki's films taught me to do things I wouldn't normally want to do because if you don't, you could be missing out on something amazing. I was taught this because I had absolute no interest in anything anime except for Pokemon, but as I said my friend got me to finally sit down and watch some of Miyazaki's films and to this day I am in their debt as they showed me what real magic is. I recommend EVERYONE to see Castle in the sky, even if you are not a animation fan. I promise that you will be happy that you did. Not only will you witness beautiful drawings and an amazing story, but you will feel like anything in life is possible more then ever. This is only ONE of Miyazaki's MANY beautiful films, so please check them all out as you will be making your heart and soul more happy then you could possibly imagine!!10 STARS OUT OF 10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Japanese animation from the creative mind of Hayao Miyazaki is an action-packed adventure. It seems to take place in a version of the early 1900s where aviation technology is very common. Miyazaki's imagination offers us an amazing adventure, with enormous air ships, sky pirates on insectlike speeders, giant robots, courageous characters, some breathtaking scenery, and an ancient floating kingdom.A young girl is being chased by a clan of treasure-seeking pirates as well as government military forces. The girl, in possession of a mysterious stone that holds the secrets of an advanced civilization, meets a heroic young boy who risks everything to protect her. Action waits around every corner. Each sequence seems to open a new gateway of wonder.A great animated adventure. There is some violence, but it should still be a great movie for kids</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few rough edges but still a magical film from Miyazaki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should perhaps begin by saying that this film was my introduction to Miyazaki, although his reputation preceded him. Even in this early directorial effort there is a sense of a genuine artist at work."Castle in the Sky" centers on the pursuit of a young girl whose crystal necklace holds the power to guide the way to Laputa, a mystical castle afloat in the clouds. After initially escaping her would-be captors she is befriended by a young boy. Together they join forces to escape the clutches of pirates and the military, each of whom have their own motives for locating Laputa.The story is refreshingly imaginative and is thankfully devoid of Disney's usual blatant moralizing. I should note that it was the Disney release that I watched, replete with English dubbing. The voice cast didn't seem extremely well-chosen but it wasn't that bad overall. A bigger distraction was the score, which I was unsurprised to learn was greatly expanded at Disney's request. Not only does it insert music where none was needed, it seemed to me to be too prominent in the overall audio mix.However, these are fairly minor quibbles which will easily be overshadowed as you become wrapped up in the story (and the wonderful visuals). It certainly made me anxious to see more from Studio Ghibli.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some ways, this is a classic tale. A lost princess meets a village boy, a ruthless baddie searches for power, friends who help the good guys overcome the odds, and a happy ending. But it is so much more three-dimensional and original than that. There are also enchanted rocks, robots, military fortresses, and a devastating weapon that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah! Studio Ghibli again weaves the mundane with the magical and throws in the usual mix of interesting characters for the journey. The main characters are innocent youngsters but that's what makes it heartwarming. The themes of friendship, love and nature are beautifully illustrated here too.I don't know how much the new Disney version has altered the dialogue, but certainly at times it did seem inappropriately saccharine or blunt. Also I should say I really liked the main theme (used in the end music too).</fullReview>

The voice talent behind this film also blew me away, everyone from Oscar Winner Anna Paquin, Dawson's Creek Star Josh Van Der Beek, Mark Hamil, and Andy Dick lent their voices to this stunning production. In addition to it being an overall amazing film, it is devoid of cursing and any heavy violence, but the action is still fresh, making this a movie for the entire family. Rent this immediately, and then after you are convinced that what I am saying is true, buy it. It will make the perfect addition to your DVD collection, and is a good place to start your Miyazaki film collection.

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki at his best, a breathtaking adventure of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My conversion to the Miyazaki mind set is now complete. I suspectthis visionary genius, whose talents had rarely been given majoraccess to the average westerner until his glorious Oscar winningSpirited Away, is capable of doing no wrong.Castle In The Sky is a beautifully crafted joyride that reminds youwant its like to be young. The animation is undeniable superb andthe voice cast (of the English dubbed version) well selected.However it is the sheer sense of wonder that gets you. LikeSpirited Away Miyazaki's scale of imagination is extraordinary. Arare talent in adults.For most people as you grow older the mundanities of life run youdown and help to destroy your imagination bit by bit. Some artistsare capable of taping into that childlike imagination andrecapturing some of the wonder and spectacle. I would argue thatin the film world Steven Spielberg, John Lasseter and (representing the slightly more mischievous child) Joe Dante areamong the best at this. Films such as E.T., Toy Story andInnerspace, Indiana Jones, Monsters, Inc. and Gremlins provide alandscape of adventure and fun, unbridled childish excitement.Anyone who's ever enjoyed The Goonies as a child knows whatI'm talking about and still gets nostalgic at a cry of "hey, you guys"!It's not the same if you experience it as an adult usually. That ispart of the problem with the new Star Wars films. So many peoplewho watched the original trilogy through the wide eyes ofchildhood cannot see the same qualities in the new films unlessthey access their imagination and childlike sense of awe, forgetwhat they know about criticism and technical specifications (likeeffects etc) that they were blissfully unaware of in childhood andlook at these films as if they were a kid again. The wonder of Miyazaki is that he seems not to be accessingchildlike qualities, but genuinely seems to still possess theimagination of a pre-teen. Even more incredible is the way he canchannel this to his audience through his stories and imagery.Castle In The Sky, like Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and hisother films, contains characters and situations few could conceiveof. I do not want to give anything away of the story as it should beexperienced first hand to truly capture the overwhelming scale andinventiveness.Miyazaki is a genius. Castle In The Sky in superior to PrincessMononoke but falls just short of his masterpiece Spirited Away.Believe John Lasseter see them all. See My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service etc. Experience them all. Awaken the childwithin you and count the days until Howl's Moving Castle (releasedin 2004) with the desperate impatience of a small child. Enjoy.</fullReview>

There also is an enchanting faux-European world of pirates, dirigables, explorers, and miners set against the backdrop of the ancient Atlantis-like Laputa. Except Laputa is in the sky, not the ocean.Like most of Ghibli films its hard to imagine anyone who would not like it except the terminally unimaginative. Ghibli's art is for the ages, not just our narrow little frame of time. So if you miss Laputa in this lifetime, don't worry, you can catch it in the next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a testament to the problems of translating and dubbing foreign films that this Myazaki classic isn't far more recognised than it is. Check the ratings: over 50% of those who voted for this gave it a 10 (mean score 8.5), but it's adjusted score is much lower. This can only be accounted for by the mode of it's release in America - the film was dubbed and scenes were cut to make it more appealing to a young audience, inevitably losing something given the perfect voice acting, characterisation and pacing of the original. I can't think of an animated film I would place over this, and that includes the entire Disney back catalogue. The music alone is worth the music of any 4 Disney films you care to name (No musical numbers! No Elton John!).In fact, this is probably a film it's best to get an import copy of if you can. However you do it, you should definitely find a way to ensure nothing has been changed "for your own enjoyment".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anime at its very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Laputa for the first time in the 80s when I was still a child, but now watching it when I'm an adult really put things into perspective. The plot is very well written, but the characters' development is what contributes to the story's overall excellence. If you seek an anime capable of captivating your heart, Laputa is the one to get. This is one of those films that you do not fast forward for there are no boring scenes. Not a film for people that seek a hidden message behind every movie, but rather one you can rent to watch with your girl/man or family on a night in.Not recommended for children under 7, since they will not appreciate the plot nor should they pick up a rock and jump off the roof trying to float.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great adventure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great and powerful tale about two young kids searching for the mysterious and elusive "castle in the sky." A certainly thrilling adventure for many people of any age. The storyline is very-well thought out, and there's never a dull moment in this two-hour feature movie.What captured my attention was the beautiful music that certainly depicts the quest, action, and heart-felt moments in this adventure from the haunting music of the robot's attack, to the great symphonic and orchestrated melody of the search for Laputa.The animation may seem a bit subpar in the eyes of recent anime-lovers, but it's still marvelous to watch compared to many other animated series/movies of the 80's. If you enjoy excitement and aerial adventure, then I really do recommend that you see Laputa: Castle in the Sky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "MUST-see" film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not even 10 years old when I first encountered this film. Now, after more than a decade, the film "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" (1986) still has been my GREATEST favorite film of all time.Although I have seen quite a few other excellent films, including animated &amp; non-animated ones, NONE has ever come close---and never will---to this one. (And I am not a bit exaggerating.) It is a real classic. A huge Japanese population still holds the film as one of the best films that this little animation-driven island, Japan, has ever produced.If you are a kind of person who enjoys animations or just any really GOOD films in general, I can quite surely guarantee you will like this one. :)One of the most prominent and popular directors in Japanese animation, Hayao Miyazaki, has produced a number of films, some of which are also considered as masterpieces. I hope the day that you encounter this "must-see" film of all time will come in the near future. And most of all...enjoy! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being very difficult to find this film (since there is no distribution channel in the US) it is a testament to the film's greatness that it is frequently cited as the best movie the viewer has seen.When watching the film there is a special feeling (totally devoid when watching most drivel pumped out by formula driven and uninspired studio drones). You know that it is something special. It transcends category (ie Japanimation, animation, children's) and you are transported to another world. The story, animation, music are all crafted with care and inspired devotion. The amazing thing about the film is that it also has one of the best soundtracks to accompany it. Which is also cited by many who have heard it as the best they've heard.It truly established Miyazaki and Hisaishi (the soundtrack composer) as masters in their field of film making.</fullReview>

Overall, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, is one movie you don't want to miss.

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I ever saw this movie in it's uncut original VCR release by chance and didn't realise that I had by sheer luck stumbled upon a piece of manga movie masterpiece. The first thing that came into my mind after viewing this movie as a 12 year old child was it's absolutely stunning animation and breath-taking action. The creators and animators were able to place the viewers literally on screen with the main characters by the use of dynamic camera angles which best captured the action as well as very fine detailed animations, which were best illustrated in the chase scene on the railroads where Pazu and Sheeta who narrowly escapes their captors. But as I grew older so did my impressions of this movie change. What makes Laputa so good were not only for it's action and animations but it's strongest point lies in it's storyline and script which were able to elicit emotions in it's viewers, and the soundtrack compliments this movie superbly. I was about to compare this movie with others in its genre but after careful consideration I don't think there's ever been another manga/cartoon movie that comes close to it. After reading this review I bet you'll all think that I'm pretty bias, but then again isn't everybody who has seen this movie? Just a note for those of you who has only seen the VCD version or later release of Laputa....many key scene have been cut out of this later release and I highly recommend trying to get an uncut copy of this movie for you to fully appreciate what the creators intended it to be.</fullReview>

Very different from My Neighbor Totoro or Mononoke but equally as rewarding. My personal favorite of the director's films.

The animation quality is excellent! If you've seen Disney's job of Kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production.

		<fullReview>A perfect 10 out of 10! Laputa is such a magical movie that I would have to rank it alongside the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Blazing Saddles, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 version), Beauty and the Beast, and Jurassic Park in terms of the best movies ever made. Hayao Miyazaki is an artistic genius. Laputa has an engaging plot, likable characters, aesthetically pleasing art, and a good balance of adventure and comic relief. Colonel Mushka makes for a great villain to watch on screen. Most importantly, there are also philosophical, ethical, and social messages behind the art, action, and adventure. It shows how militarism can ruin the beauty of the world. It shows how a madman seeking power places everybody in danger. To quote Sheeta in the movie, "No matter how advanced your technology is, no matter how powerful your weapons are, the world cannot live without love."</fullReview>

Was this an influence on Disney's "Tailspin"? The voice actors are all quite good, though it is curious that somehow Andy Dick was hired.Composer Joe Hisaishi was commissioned to rework and extend his original synthesizer-composed 39-minute soundtrack into a 90-minute piece for symphony orchestra in an effort to make the film more accessible to US audiences who are accustomed to a more substantial musical accompaniment. Newer sound effects were included as well, presumably to bring the film up to theatrical standards. Mayhaps the original would not be rated quite so high were it not for this improved score?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, I remember first seeing this on Toonami. Month of Miyazaki was the best thing they ever did. Every Saturday, me, my sister, and mother would all sit together and have a great time. Except for Valley of the Wind, which we missed. :P Castle in the Sky is a perfectly fine movie, one that can be enjoyed by child and adult alike. Its adorable, adventurous, and, as usual for Ghibli, beautiful. The scenes on Laputa itself are among the best in Ghibli's filmography, in terms of gorgeous animation and background (IMHO).I find myself giving many Ghibli films 7/10s. I'm not sure that's accurate. They are wonderful, with animation quality that's rarely matched. But they're not all brilliant in writing, or even have strong characters. Yet I don't feel they're missing something. They're good as they are. If you think Castle in the Sky is your kind of movie, it'll certainly please you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best and most successful early anime films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castle In The Sky produces more wonder and perhaps more excitement than any other film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It's not his best film, but it's a wonderful early Studio Ghibli effort. Industrial Age Europe was obviously an inspiration on the world of the film. There are elements of the fantastic, like the sky castle itself. The castle was part of a utopia created by an advanced civilization through technology. Miyazaki's animation style presents this world vividly and wonderfully. There is some truly breathtaking scenery. Compared to today's anime, especially by Ghibli, the animation of Castle In The Sky looks crude. This is hardly a distraction though. Until Akira (1988) there were very few big budget anime films. There was also a lack of good talent. What raises Castle In The Sky above average is its design and creativity. It helped that Joe Hisaishi composed an effective score that sounds enchanting in the film. Sheeta, a girl, is the heroine of the story. She meets Pazu, a boy who quickly becomes her best friend. They're good, courageous children. For a Miyazaki film there is a surprisingly large amount of action, producing much excitement. The children are almost always on the move. Sheeta's levistone pendant represents advanced technology, something that saves her again and again. The story isn't very original, but there's still a lot to like here. I highly recommend seeing Castle In The Sky. It's a film that one can treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest children's fantasy adventure film ever made - not opinion, fact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just realised I've been using IMDb for years now and I've never reviewed my favourite film. By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it. This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female). Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny - I've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good (the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It's not available on any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure.There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film.First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance.The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine (Pazu's town area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s (might be late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles.The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that.Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key (novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre - some of his key frame animation. He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds I've ever seen too. Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards in fact. What else... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - though they're pretty rare.This film is such a gift, I don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!</fullReview>

It has as usual excellent color and motion in the classic anime style. Especially enjoyed the flight to the castle and the early discoveries of the garden with the robot gardeners with grass growing on them. The pirates made good sidekicks; one thing I noticed was we were never really shown the bad guy/relative falling or dying - I guess it was assumed. I rate this anime right on par with Naussica....Tottoro will always be my favorite followed by Spirited Away. This one is not far behind though.

		<fullReview>This is the best dub I've ever heard by Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service. UrrrghhhThis one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This one has both hero and heroine (although I don't really endorse the use of hero &amp; heroine here, since Miyazaki is out from the stereotype &amp; common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, amazed by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part. Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi's dud. Well, in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 rating. I'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie.SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. It is as if mankind really can't live with too much power. The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending. It's just sad somehow. The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber.People who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition.This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days (It's a Wonderful Life etc etc).

		<fullReview>If you are looking into alternative film genre's, then this is as good a place as any to delve into Japanese Anime. The director has been involved in the some of the best animation to come from the East and this 1986 film has now become available on DVD, following Disney's decision to purchase distribution rights.It contains excellent Japanese-style animation,with an accessible family orientated story.The film combines elements as diverse as War of the Worlds, WW1 &amp; 2, The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Industrial Revolution, magic and Fantasy. These themes in the wrong hands could make a terible mess, but are handled to create a plausible, alternative world. The story can seem a little kiddie like in places- it is a family film- but it does not detract from the enjoyment.The newly dubbed English translation has Anna Paquin (Rogue of X-men), James Van Der Beek ( Dawsons Creek! and Rules Of Attraction) as well as Mark "Skywalker" Hamill doing the honours.Do yourself a favour and check out a copy. Also look out for "Spirited Away", "Princess Mononoke","Ghost In The Shell" and "Akira" for other top of the range Manga/Anime.</fullReview>

There are just so many great things about it:the animation, the gorgeous score, the weird robots, the devoted,innocent love that exists between Pazu and Sheeta etc. So, even thoughthe English dub isn't as up to snuff as the ones for "Princess Mononoke"or "Kiki's Delivery Service", that really doesn't matter too much; youcan always watch the subs and as I have mentioned in other comments: Thelanguage of Miyazaki is universal.

		<shortDescription>Impressive, but not a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later.There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'.Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most enchanting, beautiful and magical film you'll ever watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1986 under the direction of the now legendary Hayao Miyazaki and known for being the first full length feature of again the now legendary Studio Ghibli. Too many the film is seen as nostalgic, enchanting and rank highly in the greatest animation films list. However, with this I disagree this isn't just the one of the greatest animation or greatest animation film ever made...It is the greatest FILM ever made. Castle In The Sky completely blew me away to the point of being stunned and left in complete silence by the final scene. Words simply cannot describe how beautiful this masterpiece of a film really is. The soundtrack is possibly the best featured in any film ever, with beautiful orchestral and piano centred compositions capturing the aw and beauty magnificently of the on-screen visuals. The film flows perfectly with each scene progressing the plot and developing the story. Our two protagonists are simply amazing, with the duo having some of the best chemistry ever put to screen and of course while the whole film is simply stunning, the final act is one of the most enchanting, beautiful and magical experiences in film history. I can safely say that this may be one of the only films without a single minor flaw, even nit- picking is near-impossible. The plot follows the story of a young girl who is saved by a mysterious power concealed in her necklace after falling from an airship. She is cared for by a young miner boy who instantly bonds with her and reveals to her his burning passion to find the ancient sky city of Laputa. All while a rowdy group of pirates and a relentless agent ruthlessly hunt the two with the intention of finding and raiding the city. Castle In The Sky also completely surprised me with it's huge, spectacular action scenes and fat-paced adventure theme especially towards the end of the first act. Miyazaki and the Ghibli team completely blew my mind in what they achieved with this anime classic. Castle In The Sky will have you in near tears on how beautifully animated and powerful it is, without a doubt Studio Ghibli's first and best and Miyazaki's magnum opus. Castle In The Sky 100% deserves a 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite film by Studio Ghibli. The unique world can only be created by Hayao Miyazaki. The first moment that a girl slowly falls from the sky, in the fantastic sound, audience will be glued to the story. Especially I like the picture of the castle in the sky which spreads after diving into the eye of a storm. I've never seen such an attractive world. The beauty of the picture is one point worthy of note.The story line is quite simple, but suggestively tells something important to us. Varieties of interpretation can be considered. So this animation film is able to entertain not only children but also adults, all generations. I cannot find the worlds but excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one the many films from Japanese cartoon creators Studio Ghibli I had not seen, but remembered the title of and really wanted to see, I'm glad when I got the opportunity, directed by Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Ponyo). Basically young girl Sheeta (Anna Paquin) has been abducted by secret government agent Muska (Mark Hamill), the airship she is on is attacked by Captain Dola (Cloris Leachman) and her air pirate sons, they are in search of Sheeta's crystal amulet, given to her by her father. Sheeta falls from the airship, but the amulet starts glowing and her descent is slowed by its power, she lands in a small mining town and is discovered by boy Pazu (Dawson's Creek's James Van Der Beek). Sheeta is surprised to be alive when she wakes, Pazu explains what he witnessed, he is building a small aeroplane with the intention to go in search of the the lost city of Laputa, a flying castle thought to be a legend or myth, but Pazu's took a photograph of. Dola's pirates show up and pursue them, as well as Muska's soldiers, eventually the two fall into a mine, there they encounter eccentric local Uncle Pom (Richard Dysart), he recognises Sheeta's amulet and informs them it is made of 'Aetherium', a material used to keep flying cities, like Laputa, aloft, after leaving the mines Sheeta tells Pazu that her full name is 'Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa'. Sheeta and Pazu are captured by Muska and imprisoned in the fortress of Tedis, Muska shows Sheeta a dormant Laputan robot, he knows about her secret name and interprets it to be that of the Laputan royal line, Pazu's life is threatened unless Sheeta cooperates, and he is sent away and forget about her. Pazu returns home distraught, there Dola's sons ambush him, Dola is eventually persuaded to help Pazu, to stop Muska, intercept the airship Goliath and capture the crystal. Sheeta recites a magical verse and unexpectedly activates the amulet and the robot, which destroys the fortress, Pazu arrives to rescue Sheeta, but Muska obtains the amulet. The pirates, accompanied by Pazu and Sheeta, return to their airship the Tiger Moth, they pursue the Goliath, it is following directions by Sheeta's amulet to locate Laputa. The lost castle in the sky is found, it is devoid of human life, but overgrown by woodland, with a gigantic "eternal tree of life" in the centre, it is maintained by another robot. Dola's pirates are captured while Muska's soldiers explore the ancient city and crumbling, overgrown, yet beautiful ruin of a castle, it is the ultimate evolution of the crystal levitation technology, and also has the powers of holography, magnetic cohesion, pseudo-nuclear weaponry and a veritable army of the semi-sentient robots. While Pazu and the freed pirates escape, Muska captures Sheeta and takes her with him into the centre of Laputa, containing the immense Aetherium crystal keeping the city aloft, there he identifies himself as 'Romuska Palo Ul Laputa', a member of another royal line, and he uses Sheeta's amulet as the key to access the advanced Laputian technology. After Muska massacres his own soldiers and destroys the Goliath, Sheeta escapes with her amulet, she encounters Pazu and passes it to him, in a confrontation with Muska, Sheeta realises that the people of Laputa left because humans were meant to live on earth, not in the sky. Muska refuses her argument and threatens to kill her if she does not give him the amulet, Pazu enters and says he will give him the amulet if he is allowed to talk to Sheeta, Muska grants him one minute, Sheeta and Pazu recite a "Spell of Destruction", destroying much of the city, and Muska dies. Sheeta and Pazu survive the collapse, protected by the tree's gigantic roots, they reunite with Dola and her pirates, who have swiped the city's treasure, they part with Sheeta and Pazu who are heading to start a new life together, Laputa is left floating in the sky, with a robot guardian still tending the garden, and maintained by the Aetherium crystal. Also starring Jim Cummings as General, Mandy Patinkin as Louis and Andy Dick as Henri. It is a simple story of a quest to find a magical city that floats high in the sky, with are nods to the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne, and retro-futuristic stuff, the voices for the English dubbing are alright, more than anything you pay attention to the fantastically colourful and imaginative animation, an enjoyable animated fantasy adventure. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost every single animated movie by Hayao Miyazuki is both calming and intriguing. The story unpacks with Sheeta's accident to fall from the sky and then met the fixer boy Pazu. As the heir of the lost empire, Sheeta has special powers to control the flying stones and learned spells to exert the power of the stone. Laputa, the floating island in the sky developed much more advanced technology than human civilization and are known to have valuable treasures. While the treasures excited the sky pirates, another guy who belongs to the kinship on the island led the army to approach Laputa. Since Sheeta is thought to know the way to the hidden floating island. Both pirates and the military want to catch her, and of course our little boy is there to protect her, the little hero. Long with this small subhect its also embeded ecological values as the nature is the mother land and critical valus to human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tenku No Shiro Rapyuta Laputa Castle in the Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castle in the Sky was a whole new step for eminent Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki after the successful runs of his erstwhile pictures - The Castle of Cagilostro (1978) to Nausicca Valley of the Wind (1984). Not only was it the first film to be released by Studio Ghibli, Japan's own Disney studio, but it demonstrated how Miyazaki could recapture our childhood as the film swoops and soars through wide open clouds and into a world supposedly made up of dreams.Prior to the release of Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki was baffled to see children wanting to see Nausicca, an influential animated film intended more for adults and teenagers. If children were to see his films, Miyazaki wanted them to be enthralled by the kind of magic brought up by Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, or Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. The titular Laputa is, in fact, a fictional setting originally conceived by Johnathan Swift while writing Gulliver's Travels. A mysterious, floating island, Laputa was home to a once mighty civilization where the advanced technology and untold treasures eventually made the society hubristic. As far as legends go, Laputa and all of its people completely vanished, leaving even the smallest children to grow up believing such a place actually existed. Most recently, however, sinister government agents, as well as cunning air pirates, have learned the link to the lost castle in the sky: a mystical amulet owned by orphaned girl named Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin in the 1998 English-translated adaptation). Captured by the duplicitous Colonel Muska (voiced by Mark Hamill), Sheeta finds a way to break free after Captain Dola, a Ma Barker-like matriarch voiced by Cloris Leachman, and her family of boisterous pirates make way onto the palatial airship to seize the girl themselves. While trying to escape her captors, Sheeta seemingly plummets to her death, only to have her amulet miraculously float her body gently down to earth, where she enters the life of Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek), a loyal miner boy about her age and a fellow orphan as well. Together, Sheeta and Pazu must soon find a way to evade the government and the air pirates before the location of Laputa can be given to them.Because the term "Laputa" was easily misconceived as a reference to the Spanish pejorative "La Puta," the titular Laputa was quietly removed on its release in the United States and other foreign nations. Other changes made to the American renditions have, on the other hand, become irrevocable. Although the primary concern regarding how 16-year old Anna Paquin (future star of True Blood) and 21-year old James Van Der Beek were too old to voice the youngsters who have barely hit puberty, the heroes of Sheeta and Pazu never cross into bratty or cloying territory as they experience a few life lessons during their grand adventure. Pazu is a simple boy growing into a man as he braves the dangers to rescue Sheeta, a Snow White-like girl whose charm and spiritedness wins the hearts of that of the hardened Capt. Dola and her crew. Pazu and Sheeta together represent the film's exhilaration as they go through a series of perils, battles, chases, and enchantment to uncover a mystery before their enemies do. Probably the sole thing wrong with these likable child heroes are how they, along with every other animated person created in Japan, share the common failure of differentiating the characters. Since U.S. rival corporations (Disney, Pixar, or DreamWorks) have yet to best the Japanese anime in terms of writing and visuals, they at least earn the praise for making each character's facial structures distinguishable since anime characters are so often uncannily Even if contemporary audiences criticize how Castle in the Sky isn't on par with some of Miyazaki's best work, this is still sophisticated filmmaking at best. Miyazaki was actually predating Pixar for years because his brilliant storytelling gels with characters you actually care for, a script devoid of any of the common flaws and clichs found in the modern films, and animation so rich that you can gaze upon without the use of 3D glasses. In truth, though, Miyazaki's films were the best thing to come in terms of animation after the quality of Disney feature began to falter during the early 60's. The appreciation and admiration Miyazaki had for ancient legends was used to such a strong advantage that his growing empire of influence was making Miyazaki a legend in his own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of Fun and Adventure for the Inner Child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castle in the Sky is a film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. What a fun thrill ride this was. Floating castles. Sky pirates. Gorgeous visuals. Jaw-dropping action. Fun humor. Add all these together and it makes one of my favorite animated films ever.Where should even I start with this masterpiece? Well, first the story. It's just a basic coming-of-age, adventure story. Two kids, Pazu and Sheeta, find a mysterious object, so together they try to discover the secret behind this object as well as learn more about each other. Throw in some bad guys here and there, and you got yourself an adventure film fun for the whole family.But of course, that isn't enough from the great Miyazaki. I'm sure any other filmmaker would have done a fine job with this premise. Miyazaki, however, gives his audience an engaging story with such a grand and epic fantasy experience. He puts so much effort into this film, I felt as if I was coming along for the ride. I would have loved to have seen this film on the big screen. Watching the cinematic opening scene and hearing the beautiful theme song. When I first watched it, I felt I was gonna like it. I didn't expect to love it so much!I saw the English dubbed version, which I always prefer for anime. Though, I think the dub could have been a little better. The main problem were the two main characters. It's fine as it is, but I think Pazu sounded older than he looked. Also Sheeta has what I believe was a British accent throughout the film, but her accent would sometimes sound like it was fading in and out. With all that said, if anyone reading this prefer subtitles with the original audio, that's fine too. It's understandable.Another thing I should point out is not really a complaint, just an observation. The pacing does slow down towards the end. It's not a problem, but it also wouldn't be a problem if about 5 minutes were shaved off. But, it still helps set the mood and atmosphere. Those who haven't seen the movie should keep in mind that it isn't all fast-paced action.Overall, I really love this movie. A film like this can only be topped by Miyazaki's own "My Neighbor Totoro" (but that's for another review). I highly recommend it for the whole family. And if you get the chance, check out the incredible soundtrack. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Castle in the Sky (1986) is one of director and writer, Hayao Miyazaki's first films, however it is still set in his fantasy world. In a land containing fantastical air ships and magical pendants, Sheeta (Anna Paquin) and Pazu (James Van Der Beek) find themselves on the run from highly incompetent and whimsical pirates, being led by their mother (Cloris Leachman), and the government, led by the mysterious Muska (Mark Hamill). Once again Miyazaki proves why he is one of my favorite directors. His use of animation to create an entirely new fantastic world takes the audience out of their seats and leaves them elated and yearning for more. Adding this to an adorable love story, the film was a true classic and a masterpiece of animation.</fullReview>

But I can tell you I remember my hair stood up several times during the first time I watched this movie. Not to disrespect the American voice-over but the original Japanese brings a different vibe throughout the movie. The American Castle In The Sky seems like a different movie. Not to mention the music is placed a little differently(Yes I can tell. That's how many times I watched this) I believe I am one of a few that actually read the book that came out with the movie when it first came out. It was fantastic to say the least. It gives us the inner thoughts of the characters and the meanings of some of the little things you see in the background. Also an extra ending after what appears in the movie ends.The music is unlike anything else, too. I hear people use its theme song as ringtones still.Until this day, when people ask me what is my favorite movie since I am an indi filmmaker. I tell them "Laputa".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The art direction is this movie is superb, it really brings the Castle in the Sky straight out of Gulliver's Travels and onto the movie screen. The bittersweet robots that inhabit and protect the garden may even end up being some of your favorite anime characters, not because they are amusing, but because of the care and dedication that they exude whenever you see them. Laputa revolves around a boy named Pazu and the girl that floats unceremoniously down from the sky into his life, Sheeta, and how they save Laputa and the world from corruption. An all-around solid anime movie with classic Ghibli humor and spirit, definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic fantasy adventure, plain and simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castle in the Sky is the first film by Studio Ghibli, released originally in 1986. It is every bit as good as one would expect from a Ghibli film: beautiful animation and art, colourful and memorable characters, great score and a good story.The story concerns a boy named Pazu who on one day sees a girl called Sheeta falling from the sky. Together they set out to find the legendary flying castle of Laputa. The story is well paced and truly an adventure: by the end the small village Pazu used to live in feels like the distant past.The first thing I should say is this is A GREAT FILM. It's well written, beautifully animated and overall masterfully executed. Yet Studio Ghibli has produced so many fantastic films that this one stands out as a more simplistic story. There's not the ecological message of Nausica, the overwhelming adorability of Totoro or the grim moral ambiguity of Mononoke. After watching it twice I still haven't detected much of an overarching theme or message overall. Also the female lead, Sheeta, is somewhat disappointing as more of a typical damsel in distress. This is a bit jarring considering Ghibli's history of producing strong female characters one after another (Chihiro, San, Nausica, Satsuki, the list goes on).The animation is good and the visual design is very impressive. Still, some of the technical aspects are hopelessly dated: the animation can be choppy at times, and the characters are fairly devoid of detail. Though considering just how much happens in the film, the simplistic designs are somewhat forgivable, especially when we see entire armies on-screen at times.But mostly this is just nitpicking. Castle in the Sky is a wonderful, imaginative piece of fantasy adventure, and shows more creativity, personality and imagination in 5 minutes than most mainstream films show in 500 minutes.Recommendation: A must-see for any fan of fantasy cinema or Studio Ghibli. For everyone else, highly recommended.</fullReview>

I didn't understand a single word of the dialog, but this imagery was so crystal clear that I understood everything.It worked so well that when I was in Japan, I bought several over Ghibli videos, but none of them was transcendental like this one.About the tenth time I saw the film, it was the dubbed version. I don't hearing the actual dialog for the first helped. Via the images, I already knew it, somehow. And what fantastic imagery -- some of the best imagery I've seen in any film.

		<fullReview>When I was a child and first watched this movie on TV, I was blown away. It didn't go for the action of Star Wars, it didn't go for the comedy of Toy Story, and it didn't go for the romance of Titanic. Instead, it went for pure beauty, and (In my opinion) this accomplished that perfectly.While other people take off marks for the various versions (Both of the English-dubs), I had little problems with them, but I am going to focus on looking at the subtitled-original version with the original music: The way Miyazaki wanted it.The one factor of this movie which was the factor that blew my mind as a child was the music. Such fantastic composition off sounds and emotions brought through the music in each of the scenes. There were moments where the music picked up on the idea of adventure, feelings of loss and loneliness, and then moments of hope and triumph. Truly sublime: In my opinion, perfection and the BEST soundtrack I have heard. I know it is naive to say such a thing, but this is what hit me as a child: the music was such beautiful artwork crafted solely for this movie.The artwork, as Studio Ghibli's artwork always has been, was stunning. These hand-drawn images are so perfectly crafted you can actually see the amount of effort and passion the artists put into this. Together the artwork and the music tickles the imagination of both adults and children.The story is based on the floating island of Laputa: a concept originally presented in the book "Gulliver's Travels." It successfully takes that one concept and blooms it into something entirely new. It's beautiful ideas clashing between the original text and Miyazak's own wild and beautiful imagination.The characters are very well written: Miyzaki often focuses on the innocence of the youth, and this film has various themes revolving around that. Pazu and Sheeta want to find the island for selfless reasons: Pazu wants to follow in his late-father's footsteps and find the island, and Sheeta wants to discover her link to it. It is a journey of self discovery for these two characters, while the adults are greedy for money and power. There is a clear sense between who is good and bad which is ambiguous at first, but through the film as we get closer to Pazu and Sheeta, we all discover who to really trust. The characters are believable and there is a constant sense of development in both the characters and the narrative.This is my most favourite film ever because of these reasons. I try to be strict when it comes to films but I find it difficult to criticise this film. There is no such thing as a "Perfect" film, but I think this comes pretty close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to watch when you're young, and watch again when you've grown up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many reviewers here, I also recommend to watch it in the original Japanese. Characters are more vivid, and the music is more atmospheric. Unfortunately, Disney was too true to its policy not to allow a moment without music when nobody is talking. Miyazaki's (or a characteristic to any Japanese artwork) mastery of sound and silence, existence and voidness, were thereby systematically destroyed. It's also noticeable that music was grossly modified. Some may like this way, but I believe the original held the beauty of this film more effectively. Simply, my ears remember it as I heard in the original even though it was more than 10 years ago! The dubbing was done alright. Mark Hamill ('Muska') and Cloris Leachman ('Dola') were excellent. But James van der Beek ('Pazu') was a wrong choice. Pazu is good-natured, but essentially a tough orphan boy who works in a mine. Van der Beek cannot act on such a role, and instead he made Pazu sound like a middle-class boy who would perform well at school. Pazu in the original was a boy who wouldn't look back a second, but Pazu van der Beek was a rich boy who tried to be wild and that was pathetic.Is there a lesson in this film, besides entertainment? Many say it's about power and greed. Sure, those are important sidelines. But I think the most important message was the critique on our industrial civilisation. Towards the end of the film, Sheeta says "I see now why the Laputians left the castle. You cannot live away from the earth and soil!" I reckon this is the one-line message from Miyazaki. During the opening credit, we see the concise history of the Laputa world: a steam engine -&gt; industrial revolution -&gt; advances to the sky -&gt; flying cities -&gt; arms race -&gt; war -&gt; people leaving from the fallen ships -&gt; back to the simple life on earth. Miyazaki's world view is clear - he's an environmentalist. He also has a social side. In planning this film, Miyazaki travelled to Wales. It was 1980s, when many mining towns were suffering from closure. Miyazaki felt so much compassion to those townspeople, and made those people immortal in this film. Though idealised, we meet them in Pazu's mining valley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid, Disney advertised Castle in the Sky to be released to video while me and my family was watching Summer of the Monkeys. Too bad Disney never released it until 2003. That's when my two younger sisters watched it and they encouraged me to watch it with them, I was around 14 to 15 at this time.I was a little reluctant at first since I had no idea who Miyazaki was and I was not an anime fan like I am now. I had nothing to do so I decided to watch it. From beginning to end, the film kept me glued to the screen. The film was made in 1986 and it still seems timeless, the animation was quite impressive and score was very moving. The suspenseful moments such as; Muska chasing Sheeta, the Dola gang attacking Goliath; the military airship, and Pazu Rescuing Sheeta were very compelling story lines.I found myself loving the film as much as my sisters and now one my favorite films that we now have on DVD. This film holds a strong message of Good and Evil. When someone such as Muska wants misuse power and eventually faces dire consequences, Muska represents evil. Sheeta knows that her aetherium chrystal may be too much for her to handle, so she tries use it only when she's in trouble, so she represents good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two years after the success of "Nausica of the Valley of the Wind", the makers released their second film, officially Studio Ghibli's first motion picture. "Laputa- Castle in the Sky" (Tenku no shiro Rapyuta, 1986) is one of maestro Hayao Miyazaki's most action filled adventure films, where his imaginative visions and never aging animation is once again combined with Joe Hisaishi's beautiful music.This time story is set in an alternative world that has futuristic flying aircrafts but seems otherwise still be in the early 20'Th century. Film's protagonist Pazu is a young boy working in mines, and who dreams of one day finding Laputa, the legendary castle in the sky that his late father claimed to have seen, but whom nobody believed. Pazu's chance to prove his father was right comes unexpectedly when a girl literally falls from the sky to his arms. The girl is Sheeta and she carries with her the key to find Laputa. Since Laputa is claimed to have limitless riches and unforeseen science, Sheeta is chased by air-pirate Dola and her gang, as well as Muska, a power hungry man working for the government. Pazu helps Sheeta and together they try to find Laputa before others.I can imagine how a nowadays Hollywood would probably use a plot like this as an excuse to create a movie with lots of special effects and very little contents. Miyazaki on the other hand over 20 years ago then gave us a film that is both entertaining action film for the whole family and that has interesting and believable characters (interestingly though, this is Miyazaki's only film that has a truly evil villain character, unlike in his later films). As "Nausica" this film's animation has not suffered much during the last decades and is still far more pleasant to watch, than most of the nowadays western animations. Miyazaki's love for flying and aircrafts shows throughout the whole film and everything is crowned with Joe Hisaishi's wonderful score music.I can't comment the original English dub since I've never heard it, but I can compare the original Japanese audio to Disney's 2003 English audio. The new dub has divided opinions a lot since it has altered the original score and added much more lines to the film. The extra lines may be more helpful to the youngest of the family, but really unnecessary for others. Since Joe Hisaishi himself conducted the altered score for the new dub, there really isn't anything bad to say about this and since dub has even more music, it just might be better. Fans of the original Japanese audio though may be puzzled by the changes in the original score. Voice actors differ. Both Mayumi Tanaka and Keiko Yokozawa are believable as kids, Pazu and Sheeta, but neither James Van Der Beek nor Anna Paquin convinces in the dub, having too mature voices. Kotoe Hatsui and Cloris Leachman are both on the same level as pirate Dola, both making the character witty, funny and sarcastic. On the other hand, Mark Hamill completely surpasses Minori Terada in the role of villainous Muska, Hamill's voice being more menacing and evil (10 years of voicing Joker probably helped). So, Disney's dub has more music and Mark Hamill, but otherwise I recommend original Japanese audio. But to each their own taste.Miyazaki's style is not quite there on the top still in this film, but the story telling takes you completely from the very start that you can't but love this film. It is also suitable for all ages, though has moments that mature audience appreciates more. Another classic from Ghibli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Animated Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty disappointed after watching Princess Mononoke. The beginning starts out very exciting. More excitement follows, when the air pirates try to abduct her and the guy. The necklace she wears does some very strange things, and it becomes a mystery. They want to find Laputa, the castle in the sky. The guy believes in it after seeing his father's pictures when he saw it. So this huge adventure takes place when they also try to evade the government and find Laputa and to protect the necklace. This movie has lots of spoilers, so I'm not going to say anything, but that this movie is FANTASTIC! Don't be afraid to see it, it's the best thing to come out of Japan, ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, another ride on a roller-coaster, created by Studio Ghibli and its personal saint, Hayao Miyazaki. I still don't know what impressed me more about it: The art, the pictures or the fantasy the story is driven by. I probably never will be able to make a decision about that.So forget about that and let me just say, watching a movie that carries the name "Miyazaki" somewhere is a guarantee for being on a trip through fantastic lands, inhabited by fresh, cool, amusing, impressive creatures and enjoying some of the most charming and unpredictable tales ever told.Some words on the graphics: This movie was made in a time where a computer that was capable of displaying the game "Pong" in a decent way had the size of a one-story-house. There was no Pixar, no ILM, no WETA Digital. There were crayons, pens and the talented hands of the incredible crew, gathered around Hayao Miyazaki. And just with that they created animated pictures that even nowadays let most other cartoons look like the work of an infant. An example? Just take a look at the castle towards the end.This is not a movie. This is a world on its own. And I enjoyed the visit.I can't wait till Christmas because this piece of art is gonna be one of my presents. Two more words: Special Edition!</fullReview>

It was only after i started watching it again that i noticed that could not appreciate the beginning it was meant for. I would only wait for good action and reard the rest as "boring." The characters are well developed, and it is overall well paced, though the scene where pazu and sheeta are floating down after falling off the rails might look familiar.

		<fullReview>It almost sounds demeaning to call this one of the most enjoyable animated films I've ever seen; it is, in fact, one of the most enjoyable films of any kind I've ever seen. Anyone familiar with the work of Miyazaki will find a lot of familiar territory here: the rural setting, the preoccupation with aircraft, the mythic themes. What separates this (along with the hilarious "Porco Rosso") is its playful brand of movie-serial cliffhanger action. There's much more to smile at here than in its more serious cousins such as Mononoke and Nausicaa. It's one of the handful of films that one can point to when trying to demonstrate the heights of which animation is capable.</fullReview>

From there, the two are chased by the army and pirates, all trying to find the beautiful and powerful floating castle of Laputa. Not only is Laputa a wonderful adventure story, it can make you stop and think about the horrible effects of war and absolute power. I very nearly cried at the end.

		<fullReview>"Laputa: Castle in the Sky" is a 1986 feature length animation by Japanese master director Hayao Miyazaki. The film opens with an exciting battle on-board a bulbous airship, in which a band of bumbling sky-pirates attempt to apprehend Sheeta, a little girl who possesses a stone with remarkable powers. Assisting Sheeta is Pazu, a resourceful kid who lives in a ramshackled mining community.Miyazaki's plot's frequently sound silly on paper. On screen, though, they're brimming with neat little details and passages. "Laputa's" packed with one cool sequence after the next, some interesting airship designs and several action sequences guaranteed to make live-action directors jealous (James Cameron, Brad Bird and Spielberg are self-professed Miyazaki fan-boys). And as is typical of Miyazaki, the film boasts another enchanting score by composer Joe Hisaishi, alternates between kinetic moments and poetic, Ozu-like postcard images, and is positively in love with aircrafts, flying and wide open skies. The film's eco-sermon is also less heavy-handed than some of Miyazaki's other works; here an ancient civilisation collapses when it symbolically loses all ties and connections with the natural world, a lesson which a new militaristic superpower fails to learn.Miyazaki directed "Nausicca of the Valley of the Winds" in 1984. Like that film, "Laputa" takes place in a steam-punk world which mixes high and low technology. This is a contrast to most science fiction animes, which take place in dystopian, cyberpunk futures. Of course Miyazaki is as anti-militaristic and techno-wary as his contemporaries (Satoshi Kon, Isao Takahata, Katsuhiro Otomo, Mamoru Oshii etc), but he's also far less pessimistic and far more romantic. They're about steel and concrete. He's a wood and chlorophyll guy. Miyazaki's steam-punk approach also tends to result in a number of unusual machines, many of which are evocative of Albert Robida, a French artist who was popular in the late 1880s."Laputa" is arguably the only film in Miyzaki's oeuvre with a conventional villain. His other films tend to have no clear distinctions between the "bad guys" and "good guys". At its best, the film conveys an incredible sense of place, with leafy cloud cities, subterranean mining towns (Laputa's mirror image), and turbulent skies which buffet flimsy airships. Unfortunately, after a strong first three acts, the film degenerates into clichs, with conventional light shows, damsels in distress and a obligatory "temple collapse" sequence (ancient temples always collapse RIGHT AFTER they've been rediscovered). Still, it's one of Miyazaki's coolest adventures.8.9/10 ? The similarly themed, though cyberpunk, "Akira" would be released 2 years later. See "Nausicca of the Valley of the Winds" and "Only Yesterday".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film, Castle in the Sky, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the early 20th century, an orphaned boy named Pazu (Voiced by James Van Derbeek) was working until he finds a girl named Sheeta (Voiced by Anna Paquin) floating from the sky with a crystal around her neck. His own mission is to protect her from government agents like Mushka (Voiced by Mark Hamil) to sneaky air pirates lead by Dola (Voiced by Cloris Leechman) who all want that crystal and to find the secrets that may lead to a legendary floating island in the sky called Laputa.co-starring the voices of Andy Dick, Mandy Patinkin and Richard Dystart, this here is a magnificent work of animated art. This brilliant animated fantasy adventure from writer-producer-director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the most original creations ever as it made big bucks at the Japanese box-office and excellent reviews. In 1989 it came here to the states in a decent dub called "Laputa: Castle in The Sky" and then in 1998 they made a redub version that was suppose to come out in 2000 but was delayed until 2003. I adored this movie for years since i was 15 when i had a fansub tape back in 97 when i was 15 and the soundtrack as well, the score to this one is just breathtaking.I also love the beautiful scenery, imaginative creations around the island to the landscapes and of course the action abound with good storytelling. This movie influenced many things like Sonic The Hedgehog 3 to James Cameron's Avatar.The film is pure entertainment and satisfying all the way as it's a must see for any movie or animation fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time. However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it. My main point being, Disney re-dubbed the film, despite the original English version being very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix. It begs the question why did Disney make such changes? It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film. It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love. I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life!</fullReview>

It's one of Miyazaki's earlier works, and that may explain it, but I just couldn't enjoy this film even though I really wanted to. I know it sounds funny to say, but it was simply just too "cartoony". The beginning of the film is pure magic and for the first 15 minutes or so, I was engrossed in the story and looking forward to the rest of the film. But soon after that, it degraded to almost Saturday-morning cartoon levels of predictability, relying on exaggerated and typical villains and supporting characters.

However, the villains track them down, as do a variety of other people who seem keen to get their hands on the girl, and soon Sheeta and Pazu are fleeing for their lives...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie: intriguing and original setup, making the first few scenes quite interesting, followed by random, unfocused plot development and lack of character depth or development. Just becomes a mindless adventure story without any point.Animation is so-so. You can't put this down to being made in the 1980s - Disney films of the 1940s and 50s had better animation.The linear, rambling storyline and lack of thinking required should make this ideal for kids, though the long duration of the movie and jumbled plot might be too much for their concentration spans.

It has excellent art, great music, beautiful hand-drawn animation with plenty of locations that standout such as the aetherium mine/cave, steam powered town, and certainly, all the locations in the floating island Laputa itself.Indeed, this film scores high in the story and artistic department but there are not much creative outfits, mostly simple designs for most of the characters. There are also plenty of things that don't make sense. A child building and operating an airship? He must be a prodigy. Gun shots cutting off ponytails and did not leave the child deaf or affected in any way? She must be really strong. I guess these are acceptable for 1980s films but well, good, creative stuffs usually don't make sense!Nonetheless, the film is sweet, interesting and comedic at times, keeps me glued to the screen. It is also super delightful to see those yellow fox-squirrel from Nausica of the Valley of the Wind (1984) again, they are so adorable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In no way am I slamming Spirited Away! It is a great film! But there is something about the purity of Castle in the Sky that blows me away. Has there ever been a more beautiful title sequence than the one in this film or a more beautiful musical theme or a more breathtaking castle? Each scene seems patiently thought through and carefully timed. The character development is plentiful but not overdone. I really love this film. More than anything else, I think it is dear to my heart.For one thing, I can't get over the action sequences. The mother is hilarious and totally runs the show with her band of hyper-masculinized idiots. It is a real joy to see the cars swerve back and forth as characters speed down the road in a tense car chase. There is real humor and grit in this film, and I believe that it belongs on anyone's list of classics, along with the rest of Ghibli's repertoire.My introduction to this film was upon reading Leonard Maltin's movie guide book about 7 years ago. I was very surprised to see that he had given a Japanese anime film 4 stars. (If anyone is familiar with Maltin, you would know he doesn't just "give away" four stars). He said that it was one of the best action films ever made, animated or otherwise. I was already familiar with Miyazaki's work via Spirited Away and was very excited to get my hands on a copy of Castle in the Sky. At first, I wasn't all that impressed with the film. It seemed melancholy compared to the flat-out dynamism of Spirited Away. But over time this film has warmed up to me and has earned a special place on my shelf. I would recommend to anyone interested in seeing this film, or who has seen it before and didn't really like it, to give it time. Allow Castle in the Sky to enchant you. It is SO worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had avoided watching 'Castle in the Sky' for many years. I was aware of Miyazaki's exemplary track record, and have enjoyed several of his films to date. However, I was aware that many of his earlier films were geared toward younger audiences. That, combined with the marketing materials (even before Disney got their hands on it) showed nothing of some of the more exciting elements of the story. All I knew was about young boy who met a young girl who 'fell from the sky', and that the film involved some kind of 'Castle in the Sky'. Sounds like a whole lot of ho-hum "let's put on a kiddie show" type stuff.Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. The story deftly blends magic and technology in an early industrial culture. Yes, the orphan boy, Pazu does meet the orphan girl Sheeta when she fell from the sky - but the reason she fell was no mystical fairy tale reason - she was hanging off the side of an airship, being pursued by pirates, secret agents and the military! Thus begins a rousing chase, and a search for the ultimate weapon - Laputa, an island (not just a castle) floating in the sky.There's action and adventure aplenty. And the film should be of particular interest to the steampunk crowd as it's an early anime influence on the genre. There are a few things you have to overlook, such as attempts at humor both scripted, and ad libbed by the English cast, which fall flat, an annoyingly repetitive musical score, and the inevitable moralizing that gets pretty thick at the end of most anime features. But it's worth putting up with that stuff for the fun ride. Be sure to skip the John Lassiter intro which adds nothing to the proceedings.</fullReview>

I must have watched is over 20 times, before the relatively recent release on DVD.I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is more comic.To put it another way, it's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese.I'm in no way complaining, the story and quality of animation are not detracted from, but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The less magical Ghibli feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie as a part of my project to see all the IMDb top 250 movies. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is another widely loved fantasy themed animation feature by the visionary anime creator Hayao Miyazaki. However, compared to the other films of Miyazaki that I have seen (and which are on the IMDb top 250 list) this feels most like a genuine children tale. It's not as subtle and magical as the more successful Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The characters can be easily classified as "good" or "evil" and the film is stuffed with straightforward action. However, this is not necessary a bad thing - at least for a genuine children movie. Animation and drawing are - as can be expected - as good as usual. Interestingly all Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli animations (that I have seen so far) have several common features: a young girl as the main protagonist, elder female character with authority, castles and air-crafts. Furthermore, some of the animated characters (for example small fox- like animals in the Laputa island) appear again in later or earlier Ghibli features. To summarize, Laputa: Castle in the Sky has its moments but feels generally more like your standard Saturday morning cartoon feature (on the Pokemon- Digimon-axis) than the other Miyazaki movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Have Seen Fututre Boy Conan or Howl's Moving...Skip This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miyazaki's films often have similar themes and similarly drawn characters. If I have to reframe from mentioning his other works and look solely at this film I suppose I would give it a 7 out of 10 and say it was good. However having seen Future Boy Conan before this as well as Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind and Howl's Moving Castle I would have to say this this movie in comparison to the aforementioned is skipable as it pales in comparison to those movies in story-telling, overall scenes, and English dubbing. I find that this movie shares similarities with the other movies in that: In Future Boy Conan the aircraft resemble moths/bugs. In this movie the aircraft resemble dragonflies/bugs. In ever movie mentioned here there is a theme of high technology controlled by the government/past that can destroy the world and a young boy and girl try and prevent this technology from destroying the world...There are similar looking characters.....Overall Future Boy Conan has more lovable characters and more humor. There are scenes in that series that are laugh out loud funny and heart warming as well! It's well worth the watch. And Nausica of The Valley is a great summary of Future Boy Conan.. It closely follows the theme of that series and reinterprets it in a new way and puts it in a feature length film VS a series of episodes and it does a great job of expressing high destructive technology vs peace loving nature....Does that make sense? Basically I have seen those movies and love them more than this. I was looking forward to this movie being great but i felt it was just a waste of time. It also bothered me how the boy in this movie never got to fly his aircraft that he built (then why even show it???) and how he didn't seem to posses any special skill 3/4ths of the movie yet somehow could climb like spider-man near the end and do things no human could ever do. He somehow had hands and feet that could cling unrealistically to a metal tube that went upwards- and free-climbed across roots like a monkey and it was just so unrealistic it bothered me....At least in Future Boy Conan the boy was shown from the very beginning as having unusual strength and skill. But this boy in this movie was ordinary until the end when he made a 360....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Miyazaki's best, but it still contains his trademark magic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw "Spirited Away." I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is "Castle in the Sky." Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as "Spirited Away" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for "The Last Picture Show," but she's annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.I would definitely recommend seeing "Castle in the Sky." I'll probably end up buying it myself. But even though it's not as good as "Spirited Away," it's still pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Castle in the sky has Miyazaki's signature all over it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film. After seeing it for the first time I'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint. On the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means (as to what Miyazaki's films are concern), that is nothing less than excellent! Produced early in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting (and some times lovable) supporting characters. And of course, flying machines (lots of it!!). Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausic?a, which was narratively speaking, a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates. As the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best. The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, (or vice versa, as Castle in the sky was produced first), and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward! A note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at that point in her career), and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska, making up for a delightfully yet devilish villain! Don't miss this one people!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable fairtytale with some great graphics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality.Just looked up "Laputa" on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected...the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's travels", which was published in the early to mid 1700s.Anyway, this is an engaging Japanese fairytale, which features an English speaking voice-cast. It's suitable for young children, I think, but it does run at just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me.The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it. The children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and looking to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) in order to help them find it.The graphics are magnificent...sort of photo-realistic at times, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch-light, or the pretty scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked this when entertainment value was all that mattered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production Conan. In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa--the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. If it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. The importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through. Overall, I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't love it as much as other Miyazaki films, but that might not be the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At his best, Miyazaki makes me indescribably happy with wonder. That's why I love his movies. I consider movies like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away to be, in essence, bottled happiness.But as with most great artists, different people will appreciate different things. One of Miyazaki's most popular films, Princess Mononoke, is my least favorite, because it's more about violence and drama than mystery and ethereal splendor.Castle in the Sky falls more in the Mononoke action adventure category, and as that, it's a pretty good move, exciting, well paced and visually imaginative and generally fun. I was less excited by this movie than others by Miyazaki,and that might be because it is very actiony, with lots of shooting and things blowing up, and that's not what I love by Miyazaki. But it might be something else.I started watching this movie with my girlfriend late at night, and for the first hour I thought it was terrific. But we got sleepy, and didn't watch the rest of the movie for a few days. Which means the problem might not be anything more than a loss of dramatic momentum owing to my seeing the movie broken up. Or it could be that the second hour really is weaker. I don't know. I did see this movie once before, and it didn't stick with me the way other Miyazaki films have, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked it better this time had I seen it in a single sitting.In other words, you can't put too much stock in this review, except to the extent that I can stand by my belief that this is an enjoyable movie. I just can't say if I would have enjoyed it more in different circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely *not* my favorite anime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely far from being my favorite. Actually, it reaches the opposite end of the scale.Why? (personal opinion) Lacking the depth of Mononoke-Hime and the beauty and fantasy of Chihiro (Spirited Away), if falls short in most regards. Maybe I am spoiled by the later movies, but the story was flat, predictable and straight forward. The graphics were sometimes really nice, but neither overwhelming nor stunning. For me the story failed to unfold, and I never felt connected to any of the protagonists. Sitting in the cinema I was (strangely) reminded of Star Wars 1. A lot of nice scenes and random events, but badly connected and hardly surprising at any given time. Also, the movie contains various elements of slapstick, fighting (with some force/brutality - plenty people get killed (though not directly visible)) and Jules-Verne-style tech-fantasy. But it never excels in any of those elements, they come rather "cheap" and mixing them wildly does not make any movie any better.For kids it might be an okay movie, but it lacks the "cuteness"-factor (except for some seconds with (fantasy) animals). For parents (or adults in general) it might become boring.This is my heavily biased subjective opinion - maybe without a 7.9 here on IMDb I would have watched it with lower expectations, but I guess I still would have been disappointed big time.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LAPUTA - CASTLE IN THE SKY (Hayao Miyazaki, 1986) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was about to write this, I decided to re-read my review of Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - which I watched earlier this year - and I realized that what I had said about that film pretty much applies to this one as well, even if there's practically a 20-year gap between them (I guess the inference here is that this celebrated animator's style hasn't developed all that much in the interim, which is not necessarily a bad thing).To quote myself, then: "a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius; however, it also features his typical faults - to me, at least - of presenting an over-ambitious (and overly weird) plot line which, due to its excessive length, tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming (if not necessarily memorable) visual experience! As usual, the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive". Granted, the plot of LAPUTA isn't nearly as involved as some of Miyazaki's later work, though this is still far from a kiddie film - particularly in its climactic set-piece, where all parties concerned (the children, the sky pirates - whose hard exterior mellows gradually to reveal an essential softness underneath - and the army - whose leader, too, isn't what he seems to be) converge on the titular flying citadel, each having their own goal. It's evident, therefore, that characterization is not at all one-dimensional (though Miyazaki dispenses with anthropomorphism this time around) - while the robotic guardians of the island castle are strikingly designed, as well as suitably imposing; the score (by frequent Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi), too, emerges as a definite asset.To tie in with how I began this review, then, I believe that it's been my over-exposure to Anime on Italian TV as a kid which has diluted the overall impact that such feature-length efforts (and Miyazaki's films in particular) seem to have - pretty much unanimously - on audiences from other parts of the world...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Howl meets Atlantis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Miyazaki movies and this one is no exception. However, after a few animations like this, the theme of innocent romance and youthful courage defeating the corrupt power of government and military alike start getting old.The story: in an alternate world resembling very much the world in Howl's Moving Castle, only a lot more airborne, there is a legend of a floating island where riches and enormous power can be found, named Laputa. Of course, people start looking for it, for various reasons, resulting in a massive conflict of interest. In the end, being human, young and alive is far more important than being powerful and technologically advanced, therefore the child queen of Laputa utters the word of destruction and everything blows away. Everybody good lives, everybody bad dies.In the end the animation is great, but I expected that, so is the music and the basic storyline, however the moral got lost somehow between the obviously Japanese fear of technological disaster and characters of unreasonable courage and moral strength. I never expected Miyazaki to be realistic, but at least I wanted the movie to be unpredictable. It is full of clichs.Maybe the overall resemblance to Atlantis: The Lost Empire also made me fear a Disney contamination of Japanese anime, but in the end, both movies have the same audience, so why not be more like each other?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated anime fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki has been getting a lot of praise recently as a result of the American release of his excellent 'Mononoke-Hime' and his somewhat less than excellent 'Spirited Away'. Castle in the Sky fits in between the two in terms of quality, but adds to the feeling that I got when the credits of 'Spirited Away' rolled that Hayao Miyazaki doesn't deserve such high praise as he's getting. Don't get me wrong, this certainly isn't a bad film (neither is Spirited Away), but it's hardly the work of a great master either. The substance on offer isn't much more than what you'd find in a Saturday morning cartoon, and the film takes itself way too seriously for an animated feature. Too much of the film is spent on characters delivering reams of heartfelt dialogue and it comes across as contrived and more than a little bit silly. However, this is matched by Miyazaki's inventiveness and attention to detail, which keeps the film away from the low end of the rating scale.With this film, Miyazaki has created his own world for his character's to inhabit, and that is always going to garner praise for the auteur. The story follows a young girl that has a crystal that has the power to show the owner the way to a mythical and powerful city in the sky. After escaping from various evildoers that want the crystal for their own reasons, she finds herself on the run with a young boy that also wants to find the lost city. This creativity is both a help and a hindrance to the story. On the one hand it allows Miyazaki creative freedom over what goes on, and he makes best use of that on many occasions. However, on the other hand, because the world isn't a complete whole - it leaves many questions unanswered, and after an hour or so of being bombarded with goings on that don't make much sense; the film gets more than a little bit tiresome. The film follows the classic adventure structure, which is nice as it makes for an entertaining ride. Castle in the Sky also has a nice musical score, which fits the tone of the film excellently.This film certainly isn't bad, but it's not great either and I suspect that more than a little of it's praise has come of a result of the popularity of Miyazaki's later works and the fact that Japanese things are very much in fashion of late. However, if anime is your bag, you'll find lots to like here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had ordered this film with much anticipation off the Internet, since I had already seen most of Miyazaki's works, and I was surprised that it didn't grab me at all. The animation is very simple, it looks exactly like any Saturday morning cartoon (although admittedly, some of the backgrounds are of a higher caliber). The only things to differentiate it from a programme on Nickelodeon are the magical and beautiful score by Hisaishi, and the storyline. I would've loved to love this movie as much as I did Miyazaki's other efforts, but it just didn't have any resonance, it was too cartoony and childish. Maybe I'll watch it again and gain a different impression, maybe I've been spoiled by Spirited and Mononoke, but I just know this isn't anywhere near as impressive as those. 4/10</fullReview>
