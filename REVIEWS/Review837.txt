		<shortDescription>A Tale Of Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all remember five years ago when the story of 33 miners trapped 700 meters underground caught the world by storm. Everyone was asking: Are they alive? How are they going to make it out of there?. I think there's no need to say how it ended. Since then we've gotten tons of news announcing a big budget film about San José's rescue. The thing everyone's asking right know is: Is it any good? First things first: Patricia Riggen. Her direction is absolutely brilliant, managing to alternate between tense and emotional scenes almost perfectly. The acting as well is outstanding, with Antonio Banderas (Mario Sepúlveda) and Rodrigo Santoro (Laurence Golborne) being the most notable. Also, Cote De Pablo (Jessica Salgado) brings a big emotional push into the movie with a beautiful interpretation of "Gracias a la Vida" by Violeta Parra. Juliette Binoche (María Segovia) was also very good. In general, every actor and actress in this movie gave a solid performance. The screenplay is very well written, giving the characters a lot of development and personality. The soundtrack (Composed by James Horner) is also very good, mixing chilean instruments with big orchestra compositions that fit the movie perfectly. The CGI is OK, nothing groundbreaking, but it gets the job done.It's not a faultless film though, it has it's flaws. The are times when the movie loses it's pace and gets slow. Also, the editing, being mostly very good, it's evident that there where scenes in the movie that were cut from the final product, an issue that can leave some viewers confused. There's a little bit of shaky cam as well, not a big complain, but it can get very disorienting at times.Overall, even if it's not perfect, it's still a great movie that succeeds at telling the story of the 33 miners. Hopeful and inspiring, it's worth watching at least once.8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The 33" is a true story dramatically and compellingly told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mining is a dangerous business. Going deep underground to dig minerals out of the earth means subjecting yourself to extreme heat, back-breaking work and the inhalation of dust that can lead to the pulmonary disease of silicosis. If none of these kill you slowly, the mine itself can kill you quickly and without warning. Miners die from accidents caused by their equipment, gas leaks and explosions and, of course, sudden collapses of the rock surrounding them. All told, this difficult work kills thousands of miners every year (as many as 12,000 by one count). These facts and statistics are brought to life in the true story of the 2010 Chilean copper-gold mine collapse portrayed in the drama "The 33" (PG-13, 2:07).The film opens with a retirement party for one miner who is about to complete 45 years of service to the private company that owns and operates the San José mine near Copiapó, Chile. Several of his long-time co-workers are at the party with their families. Their is shift foreman Luis "Don Lucho" Urzúa (Lou Diamond Phillips), experienced miner and natural leader Mario Sepúlveda (Antonio Banderas), father-to-be Álex Vega (Mario Casas) and Elvis Presley-loving miner Edison Pe?a (Jacob Vargas), among others.On the morning of August 5, 2010, these men took the long and winding truck ride three miles into the mine, completely unaware that they were about to become victims of one of the worst mining disasters in Chile's history. Luis saw it coming, but the safety concerns that he expressed to the mine's manager went unheeded. That afternoon, a rock the height of the Empire State Building and the width of two of them fell into the mine, trapping 33 men inside. Seeing the devastating cave-in and its effects on the men and their surroundings, it seems like a miracle that none of the 33 died in the initial collapse. Although some would say that the real miracle would be if no one died in mining accidents, or at least if this collapse had occurred during off-duty hours, rather than the miners having to get trapped and suffer, while their families waited in agony for news about the fate of their loved ones.It was those families who became the impetus for a full-on rescue attempt. Although Chile's President (Bob Gunton) is reluctant to get his government involved with an accident at a privately-owned mine, his new Minister of Mining, Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro) convinces President Pi?era to let him go to the site and see what he can do. The families, led by María Segovia (Juliette Binoche), the estranged sister of trapped miner Darío Segovia (Juan Pablo Raba), had gathered outside the locked gates of the mining complex. These siblings, wives, mothers, fathers and friends demanded action, and action they got. In spite of the prevailing opinion that the miners were probably dead or would die long before they could be rescued, Minister Golborne brings in heavy-duty drills and works with renowned mining expert André Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne) to try and reach the miners before it's too late. Meanwhile, the miners ration food and try to keep each other's spirits up, even as several of them fight and suffer from various medical conditions, as hope fades that they will ever see their families again."The 33" is exceptional. Based on the book "Deep Down Dark" by Héctor Tobar, the film version takes few liberties with the facts and fashions a very compelling narrative. The screenplay succinctly, but effectively sets the stage and develops its characters ? both above and below ground. We feel the desperation of both the miners and their families. As the miners' story unfolds, concurrently with that of their families and those attempting to rescue them, Patricia Riggens directs with great pacing (which is helped by nearly perfect editing). She also gets great performances from her cast and blends the talents and experience of well-known and little-known actors wonderfully. Although the movie did drag a little as it neared its dramatic conclusion, this is a film which tells its story with drama, sensitivity and even some humor and makes it relatable to anyone who ever came to the aid of someone in trouble.

		<shortDescription>An emotional tribute to the 33 Chilean Miners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's not a rock, that's the heart of the mountain. She finally broke."Five years ago the eyes of the entire South American population were placed on a relatively unknown small mining town in Chile. When the San Jose mine collapsed in Copiapo, 33 miners were trapped under more than 2000 feet, and the news travelled fast. It isn't uncommon to hear about these tragic mining accidents, but what stood out here was that the family members never lost hope and established camp near the site to force authorities to not give up and continue the rescue efforts. After two and a half weeks of uncertainty and against all odds, the rescuers managed to contact the refuge in the mine where all 33 miners reported to be alive and well. That was just the beginning of a long and exhaustive rescue effort that would last more than two months, and that every media channel covered 24 hours a day. The story is recent and we all saw it take place live on our TV sets, so the real question I had for Patricia Riggen's film was whether or not she could make this captivating enough to hold our interest despite the familiarity of the story. Surprisingly she succeeded. The film is deeply flawed and for commercial purposes it had an international cast that spoke in English with a forced Chilean accent. I hate movies that do this (if you want to tell the story in English then just have the actors speak in plain English; you're not more convincing because you do it with an accent), but despite that pet peeve of mine, the film managed to draw me in emotionally and I found it to be a beautiful and honest tribute. I can understand those who criticize the movie because it isn't perfect, but there were several emotional scenes where I literally had goose bumps all over my arms, and that is always an indicator for me that the movie is accomplishing its purpose. One of the main characters in this film, the miner who kept the group together under those critical conditions, was Mario Sepulveda (Antonio Banderas). He never lost hope and promised the rest of his friends that he would keep them alive. His wife, Escarlette (Naomi Scott), was one of the supporters who decided to set camp outside the site to force authorities to continue their rescue efforts. The other main supporter was Maria Segovia (Juliette Binoche) who refused to believe that her brother, Dario (Juan Pablo Raba) was dead. Along with other family members and with the help of the media they put pressure on the government to save their lives. The Mining Minister, Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro), and mining expert, Andre Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne), were given the difficult task to come up with a plan to rescue these miners who were buried deep underground. Meanwhile under the heart of the mountain, Mario was in charge of keeping the group spirit alive and avoiding they end up driving each other crazy due to the lack of food and water. He lifted Alex's (Mario Casas) spirit when he was falling into despair reminding him that his pregnant wife Jessica (Cote de Pablo) was waiting for him, he also protected the only Bolivian in the crew, Carlos Mamani (Tenoch Huerta), who was pushed aside by everyone else for being a foreigner, and he also encouraged Don Lucho (Lou Diamond Phillips), who felt had failed the team because he knew the security conditions were bad. Rigged delivers both sides of the story: the 33 miners struggling to survive from the inside and the family members and the rescue team fighting to save them from the outside.I wasn't really into the film during its first thirty minutes because I was upset the characters were speaking in English with Spanish accents (to make matters worse there is a scene where a famous Chilean TV star named Don Francisco shows up and gives a report in Spanish), but midway into the movie the emotional drama picks up. There is a superb scene in which the miners are imagining eating their last supper together, and it was one of the most touching scenes I've seen this year. The visual effects weren't mesmerizing, but the collapse of the mine is believable. It takes a while to get used to the dark cinematography inside the mines where you can't tell most of the characters apart from each other. I'd say there are only about five miners who you can recall from the film, the rest are just there and are given no personality whatsoever. Those are some of my minor complaints for this film, but other than that the material was handled respectfully and James Horner's final musical composition helps build the emotional moments. Another memorable moment was when Cote de Pablo sings a beautiful song, Gracias a la Vida, while the families are awaiting for any news from the rescue team. Antonio Banderas delivers a great performance as Mario and he is one of the reasons why the dramatic moments worked so well. Despite knowing the story, it was still exciting and emotional to experience it in this flawed but touching film. There is also a funny and recurring gag on one of the miners (Oscar Nu?ez) who had his wife and lover waiting for him in the camp. The film might not be entirely accurate, but it is still a well made film and a decent tribute. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling story of human resilience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this at Twin Cities Film Fest this weekend. The 33 chronicled the event that gripped the international community when 33 Chilean miners were buried under 100- year-old gold and copper mine and trapped for 69 days.Director Patricia Riggen did a phenomenal job telling a compelling story of human resilience and the courage of both the miners and their families above ground who refused to give up. Great ensemble cast featuring Antonio Banderas, Juliette Binoche, Lou Diamond Philips, Rodrigo Santoro, and Gabriel Byrne. It was exquisitely shot by Checco Varese, which was shot on location in two different mines in Bolivia, Colombia. It certainly looked authentic as the environment of the set made the actors felt as if they were real miners for a while. The 33 miners were also consulted for the film.There were moments that might have felt too 'Hollywoodized' but overall the film didn't feel emotionally manipulated. The genuinely stirring score came from the late James Horner, which the film paid tribute in the end. It's not a perfect film but I think the film was respectful to the subject matter and did the story and those miners justice.? read more new releases reviews on FlixChatter.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. How do you structure a film based on a true story that lasted 69 days, occurred 5 years ago, and was followed live on TV by half of the global population? Director Patricia Riggen (Girl in Progress, 2012) delivers a film designed to tug on heartstrings, and is based on the book "Deep Down Dark" from Hector Tobar, as well as interviews with the key players.In 2010, the San Jose copper/gold mine collapsed trapping 33 miners more than 2300 feet under tons of rubble and an unstable rock that dwarfed the Empire State Building. Through some pretty solid special effects, we are there for the collapse. It's this segment and the immediate reactions from the miners that provide the film's best segment. We feel the miner's sense of panic and doom as they begin to come to grips with their plight.The film rotates between three struggles: the isolation of the miners struggling to survive, the tent city populated by their families struggling to maintain hope, and the Chilean government struggling with the politics and public relations of a rescue mission. From a character standpoint, each of these three segments is given a face. Antonio Banderas as Mario becomes the focal point of the miners. He searches for an escape route, takes charge of the (very limited) food rations, and acts as referee and light of hope in an extremely volatile situation. Juliette Binoche (yes the French actress) is Maria, the sister of one of the trapped miners and the most assertive of those pushing the government to attempt a rescue. Rodrigo Santoro plays Laurence Goldborne, Chile's Minister of Mining, and the one who pushes the government to move forward with the costly rescue mission.Other key characters include Bob Gunton as Chile's President Pinera, Lou Diamond Phillips as "Don Lucho", the safety inspector, Gabriel Byrne as the chief engineer, James Brolin as Jeff Hart (leading the U.S. drilling team), Naomi Scott as Mario's wife, and three of the other miners: Oscar Nunez, Mario Casas, and Juan Pablo Raba.The most bizarre segment comes courtesy of miner hallucinations. It's a fantasy-infused Last Supper sequence that plays out to the sounds of a Bellini opera, while the food and drink flow and the family members join in the joy. It's not difficult to imagine the brain taking these poor gentlemen to such places of mental torture.As if the approach is to make the most viewer-friendly buried miner film possible, we aren't witness to much underground conflict, and the internal bickering within the Chilean government officials is kept to a minimum. We do get to see the media circus that occurred during the ordeal ? of course, most of us witnessed it in real time.Director Riggen has delivered a film that taps into the multitude of emotions for the different groups of people, rather than concentrating on the miserable situation of the miners. It's a challenge to keep us interested in a true story of which we all know the ending, but most viewers will stay engaged with the characters. It should also be noted that the minimalistic score is some of the last work from the late, great James Horner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done story about what can happen when we all work together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true story of 33 miners who go into a mine in Chile to have a big rock get in-between them and the surface, and they have to survive long enough to be rescued.I thought the movie was very detailed and complete about what the miners and their families went through during this ordeal. I never felt I missed any part of it.It was never boring, always interesting, which I did not expect, but a lot went on in those three mouths and it was captured wonderfully on the screen.Antonio Banderas was great as Mario, who kept the men together long enough to survive. And even though I knew the outcome, the 33 makes you feel for each character, which allows suspense.Well done and heartwarming, hitting on the rights spots and leaving me all filled up inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand there are limits and parameters to telling a story such as this -- one we all remember. But why would the producers/writers not include the heroics of the paramedics and navy seals who *went down first* to secure the 33's health. That is a story onto itself. And they're completely left out? I enjoyed the film until that part at the end, asking myself, WTF? A complete omission and slap in the face of men who put themselves in harm's way. It doesn't make sense not to include a couple of minutes of their work in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mining Disaster That Captured The World's Attention In 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For sixty-nine days in the summer and autumn of 2010, the world was transfixed by a human-interest story like few others in history. It involved the plight of thirty-three mineworkers trapped inside an unstable mountain mine in the Atacama Desert in the southern part of Chile. During what appeared to be a routine mining operation some two thousand feet below the desert surface on August 5, 2010, the mountain started shifting very violently, trapping these workers in a shelter, blocked by a mass of rock twice the size of New York's Empire State Building. With three days worth of rations, the miners managed to survive an extra two weeks before massive drills managed to reach them with additional supplies. But during that time, it was necessary to engage in a very careful rescue operation that took an additional seven and a half weeks; and it involved a great deal of risk. Utilizing a Phoenix rescue capsule designed in the U.S., the multi-national rescue operation resulted in all thirty-three men coming out of there alive on October 13th, some in very bad shape, but all in one piece, physically anyway. This is the story told in the 2015 movie THE 33.Well directed by Patricia Riggen, a Mexican-born female director whose credits include 2007's UNDER THE SAME MOON, THE 33 stars Antonio Banderas and Lou Diamond Phillips as the principal leaders of the miners who find themselves trapped in that mountain, literally between a rock and a hard place, and a Chilean mining company and government that seem unwilling to believe that any of them are alive. The claustrophobic nature of the saga is very well depicted by Riggen, and give the added gravitas by the largely Latin American cast that portray the miners, including Banderas and Phillips. A fair amount of this film was made on location not far from the actual mine itself, in Copiapo, Chile; and the remoteness is photographed with the utmost stark reality imaginable. Riggen also depicts the kind of international media attention that the story got, and how the families and wives of the miners, including Juliette Binoche, who portrays the wife of miner Dario Segovia, played in the film by Juan Pablo Rada, angrily pressed the case for the Chilean government to do more, even to the point of asking for help from outside sources, including an American mining and drilling expert portrayed by James Brolin. Gabriel Byrne and Rodrigo Santoro portray the government officials charged with finding a way of drilling down to the miners without making the mountain even more unstable than it already is, and thus guaranteeing a cave-in that would make rescue impossible.While it may be easy to portray the Chilean mine disaster depicted in THE 33 as an example of corporate malfeasance that had nearly fatal results, that socio-political aspect is not really discussed in the film, although when the end credits (featuring the real life miners) roll, the end title card indicates that the mining company never compensated the miners for their nearly ten weeks of psychological and spiritual horror (in essence, they got the Shaft, so to speak). The film, however, does go to great lengths to depict the aforementioned psychological and spiritual horror they went through, including a subtle hint that, unless food was sent down to them, they might resort to cannibalism if any of them died off in that hellhole, where temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit the entire time. Even without this hint, though, the film that THE 33 most closely resembles is 1993's ALIVE, which depicted the survivors of the 1972 Andean plane crash whose survival did partially depend on cannibalism; it also resembles the equally compelling true-life 1995 space saga APOLLO 13. Another aspect well depicted is how transfixed the international media, including every news outlet in the United States, covered this story in a way that, given how tabloid-focused it had become by then, was largely tasteful, though also suitably dramatic.The whole enterprise is topped off by an appropriate, somber, and Andean-flavored score by James Horner, which turned out to be one of the last film scores he worked on before he perished in a plane crash in Ventura County, California on June 22, 2015. Despite the fairly leisurely pace (some would, mistakenly in my opinion, call it slow), THE 33, like ALIVE and APOLLO 13, is done in the right way, avoiding spectacle most of the time, using CGI only when necessary, and steering clear of sensationalism. As such, it will likely count as one of the best movies of 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tragic Accident and a Heroic Rescue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its empowering story, visuals and acting, this film brings another true survival story to life. A group of thirty three gold miners go to work in the underlying mountains of Chile when their lives quickly turn upside down. Stranded by the collapse of the rocks, the men are forced to work together, struggle for food, stay optimistic despite their life threatening condition. With every second so crucial, the intensity of the film leaves the audience on the edge of their seats.Watching this film made me feel the pain of the miners, the anxiety of the families and the stress of the rescue team. I could personally feel the struggle from every side of the story. This is an amazing aspect of the film, especially because it is based on a true story. What better way to gain awareness than to make individuals feel the experience for themselves. I felt like throwing up throughout the whole movie and that just shows how amazingly the filmmakers depicted this horrifyingly true story of the innocent men who were stranded and their struggle to survive. The filmmakers have created a film that makes the audience feel as though they are experiencing the struggle rather than just watching it. I felt as if I was starving and becoming dehydrated just by watching. It's what makes the movie feel so real. The persuasive acting contributes to the empowering movie, especially Antonio Banderas whose performance as the leader, Mario was so believable. It's a role completely different from what he usually plays and he made me believe he was a Chilean miner. Usually films based on tragic events feel depressing but this film feels empowering and comedic in certain scenes. I enjoyed that. The film didn't make the best impression at first but, it became very engaging and strong towards the end. I give a lot of credit to its great ending because, in my opinion, an ending can really make or break a movie. I give the movie four out of five stars and recommend it for people between the ages of 13 and 18. Adults will enjoy it as well. Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard True Story Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 33 is based on a true story about thirty-three miners who were trapped underground after an earthquake back in 2010. A film adaptation could have easily been another one of those claustrophobic/isolated approach such as Cast Away, 127 Hours or Buried, where we only focus on the protagonist finding a way to get out. But no, it's a movie that bounces into different locations, characters (even outside the cave) and themes; so this might as well be The Martian, except it's twice as conventional and sentimental. Yeah, the movie doesn't quite manage to linger on the ordeals, which makes The 33 a mostly contrived piece of drama.The movie doesn't wait longer for the miners to face the mishap, though it does take some time to establish each of their personal life, more specifically with their loved ones who are also going to help pushing the government to get them back. After those moments of shoehorning, foreshadowing and the accident finally happened, the victims gone paranoid and plan ahead for the rest of their days, finally facing the reality of their situation, while their loved ones are protesting for the lack of information of the incident. It's not a bad setup, but as the story goes, it just goes to the most standard, almost Hallmark worthy drama. It hardly takes any risks, it just pushes into easy sentiments. Though there is some strong moments, well sort of. Specifically after an incredibly awkward hallucination sequence from the miners, it suddenly segues to a quiet moment of reality. That silence is the kind of gravity this movie needed more, but again, it's supposed to be a feel-good inspiration, so we don't see much of a compelling struggle.The characters aren't given enough definition either, aside of their families, thus their moments below the cave is basically just a series of melodramatic issues that get easily resolved. However, it is visually appealing, the production and the setting really look flavorful in detail. The direction also solidly put its action together, but only for the sake of spectacle rather than suspense. The acting is pretty strange, one could argue that these international actors are just great enough to play these roles, but the accents are just so unnatural. Put that aside, well their performances eventually turn out to be predictable in this dramatic platform's standards.I wanted to like The 33, this is a good story and I believe this can be perfect on screen if it was handled by a much inspired storytelling, but it goes to the breeziest route that every conventional drama typically end up. Maybe a little more gravitas like its quietest moments, maybe more depth from at least some of these miners aside of their relationships and single noted personalities. In the end, most of the conclusion feels unearned, not because of there was no effort, but because the movie doesn't quite linger at the more interesting parts of this dilemma. We've seen this approach before and we knew that it doesn't quite bring much tension, depth or complexity with its story, thus everything feels underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope Runs Deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes in life you come across stories that are so intense and complex they are worth being immortalized on film. And the 2010 Copiapó mining incident in Chile is as intense as it gets.All of the sudden, everyone back then got out of their routine and turned their attention to Chile, where this surreal situation of 33 souls trapped 700m deep in the entrails of a very unsafe mine. Were they alive? How many survived? If they managed to, are they well? And, above all, could they be rescued?As the days passed, each one of these questions were answered in a miraculous way: against all odds, that note determinedly handwritten in bold red defied circumstances and extolled hope: "Estamos bien en el refugio, los 33". Fueled by this motivation sparked from underground, an entire country -with the whole world watching- began the war against the clock, with the clear resolution of getting them to the surface, and reunite with their families.This film brilliantly captures every single of those moments, with the precise amount of drama. Great performances from the actors, the cast delivers every single emotion convincingly, notably the actresses, Banderas, Santoro and Raba, who successfully connect with the viewer. The atmosphere is also claustrophobic, aided by the sound editing, that helps the audience feel right there, trapped beneath rocks. Some side-stories help to give context to the story, and even balance it with humorous moments. It is a roller coaster of emotions that, despite possibly knowing how it all ended, keeps you at the edge of your seat.Perhaps its only downside -which is an important one for me- is the film editing. Some scenes appear to end abruptly. A major principle in drama is that you must leave some time for the spectator to process the emotion you have just conveyed. For moments, there's no transition: you get shocked by a sensitive scene, only to be immediately swept by a funny one. And even worse, transitions between scenes taking place in the refugee and the surface are not as smooth as you'd want, given the obvious difference in lighting, even leading in one occasion to me being left almost blinded after a cave scene cuts inadvertently to a bright sky. These aspects should have been taken into account and prevented. It's a shame they didn't have the tact to consider this while editing the film.All and all, it's a great real-life drama movie. You will be touched by the performances and the overall atmosphere, if you do not let yourself be distracted by the graceless editing. But it's greatly scripted and directed. The final scene, with the inspector of the mine breaking in tears while looking at the inscription the miners left on the bedrock summarizes the tragedy perfectly. And showing on screen the real characters of the story (who also worked on film production as well) right before the credits roll was a very nice touch.</fullReview>

I quite enjoyed Everest recently and was hoping this would be of the same. Sadly this was a long drawn out mess. The subject matter while interesting and dramatic was not utilised and you felt nothing for the miners. Although you know before hand that there were no fatalities among the group the writers do nothing to push you into thinking they were in mortal danger. When the end finally came there was no sense of relief of feeling of jubilation the movie just fell flat. If you're expecting something good here move along mediocre at best</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with all movies "based on" or "Inspired by" a true story, this movie might be filled with some embellishments or even flat out fabrications. If that's true then shame on the producers.I know nothing about the true events except what I learned from watching this movie. And I have to say I thought the movie was awesome. There were a few things that could have been done better. Using Caucasian actors to play Hispanic roles was pure Hollywood Cheese. They can't get passed the idea that only movies with white actors make any money. What they won't accept is that bad movies with white actors don't make money either.But The 33 is an awesome movie. It's a gripping family story, human interest story, character driven, keep-the-tissue-handy kind of film. If you, like me, wonder why they never make good movies anymore, check out The 33 before it goes away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story, but a Few Problems Stick Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really sure what to think of this movie when I first saw the trailers. The story sounded interesting and I was actually reminded of when these guys were trapped down there. How can you mess up a movie like that? Well, as soon as I saw that the film was in English I started to worry a little bit. What's wrong with using the native tongue and giving us subtitles? Can we lazy Americans not read? Whatever the reason was, it worried me a little bit. Fortunately, the movie is actually pretty good and I forgot about the language thing fairly soon after it began. I've never heard of the director before, a woman named Patricia Riggen, but I believe the film was well directed and I enjoyed what we were given.The story is based off of the true story of 33 Chilean miners that end up being buried underground inside a gold and copper mine. Everyone knows the mine is dangerous but the higher ups aren't willing to do anything to correct the problem and the guys inside suffer because of it. As strange as it sounds, these guys actually manage to pull together and ration their food until drillers on the outside are able to get food through to them. While the miners suffer on the inside, families, drillers, and one particular politician work to get them out on the outside.We actually got some pretty good talent for this film but I feel a little weird about some of the inclusions. Before we get to that, let's talk about some of the stand-outs. Antonio Banderas gets the most screen time as Mario Sepulveda. He's a family man and easy going guy at first but ends up taking on the role of the leader when the mine starts collapsing. We see many sides to Mario during the film but he always comes through to help his fellow workers. Banderas pulls off this role extremely well and it's nice to see him play something a bit more serious for a change. The spearhead of the rescue operation on the outside, Laurence Goldborne, is played by Rodrigo Santoro. He does a pretty good job as the Minister of Mining and almost seems like he's portrayed as a kind of saint. He always goes out of his way to do the right thing and wants to help the miners and their families. Everyone else does a decent to great job as well but there's a few things that bug me about the cast to the movie.Do Chilean actors and actresses just not exist in Hollywood? I mean, at least go for some more people that are actually Hispanic but there are a lot of people in this film that don't feel like they belong. For example, Juliette Binoche is an excellent actress but why in the world was she chosen to get the most screen time out of all the other ladies and she's the one that's not Hispanic? She does a fine job but it is a little jarring right at first. Bob Gunton and Gabriel Byrne also stood out like sore thumbs to me and it makes me wonder if they ran out of Hispanic actors and actresses. Don't get me wrong, these are all talented people but I didn't for a single second believe they were a different ethnicity.Fortunately, the movie is still pretty good even though there are some scenes that took me out of the experience. The best parts of the film actually take place inside the mine. The mine itself is almost complete darkness because of the lack of light which really helps to set the mood and makes the situation seem even more hopeless. Seeing all of them pull through together and help one another shows just how resilient humanity can be. I know the families on the outside were worried about their loved ones but the struggles of the miners are what we really want to see.Despite a few complaints, this is still a really enjoyable film. The story is interesting (and true!) and the scenes inside the mine are really well done and help to make the situation seem even more hopeless. The acting is also excellent in the movie but I couldn't help but notice the lack of actual Hispanic actors and actresses. Still, it's a small complaint considering how good the film is. I would recommend giving it a watch if you're in the mood for a good drama and a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie fills you with hope and shows what humans can do when their backs are against the wall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's not a rock. That's the heart of the mountain. She finally broke." August 5, 2010 started out like any other day. Mario (Banderas) and 32 other miners headed down in a mountain looking for gold. While they are underground the unthinkable happens. Now, with only enough food and water for 30 people for 3 days the 33 trapped miners must ban together and fight in order to survive long enough to be rescued. This is a difficult movie to make emotional. The subject matter lends itself to it, but this only happened 6 years ago and most people remember the events and the outcome. The fact that most people know how this will turn out is a hard thing to overcome. This movie did that and more. The movie was tense, emotional and really sucks you in. You are on the edge of your seat almost the entire time and you actually forget you know how it will turn out. That is a tremendous thing for a movie to pull off. This is a great movie for all ages and I recommend this. The movie fills you with hope and shows what humans can do when their backs are against the wall. Overall, one of the best movies of the year. I highly recommend this. I give this an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trapped deep down a gold mine. Unnerving? Yes. Superficial? Yes too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's a big rock. That's not a rock. That's the heart of the mountain. She finally broke.""The 33" is impressive, unnerving, claustrophobic and touching at the same time. But at the same time also a bit superficial. The true story of a mine disaster in Chile which happened in 2010. This disaster got a lot of media attention. The entire world witnessed the rescue operation in which all the unfortunate miners were brought back to the surface. One aspect of the movie is hereby nullified. There won't be a surprising denouement. Anyone who follows the media a bit, knows how it ends. One fact amazed me though. How is it possible that precisely in this group the kind of colorful archetypes were present? It seemed as if the group was deliberately composed in such a way that it would be the ideal company to make a film about, the moment something went wrong. What a coincidence.The group is a hodgepodge of poor devils, risking their lives for a pittance on a daily base. Only the mine owners are the ones getting filthy rich. Of course, the following types were present. First, we have an old-timer on the verge of retirement. Next an alcoholic who'll get the most rigorous detox. Luckily there's a priest among them to support him. Of course there's also a father-to-be. And then you have two individuals who are completely different when it comes to character traits. Mario (Antonio Banderas) is the epitome of positivism and believes in salvation from the first minute. And Don Lucho (Lou Diamond Phillips) is the one who gives up hope the moment they discover that all emergency exits are fake and they are trapped like rats. I expected the latter to sing an underground version of "La Bamba" in order to keep their morale high.The moment disaster strikes, the film takes place at two locations, with groups fighting their own battle. First the topsoil. Those left behind struggle against those responsible for the mine, because they don't have the intention to undertake a rescue attempt. Those relatives also try to get this mine disaster on the political agenda of the Chilean Government. A representative of the Government, Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro), cares about what happened with these poor miners and launches an international rescue operation. And secondly those who are stuck in the mine and who struggle against hardships, their buddies and most of all themselves.The film succeeds in outlining the situation in a proper manner. The hope to find a way out and the despair that strikes when all alleged emergency exits of "the refuge" appear to be unusable, because of the lack of food and the malfunctioning communication. An intriguing picture of the hardships endured by these 33 miners. Unfortunately it became rather superficial after they got stuck there. A missed opportunity in my opinion. They could dig deeper (euh...) into the personal lives of these gold diggers. Who were they? And what about their family life? All we get to see are a group of brave persons in deplorable conditions. And above them there's a race going on between several firms hoping to score a publicity stunt. They just need to be the first one who can provide a way out."The 33" seems like an exciting documentary. A disaster film that takes place deep underground. But despite the big names and the miraculous rescue (surviving two months on a ration of a few days), it remains a typical disaster movie. Exaggerated special effects were shunned and the "we-won't-give-up" feeling was omnipresent. But it could have been more. The depth those unfortunate 33 men were trapped in was significantly (about 700 meters). However, in general the content of the film was little. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Thirty-three men, trapped underground, and we don't even know if they are alive?'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An infamous rescue in 2010 as written in the book 'Deep Down Dark' by Hector Tobar and adapted for the screen by Jose Rivera, Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten and Michael Thomas and directed with great skill by Patricia Riggen is brought to life by a splendid cast who not only maintain a sense of credibility to the incredible 69 day survival trapped in a mine but also make us aware that the government and the mining company did not compensate these men or their families for the disaster they experienced.Filmed in Chile and Colombia the action is very real due to not only the cinematography and special effects but also to the fine cast of characters. The place - Copiapo, Chile were many of the town's men dig for gold in the San José mine. Mario (Antonio Banderas) takes extra shifts to support his wife Katty and his daughter. Álex (Mario Casas) considers taking a much safer job despite that it may pay much less to ease the mind of his pregnant wife Jessica and his father Don José. Darío (Juan Pablo Raba) would rather sleep on park benches than accept the charity of his estranged sister María (Juliette Binoche). Yonni (Oscar Nunez) entertains his fellow miners with his romantic escapades, while Edison (Jacob Vargas) dresses and behaves like an Elvis impersonator. José (Marco Trevino) doubles as a pastor for the men when they head below ground; shift foreman Luis (Lou Diamond Phillips) has growing concerns about the safety of the San José mine. Gomex (Gustavo Angarita), the crews oldest member, will retire in two weeks. Then, August 5, 2010. Day 1 - Mario, Álex, Darío, Yonni, Edison, José, Gomex, Luis, and other men board a shuttle bus to the San José mine. While driving through the desert, they pass Carlos (Tenoch Huerta), a Bolivian transplant walking to his first shift at the mine. The bus does not stop to pick him up. Before their shift begins, Luis storms into his boss Castillo's office. While inspecting the stability of the tunnels below ground, he discovered a shard of glass. Luis explains that mirrors were placed between the fissures of the mountain; some of the mirrors have broken, which means the mountain shifted. Luis, concerned about the safety of his men, thinks the mine should be shut down. Castillo disagrees and sends Luis away. Outside, Edison berates Carlos because he comes from Bolivia, where men dig tin but not gold. Everyone climbs aboard a truck, which drives them into the mine through its only entrance and exit: a narrow tunnel. Carlos quickly becomes claustrophobic. Once descended into the mine the mountain collapses and the men are trapped and it is there that the social commentary is stunning.Behind the scenes - or rather above ground - there is much work from the Minister of Mines Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro), the engineer Andre Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne), President Pi?era (Bob Gunton), and the various countries who come to Chile to drill in an attempt to free the 33 trapped men. Some are heroes, others are not. But the celebration of the release of the men on October 13, 2010 is deeply moving.The movie could be edited to shorten the viewing time, but in a way have the movie long mimics the length of time and anxiety and endurance of the 33 me and their above ground families. It works well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miners get trapped underground, drama surrounds rescue attempts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching the film thinking it looked interesting. Nice Chilean scenery, cool story about a group of hard working miners being trapped and rescued. However, from the opening scene on I began to hate it. The film starts off with what looks like a Mexican/American BBQ transported to a Chilean desert. There is an Elvis impressionist, and lots of colorful dancing and laughing. You half expect to see a band of Chollos dancing around a campfire while signing "la cucaracha", shaking their maracas like chiuauas on crack.Next we see a pretty older Hispanic looking woman walking down the street hawking empanadas. Although she is clearly in a south American town, she is yelling in English with an exaggerated Spanish accent. Strange. Later , we see the men transported down into the mine, and as they jump off one of the men socks another in the groin, playfully. What are the writers in middle school? The man who his hit doubles over in pain, and I can assure you adult men do not do this for a laugh.Hollywood writers have been presenting smacking men in the balls as humor for years now, and they should stop. I don't know if the writers are women, neutered men, or misandry loving millennials , but any movie that presents this as humor should be banned. The rest of the movie was a mixture of phony looking scenes, and guys acting like writers who have never been near hard labor would think they might act; , it was a film about "real" men, written by phonies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 33 is a very uplifting film that I really enjoyed and must recommend. This film had great massages and great lines throughout the entirety of the film. There are strong messages about hope, belief and the human spirit.The cooperation of the men stranded in the mines and the heart and struggle really makes this film something. The performances portraying human nature and how the 33 managed to band together and overlook their differences was an amazing story. The story of how when all of these people come together the cumulated power of belief really makes the impossible possible. Turning what seems like a hopeless situation into a story of hope.There are certain religious aspects in this film which are actually very interesting, in terms of how they chose to go by mentally. They didn't leave their fates completely in the hands of god, but instead they chose to believe also in themselves and the power that they also possess in turning the tables. Which is a very good message actually because it really goes to show the faith is a strong force but not one that should be followed blindly, it is when faith in god and one's own powers and strengths both are these two things the strongest. The 33 really sort of gave me hope and is just a brilliant, cinematic film that depicts the human spirit in good light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just 6 years ago, 33 miners trapped 200 stories down in Chile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seems a lot more recent than 2010, almost 6 years ago, when we watched the news almost daily for 2+ months to learn the fate of the 33 miners trapped in a gold mine collapse in the high desert of Chile. This movie is a dramatization, certainly very realistic, of the event and the eventual rescue. We saw it on DVD from our public library.I don't know much about deep mineral mines but what I learned watching this is they had mirrors are certain places and when they would break it was a signal that the rock was shifting. The mining safety engineer pleaded for caution but the manager told him they needed to keep their daily output, maybe even up it.There is an event, falling rocks, one the size of two Empire State Buildings, block off any entry/escape path and the 33 miners are forced into the medium sized safe room. Besides being isolated with no idea if they could ever be rescued the food locker only had very sparse rations, certainly not enough for 33 men for several weeks.Antonio Banderas is good as Mario Sepúlveda, the supervisor who took control and made a plan to ration food to prolong their survival. Juliette Binoche is good as María Segovia, with a brother among the trapped miners. She was vocal and persistent to get the attention of the proper Chilean authorities to get prompt action on attempting an extraction.Lou Diamond Phillips is good as the mine safety engineer Don Lucho.As we know from prior news reports they finally were able to reach the miners, first with a 4-inch hole to get them supplies and even video communications. With more effort they were able to drill a hole large enough for an extraction capsule, one man at a time, until all 33 were rescued.Good movie, shows the power of teamwork, both to stay alive below ground and to fabricate a way to rescue the men. The ending has a shot of the real 33 men in present time, all on a beach, and identifies each one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope for 33</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a spectacular movie considering that it was based on a true story. The miners of Chile had their story told from this movie.It was difficult to watch what the 33 men went through in order to survive being buried over 2,000 feet underneath the Earth's surface. If that is not bad enough, there was a giant rock estimated to be twice the size of the Empire State Building that had caused the collapse, and it was inevitable for it to give in and crush the 33 miners that were trapped beneath it. The miners endured almost 10 weeks of agonizing mental and physical pain.It was quite disappointing that the mining company had wanted to give up hope for rescuing the 33 trapped miners. It was totally uncalled for and unethical considering that the men were still alive and the company knew that.But despite the challenges that were faced to get the 33 trapped miners out, people from all across the world came together in a time in need for the greater good. That is what ultimately made the difference in saving the lives of all 33 miners. It is truly magnificent that there were no fatalities in this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>+10 all thumbs up movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very human Mario Sepúlveda (Antonio Banderas) exemplified an attitude of never lose hope as long as there is one shining lantern in the darkness of the abyss. This sanctity gave rise to a superior quality of real leadership, in safeguarding the mission principle of life. A true down, but not out, groveling in the dirt TKO like comeback, by the humble gathering of useful people, resources, in further concord (the underlying real physical economy), while continually pushing the limits of human endurance and morality. The right stuff?of which Chilean miners and families possessed, with not much else, the former USA once had same? in abundance just over 50 years ago, and willingly gave up on it increasingly. Here today in the US of A we would have, beyond a shadow of a doubt, eaten the Bolivian (tasty, just like chicken)! Antonio Banderas was truly graced in his passionate demonstration of a pure miner and gave it the unsurpassed down of the earth grit, in an unblemished powerful performance. To top that, it comes along with a very special unsoiled cast and crew in solid support. In conclusion, let's also give rise to, as crusty representatives of a further surface grubby humanity, a very long silence in the dark followed by an even longer foot stomping noise applause on behalf of any comparable progress pulled out of humanity, anywhere. Bravo! Special note: see also "The Way Back" (2010), with Ed Harris, for similar portrayal of increasing real human dignity while under stark survival conditions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World Watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chile during the last century was not a happy place with the overthrow of Allende and the dictatorship of Pinochet. The stories didn't make that country have a good world image. But in a strange cosmic sense Chile rehabilitated itself with this story of the rescue of The 33 miners trapped half a mile below the surface.Chile's chief exports to the world are copper and nitrates found in the Atacama desert, one of the most forbidding places on the planet. It is said by geologists that there are some spots that have never seen a drop of rain for hundreds of years. This is where the miners work and where the story takes place.Antonio Banderas usually seen dressed to the nines in film breaks stereotype somewhat as the charismatic leader of the trapped 33 miners. You'd better have charisma if you want to keep 33 men from tearing each other apart for 16 days. The main focus of the film is the interaction of the trapped miners.On the surface Juliet Binoche also through charisma and chutzpah becomes leader of the families. Not a woman to be trifled with or shuffled off as the government and the mine owners learn. Also to be noted is Lou Diamond Phillips as the mine foreman who tries to tell the management what a dangerous place they have to work in.You'll like the rescue scenes as all kinds of methods are tried to reach the men. All in all The 33 is a fine bit of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE 33': Four Stars (Out of Five)Chilean disaster flick (with English spoken dialogue), based on the 2010 Chilean mining accident; in which 33 miners were trapped in a San Jose mine, for over 2 months. The film was directed by Patricia Riggen; and it was written by Mikko Alanne, Criag Borten, Michael Thomas and José Rivera. The script was adapted from the book 'Deep Down Dark', by Hector Tobar (which was based on true events). The movie stars Antonio Banderas, Rodrigo Santoro, Juliette Binoche, Lou Diamond Phillips, Mario Casas, Kate del Castillo, Gabriel Byrne, Bob Gunton, Oscar Nunez and James Brolin. It received mixed reviews from critics, and disappointed at the US Box Office (but it was a huge hit in Chile). I enjoyed it. The film tells the true story of a 2010 Chilean mining disaster, at a San Jose mine, in which 33 miners were trapped for 67 days. The owner ignored multiple severe warnings, of the mine's instability, and it collapsed shortly later. Dozens of hard working citizens, of Copiapo, Chile, worked there. This movie revolves around 33 of them, which were unlucky enough to be working that day (but amazingly survived); and the families that desperately waited for them outside.The film is nicely directed (by an impressive female director), and it's filled with quality performances (especially Banderas in the lead). The story is truly inspiring, and ultimately uplifting. Still the script suffers from routine formulaic writing; filled with systematic clichés. That doesn't mean it's not worth seeing though; it's still entertaining and emotional. I had a good time watching it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/EuKmXpjFt-k</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping biography about the Chilean miners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very gripping biography drama about the 33 Chilean miners that were trapped more then 700 meters underground for months. You can feel and imagine their despair through the entire movie. I thought it was a very powerful movie with good actors. What is the most disgusting about this whole drama is that the survivors didn't get any compensations or that nobody from management got any fault or got on trial. It's just scandalous but then again it doesn't surprise me. Miners are not treated like humans. They risk their lives for a minimum wage, endangering their health on the long term. And that while the company gets rich on behalf of their workers. It's the sick world we live in, it's all about greed and power. Nevertheless, the movie itself is certainly worth a watch. I can only say, total respect for those miners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film today, and thought everyone did a great job. Acting was superb, and the cinematography and direction were excellent. I don't really care much for CGI, so I wont comment on that aspect of the film. The only thing negative I could even possibly say about the movie is that the casting of the actor portraying the President of Chile was questionable at the very least. I truly liked the film a lot though, and I'm especially fond of true-life dramas anyway. It was interesting to get a sense of what actually happened during the 2 months in which the miners were trapped, because there was minimal press in the U.S. at the time the events took place. Its a great movie, and everyone did a great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great (based on true events) movie, that doesn't take too many liberties.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if there can be spoilers for a movie that is based on true events, but I'll steer clear of giving too much info, just to be safe.The 33 is based on the 2010 Copiapó mine incident. The mine is 100 years in the making, and more than 2,300 feet deep. When a boulder twice the mass of the Empire States Building shifts, the mine collapses, trapping 33 men half a mile underground the ground. They only have 3 days worth of food and water.The mine is owned by a private company, and they don't begin to have the resources to dig the men out. When the Chilean government gets word of the incident, they try to come to the rescue. They quickly find that there is a reason it's taken 100 years for the miners to dig as deep they had.When they drill a small hole to the stranded miners, and find that the 33 men are still alive, the world takes interest in their plight, and several countries rush to rescue the stranded men.I loved this movie because most "based on true events" movies take too many liberties with the story in and attempt to thrill the audience, deviating so for from the truth that the whole movie might as well have been fake. Patricia Reggin handles this very well by focusing, instead, on the human aspect of the crises. There are a few 'edge of your seat' moments, but the true genius behind the film is the focus on very real problem of having 33 men trapped in a confined space when tempers are resting on a knife's edge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story. "God Was With Us"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well done movie that basically delivered on my expectations. I would have liked to have seen more of the faith based aspect of this film, however. Faith carried them through this ordeal and that aspect was seen in glimpses but not shown in any great depth or relevance. It was certainly touched upon but it's almost as if the makers of the movie were afraid to go too far in that direction. Being caught in the middle and playing it too safe rarely results in exceptionalism. "God was with us" was scrolled on the wall by them as they left. It would have been great to see more of why they thought that. We saw them praying and their families doing likewise but by choosing to keep that private and internalized within the characters the director missed a huge opportunity to flesh them out more. Everything seemed rather average and serviceable until the actual contact that was made with the miners. That's when the movie jumped in to a higher gear and became much more enjoyable. There was very little character depth until the third act but how they closed the story really elevated this effort. Also, the performances were amazing. Antonio Banderas proves he still has the chops and the entire supporting cast was brilliant.</fullReview>

I'm a fan of Antonio Banderas and I think Juliette Binoche is one of today's best actresses. When it comes to films about events outside the USA, the actors are put to the test, because in general, the speech is in English. The accent and expression are complicated for the English language. The movie shows the reality of an enterprise and of every person involved in solving problems in a very precise way. I hope to see a film about the tragedy of Mariana - MG - Brazil, which took place in November-5-2015. Perhaps worse than the gold and copper mine collapses of Chile. Probably more than 8 dead and 11 missing people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Patricia Riggers and Director of Photography/husband Checco Varese come together to tell the 2010 collapse of the Chilean Mine that trapped 33 coal and cooper miners for 69 days, as the world watched and anticipated their rescue. Based on the book by Hector Tobar ("Deep Down Dark"), the audience venture down into the mine to relive the moments before, during and after the collapse, the bonding and turmoil of the trapped men, and the fight above ground to keep hope alive. Caress's photography is played a lot in the dark, with unsteady camera, making the film at times hard to enjoy. Dialogue (Screenplay) by Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten, Michael Thomas is all intense, providing little time to get to truly get to know the characters. Antonio Bandares (Mario Sepúlveda), Lou Diamond Phillips (foreman - Don Lucho), Oscar Nunez ("The Office") and the slue of other miners do nice jobs as trapped miners, although the entire film feels a bit forced and rushed. Above ground, one of Brazil's most popular actors (and quite the looker) Rodrigo Santoro is the government worker, along with rigger James Brolin ("Life in Pieces" - TV) and sister to one of the miners Juliette Binoche ("The English Patient" - 1996) who fight among and with each other for the men's survival. Binoche unfortunately, is a bit out of place with her Chilian accent. While it's hard to pull-off a movie where the viewer knows the outcome, once the rescue gets underway (the collapse isn't really all that traumatic here), one can't help but get caught up in the anticipation. Make sure to stay for the credits, for a shot of realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FLASH: Hollywood Invades Chile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given a full-on H'Wood treatment, the compelling story of "The 33" trapped miners becomes tasteless fodder for international audiences.The Chilean government and mining corporation accepted the deaths of these miners even as they still lived and breathed. The filmmakers also treat this story with a carelessness further burying these brave men. There's a roster of stars wringing hands and fretting in an embarrassing and juvenile dramatic fashion. The only fireworks from scrappy Juliette Binoche who drives the continued efforts to save these men. The rest of the cast simply deliver predictable lines in a contrived, static plot based on a novel by one of the survivors. Was it really that calm and boring among these men?The setup is too short to provide empathy. That may be a function of the sheer number of men. However, it leads to a lack of emotional investment in them. Portraying caring relatives above does not pay off the investiture in those below. Even two-way video messaging between trapped and relatives is flat and dull. Their release from the grip of the mine is therefore anti-climatic and borders on "so what."Having never been in a mine, nor being an engineer, when the initial pilot hole misses by thirty feet due to rock dynamics a question arose, "why not drill for the variance." It took the cinematic engineering geniuses another hour of screen time to figure this out. That and the 'Mericans save the day through perseverance after other drills quieted. What would Chile do without the good ol' US of A (a question those who suffered torture and death at the hands of CIA-backed puppet Pinochet in 1973 might best answer).That the dialogue is English with a few non-subtitled Spanish passages is a condescending pat on the head to the countrymen whose language was not used. It takes firm resolve to take a highly dramatic story and churn it into baby food, and the filmmakers succeeded. Give this film a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The 33' is beyond rescue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In August 2010, a story from Chile captured the imagination of the world. Thirty three miners were trapped inside a century-old gold and copper mine deep below the Atacama Desert. They survived in these claustrophobic and life-threatening conditions for over two months. More than two months after being buried 200 stories below ground, they were rescued and reunited with their families. The 33 was filmed on location in the Atacama Desert and within two real Colombian mines. This is a compelling story of triumph of the will, resilience, teamwork, and the psychological effects of being stuck underground without food or the assurance of making it out alive.This is as much a story about survival and hanging on to a fine thread of hope as it is about the families above the ground, who never give up and relentlessly pressurize the government. Then there are the teams of engineers and rescuers working day and night to bore down the height of two Empire State buildings without any idea if anyone is still alive. The mission is championed by Minister of Mines. The performances are uneven, while some actors are simply miscast. Though the lighting, camera-work and music are noteworthy, you hardly feel the stifling hopelessness that is bound to have affected the mental state of at least a few of the men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 33- lacked a strong protagonist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always hit and miss with biographical films. however some of the best films I have ever seen have been based on true events. The Wolf of Wall Street, The Social Network, Titanic, 8 Mile, Coach Carter and Notorious (2009) to name a few of my favourite biographical films.I've been waiting for this particular film for a few years though, I heard soon after the events of 2010 that a film would be made to depict the events in Chile.5 years later and the wait was over.... and all round i'd say it was worth the wait. Although the film is far from spectacular, I feel director Patricia Riggen did the story justice.If anything could have been improved upon for me, it was that I didn't feel any real connection with the protagonist or any of the other characters for that matter... perhaps the attention was spread out among the 33 title characters. But I would have liked to have seen one particular characters journey reflect upon the films audience. the film made me sympathise, but not empathise. The audience could never feel empathy for what they were going through directly, but we all know what it's like to go a little crazy.. feel a little trapped or over crowded. On the plus side I feel Antonio Banderas' performance was note worthy, not award winning in my opinion, but note worthy. He was the closest the film gave us to a protagonist. Unfortunately the struggle between feeding the audience a main character and giving as many of the 33 Miners some back story had an effect on the quality of the film. In my opinion the film could have done with being half an hour to an hour longer in order to build up the back story's of some of the main charactersBut to sum up my opinion of the film all I can say is.. I would recommend it to anyone who was interested in the story like I was back in 2010. I'll give the film a 7/10 for good story telling. it may well have been an 8 if there was a stronger protagonist and a deeper connection between the audience and the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Tragedy Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true event in 2010, this claustrophobic film about miners who are trapped underground surprisingly starts off straight to the disastrous incident but buried by its own formulaic plot. It offers the same horrific experience just like in "127 hours"; the underpaying jobs and risks faced by the miners, the setting and cultures in Chile, the fear and trapped in the mines, the rally, political plays, media propaganda and the rescue attempts are all included well throughout the story. However, screenwriters squeeze too much in the film, the background and life events of each characters seems to lose engagement, causing imperfect character developments and less inspiring. Scores from James Horner are trying to remain the tone of the film but it starts to deviate into lighthearted due to unnecessary scenes, making audiences wonder the existence of real tragedy. However, the film still offers a thrilling climax and satisfyingly ends in a beautiful note even though it should have just focused on the disaster, survival skills and rescue operations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the mountain swallowed the 33 men alive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movie of 2015, not because of twists and turns, but pleasingly illustrating a true disastrous event. So don't listen to the negative remarks about it, ignore the low scores and just see it already. Like any flick, it definitely had a few flaws, if you focus it properly, you won't be distracted for those faults in the movie. All the above, bringing that 2010's unfortunate mining tragedy on screen was a success, that's the very important.It was not a Marvel's superhero movie or a Disney-Pixar's cute animation that has its own large fan base to support. It is not even a Hollywood, but English language movie from Chile. So that's where the critics steered common people in a wrong direction. But as I'm a movie fanatic, I totally recommend it for all. This was not a simple disaster drama, but had a good amount of emotions, suspense, nationalism, light laughs, brotherhood and ultimately a good entertainment.It is no ones biopic as it was categorised. It is a single real incident based movie, especially the book 'Deep Down Dark'. All the characters had a fair scope and portrayed according to story growth. But it opened by introducing only a few main characters and other supporting ones out of 33 whose story this was based on.On an ordinary day, those miners started their day as usual. For some, it was their first day and for others it was the final days of their job, but everyone had their own reasons to go into the mountain's deep down. But what they did not know was the mountain was tired of being opened its mouth for the centuries. Finally, she decided to close the mouth by swallowing the 33. But those men stood against the chances they had and fought for their survival, which was finely told in this movie. What happened to them, how it concludes was narrated still the last minute with suspense."That's not a rock, that's the heart of the mountain. She finally broke."To me there was no mystery left in the main theme, because when this thing happened 5 years ago, I closely followed the event. So I know how it ended and I knew how the movie would end, but surprising parts were the families, media, politics and all the other surrounding events composed together which was a quite fresh perspective that helped the movie to help shape well. So I am telling you, if you think you know this story, you probably wrong on that assumption.If I want to discuss about negative, that would the language of the movie. I am very-very disappointed with that choice, it must have been in the Spanish. Those Chilean characters speaking English was kind of jokes with their funny accent. It did not work for me, because Chile never was a commonwealth member. If Indian, Malaysian or Sri Lankan character speaks English would make sense. I know they wanted it to be an International product, so did they chose Internationally recognisable actors like Antonio Banderas and Julliette Binoche. Yes, on that aspect it paid off well.The movie almost got me on its emotional side, I did not show it physically, but surely I felt deep inside me. It also triumphs to tell how important the families are. They are the first ones to react if you are in a real danger to rescue, to shed tears, to standby on the scene looking for your return and to hug tightly. The movie might be categorised in a couple of genres, but it had other mixed ingredients as well. For example, the scenes called the last supper and the circus outside the rescue site. Movies are not all about perfection, sometimes demonstrating its purpose decently would do good enough. So on that facet I got no point to say to skip it.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tale of the 33 trapped Chilean miners was almost played in real time as it attracted worldwide media attention. It was probably because of this media scrutiny that the Chilean government stepped up the rescue efforts with the aid of international cooperation.The 33 has a varied cast. Irish Gabriel Byrne, French Juliette Binoche and American Bob Gunton all have a crack at doing some kind of Latino accent. Byrne's character must have spent time in Dublin in the past.We see the 33 miners as people as they enjoy the barbecue with some Elvis being sung. However when the fateful day arrives, the mine collapses and the miners are trapped we see that their fate hangs in the balance as it is a question whether a rescue team could ever reach them.Here the story is divided between the trapped miners, the families of the miners making sure that help arrives and cajoling the media in this and the government at first reluctant to get involved in a costly exercise to save 33 men.Antonio Banderas is Super Mario Sepúlvedaand who tries to keep the trapped men going by rationing food and stopping them from fighting each other. Lou Diamond Phillips is Don Lucho who also tries to keep the men together but feeling guilty for not doing enough about safety concerns.The film though does come across more as a glorified television film. I just felt that the characters lacked depth, very stereotypical. Binoche the epitome of the angry Latino activist who takes no crap and happily will punch a government minister.The hallucination scene where the miners eat a gourmet meal just came across as silly and the film just felt pedestrian. Obviously it was going to be difficult to give 33 working class miners sparkling personalities but the film lacks drama whereas the real time news footage of the incident gave it an urgency and a human interest focus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chilean Atacama desert San Jose company miners have a party at Mario's place, and an outcast Dario sleeps homeless on the street. The next day, Auguts 5, 210, they enter the mine to work, despite Luis' objection to the manager that the mine grows unstable. After an hour driving down they reach the quarry and start working. Luis finds a mawing gap of shifting rocks in the mountain. Mario teaches the new Bolivian about the mine. Parts of the mine start collapsing so the miners flee to the car. They head up but Luis knows they won't make it in time and instead tells them to head down to the refuge. They find the road out cave in as they go down. At the refuge they find all 33 men inside at that time are accounted for. They find a very big rock blocks their way up. Mario insists to Luis in finding a way out via the chimney. Meanwhile up stairs the news break out to the miners' families and they start coming to the mine site. Guards threaten them to go home but Dario's sister Maria lifts their spirit to stay. The Chilean mining minister Laurence Colborne gets the president's approval to go to the mine. Mario and Alex finds the chimney offers no way out. He reaches the site and angry families demand answers from him. In the mine Dario fights Yonni to get food. Mario breaks the fight, locking the food chest to ration it daily. The president sends engineer Andre Sougarret to help Laurence. Mario rations food very sparsely, and with Alex revive the lights. Laurence build facilities for the families at the mine site. Alex manages to craft a simple water filtration, ensuring the men some drinking water supply. Sougarret's drill reaches the refuge's depth but it deviates and misses the location. Alex gets frustrated by this and goes to the abyss edge. Mario follows him and talks him out of suicidal thoughts. The miners soon share their last meal and each have fantasies of having a feast with their loved ones. Sougarret calls the drill off due to finding no result. But before he leaves Laurence gives him a solution to the drill's deviation. On day 18 the drill punches a hole to the refuge and the miners gives signs of life, to the relieve of the rescuers. Soon the rescuers communicate with the miners and the news go all over the world. Three bigger drills are used to reach the miners with the original smaller hole used to transport supplies to the miners including video conference equipment. Mario's wife tells him that he got offered a book deal but he tells her to keep it secret. On day 50 the Plan A drill breaks due to hitting steel. Word of the book deal reach the other miners, making them exile Mario. Dario comes to Mario for advice about his relationship with Maria. The Bolivian and another miner fight over an Ipod. Mario breaks the fight and explains that he rejected the book deal. The broken drill bit is retrieved and the drilling restarts. But soon Luis finds that the drill nears the iron support beams. The miners propose a controlled explosion to make way. Laurence and Sougarret finds time is of the essence due to the explosion has shifted the big rock. The rescuers send a capsule to retrieve the miners one by one. Alex goes first and Mario follows after. The rescue goes smoothly and Luis is the last out.Based on a true story, this movie makes for a complete year for disaster movies. We got action packed fictional San Andreas, and then the based on true story Everest and then now The 33. This movie particularly gives the nice relieving contrast to Everest. Everest pits humans with nature high above normal breathing altitude, The 33 pits humans with nature deep down underground. Further to the contrast is that while in Everest the main characters die dramatically but in The 33 it ends with all of the trapped men rescued.The dramatization thus gets less room with the actual ordeal underground. But the movie nicely compensates this with the balancing exposures of the families above ground who are anxious in waiting their 33 loved ones. The depicted additional pressures by the president and how the incident grabs the world's attention add nicely to the movie as a whole, justifying its two hour duration.The movie's production designer did a great job in getting the appropriate looking locations for both the underground mine and the surface level camp. Those sites look real and representative enough to depict the mines both interior and exterior. The props used in this movie is also convincing enough, although still I should say that the movie lacks a little bit since it doesn't feature any above standard work in cinematography.The acting work in overall feels decently good. Antonio Banderas nicely used the same level of energy in his character here as he did on his Zorro roles. Lou Diamond Phillips did just enough to give his character life, particularly in portraying Luis' guilt over the mine's inadequacies. On the surface level Rodrigo Santoro did also well to keep the emotional side of the movie going, balancing the miners' underground scenes. Juliette Binoche almost always succeeds in grabbing attention and giving life to her role and its story plot. I think she really made maria a unique character considering the character's struggles and her relationship with Dario.7 out of 10 score is my view that The 33 (2015) deserves. A recommendation is a yes from me for you to see it in the cinemas. It nicely meets the standards of dramatic disaster movies. But it goes even more as it can be contrasted very well with the earlier movie Everest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The 33", starring Antonio Banderas-The Expendables 3, Haywire; Lou Diamond Phillips-Longmire_tv, Young Guns; Cote de Pablo-NCIS_tv, The Jury_TV; Juliette Binoche-Godzilla_2014, The English Patient and James Brolin-The Goods:Live Hard, Sell Hard, Catch Me If You Can.This is based on a true incident that happened in Chili in 2010 where 33 miners were trapped underground for 69 days. Antonio and Lou play a couple of the miners who have to try to survive on about 3 days of food and water until they can be rescued. Cote plays the wife of one of the miners-she also gets to show off her singing skills-and Juliette plays the sister of another miner, both, along with many others, being concerned about the safety of their loved ones. James plays a Texas drilling expert that is called in to help assist in the rescue. The story is good in conveying the desperation in the miners as they run out of food and any hope of rescue. It is a real miracle that they could survive so long and at the end of the movie, you find out that the real miners were not even compensated by their jobs or the Chilean government. The actual miners are also shown at the end. FYI: The music is by James Horner, who died June 22, 2015 in a plane crash. If you don't recognize his name, you probably would know his work. He was involved in the music of Apollo 13, Braveheart, Titanic, Avatar and The Amazing Spider-Man, just to name a few. It's rated "PG-13" for disaster sequence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 7 minutes. It is an interesting story but not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough. It would be a good rental though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A miner winner of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The 33" is a more satisfying film than I was initially expecting, largely because, especially in the wake of this tragic weekend that saw chaos in multiple different countries and countless causalities and injuries all over the world, it's a film that really emphasizes some element of human bonding in the wake of a tragedy. Granted, the characters in this film are pretty thin and bound together only by seriously unfortunate circumstances, but that doesn't entirely matter. The film focuses on their bonding and their acts of cooperation in a time when survival seems astronomically unlikely."The 33" looks at a variety of angles revolving around the collapse of a mine in Chile in 2010, which left thirty-three miners trapped until complex drilling equipment could be acquired in order to determine if they were even still alive. Most presumed the miners would've been killed when the heart of the mountain collapsed or would starve to death before help even began to reach them. When the drilling commenced, and discovered that all the men in the mining crew were alive and surviving off of the mine's limited supply of food and water in the refuge, trying to build a system that could extract the miners was going to take more time and effort on part of the Chilean government. The miners were trapped for sixty-nine days before being rescued.Patricia Riggen's film attempts to focus on the miners trapped underneath hundreds of tons of rubble, more than 2,000 feet underground, and the families above ground, gathering around the gates of the mine. The families are immediately disgusted with the government's lackadaisical and stunted response for rescue efforts, with government officials doing what they do best - claiming they care and are doing everything in their power to remedy a situation when they are doing nothing of any significance and making no attempt to reassure or comfort the families of the affected.To get the problems of "The 33" out of the way, to begin with, the film still continues the trend of capturing much of its events in montage, the same trend we've seen assist films like "The Martian" and "Pawn Sacrifice" this year with telling their large stories in a truncated manner. This film doesn't encapsulate as much of its events in montage as those films, but it still does enough fast-forwarding to the point where we don't really get to know the titular thirty-three outside of buzzwords and blanket traits, like the leader is nicknamed "Super Mario" (Antonio Banderas) and there is one miner who is Bolivian that nobody seems to care for. With that, the montage effect is something that is used in films for an understandable reason, but overusing it results in a film that is made up of moments of greatness rather than a big-picture sense of greatness.Probably the most glaring concern with "The 33" is the choice to make the thirty-three Chilean miners English-speakers, undoubtedly a move by touchy studio executives who feared American audiences wouldn't want to sit through a two hour film and read subtitles (unfortunately, in many cases, they're probably correct). While it's not a glaring issue, it's a bit strange to see the family members, all of whom minor characters in the film, speak equal amounts of Spanish and English when their husbands, brothers, and boyfriends are largely English-speakers in a country where Spanish is the dominant language.But what "The 33" manages to get right is its human focus - a focus placed on acts of survival and cooperation, even when the miners become overnight celebrities. One particularly interesting angle is when the film's screenwriters - Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten, and Michael Thomas - show Mario's decision to accept a book deal on the incident for a large sum of money whilst still trapped in the mine. In addition, we see coffee mugs, t-shirts, and posters being sold that advertise the thirty-three survivors outside of the mine itself. These are the fine details that make "The 33," a film that despite its miraculous true story sometimes feels like a cliché Hollywood parable on courage and keeping faith, a miner winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid entry of cinematic biography from ordinary men, much more accessible than, yet equally grounded in reality as the collapsed mine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking a true story event as theme of a movie can be challenging, audience who followed the actual incident might already know the story. However, The 33 delivers a sincere and detailed account without being too overbearing. On contradictory, it has a fairly lighthearted tone to the whole affair as to present it with poise and optimism instead of melancholy.Some might already know the tale of miners trapped in Chile mine five years ago. The situation spanned for about two months as the rescuers tried to dig their way through the collapsed mine, while the world interacted with the miners via most unusual webcam chat. The movie captures the spirit of the event, both its tragic moments and surprisingly serendipitous festive atmosphere.The visual is pretty nice, not many viewers realize in what space the miners were trapped. The film makes a fairly meticulous depiction, not just a simple pit hole, but more of a subterranean barrack. View of the underground settlement and outside desert are presented with fine cinematography. It's a refined look although still identifiable without being too glossy.This is a character driven story, which gives ample opportunity for the actors to shine. Antonio Banderas as Mario is a convincing leader role. He's a veteran actor who knows how to deliver reaction in a realistically rugged manner and makes it presentable for viewer. Lou Diamond Phillips, James Brolin and many other round up the crew of the miners while Rodrigo Santoro plays as the Laurence, the representative of government who is more optimistic and considerate than when he donned Xerxes' role.These miners are rough men, working in extreme condition, but the most drama comes from when they must face with the anguish and desperation as they realize they might face their own demises. It humanizes them more than the blue collar label ever does. While it may have several dramatic moments, the movie keeps an overall positive tone, evidently shown with a rather merry soundtrack.The 33 is a compelling story of ordinary men in extreme situation, it is above all a tale of hope, much more accessible than, yet equally grounded in reality as the collapsed mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . in today's corporate Charnel Pit, Warner Bros. documents in THE 33. Warner fills THE 33 with actors recognizable to Americans, along with Yankee product placement (what trapped miner WOULDN'T wish to jog around partially collapsed tunnels in spanking new Nikes?), to clue viewers into the fact that this story is intended to encompass a bigger picture than merely the fate of three dozen exploited Chilean miners. Warner is showing us that We the Workers of the World are totally expendable to the Fat Cat One Per Centers (represented by the callous mine managers depicted in THE 33). Just this week the USA's national newspaper was filled with hateful messages of outrage submitted by MBA types over the need for fast food grill and counter people to earn a measly $15 hourly. "Get a $200,000 'education' like us, dream up your own derivatives scheme, and steal a trillion from the 99% like we did," is what all these Nasty-Grams boil down to. When Corporate Thieves feel that they have a Divine Right to Live Large lording it over everyone else while barely lifting a finger themselves, mountains may surely fall upon them, THE 33 cautions. Fate will save the Righteous, such as THE 33, when Judgment Day comes. But Warner is warning the Fat Cats to change their ways, in the few moments they might have left to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 33 (2015) in short is a film that had some good potential with an interesting story though here is where things went completely the opposite direction. The script to begin with was more a dry, quick, and very rushed short cut of a story based on what the story was about. It's as if they didn't quite have the funding to properly put this movie together. The next issue of this film which made us almost say no right off the bat to watching it was to see Antonio Banderas and at that point you know the movie has flopped. Antonio Banderas hasn't been in a good film in a very long time, and honestly I've never saw his acting a good enough to be in movies, maybe TV would be best. I must say that in this film he did probably one of his best performances since Interview with a Vampire so Kudo's to him on that.The 33 could've been a great film being the realistic happenings in which is was made on, though seeing how those involved in the real story were done in the end, ya might as well say this film done the same thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth 66. &#x2666; Grade C+</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not 99, the film is worth at least 66 for the great efforts that have been evidently taken by the cast and crew to re-enact the horrifying real-life incident.Much has been told and covered about the 2010 Chilean accident, and the film strictly follows the events using the good old formula popular among documentarians. Although the film partly feels like a documentary, emotions did take charge of me in the first and the third acts. The cast do a fine job, but I thought Banderas was a bit over the top.Nevertheless, the narration has one too many flaws, mainly about how the miners' situation was written. The survival factor was only brushed upon, and the miners mainly indulged in dialoguery, for lack of a better word. Choice of music, and camera work both are below average.BOTTOM LINE: All said and done, The 33 is a decent affair, and makes for a good afternoon view if you are interested in dramas about crises and the circus that is mount around it.GRADE: C+Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 33 Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disaster strikes on Aug. 5, 2010, as a copper and gold mine collapses in Chile, trapping 33 men underground. With more than 2,000 feet of rock in their way, members of a rescue team work tirelessly for 69 days to save the seemingly doomed crew. Beneath the rubble, the miners begin an epic quest to survive, contending with suffocating heat and the need for food and water. With family, friends and the rest of the world watching, it becomes a race against time and a true test of the human spirit.So you may or may not be aware of the story of the Chilean miners. I wasn't completely aware so I thought I'd give this film a look. What helped was that it had Antonio Banderas and Lou Diamond Philips in it. Of course they played some of the miners Mario Sepúlveda and Don Lucho respectively. Since the film is called "The 33" and is about 33 miners, there are 33 miners and since it would be hard to focus on all of them, they only focused on a few of them (I don't remember any of the other characters' names because I was focused on Antonio Banderas and Lou Diamond Philips). This was probably for the best as I didn't really care about the other miners' stories. To be fair, these stories include: one about to retire, one who is an Elvis impersonator, one who has a drinking problem, one who is a Bolivian and has a hard time fitting in, one who is having an affair, and one who is having problems with their sister (at least those are the ones I can remember). The film is not just about the people down below, however, as it follows the drama involved in the rescue above and the miners' families patiently (mostly) waiting for their safe return. This contingent consisted mostly of Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro), a government official, and Andre Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne), a mining expert called in to assist with the rescue. I found that the miners' families were not well represented here with the most vocal of them being one of the miners' sister Maria Segovia (Juliette Binoche). I thought Binoche was good here with what little she had. I found that pretty much everyone we got to see up above was okay in their respective roles despite me not caring as much about the whole government angle which also included Chilean President Pi?era (Bob Gunton). The acting from the miners down below was okay for the most part but I found Banderas' performance to be a little over-the-top. Sure this is supposed to be an inspirational story but I found his cheesy inspirational/motivational lines to be a little off-putting. The special effects involved were well done as the initial cave collapse looked realistic and created the only real emotional moment in a film that is supposed to be an emotional film. The look on the miners' faces when the cave collapsed was real and you could see them feel trapped. This was emotional and I don't think anything else after that was as the film is just a bunch of guys stuck in a cave with nothing to do. I will say that this film does take a little getting used to because the scenes within the cave are very dark and it is sometimes hard to tell the miners apart. Also the story just seemed a little lazy to me as it never really explained how the miners were saved, the story took a few convenient turns, and it used a little too much news footage to explain what was happening. Overall, this is just an average drama with a little emotion and inspiration.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Drama with a Couple of Dramatic Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the real-life event. The disaster began at a mine in Chile's Atacama Desert: Miners working deep inside a mountain, excavating for gold. Suddenly, there was a massive explosion and the passageways of the mine were blocked and it traps 33 miners underground for 69 days. Antonio Banderas as Mario Sepúlveda, showed leadership, Lou Diamond Phillips as the foreman, knows the mine, better than anyone else, Rodrigo Santoro as Laurence Golborne (Government official) were my favorite actors. It was nice seeing James Brolin (Doctor Kiley on Marcus Welby M.D. TV series) as Jeff Hart, he was some kind of drill pro. Bob Gunton (Warden of Shawshank Redemption) as President Pi?era. Filipino migration to Mexico took place in the late 19th and 20th centuries, therefore, Lou Diamond Phillips is (part) Latin and contributed a great performance as Don Lucho. One of my favorite scenes is when the miners were so afraid of dying, one guy, was shouting and kicking, holding back from crying. I thought, don't hold it back, just let it out! Surrounding the miners, were their families, the government involvement for a rescue, and the events that took place in those 69 days. I would highly recommend this movie to the more mature audiences. In Chili, mainly Spanish, they believe in God and praying which I can fully relate to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maturity gets you everywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i first found out about this film, and did some research, i was shocked to find out all 33 miners survived for a couple of reasons. first, the obvious. the conditions were not ideal, the constant falling of the mountain could have any miner at any time. secondly, 69 days in 90 degree conditions can bring on so many illnesses. 3rdly, the mental impact it must have taken on those men. you would have though they would have killed each other down there. that they didn't is a testament to their leader (Banderas) who lead everything in an organized fashion. yes, tensions run high but he was fair and that is why the men are still so close today. really amazing movie about hope. highly recommended. my only beef (hence the 8 stars) is some of the casting. Lou diamond Phillips is Filipino, not Latino and needs to stop being cast as such. similarly, Juliette binoche? really? a french actress as a Hispanic. they really missed the ball on that. otherwise, wonderfully emotional film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of promise but lacking delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this film I was immediately intrigued. They made the trailer emotional and powerful and I was very excited to see this. It seemed like an easy hit because it is based on something so recent that all of us can remember. So I suppose it's fair to say that my expectations were very high. Perhaps that is why I was so disappointed in it. It wasn't bad but I really expected to be a sobbing mess over this emotional boiling pot but it felt like it really missed its mark and lacked a lot of the heart I expected from it. There was one strong performance and everyone else was okay at best and I expected an ensemble cast. I didn't dislike the film for any of the reasons other reviewers are trashing it. So many reviewers are complaining the film was in English. Who cares? When I watch a movie like this, I suspend belief and pretend that I am watching the film unfold in its Native language, I can just understand it. The other complaint didn't bother me as much as it did confuse me. The cast is full of well known actors who aren't Latino let alone Chilean. Why on earth did they cast Juliette Binoche as a Chilean Empanada peddler? Bob Gunton as the President of Chili? Was there suddenly a lack of Latino actors? The highlight of the cast is still not that great. Antonio Banderas tries his utmost to make the best out of a sub-par script. He plays larger than life impromptu leader Mario. Banderas certainly brings his trademark energy to the cast and its much needed. Without him, it would have been completely lost. I was sincerely disappointed in the development of the characters played by Lou Diamond Phillips, Rodrigo Santoro, Jacob Vargas, Juan Pablo Raba...essentially the entire supporting cast of the miners. I expected Phillips to be a strong performance and he was barely there it seemed. You have this big ensemble cast and they try to establish sub-story like sibling rivalry, hobbies and personality and family life but it all falls flat. The politicians and workers and emergency personnel are so plentiful and many of them are familiar faces but no one stands out at all because the roles are so small. Casting actors nowhere near the ethnic background of their character makes no sense at all. Juliette Binoche is pointless, Bob Gunton seems ludicrous as the Chilean President and Gabriel Byrne, who I think is great, is completely underused and wasted.I know that they likely very much wanted to do this story justice, and I can't say how they should have done that but I think they may have bit off more than they could chew. I honestly expected a boat load of emotions during this movie and I didn't get any of that. Director Patricia Riggen doesn't have enough experience to handle a heavy concept like this. The film definitely underperformed and it's not hard to see why. Despite a strong trailer, it misses the mark in capturing the movie goers heart the way the actual event did. Even when the miners are rescued, I didn't feel the intensity. Overall, and unfortunately, The 33 is a practical miss. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Constantly developing plot distracts from otherwise elongated conflict.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the plot is simplistic, it rarely lingers despite the mine's seemingly premature collapse just half way through the first act. Thankfully, any fears of elongation were eventually diminished following the cave in ? a cautiously lit sequence, taking the initiative of using the miners' headlamps almost exclusively in terms of lighting. Conflicts such as a detached drill bit or a mutiny amongst the miners are introduced before being solved in a timely fashion. On one hand it could be argued their relatively hasty resolve is a means to stretch the runtime, but these small struggles contribute to a sense of constant development ? even if they lack any gravity to the overall narrative. Furthermore, the film exudes with personality and character; be it Edison Pena (Jacob Vargas), an Elvis impersonator or Yonni Barrios' (Oscar Nunez) mistress or a humorous hallucinogenic last supper?there's a palatable aura of humanity and fellowship amongst the 33.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/11/18/the-33-2015-review-indie-adam/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Story Better Than The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I think the movie is worth watching since it's an amazing story. But the "Hollywood" factor is a little too much "Hollywood". I understand that Antonio Banderas is not ex-president Sebastian Pi?era's biggest fan, as they are publicly from different political sides. And I understand that it's a movie and that Pi?era is just a character, not real-life Pi?era, and that they wanted a cold president, whose biggest concern was the implications that meant for chile's international image if the miners were not rescued. After all, it's Hollywood. But the real story is better. I just wish that they had sticked to it. The whole intelligence that was involved in the rescue of the miners is not really shown in the movie. Throughout the movie, Golborne is portrayed as the big man. He was very important, but in the real story is much more impressive, worth telling and honestly realistic. Pi?era, who is know for being a brilliant man, had a lot more to do with it, he acted fast as asked for help from other countries as soon as he heard the news because he remembered a story of a Russian submarine that had failed under the ocean and the whole crew died because they were not rescued at time. That was all over the news at the time and we all thought he was crazy, not way they could find the miners alive. The engineers and Pi?era were the brains behind the operation, and that story I believe is not that well represented in the movie, and is so interesting. How these people managed to do it, something that was impossible. I'm proud to be Chilean and the quality of the engineers we have here. I mean, we just had a 8.4 earthquake and there was very little damage. The earthquake was intense, so intense, I lived it, but the real reason why little damage happened is because of our engineers, and how they have designed our houses, buildings, urban structure, everything, in order to survive earthquakes. In 2010, during an 8.8 earthquake there were many deaths, but the main reason that happened was because people were not evacuated at time and a huge tsunami took many lives.I might sound like a Pi?era fan- i'm not, I just acknowledge his work. I'm not a political person, but I follow the news in my country. The newspapers that are pro- government, and the other ones too. I'm not really biased. So, another thing that I thing should have been in the movie is how the first lady, Cecilia Morel, acted and what a huge support she was for the families and in the camp. She has always been perceived as the most lovely and caring person, even from people that deeply dislike his husband. She was very important for the families. The day her father died, they found the miners. And minutes before he died, he told Pi?era that the miners were alive and that he should go back to Copiapó and help them. So, he went to Copiapó when his father-in-law died, the day they found the miners. That was impressive and unique, the real story. Pi?era and his wife were at the camp almost the whole time. There is a lot of interesting elements that were left out in the movie. A lot of intelligence and unique things that happened. The story itself is so impressive and unbelievable that they didn't need had to change it. And, as I said before, showing the intelligence and how fast they acted would make the movie more realistic, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chileans speaking English</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those chilean guys speaking English are just too weird. The same will happen with the Crouching Tiger's sequel, which is also spoken in English. I'm just tired of that format. It sounds silly. I understand it's not made for chilean people, and I'm also not chilean. There are awesome series like Narcos where people will speak the character's languages. Americas will speak English, colombians will speak Spanish and so on.. It adds realism to the movie. The rest about the movie is kinda OK but I believe the event itself is far more impressive than the movie can deliver. It's a nice glimpse of what happened there, but it turns a serious historic episode into a childish tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>greed of few</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the last words in the movie:"The San Jose Mining Company was found not guilty of criminal negligence.""The miners were never compensated".I will cite from the comment above: "Mining is a dangerous business. Going deep underground to dig minerals out of the earth means subjecting yourself to extreme heat, back-breaking work and the inhalation of dust that can lead to the pulmonary disease of silicosis. If none of these kill you slowly, the mine itself can kill you quickly and without warning. Miners die from accidents caused by their equipment, gas leaks and explosions and, of course, sudden collapses of the rock surrounding them. All told, this difficult work kills thousands of miners every year (as many as 12,000 by one count). These facts and statistics are brought to life in the true story of the 2010 Chilean copper-gold mine collapse portrayed in the drama "The 33" (PG-13, 2:07)." The greed of few is making millions of people around the world suffering. Human is expendable. Humans became "resources" themselves. Ugly face of capitalism. Corporationism. Plutocracy.</fullReview>
