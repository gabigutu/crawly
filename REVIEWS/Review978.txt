		<shortDescription>One of the finest westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES is a wonderful story about a wounded man, Josey Wales, a Missourian who has lost his home and his family to the Civil War. As the Civil War ends in defeat and despair for the South, Wales alone of his guerrilla unit refuses to surrender. He has nothing left to live for, except to fight, and he cannot give that up.This is a setup that has appeared many times in the movies, as the hero with nothing left to lose is a perfect excuse to show nonstop gunplay. To some extent, this happens in THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES too. It is an action western according to the classic formula, but it is more than that. Josey Wales heals his wounds as the story goes on, and begins to replace the friendship, and then the love, that he has lost. And as he heals, he begins to grow out of violence as a way of life. Many westerns have the theme of the older breed of man who tamed the west by violence being abandoned by his fellows; only this one, so far as I know, has the older breed of man abandon himself, that is to say, change his ways with the changing of the times.Clint Eastwood is a decent actor, not a great one. But at times he has shown the skills of a really first-class director, and given his limitations as an actor it is the more to his credit that he did not hog the stage. He gives plenty of screen time to an excellent supporting cast, of whom the most memorable is Chief Dan George as aged Cherokee warrior Lone Watie, a role he plays with an eerily perfect balance of dignity and humor. Will Sampson makes an unforgettable cameo as Comanche chief Ten Bears, and Paula Trueman is a magnificently feisty Sarah. John Vernon plays Fletcher, the man who betrays Josey Wales early on. I don't understand why Vernon could not find work in quality movies after this (he has appeared in 38 cinema releases since this movie and I challenge you to name any of them). Vernon has one of THE great basso-profundo voices in American cinema; only James Earl Jones could compare to it. If mountains could speak, they would sound like John Vernon. His role is a neat twist on the trope of the 'reluctant hero'; Fletcher is a reluctant villain.The ending of THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES is the most beautiful and poetic of any in western movie history, maybe the most beautiful of any movie ever. According to the rules of the genre, the final confrontation between Wales and Fletcher can have only one outcome; the movie finds another way, because Josey Wales has found another way.Rating: ***? out of ****.Recommendation: Western fans should own this one, but any movie fan should enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, Hate, Revenge, Forgiveness, Sorrow, Life, Death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, sorrow, life, death, emargination, racism, the uselessness of war, betrayal, redemption, solidarity, friendship. Not many films manage to deal competently with even just one of these topics. This masterpiece deals with all. Within the first 4 or 5 minutes (even before the opening credits) one has already been exposed to more force and emotion than most films can pack up in 90 minutes.By the end of the 2 hrs 10 minutes of this film one would have lived through tour-de-force highlighted by memorable climaxes and showdowns featuring some of the most striking dialogue in cinematic history... "dying ain't no way to make a living". Eastwood's character doesn't speak much but utters a handful of memorable lines.The central character played by Eastwood is given fine support by an excellent ensemble cast including Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney and most of all John Vernon. John Vernon plays a character called Fletcher who turns out to be one of the most complex characters I have ever come across. His motivations and true intentions are never quite clear. He comes across as a bit of a Judas figure and yet he still retains his humanity as the script and Eastwood as the director never truly judge Fletcher, leaving the viewer to judge for him or herself. Almost every character is memorable and every performance fits in place.The action is sudden and explosive and not always expected. The film takes many twists and turns, yet every twist is a natural consequence of the situations and characters in the film. Ultimately one is left with a truly rich cinematic experience which should appeal to more than just fans of the Western genre. Its themes of suffering and the consequences of evil acts is still sadly relevant in today's world - a world in which not all wars are won by the good guys and in which the good are sometimes persecuted by those who win these wars.When thinking of the best pre-credit sequences ever forget most others... this should be your best bet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of My Favorite Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has directed, played in or starred in a lot of westerns. We all have our favorites and this my favorite Eastwood western, along with the more set-in-modern-day western, "Bronco Billy." (The latter is really a drama more than a western.)This is simply an extremely entertaining story with two lead characters - played by Eastwood and Chief Dan George - who were fascinating to watch. Also, as in most westerns, I enjoyed the good photography and was surprised, considering the year of release, that the language was pretty tame.George has always been a favorite Native American actor for many people. He gets choice roles playing likable guys, and "Lone Watie" character here is no exception. Eastwood, as " Josey Wales," reverts successfully back to his "Man with no name" persona: you know, the strong silent and somewhat mean type. He's a lot like the characters John Wayne played late in his career. He best portrays this with scenes like the one in which he spits tobacco on his dog!In addition, there are some solid actors in minor roles, people like John Vernon, Sondra Locke and Bill McKinney, Will Sampson, Sheb Wooley and Sam Bottoms, among others. I was surprised Locke, Eastwood's girlfriend or wife at the time, didn't have a bigger role. With her youthful looks and great big eyes, she looked prettier than I've ever seen her, although she never was a glamor girl or got many good parts.At 136 minutes, this is a bit long but it never drags. This is one of the very few movies I ever watched twice within two weeks and enjoyed it immensely both times....and each time since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly Clint Eastwood's best complete movie, the story of a man drawn into hell by the inhumanity of others (specifically, the Redlegs and the Senator), who is redeemed by the humanity of others (the settlers, Lone Wattie and Ten Bears) to recover some semblance of a life after the Civil War. Eastwood's acting is economical (but a far cry from the man-with-no-name character he made famous), and carries the story very well, and his directing style is practically invisible (which is exactly what it should be -- if the director does his job, you should never even notice his contribution). The viewer is entirely caught up in the story of the man. All in all, a brilliant bit of film from Eastwood (who clearly learned everything he could from his own directors, and then combined that knowledge into superb craftsmanship of his own.) It is interesting to contrast the Jose Wales and Billy Munny (from Unforgiven) characters. Wales seeks to regain his humanity through others; Munny - having regained his humanity from being a Wales-like character at the beginning of the movie - descends willingly into a hell of his own choosing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Clints very best!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up with Josie Wales as a household name and being a big fan of westerns, I have to agree with the just about everyones previous comments in describing it as excellent. It represents what a true western is. The story line is captivating and intense. The lead character played by Clint himself could be played by no one else. What some may call "lack of acting" because of lack of dialog only lends itself to the desirability of this film. You find yourself hanging on his next words. Clints one liners are still household expressions nearly thirty years after the movies release. In short this film is one of the best westerns made period. There have been others that Clint has made including the spaghetti westerns and his Oscar winning Unforgiven that add to his credibility as a great actor and film maker. But not many films touch so many levels of emotion. The only letdown to this film is that it had to end and no sequel was followed by Clint. Lastly, it's too bad for the film industry and Eastwood fans like myself that the man has to get old. His take on what entertains an audience is uncompromising. Films like The outlaw Josie Wales and what it represents to the American Culture will be enjoyed for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among The Best Westerns Of The 1970s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even when matched up against his Oscar-winning 1992 film UNFORGIVEN, THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES must rank as being among Clint Eastwood's finest turns both in front of and behind the camera. Having displayed a solid feel for the director's chair with 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME and 1973's HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, Eastwood took the reins on JOSEY WALES when he and the original director Philip Kaufman, who still shared a co-write of the script (and had directed 1972's THE GREAT NORTHFIELD, MINNESOTA RAID), ran into some pretty strong disagreements. The end result was one of the best westerns of the 1970s, in critical, commercial, and artistic terms.Eastwood's character is a farmer living out a quiet life in Missouri near the end of the Civil War who is forced to see his whole family and homestead wiped out by marauding "Redlegs" from Kansas. He joins up with a guerrilla band of Southerners to "set things aright." But when the Union betrays those same guerrillas into surrendering and then promptly slaughters all of them, Eastwood takes violent revenge. He soon finds himself of the run at the reluctant hands of his former commander (John Vernon), and a determined Union man named Terrill (Bill McKinney, who played one of the sadistic mountain men in DELIVERANCE). As he heads towards Texas, he encounters a motley group of outcasts (Chief Dan George; Sondra Locke; Paula Trueman), and becomes less obsessed by violent revenge and more interested in helping, going for his guns only when McKinney's Union troop closes in, and bounty hunters come looking for him.In contrast to the "Man With No Name" persona he codified with Sergio Leone in the 1960s, or the tough cop he personified in DIRTY HARRY, Eastwood's Josey Wales is a man of great courage and sympathy who becomes tired of all the violence he has had to see and to take part in. The vengeance motif is largely played out by the time the film is into its second half, and it only comes back towards the tail end for a brief moment. Those who have tagged Eastwood as a political reactionary, a John Wayne of our time, have certainly misjudged him, as even one viewing of THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES will testify to. He is not interested in being tough for the sake of being tough; he just wants to survive, and he wants those he protects to be able to live in peace. That's why, although the film is unavoidably violent at times, it has a considerable humanity too, and why it remains one of Eastwood's finest films even to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Are You Gonna Pull Those Pistols or Whistle Dixie?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Outlaw Josie Wales" was made by Clint Eastwood at a time when westerns were out of favor and the public wanted more of Clint as Dirty Harry. This film as it turned out, was one of Clint's best and certainly ranks up there with the more popular "Unforgiven" (1992).Josie Wales (Eastwood) is a dirt farmer in Missouri during the American Civil War. One day a group of yankee raiders led by Captain "Red Legs" Terrill (Bill McKinny) attacks and burns his farm and murders his wife and young son while leaving Josie for dead. As Josie ponders what to do next a group of southern raiders led by "Bloody Bill" Anderson (John Russell) takes him into his gang to seek his revenge.After the South surrenders, a fellow southerner, Fletcher (John Vernon) offers the remaining members of Anderson's gang amnesty if they will swear allegiance to the North. All but Wales agree. Unbeknownst to Fletcher, the men are suddenly murdered by the Union soldiers led by Terrill and in spite of Josie's efforts, only he and a young soldier names Jamie (Sam Bottoms) escape. Terrill and Fletcher are sent to hunt down the fugitives.Jamie soon dies from his wounds and Josie is left alone. He makes for Mexico but is joined first by Lone Watie (Chief Dan George), then Little Moonlight (Geraldine Kearns) whom Josie rescues from a trading post and finally Laura Lee (Sondra Locke) and Grandma Sarah (Paula Trueman) who he rescues from a gang of Commancheros.The group makes for Texas where Grandma Sarah's son has left her a ranch. All the time Josie is being pursued by Terrill and assorted bounty hunters. Josie dispatches several of them with his brace of Colt 45 horse pistols.Finally at the ranch, the group sets up a home and Josie begins to fall for Laura Lee. Fearing an Indian attack, Josie rides to meet with Chief Ten Bears (Will Sampson) and makes peace with him. But finally Terrill and his group of "Red Legs" tracks Josie down and..........Eastwood who also directed the movie, plays Wales with his usual grim faced persons. He's not afraid to pull his pistols and dispose of anyone who stands in his way. Interestingly enough, Eastwood cast all of the principal Native roles with native actors and treated them as equals and not in the old Hollywood tradition.An excellent western in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Westerns (Short List, Too)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about this film is that it manages to be Epic --truly grand, covering broad territories interior and exterior, a lot of emotional, moral and physical ground-- without posturing or self-conscious bigness. You never get the feeling people are being herded onto a giant mark for a take. --Or that Eastwood the Director is scrambling for filler, biding his time until the timing is right for the next blow-out set piece. In a word, it really has none of the faults even of some of my long-time cherished 'favorite' epics (no names please). It is more focused and more genuinely evocative of mood than Nevada Smith, which its story may faintly call to mind; it seems less overtly "Hollywooden" than that film, too.Westerns that stand in stature alongside Josey Wales: The Searchers, One Eyed Jacks, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Fort Apache, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Beyond that, I draw a blank. The Boetticher and Mann '50s westerns with James Stewart and Randolph Scott are probably the real spiritual predecessors of this film, although, stylistically, Eastwood has clearly studied his Ford and paid close attention to Leone. (Those who've seen Jimmy Stewart break down in tears of moral anguish in one of the aforementioned films-- or watched Randolph Scott use up all his ammo in a standoff on some matter of principal so imperative that he cannot move until the thing plays itself out, however that may be-- know exactly what I mean.)Another thing I like: Whenever you get too comfy within the environment of this film --as you did, say, in the late John Wayne westerns, after he had become such a franchise-- along comes some major shock or disappointment or unbearably poignant bit to remind you that the model of this film is, after all, real life, where these kinds of thing happens all the time.-----------------------May I add a spoiler at this point? I said "A SPOILER??" What happens to Terrill, the chief red leg, at the end of this film is more in line with the fate I envisioned early in the going for Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. It is spectacular, painful to watch and more than a touch grisly. But it is not so overblown and RoboCopesque that you can't imagine such a pivotal moment actually happening that way. The ending of The Outlaw Josey Wales is, in a word, what the ending of Gangs would have been if the focus groups and script doctors and the Great Scorcese had gotten the thing right.Ten stars.See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal tour de force for Eastwood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood's film had all the necessary elements to make a classic... There are in his movie a lot of thoughts about war and the victims of war... The film has the magical combination of historical fact and cowboy fantasy...The fantasy, as ever, is Eastwood... Josey Wales switches from a simple peasant farmer to stone-cold killer... His shooting becomes as precise as his tobacco spitting... Whether he is merely taking a split second to reverse the two guns he is pretending to hand over to some bounty hunters and concede some bullets instead, or whether he is decently shooting countless 'Blue Coats' with a captured machine gun, or appearing out of the sun to terrify a band of Indians into thinking he is an 'army of one,' or pulling the triggers of his empty guns over and over again, he remains superhuman and invincible... It is Eastwood's screen presence as something unique, direct and strong, the essential Eastwood persona that is a powerful attraction to the public and an enigma to the critics... Josey Wales has no desire to become an outlaw... At the beginning of the film he is a peaceable Missouri farmer whose wife and child are murdered by Unionist vigilantes, the 'Kansas Red Legs.' The film opens in 1858 when the semi-discipline of the Civil War has been reduced to the chaos of marauding private armies... Wales joins a bunch of desperate Confederate fighters led by Commander Fletcher (John Vernon), and for the next seven years intensifies a multiple revenge on the Unionists, killing them without political cause or pity...At the end of formal hostilities a price is placed on his head so he makes a picaresque journey into the Indian nation... On the way he picks up different companions: Jamie (Sam Bottoms), a young soldier he saves and who repays the favor only to die from his wounds; Lone Watie (Chief Dan George) who instructs him in the ways and thoughts of the Cherokees; Little Moonlight (Geraldine Keams), the Navajo girl who suffers injustice from the white man's civilization; Grandma Sarah (Paula Trueman), the old woman who knows how to shoot marauders, and Laura Lee (Sondra Locke), whom he rescues from a rape...After surviving the dangers of their journey under the protective wing of Josey, the group settles on a farm formerly owned by Sarah's son who has died in the war... Wales tries to pass his self-sufficient qualities onto them so that they can if necessary survive without him... He shows them how to use guns and protect the farm against invaders, and negotiates a peace with the blue-painted Navajo Chief, Ten Bears (Will Sampson).Eastwood plays a solitary figure who is not simply an avenger, or a fugitive with a gun... He is a man who at the same time defends women and children and the weak... His love affair with Laura is triggered off by such wistful sentiments as 'clouds are dreams floating across the sky of your mind,' but it rings true that a man blinkered by revenge and hardened by the sheer need to survive could be drawn to an innocent girl, able to escape from the terrors of her environment into the poetry of her reveries... This was the first of six films that Eastwood would make with Sondra Locke who has already won an Oscar nomination in her film debut 'The Heat Is a Lonely Hunter.' Chief Dan George, who received an Oscar nomination, for playing Old Lodge Skins in Arthur Penn's 'Little Big Man,' is terrific as the aging Indian warrior Lone Watie... He calls himself a civilized Indian - "We're civilized because white men can sneak up on us.' He struck up a perfect partnership with Eastwood, sensitively timing the soft humor in their relationship... When Josey casually outdraws and kills four men, the Old Indian asks with genuine interest, 'How did you know which one to kill first?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Clint Eastwood in one of his best roles ever. There's great one-liners like "You gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?", "Dyin ain't much of a livin boy", etc. Eastwood meets up with the likes of 10-bears (Indian chief), Yankee soldiers, Rapist Trappers, you name it. At one point Eastwood meets an old Indian "I forgot his name" who tells him that he didn't surrender, but they captured his horse and made him surrender. I haven't seen this movie in over 2 or 3 years and so my memory of it has faded some but it's one of the best Westerns ever. As Eastwood would say "Better 'an you'll ever live to see". Rarely is there a happy ending in Eastwood's work. There's always another trail to ride, a bounty to collect, and blood to be shed. 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' shows how hard it is for that blood to be washed away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strikes all the right notes of humor, adventure, gun fights and most of all, authenticity. Eastwood is impressive in front of and behind the camera. The script stays reasonably close to the book (Gone to Texas).Chief Dan George is truly a treasure and was perfectly cast. The great Will Samson is imposing and utterly believable as Ten Bears. Bill McKinney (from the "Eastwood acting collective") is great as Terrill. Although, Sandra Locke is typically forgettable in an otherwise well cast film.This along with Unforgiven will forever be branded classic "Cowboy" movies in my mind. I still recall Orson Welles on the Tonight Show telling Johnny he had just seen "the greatest Western ever made" after viewing The Outlaw Josey Wales. Brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Outlaw Josey Wales is directed by Clint Eastwood, who also stars as Wales, and is adapted by Sonia Chernus &amp; Phil Kaufman from the novel "The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales" written by Forrest Carter. Joining Eastwood in the cast are Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, John Vernon &amp; Paula Trueman. Music is by Jerry Fielding and Bruce Surtees photographs on location in Utah, Arizona &amp; Wyoming.We are at the very end of the American Civil War and Josey Wales is a contented family man working on his Missouri farm. But his peaceful world is shattered when Union soldiers raid his home and murder his wife and child. Surviving the attack, Josey takes up arms with a group of Confederate guerrilla fighters who take the fight to the Redlegs. However, when the news comes that the war is over and the Confederates are required to surrender, Josey refuses to do so. A wise choice since his group are rounded up and slaughtered in cold blood. So Josey is forced to go on the lam as an outlaw, where hot on his trail are the Redleg group fronted by bloodthirsty Captain Terrill. On his way, as he contemplates survival and what life has in store for he and his aggressors, Josey acquires some interesting companions.Acclaimed by the critics upon its release, The Outlaw Josey Wales is ageing like a fine wine. It's a film Eastwood himself is very proud of, citing it as one of the high points in his career. Yet the film got off to a difficult start. It was originally given to Kaufman to direct with Eastwood's Malpaso company producing, but the star and director fell out over Kaufman's directing style; and that a certain Sondra Locke was turning the heads of both men. As we now know, there was only one winner there.The story is a classic Western tale, hell it's a powerful tale, one with layers that peel off as the film progresses. Josey Wales starts out a peaceful family man but after having that stripped away from him by violence, he too is forced to take up violence in response. So far so formulaic then. But the film is so much more than just a Western revenge yarn; even if that aspect of the story is darn good as Clint gets mean and broody and pulls his pistols. There's a real strong family thread throughout, from losing his own kin in the beginning-to a father son relationship-and on to the way he acquires a new family on his travels, it's very strong and gives the narrative a real emotional kick. As Josey goes on his way, angry, bitter and prepared to face the consequence of his choices, the character is constantly forming. It was only after a number of viewings that I personally realised that Josey Wales the man was being healed by the ragtag assortment of individuals that he collects on route to his character being rebuilt.Eastwood the actor here is on fine form, cool and every inch a man's man . But even Eastwood wouldn't decry the scene stealing excellence of Chief Dan George as Lone Watie. His dry wit puts him in the top tier of Western comedy sidekicks, but the character is more than that. For Watie acts as a sort of spiritual mentor to Wales, and Eastwood reacts positively to George's serene acting to give the film its tight bonded centre. The rest of the cast are a much of a muchness but all serve the story well with solid performances. In fact it's a rare occasion when Locke's vacant method acting actually works well! Eastwood the director is calm, assured and subtle in pacing, with his storytelling boosted considerably by Fielding's popping score and Surtees' gorgeous cinematography. The script is awash with attentive dialogue and punching moments of humour, whilst its noticeable denouncement of violence and intelligent portrayals of the Indians is to be roundly applauded.Iconography unbound and bulging with class in the writing, The Outlaw Josey Wales is not just one of Eastwoods best Westerns. It's one of the best Westerns period. I reckon so. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a contender for the title of Clint Eastwood's best western, possibly even his best film. I'd seen it on television in "pan and scan" format and enjoyed it but it really needs to see watching in wide-screen to fully appreciate the film.Clint Eastwood plays a Missouri farmer, during the American civil war, who joins Confederate fighters after his wife and son are murdered Kansas red-legs who are fighting with the Union. When the war is over his commander says that he is going to surrender to the Union and all the other men join him with the exception of Josey. When they are in the process of surrendering it turns out that it was a trap and the Union troops plan to murder them, as they are being gunned down Josey rides in and rescues Jamie, one of his friends who is badly wounded, and kills many union troops in the process. The leader of the Red-legs and Fletcher, Josey's former commander, are tasked with hunting him down.Josey and Jamie head towards Texas encountering a few problems including a ferryman who will back either side depending who is paying and a couple of hill-billies hoping for the reward. Unfortunately Jamie dies before they enter the Indian Nation. Josey isn't alone for long as he soon joins with a Cherokee who fought with the Confederacy, a young Navajo woman who he rescues from a trader and a mother and daughter from Kansas who he saved from a group of Comancheros. All of them continue to Texas where they head to the ranch that belonged the the elder Kansan woman's son. Here they prepare for conflict with the local Comanches but end up having to fight against the Red-legs who have finally caught up with Josey.The acting throughout the film is very good, especially Clint Eastwood and Chief Dan George who played the Cherokee Lone Watie. As well as top rate acting Clint Eastwood proves himself to be a top rate director. The film is full of quotable dialogue but it never feels as if it has been spoken just to sound cool. I would certainly recommend this to all film lovers, especially fans of Clint or Westerns... although I can't imagine many such people wouldn't have seen this yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An equivocal genre classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixteen years before the unforgettable Unforgiven (1992), Eastwood delivered this genre classic, at a time where New Hollywood had confidently taken over and, outside of Italy's fledgling film industry, Western was no longer on the agenda. America's self-understanding as a conquering nation had been dealt a traumatic blow in Vietnam, and hence, tales of fearless and god-fearing conquistadors seemed at best inappropriate. Well into his transgressive Dirty Harry stints, Eastwood plays one Josey Wales, a farmer who is caught in the horrors of the Civil War and turns against his tormentors with a vengeance. The figure of Wales, which shares essential features with both the earlier Harry Callahan and the later William Munny, is the epitome of an Eastwoodian character, freighted with a moral ambiguity that is still likely to puzzle viewers today. A constituting factor of his lone riders is the outward defiance of authority where it is deficient, providing the moral justification for an individual to take the law into his hands. Josey Wales was unjustly harmed by the Union forces (who represent the State) and will fight them down come what will. Incidentally, Eastwood's positive depiction of Natives throughout his career fits in neatly with this ethical code, the State having stripped them of their rights, calling for individual action outside the boundaries of the law, or self-empowerment, if you will. Both the Natives and Josey Wales are outcasts, and by way of this ostracism, forced to become outlaws. The general feel of this film, like so many others, reflects Eastwood's no-nonsense directing. After all, he boasts a reputation for making swift decisions, doing with few takes, and coming in below budget. The opening credit scenes are a case in point here: instead of lengthy battle scenes, Eastwood has his bunch of guerrilla fighters ride across the landscape and shoot at random, enough to convey the essence of their action. The plot serves this purpose as well: a brief (pre-credits) introduction (Wales's family killed by the Union forces during a raid on his farm) serves as the inciting incident and must suffice to lay down the hero's motives. From here on, we may concentrate on Wales's adventures and, eventually, his inner conversion. It takes an immaculate female to bring this conversion about, a virgin who can be seen as the embodiment of the hippie movement and a Catholic figure of redemption alike ? a perfect incarnation of Eastwood's trademark double entendre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that I love about all of the Westerns that Clint Eastwood directed is their moral complexity. He isn't content to tell a story where the heroes and villains are dressed all-in-black or all-in-white, so to speak. His characters are presented with difficult choices. Should Josey choose the path of justice and revenge, or the path of peace, reintegration, and submission? Within the moral framework of the movie these paths are mutually exclusive, and neither is completely satisfactory. It is painfully clear that from the moment Josey picks up a gun to avenge his slain family, he will never be able to return to a life of peace, although he will want to. But what other choice does he really have? What makes this movie amazing is that the main character is clearly cognizant of this moral struggle. In the briefest flickers of expression on Clint Eastwood's face, and in the well chosen word, we see that although this man is supernaturally good at killing people, he doesn't LIKE it. He would rather have been left alone on his farm with his wife and child, than to have been dragged into "the damn war". He also goes out of his way, at times, to avoid conflict. (i.e. giving the bounty hunter a chance to "walk away," bargaining with Ten Bears rather than making war.) He remembers peace, and he wants it (as symbolized by his attraction to Sandra Locke's character). But it will always be out of his reach.I think that Clint Eastwood is single-handedly responsible for elevating the Western to an art form higher than Greek drama. My argument is that in Greek drama, the characters are, trapped by circumstance, doomed to act in a certain way. Yet it is only at the end of the play that they realize their actions have led to their demise. In this movie, Josey Wales seems painfully aware _at every second_ that his actions will have consequences both for himself and those around him. Yet his actions are dictated by strict rules of circumstance and honor, and in any given situation his choices are pretty limited. And he knows it! How's that for tragedy? Eyes wide-open, he plays his cards the best way he knows how, and _still_ he ends the movie gutshot and estranged from the things he loves.My favorite scene from this movie, by the way, is when he finally tracks down Captain "Redlegs" Terrell, and kills him with his own sword. In the hands of a lesser actor-director, this could have been a neat scene where scores are settled, loose ends are tidied-up, and moral satifaction is achieved. But it isn't. In the seconds after he kills his nemesis, Clint Eastwood's face momentarily conveys a sense of disgust, disappointment, and even horror at what he has just done. Revenge has been exacted, but it brings no satisfaction, and doesn't bring back the dead.I think part of Eastwood's brilliance as a director and actor is how with just a few lines of dialogue and a glimmer of facial expression, he can communicate volumes of moral complexity. It is a minimalism that places an unusual amount of trust in the audience. Not many directors believe that audiences can follow their characters into dark and morally ambiguous places. Eastwood not only believes that they can, but that he can take them there without a lot of sissy hand-holding and unnecessary exposition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western of all time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It simply sickens me that this movie is not considered in the top 250. My innards churn with rage as this cineamatical marvel is reduced to such a pitiful rating. This movie is in my personal top 50 if not higher. Released in 1976, this is a timeless masterpiece that I will watch and enjoy for the remainder of my lifespan. I am not a huge Clint Eastwood fan, but simply love his character in this movie. His roll is equivalent to the Spartan King in "300". This movie has influenced my vocabulary and any fan of this movie will use the term "reckon" in their everyday life. If anyone has not seen this movie I strongly encourage. If anyone dislikes this movie or rates it less than an 8 (suprised every vote is not a 10) they are just silly individuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among Clint's most daring films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: Contains spoilers.This film must be one of my favorite westerns of all time, and I just watched it again on my brand new DVD player.I also find it is one of the most strange westerns ever, something I'm not sure it is deliverate or it comes from the different personalities involved in the project. For starters, the film is based on a novel, and it is also known that Eastwood fired the man who was going to direct it (Philip Kaufman, also the screenwriter) when the project was already in an advanced stage.Clint Eastwood stars as Josie Whales, a pacific farmer who sees his family killed during the American Civil war, and who, not having any good reason to live but to achieve revenge, joins the suddist irregulars. And here the strange things start to ocurr, because after the beginning credits the war is over and Whales is in more or less the same state where we left him. A series of events turn him into a fugitive, with literally every bounty hunter in the territory after him, and his dry, sullen persona starts to evolve as his journey towards Kansas progresses and he joins some of the most peculiar travel partners ever to grace a western: a young kid (Sam Bottons), a disenchanted Indian chief (Chief Dan George), an Indian woman who speaks in an unintelligible tongue, a dog, a puritan woman and her aloof young daughter (played by Sondra Locke, future companion and regular screen partner of Eastwood).It is a wonderful film, really, but as I said it is VERY strange. It starts as your usual Eastwood vehicle, although Eastwood's tone as a director is even more laconic and dryly humorous than usual, but as the journey progresses new characters are introduced and Wales himself starts to change, developing, just like the film itself, and underlying schizophrenia. Wales is teared apart, as the film goes, between his desire for revenge and thus ending with his inner torment, and the newly found desire to reintegrate to society (he's been a loner for years as the film starts), as he founds himself as the leader of some sort of dysfunctional, even interracial, family.This inner conflict is also transferred to the film itself, which seems to eternally debate between historical (and genre) accuracy (this must be the most "historical" of all Eastwood films, as it is based on historical events and several real figures like Quantril are mentioned) and Eastwood's desire to short-circuit it with dry humour and anti-archeotypical character allegiances.This alone should make it a must see for all westerns aficionados, but it should also be noted that this is one of Eastwood's finest directing efforts. Attention to detail is overwhelming (notice for instance the use of period songs), and the cinematography is absolutely riveting, coating the interiors with persistent shadows, and washing out the familiar landscapes with invernal light. Kudos for the supporting cast, specially Chief Dan George, are also obligatory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Leaves dead men wherever he goes"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the 1970s, the classic Western seemed to have come full circle through genre cliché and elegy, and was now going through an era of surrealism and self-reference, from cheeky comedies like Little Big Man to horror-tinged bloodbaths like High Plains Drifter. However, with 1976's The Outlaw Josey Wales, this wave of strange and violent Westerns gains a little perspective on itself.Have no doubt, The Outlaw Josey Wales is an action Western, but it has an overriding theme of making peace and learning to have a life after conflict. It essentially presents the typical tough-jawed Clint Eastwood shooting his way through dozens of hoodlums with barely credible dexterity, but then gradually having his humanity restored by an unlikely family of sorts that he picks up on his way. As such it's ultimately a rather heart-warming affair. And amazingly this humane streak is not at the expense of the necessary business of gunning down men four at a time. There is a little prologue in which we see Eastwood as a meek little farmer witnessing his family get butchered. This version of Eastwood is perhaps a little too ineffectual for us to fully accept his transition to a hard-hearted badass, but enough happens in the meantime to make us forget the prologue, only for to be reminded of it in the picture's final act as some surreal dream of the life that once was, with renewed impact.As an actor, Clint Eastwood was of course born to play the tough-jawed Clint Eastwood type, but he handles the more peaceable aspects of the Josey Wales character with rather mixed success. He looks appropriately awkward towards the end when attempting to dance with Sondra Locke, but his attempt at being the humble little fellow who gets his face slashed in the prologue is a really terrible bit of acting. The highlights of the movie however are really the supporting players. Chief Dan George is wonderfully deadpan, bringing a little hint of irony to even his most serious speeches. Paula Trueman is very good too, playing the feisty old lady stereotype with far more realism than one generally sees.This was Eastwood's second Western as a director. The influence of his mentor Sergio Leone shows through with action scenes preceded by lots of mean-faced close-ups and made up of quick bursts of gunfire. But there's something that Eastwood does with the space that is very unlike the rolling vistas of Leone's work. Eastwood uses tight framing and close backgrounds to enclose each shot, as if fending off the Western landscape and even defying the width of the 'scope aspect ratio. Throughout we are encouraged to see the people, not the place. What landscape we do see is wintry and spiky, a harsh and atypical look.And this is still in many ways a harsh and atypical Western. Although it certainly brings back some sense of hope and humanity to an increasingly brutal genre it is still very much of its time. There is no wistful harking back to the classic oaters of the previous generation. This is High Plains Drifter with a silver lining. And it is perhaps just what the Western needed at that time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among my favorite westerns. Clint Eastwood to me personifies the quintessential western figure - tall, strong, intelligent, rugged, reserved, and a master of the gun. There has not been an actor before or since that can play such an ideal character.Josey Wales exemplifies the folk hero that southerners so admired following the American Civil War. Obviously inspired by Jesse James, Wales' is a fugitive out for revenge against the Union forces who had wronged he and his family. Unlike James, Wales does not explicitly rely upon banditry for his living, although it is sometimes implied.There is a great deal to like about the movie. The characters interactions are great, with much deadpan humor and highly quotable lines. The action is very good, with Josey shooting himself out of a number of sticky situations. Eastwood even manages to squeeze in a moral message or two regarding the Civil War and the Indian Wars.My criticisms are few given the overall appeal here. Most of the villains were very one-dimensional and despicable, with several performing the typically dumb moves to set them up for the protagonist's bullets. And Wales, like most Western heroes,is a dead eye with the gun - not a single shot fired missed its mark.In the end, though, it still tops my list of favorite westerns. Lovers of the genre will be very pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I can't say enough about how much this movie rocks. Being a big fan of westerns, I can say that this is definatly one of the better ones you can see. Eastwood brings his A-game and magnificently engulfs you into this movie within the first few minutes. This movie, being based on a true story, gives a great account of the Civil War's ending and one man's determination to rebel against those who have destroyed his life. This man is none other than one of the greatest outlaws ever known to the wild west, Josey Wales. In my opinion, you don't even have to like westerns in order to fall in love with this movie. The acting is great, the cast is great, the plot is great, and overall this movie is great. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, make no hesitation in seeing this fine western classic.</fullReview>

I have seen thousands of films and, with the possible exception of "Casablanca", I cannot think of one whose entire cast of characters are as vivid and animated as they are in this film. Eastwood's directing is nothing short of amazing considering the size and scope of this production.In fact, I cannot believe why The Academy snubbed Clint and this movie when it was made and yet gave honors years later to "Unforgiven" (a lesser movie in my opinion). The Outlaw Josey Wales has it all...action and adventure woven into a great story with great settings, brilliant acting by a ensemble cast of memorable characters, and is beautifully filmed, costumed, and decorated with an eye for detail and authenticity.Needless to say, I would definitely rate this film a '10' and recommend it to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong but splendid Western well played and directed by Clint Eastwood as a farmer turns outlaw when Union soldiers kill his family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting movie based on a novel by Forrest Carter titled "Gone To Texas" and professionally performed and directed by Clint Eastwood . Exciting film based on historical events set during American Civil War (1861-1865) in which the Bushwhackers use guerrilla warfare to destroy Yankee targets and led by men set on revenge, make raid and surprising attacks . A Missouri peaceful farmer named Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) whose family is killed by ¨Red Legs¨, a bunch of pillaging outlaws who have allied themselves with the Union Army ; he then turns vigilante . After the war , everyone in his troop surrenders to the victorious Unión except Wales . There take place fights between cutthroat Bushwhackers versus Jayhawkers , including historical characters named Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson (John Russell) who carried out an infamous Raid on Lawrence, Kansas . The surrendering detachment are then murdered after being promised amnesty . Then Wales in turn has a price on his head and joins a Confederate guerrilla unit to revenge their deaths and winds up on the run along with a motley group (Sam Bottoms , Chief Dan George , Sondra Locke) from the Union soldiers who murdered his family and undertaking a lethal chase .The picture compellingly describes the atmosphere of violence set in post-Civil War ; in which women have few rights, and took place confrontation among bands and bloody battles . This thrilling as well as violent flick details a bloody vendetta , propelling a cat-and-mouse pursuit odyssey . Although atmospheric , it's also sometimes slow-moving and winds up into a spectacular showdown . Very good production design , including breathtaking attacks and fights ; as the film contains some of the most wild horse scenes ever recorded and kept in a movie . The scenes of the picture were filmed in Lake Powell, Arizona, Wyoming,Glen Canyon, Utah, Kanab, Paria, Utah, Oroville, Utah and Mescal, Arizona . Nice acting by Eastwood in his usual stoic attitude as the outlaw becomes the hunter and the hunted . In fact , Clint Eastwood cites Josey as his personal favorite of all the movies he's made . And this is the first of six movies made by real-life couple Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke. Very good support cast plenty of familiar faces such as Chief Dan George , Bill McKinney . John Vernon , Paula Trueman as Grandma Sarah , Sam Bottoms , Joyce Jameson , John Davis Chandler , Will Sampson , Doug McGrath , John Russell , Charles Tyner , Matt Clark , among others . And uncredited Kyle Eastwood , in film debut , can be glimpsed very briefly in the opening sequence helping his dad, Josey, work the land by their home . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Jerry Fielding , Sam Peckinpah's usual . Colorful and adequate cinematography shot in Panavision by Bruce Surtees , great cameraman Robert Surtees's son.This masterpiece of characterization , adventure and action was efficiently directed by Clint Eastwood ; however , the movie received mixed reviews on its release . Clint took over filmmaking from Philip Kaufman who also co-wrote the script , a rule which has ever since been titled the "Eastwood rule" . It is Clint's one of the best films as both a player and filmmaker and being followed by ¨The return of Josey Wales¨ with no participation by Clint Eastwood . Star, producer , director Eastwood realizes an excellent film and perfectly directed . This classic Western as good as the notorious ¨Pale rider¨ is magnificent in every way . Later on , Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western , the Oscarized ¨Unforgiven(1992)¨ also with some common theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Outlaw Josey Wales is an altogether nice film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Outlaw Josey Wales is arguably Clint Eastwood's finest achievement to date, although it began unhappily when after a week's shooting he took over direction from its highly gifted co-screenwriter Phil Kaufman. The budget-conscious Eastwood thought Kaufman was indecisive. Made three years after the end of the Vietnam War, it was an informal contribution to the 1976 bicentennial celebrations. The film uses the varied landscape (forests, deserts, plains, mountains) and weather (pouring rain, scorching sun) to dramatic effect. In various ways it echoes John Ford's The Searchers (1956), another fable of a healing journey in post-Civil War Texas undertaken by a vengeful veteran whose family has been brutally killed. Following Eastwood's first Western as director, the cynical, Italianate High Plains Drifter (1973), The Outlaw Josey Wales is an altogether more affirmative affair, emphasizing the rewards of community and the consolations of forgiveness. Wales's final line - 'I guess we all died a little in that war' - applies as much to Vietnam as to the Civil War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood Rules!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trail of a notorious Confederate gunslinger through and after the American Civil War as shown in the superb western "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is a dangerous and blood splattered trail to follow. As directed by Clint Eastwood, "Josey Wales" is as much an attack on war and the degrading effects war has on man as it is on the double-dealing politicians and scalawag soldiers who tried to profit by war to achieve their own selfish aims at the expense of innocent men's lives. "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is about revenge and rebirth. When the family of a harmless sod buster, Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood of "Hang'em High"), massacred by Northern raiders, Wales joins a band of Confederates led by Bloody Bill Anderson (John Russell of "Pale Rider") to go North and "set things a-right." In a masterful stroke of directorial genius, Eastwood compresses the Civil War into a tightly constructed title credit sequence which documents the transformation of Wales the poor dirt farmer into Wales the most feared of all guerrilla fighters. At the end of the war, as Josey is about to hang up his six-guns, he witnesses an incredible act of cold-blooded murder. Reluctant to turn himself over the Federal authorities, Josey remains behind and watches as his men surrender to the Yankees who repay them by wiping them out with a Gatling gun after they have been disarmed. "There is no end to doing right," cries the leader of these ruthless Yankees, a Captain Terrill (Bill McKinney of "Deliverance") who was also responsible for killing Josey's wife (director William Wellman's daughter Cissy Wellman of "Redline 7000") as well as son and leaving Josey literally scared for life with than painful memory. Indeed, Terrill slashes our protagonist's face so he wears a scar.Josey tries to escape Terrill and his troops, but everywhere he goes, he is found out and must fight. Finally, in the unlikely company of renegade Indians and the survivors of Comanchero raiders, Josey tries to start a new life. He picks up an Indian friend, Lone Watie (Chief Dan George of "Americathon"), and Watie becomes his sidekick. Before Josey can fully restart his life, however, he must confront the man who destroyed his life.For all its macho, action-paced gunfights, "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is also a film about the growth of America and the Utopia that the West offered in place of the war-torn East. Among the film's assets are Bruce Surtees's outstanding, widescreen color cinematography and a richly comic performance by Chief Dan George. One example of the humor occurs during a ride through the wilderness when Wales observes, "When I get to knowing somebody, they ain't around for long." To which Lone Watie replies, "I noticed when you get to disliking somebody, they ain't around for long." Eastwood shuns a poncho and his wardrobe reflects the time period. He doesn't wear his "Rawhide" gun belt with the low-slung holsters. Instead, he sports black powder pistols in holster that ride high on his hips and he totes multiple firearms. Black powder pistols required a longer time to reload because they didn't accommodate store-bought metallic cartridges. Eastwood doesn't smoke a cigar as he did in his Sergio Leone westerns. Instead, he chews tobacco and gets a lot of mileage out of spitting before he shoots and kills. Lone Watie narrates one of Josey's confrontations from afar and says, "Now, spit." After Josey spits, he blows away the opposition in a hail of gunfire.Wales and Lone Watie befriend an immigrant group and rescue them from the Comancheros and Wales falls for a slender, thread of a woman, Laura Lee (Sondra Locke of "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"), and helps the remnants of this settler family when Terrill and his marauders arrive to wipe him out. At the end, when Wales tries to make peace, he remarks "a little part in each of us died in that damned war." Although the character refers to the American Civil War, there is a strong underlying suggestion that runs throughout "Josey Wales" that director Clint Eastwood and his scenarist Philip Kaufman of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" that they are alluding to the Vietnam war.Some of the more memorable scenes include the Missouri boat ride scene, the shoot-out in the trading post when Josey displays his skill with twirling guns around, and the scene at the end when Josey dry-fires his arsenal of guns before he runs the villain through with a saber.Anybody that loves seminal westerns and Clint Eastwood westerns in particular MUST watch "The Outlaw Josey Wales."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 70's Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest Westerns of the seventies, "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is not only a compelling revenge tale with plenty of typical Eastwood badassery, but is also a superb character study and offers much food for thought regarding wartime morality and even race relations among other topics. It's just a great story that's very well-told.Eastwood's work as director here is excellent, although a couple of the action scenes, particularly the opening one, being pretty shoddy and borderline incoherent, but it's tightly-paced and fairly sophisticated visually, with warm, atmospheric photography by Bruce Surtees. Eastwood's handling of the film's tone is particularly notable, especially with something that is so often humorous yet such an intrinsically dark and serious story. There are many scenes with a wonderfully warm, welcoming air, and others that are just plain gruesome and disturbing, but the film never feels like a clash of tonalities. Eastwood also isn't afraid of variety. He'll go for a kinetic edge and make it work at times, but employs a minimalist approach at others.Of course, outside of the wonderful performances especially from Eastwood and Chief Dan George, the film's main attraction for me is the brilliant screenplay, an all-time great, by the wonderful Philip Kaufman and co-writer Sonia Chernus. It is a remarkably sophisticated treatment of the story's characters, themes, and plot, with a remarkable narrative momentum and some of the best dialogue ever written. Those last lines are so perfect as well. If this were a more popular film surely they would be considered among the iconic last lines in cinema. Hey, at least "are you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?" has made it into the popular lexicon. I have no real criticisms to make. Sondra Locke is okay, not horrible as some say. In every other way the film seems pretty great to me. Nearly forgot to mention Jerry Fielding's score, which is just outstanding. A real triumph on the whole, one of the best Westerns of the seventies and if not Eastwood's best Western as director then almost certainly on par with his best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood's directorial talent has always shone through; his willingness to learn from others, whilst honing his own technique has meant any movie directed by him holds something worthy. In Josie Wales he displays his understanding of the genre, and his ability to frame a long movie without wasting a single shot. He draws outstanding performances from the whole cast, and uses the sparse dialogue to let his actors strut their stuff, whilst framing the beautiful settings, in scene after scene.Yes it is violent and for some that is all Eastwood is about, but even a brief and superficial reflection should allow the viewer to see beyond the obvious.I watched it again recently, and there is a sense of timelessness to it. Maybe the western is moribund, and maybe its just resting, waiting for another director of Eastwood's vision and talent. Let's all hope so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Endeavors To Persevere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:A great pure action western, for those of you looking for philosophical depth, I refer you to Unforgiven. This is a fast moving, well made western. Wales' family is slaughtered by the creep Red Legs of the Union Army. This last group of holdouts, led by Vernon's Fletcher, finally decides, upon a new offer of amnesty, to surrender to the Union Army, bad idea. Wales saves only one, Bottoms, but just for a short time. The movie follows Red Legs and Fletcher chasing after Wales. Wales, not in the best of moods, after seeing his whole group machine gunned after surrendering for a phony amnesty that was but a ruse to lure them into their doom, retains his hatred of the Union Army. He cares for Bottoms but he caught one and is not long for this world. The surprise to Eastwood's direction, is, unlike Unforgiven, how much humor he puts in this to lighten the grim, depressing narrative. My favorite is my header spoken by Chief Dan George who tells Wales how, after the government failed to hold up their side of the Native American's surrender, palliated them with,"You must endeavor to persevere," adding that they made their horses surrender also. There is great comedy throughout this movie, this makes it much less grim than its initial depressing beginning. Wait until you meet the carpetbagger who never should have bragged that his snake oil can 'is good for any purpose.'Along his flight, Wales picks up the Chief and his squaw, two proud Kansas' natives who run into Commancheros, who capture and rape poor Sondra Locke. The grandmother is very funny, for her, anyone not born in Kansas is the garbage of the planet. Yes, detractors, there are lots of Clint moments of hyper-manliness quick draws, but, this is typical of the genre. He gets the better of a couple at a time, not twenty or thirty as we have to endure in Wayne's movies. His hatred may offend some people, after he shoots people, he likes to spit tobacco on their heads, that the ladies in my family found offensive. The lead he has over Fletcher and Red Legs gets smaller and smaller as the movie progresses. Eventually, there is the big showdown. The movie leaves it open, like Shane, whether Wales is dying at the very end. Fletcher lets him go, he sees the blood dripping on his boots. Wales' bravery is well delineated, the way he gets the better of men in quick drawing is not only by speed but by intelligence.Often, the motor mouth morons, reminiscent of Bond villains, keep chattering until he bests them unexpectedly. It will remind you of the Ugly's sound advice in GBU,"If you're going to talk, talk but if you're going to shoot, shoot!!" This is a pure entertainment western like the westerns of old, do not come into it expecting realism. While it does not go into John Wayne's levels of fantasy, with the numbers shot, it still has him taking out three or four at a time. Hey, even the great Leone did this in Once Upon A Time In The West. The humor is throughout the movie after the bleak opening, do not turn it off, it lightens as it proceeds. The ending is left up in the air as to whether Wales is living or dying, as Fletcher walks away,"We all died a little in that damn war." I own this as much for the great comedy that Clint puts here with the chief, the carpetbagger and the snobby grandmother who thinks God should have stopped Creation after Kansas. Locke is stunning as usual, and thankfully, I can report that she doesn't sing in this movie. She always felt it necessary to show us her hot backside; I have no complaints here. Yes, lots of people getting shot, but bloodlessly; Wales shoots them and they fall over; often, he feels compelled to spit on their heads, be forewarned. Like his Fistful Of Dollar movies, this is light, not to be taken seriously entertainment. As an action movie, it moves well, has great villains, with humor that will make you chuckle all through the film. A Good Movie. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Readers,The Outlaw Josey Wales is an impressive piece of work for Clint Eastwood, who at the time was only known for his performance as 'The Man with No Name'. Josey Wales is typical Clint. Kicking butt and taking names and having a heart of gold. His skill with revolvers is incredible and the action sequences are great beyond belief. The rest of the Supporting Cast do well and the villains are relatively cool but are no Gene Hackman. The Action sequences are amazing especially when compared to Unforgiven and Tombstone. They're not exactly graphic but not for everyone. The other scenes of violence are quite brutal, starting with Wales's family being killed, a gatling gun Sequence, and a guy getting shot in the groin, to say nothing of a vicious and graphic rape attempt. Unforgiven is still better than the Josey Wales and Pale Rider, but I highly recommend them all.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen Josie Wales several times and i love it.I recently bought the DVD of "Once Upon A Time In The West" ...a great movie,and i see a lot in Josie Wales that Clint borrowed and used very well.Both movies are terrific.I guess Clint learned a lot from Sergio when he did those spaghetti westerns in the 60's .Of course the stories are completely different ,but musically ,the cinematography,the music and the stretches of little dialog all ring true.Then there is the scenery,Monument Valley in"Once upon A time.." and wherever Josie Wales was filmed,it doesn't look to me like Monument Valley...but i could be wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Eastwood best, and a Western genre best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not at all an Eastwood fan. Of his many films, this one, The Beguiled, and Play Misty For Me are his all-time best. Clint is generally the same in every film whether he be Dirty Harry or the Unknown Cowboy--whatever. It worked for his career and fans, God bless! I like this film because it's actually funny as well as realistic--at least more realistic than the bulk of Westerns which tend to go off into the realm of mythology. There were many historical factors that caused the great migration "into the West" of the U.S.A. One was The Civil War. The true effects of this war have pretty much been neglected in film until relatively recent productions such as The Long Riders, Tombstone, and Dances With Wolves.The humor in the film is because Clint sets out on a vendetta and gets entangled with every kind of person in distress that can possibly get in the way of that goal. And because his character is ultimately "good", he "gets involved" when he doesn't really want to --even with the mongrel that he spits tobacco on. Other funny characters are 'granny', the 'chief', and the old timers at the played out saloon in Mexico.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wales Is A Winner.. as ...Clint Begins To Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A massively under-rated Western made in 1976 when it was un-fashionable to ...even be associated with Westerns. However-even now this piece of cinema is much better than lots of the muck that is churned out to-day. It has humour (Chief Dan George could teach ALL of todays "comedians" how to deliver a line.) It is about history, and it is about a gunfighter who knew how to kill those nasty people....he did not like. Eastwood stars and directs this, and although he won Academy Awards for Unforgiven (Best Picture &amp; Best Director)---this is at least as good. In 1976 Eastwood was still learning the craft of directing. He has since made many excellent films. It is entirely possible that Unforgiven was so highly acclaimed because Westerns like this one...were over-looked. The Academy works like this (there are many examples).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Road Movie On Horseback Or Feet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' is a most unconventional Western 'road movie'. The journey (actually it's more of an escape) here is done on horseback (rather than car) but what's particularly intriguing is that it touches on many themes such as love, loss, hate, revenge, war, racism, life, death, loyalty, betrayal, redemption, friendship, unity among others, and it stays true to them in its depiction.There's enough energy in the film and the characters continue to fascinate you in the quieter sequences. The characters are strong and brilliantly defined (even the minor ones). They don't fall prey to stereotype (as was the case in a majority of Westerns). There are plenty of memorable and funny dialogues, especially the ones delivered by Eastwood and Chief Dan George. The comic timing is excellent.The landscape is stunning. I wonder how Eastwood and his team found such diverse locations. It is captured stupendously by the camera and accompanied by a fine score. The action sequences are delightfully choreographed. The rustic sets and costume look authentic.'The Outlaw Josey Wales' boasts of some great performances. Eastwood succeeds once again in playing the loner 'outlaw' of a few words. His restraint is remarkable. He is terrifically supported by Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, John Vernon, Sam Bottoms, Geraldine Keams and Paula Truman.To say the least, Clint Eastwood has delivered another unique Western gem which is among his best works.</fullReview>

Anderson.He becomes a wanted man when he doesn't surrender with the other members of his group and witnesses a massacre of the men by Captain Terrill's Redlegs, who have now joined the Union army.With him on the run is the wounded young man by the name of Jamie.When he dies Josey befriends with an old Cherokee Indian named Lone Watie.He also rescues from a raping a young Najavo woman, Little Moonlight.The company grows with an elderly woman, Grandma Sarah from Kansas and her granddaughter Laura Lee.He sees this young woman taken from her carriage and thrown on the ground.A group of men start ripping off her clothes, while Laura helplessly tries to stop them.She won't get raped, and she falls in love with Josey Wales.Also some townspeople belong in their group, who settle in a ranch house.The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) is directed by Clint Eastwood.This movie is one of Clint's personal favorites.I can see that.It shows us one pointless war, the American Civil War, which can be seen as the war in Vietnam, that had just ended.There is one great speech about peace between Josey and the Indian, Big Bears.The scenes in town, when he shoots down those four men, is amazing.The last showdown is unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood directed this Phil Kaufman-penned adaptation of a sprawling novel about a Confederate soldier on the run from Union Soldiers long after the Civil War has ended. They kill his family and there will be no peace until they have killed him. He travels from Missouri to Texas in this epic adventure, piecing together a new family (a couple of Indians and several survivors of a besieged wagon train) along the way. The supporting cast is superb, headed by flinty-eyed John Vernon as Eastwood's old commandant and the wonderful Chief Dan George as Eastwood's most loyal friend. Watch for a relatively young Will Sampson in a small role as an Indian chief. Add this to the list of must-see Eastwood Westerns, along with UNFORGIVEN, JOE KIDD, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and PALE RIDER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every man who looks at his father as a low level superhero will see him in this movie. From his acceptance and protection of the downtrodden, to his quiet strength, Josie Wales is a depiction of what, as a society, we believe a man should be. Stoic, brave, and "plumb mad dog mean" in the face of adversity. Against the powers that be and living life with the infectious optimism that comes from physical well being, Josie is an outlaw that these times need. Chewing tobacco, and spitting on those that desperately need a humbling he personifies the guerilla fight creed. Not afraid to ride off with no hope of returning, and staring down those that wish him dead, he is the quintessential Clint Eastwood character. The only time I have seen him in a better portrayal ia in Unforgiven, he drinks whiskey and everybody dies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this troubled world trying to live in peace, we daily here of terrorist threats and besieged with news on "weapons of mass destruction." But that scene when Josey Wales rides up the mountain to see Ten Bears, the dialogue exchanged was to me, a classic. It summarizes why, if you really give it some thought, we can all live together in peace, and share nature. There's enough there for everyone! The conversation with Wales and Ten Bears really sends a strong message, and makes you wonder why the world cannot live in peace. Perhaps that is a scene that many could take a lesson from. Unfortunately the dictators in this world won't see it that way. Kudos to Eastwood for at least trying!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movies are not always factually correct!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems the only real criticism of this wonderful western (Eastwood's best), and one of my all time favorites is that it presents the Union as the bad guys and the south as the good guys. Big Deal! There have been plenty of movies that go the other way. A good story has to make the hero's side be the side to root for. My Darling Clementine and The Alamo (John Wayne's version) are ridiculously inaccurate accounts of history, yet they are both great movies! I am a history buff and have studied the civil war, and most of the historical criticism is accurate. But so what! I don't watch Clint Eastwood for a history lesson. I would judge harsher a movie that represents itself as history. Movies like Glory or Gettysburg I was much more interested in accuracy. Outlaw Josey Wales was based on a fictional story called, I believe "Going to Texas". I may not be exactly correct on that name! Anyway, in the words of Josey hisself, Dying ain't much of a living, boy!</fullReview>

At one point Eastwood meets an old indian "I forgot his name" who tells him that he didn't surrender, but they captured his horse and made him surrender.

Although it is set more than 130 years ago, the key elements are played out every night on the news in many parts of the world, most recently in Kosovo. This movie is about a lot more than the post-Civil War period.Wales had a long, violent journey to find people he could make peace with and want to give his life serving.The texture of this film was deep and rich with fine colorful characterizations from Eastwood's supporting cast, particularly the Lone Waite and Fletcher parts.

		<shortDescription>As Good As Westerns Get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood's masterpiece works on many levels. It covers all symbols and necessary parts which make a Western. Josey is as bad-ass as Western gunfighters become. The scene in the trading post with gun trick: OH MY GOD!!! As a Western it is brilliantly done, but what put it over the top is the comment Eastwood makes on the South during the post-civil war period, as well as on the Vietnam war (It was made during the aftermath of Vietnam). "I guess we all died a little in that damn war," is as powerful a statement as you will find in any film concerning the people of the United States. When the film ends and Josey rides off on his horse, never did I feel before that more right had been done, that what was wrong was finally right. I've seen this film ten times in the past month, but I never grow tired of it. It is as good as Westerns get.</fullReview>

When the war ends, the irregulars who murdered his family become official Union soldiers overseeing confederate surrenders. Except they intend to kill all the rebels.Lone Watie (Chief Dan George) becomes Josey's sidekick. He's a funny Indian who got too civilized. The movie is nice mixture of comedy and drama. Clint Eastwood is his intense classic self. This is arguably Clint's most complete early movie. A lot of that is due to Chief Dan George's comic relief and perfect timing.Laura Lee (Sondra Locke) is the Kansas traveler who Josey rescues from bandits. She became Clint's girl in real life, and would be one of the most tumultuous Hollywood relationship ever.And let's face it. "Dying ain't much of a livin boy." is a great line.</fullReview>

Each contribute more than their lines. Ladge, Abe, both Grannys, 10 Bears, the Carpetbagger, Lemuel, Jimmy, Sunshine - all are exceptional. I also liked the fact that even though this is not necessarily a movie about the Civil War, the drama is played out between two neutral states from that war (Kansas and Missouri). It's an interesting angle. There are life's lessons that can be extracted from this movie. Let's hope that we never have to use the lessons learned but survival against overwhelming odds takes on many forms. Again, my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Josey Wales : Sign Of The Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Outlaw Josey Wales is a bit long and meandering but there's enough worthwhile drama and action to make it worth watching.This came out at a time when the young people of the previous decade were getting a bit older and beginning to integrate back into mainstream society while bringing a few of their own quirks to the table.Filmgoers began to demand more offbeat protagonists It's why this story of an anti-hero leading a group of misfits fighting against an unjust authority in the most traditional of settings and film genres was (and is) so popular.The character of Josey Wales mirrors America at the time, defeated in war and humiliated.My favorite scene was was when Wales rides into the Cheyenne camp to meet with Chief Ten Bears (great performance by Will Sampson) and gives his words of life/ words of death, speech.This is the only Clint Eastwood movie where Clint doesn't get the best lines as they were all pretty much given to Chief Dan George.The end scene of The Outlaw Josey Wales is very positive in that Wales (like America) lets the past go and looks forward, which isn't very easy to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime Revisionist Eastwood Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is doubtlessly one of the greatest names to be associated with the Western Genre, both as an actor and director. Eastwood helped redefine the genre when he epitomized the Western antihero in Sergio Leone's Dollar-Trilogy, which culminated in the unmatched masterpiece "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" ("Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo", 1966), arguably the greatest Western- and doubtlessly also one of the greatest films ever made. After starring in some other very good Westerns (Ted Post's "Hang 'Em High" in 1968, Don Siegel's "Two Mules For Sister Sarah" in 1970), the iconic Western actor redefined his anti-hero role when directed his first Western, the gritty, dark and brutally fascinating "High Plains Drifter" in 1973. He would continue to keep the genre alive with three further magnificent directorial works, "Pale Rider" (1985), "Unforgiven" (1992), and, earlier, this incredible piece of cinema named "The Outlaw Josey Wales". "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is a compelling Revisionist Western which has the rare quality of being gritty, violent and yet subtle at the same time. The film is a revenge tale set at the end of the American civil war, which, rather than exploring the cause of a War, explores what War causes in people - in a more than impressive manner.Josey Wales (Eastwood) is a farmer, who, after his wife and kids get massacred by Redlegs (Kansas Unionist guerrillas during the civil War), vengefully joins the Confederate Guerillas of Bloody Bill Anderson. After the Union's victory, Wales becomes one of the most dreaded outlaws."The Outlaw Josey Wales" has everything - it is a violent revenge-tale with loads of Eastwood-bad-assery, but it is also a disturbing and unique portrayal of some of the atrocities of War, and an intelligent tale of inter-cultural discourse. As in some of his other Westerns, Eastwood's character of Josey Wales is on friendly terms with Native Americans. On his escape from the Union's authorities, he finds two companions in the old Indian Lone Waitie (Chief Dan George), and a young Indian woman (Geraldine Keats). The film has violent, action-packed, sad and funny moments, and it is impressive in all aspects throughout its 135 minutes. Eastwood is at top of his game as the tobacco-spitting gunslinger Josey Wales, Chief Dan George and Geraldine Keats are excellent as his sidekicks. The entire cast is great, actually. Eastwood's then-girlfriend Sondra Locke fits greatly in the role of the innocent beauty, Paula Trueman is one of the funny characters as her constantly nagging grandmother, Bill McKinley is sardonic as the murderous Terrill and John Vernon (who played the role of the mayor in "Dirty Harry") is great as Fletcher, a fellow former guerrilla who unwillingly has to pursuit Wales. The film is excellently photographed in impressive locations, the score is great and always fits the atmosphere. While the film is great in its other aspects, it is primarily a fantastic revenge-western with exceptional gun-play and superbly bad-ass eponymous protagonist. Once again, the role of Josey Wales fits Eastwood like a glove. All in all, "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is an incredible Western that no genre-fan may miss. This is another proof of Eastwood's genius, both as an actor and director, and one of the highlights in this great man's impressive repertoire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the best Eastwood Western?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many say that The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was Eastwood's best Western film, well I since have not watch it yet, this movie would remain as the best. Josey Wales is a vengeance movie in which the lead character wants to avenge his family's death however in return for his troubles acquire a unique bond with different people that he could consider his new family.First is with an old Indian, Lone Waite (brilliantly played by George), which has a natural sense of humor around Wales, ( "I didn't surrender, but they took my horse and made him surrender. They have him pulling a wagon up in Kansas I bet. "). Second is Little Moonlight, the squaw that he saved from an attempted abuse, third is the dog, and lastly the Settlers from Kansas, Laure Lee and Grandma Sarah which he saved from some Comancheros; traders. With this ensemble, Wales start being comfortable and remembers his anguish towards the loss of his family.Although supposed to be a dark and sad revenge flick, The Outlaw Josey Wales, has mix elements of action, drama and a little bit of funny dialogue. Eastwood removes the glimmer of Western and pasted his rough and desolate vision of the time period. It also showed the negative effects of war and how it affected the people that are just caught up in the battle.If you want a straight out shooter this is not the movie for you although western action would still be incorporated but for me this movie is all about peace of mind of a man who once lost it all.</fullReview>

The movie is well acted and has a good cast. It has plenty of gunfighting to entertain.This movie shows Eastwood in his prime for westerns, soon after he started doing the Dirty Harry movies.

		<fullReview>It's been around twenty years I guess since I first saw this movie on video. I remember my first reactions as a young man were how cruel it was that Clint's family was slaughtered, how cute Sondra was, and how easily the movie moved from one phase to the next.Westerns are programmatic by nature, and this one is no exception, but years before Dances with Wolfs was held up as a masterpiece and a mechanism for the American people to recognise what they had done to their own indigenous peoples, this movie presented the tribe of Ten Bear's as reasonable, heroic people in the same quest for fairness as Client and his tribe.For anyone interested in movies, in their construction, direction and production, this is an important work to view and consider. And, my understanding is that it was almost never made. Someone had been pestering Clint that he'd written this screenplay - something Clint was probably bored hearing....eventually the pestering paid off and the big man read the story. The rest is history.</fullReview>

I'm always amazed that Hollywood can still produce movies that are capable of making us ponder the human condition, yet make us smile. This is full of marvellous lines from Eastwood, and the wonderful Chief Dan George,(deserved a Best Supporting Actor for this one) and I would consider this the best Eastwood I've seen, (perhaps Million Dollar Baby may top it for totally different reasons). Kudos also to the cinematographer and costume designer, excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I reckon it was a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly I have not seen many westerns so I don't have much to compare this too. I was born in '78, raised on movies from the 80's and 90's, this movie came out in '76 and I still liked it. The dialogue was fantastic... I loved those witty quips and one liners. There was one particularly good line when a confederate was talking to a guy from the union and he said, "I don't like when a man is pissing down my back and telling me it's raining." It was a good ole tale of revenge and gun slinging. I especially like the change of pace and light-hearted spirit that Chief Dan George brought to the movie. I didn't know that Native Americans were given such roles in films back then. An excellent movie, I'm liking Eastwood more and more.</fullReview>

Death follows Josey Wales, but never catch him. He is a bloody warrior whose path will be taken by a lot of people that is in need of his helpThose who know "Roland from Gilead" should see this great film.It is impossible not to remember the Dark tower 's hero when we see Josey wales in action.

		<fullReview>As many other reviewers have said, it's about the best Western ever made. (I prefer the Sergio 'man with no name' trilogy more,) but I must warn that it really should carry an 'R' rating.*POSSIBLE SPOILER*There is a very graphic (even by today's standards) attempted rape scene. Plus lots of violence. It is very appropriate for the tone of the movie, and an important part of the plot; but it is more than a PG rating should have. I mostly say this because I almost let my 10 year old son watch it without viewing it first. It would *NOT* have been appropriate for a 10 year old, regardless of its PG rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Definitive Western that supersedes Unforgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Josey Wales is a simple farmer in Missouri and he has a name. Unlike so many of the Sergio Leone westerns here we see Clint Eastwood as a character with depth of character. This film was shot long before the days of political correctness but certainly during times of strife and government problems in the USA. People needed and wanted an escape from the horrors of real war brought home to their televisions every night and The Outlaw Josey Wales contained all the right elements to release tension. It had the real man who had served as a soldier but was now considered a vagrant and an outlaw within his own country. This is not history as it tends to be a revisionist view but it is a good story, the essence of a good movie is the backbone story. Movies made without a backbone are so many glitzy big-budget films that fall over under their own bloated weight. In Josey Wales we have a man that had seen both friend and family slaughtered in front of him and he wanted for nothing more than peace and a place to live it in. OK, he wanted a bit of vengeance too. While the film has its bright moments of classic Clint Eastwood one-liners to release tension it also had plenty of serious comment to make about society. This was not a bright polished western with clean hotels and glossey shoot-outs with quick-cut scenes and a multi-million dollar budget for the soundtrack alone. It was a western with vagabond Indians ( Chief Dan George ) and rag-tag soldiers just trying to survive in a post war world. If anyone is serious about looking at the classic western long before hollywood became glossy about the genre then I highly recommend "The Outlaw Josey Wales" as a template to measure others in the class. Get a copy of "Little Big Man" ( 1970, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Chief Dan George) at the same time and you have a solid Sunday afternoon of top notch westerns made with all the passion, the grit and the government hatred that one can swallow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film however it is overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As The Outlaw Josey Wales, Clint Eastwood is ideal as a wary, fast drawing loner, akin to the "Man with no name" from his European westerns. But unlike that other mythic outlaw, Josey Wales has a name and a heart. That heart opens up as the action unfolds. After avenging his family's brutal murder, Wales is pursued by a pack of killers. He prefers to travel alone, but ragtag outcasts are drawn to him and Wales can't bring himself to leave them unprotected. The Outlaw Josey Wales was released in 1976 and it stars Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke &amp; John Vernon. In my opinion this is no where near one of Eastwood's best films, don't get me wrong it is a good film but Eastwood has had much better for example, Dirty Harry, True Crime, Magnum Force, Coogan's Bluff and The Enforcer.***/***** Good but overrated</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Eastwood's Finest Effort! Totally Gripping!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is in his element as a Confederate rebel fighting his way across Missouri to Texas just after the Civil War ends. He is sought after by all the "powers that be" of the time but Josey is implacable in his fierce demeanor - fearless in his resolve to fight on "because he has nothing else better to do." After his wife and child are killed by the "red legs" of the Union forces, Josey joins "Bloody Bill" and his rag tag Confederate band of ruffians. As the Civil War ends, all the Confederates are forced to surrender at the beginning of the film, after fighting successfully during the campaign. Only Josey Wales holds out to fight on ruthlessly and relentlessly because he has no life to go back to and no reason to live on. So his hate kicks in to overdrive as he proceeds to kill anyone who gets in his way which is every authority that crosses his path. "You're wanted Wales" says a bounty hunter to Wales. Josey's (Eastwood's) response? "I reckon I'm right popular." This movie is loaded with great lines like this. Josey becomes a warrior out of necessity and because his life, (wife and child), has been forcibly stolen from him, he does not fear death which makes him a deadly foe. Yet his tender and tolerant side surfaces throughout the story as well as his capacity to love another girl again. He also displays a religious angle as he bows his head in a perfunctory manner during Granny's prayer and also when Wales prays over the death of his young companion. There are several classic Eastwood moments of confrontation reminiscent of "A Fistful of Dollars" that lend suspense to heroism in this exciting and interesting tale. With a cast of fascinating characters and constant violence, Eastwood portrays his finest role in brilliant style that grips the audience and never lets go. There is a taut tension throughout this film yet at the same time slow and relaxed scenes are interspersed regularly and executed effectively between action sequences. Perhaps this is Eastwood's finest film. I loved it! "Get ready Granny! Hell is coming to breakfast."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some words on a good western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only recently begun to appreciate the western as a genre. My father always tried to get me to sit and watch various westerns when I was younger with varying success. So now I find myself returning to those films he seemed to love so much and seeing with more mature eyes what he might have seen. One of those films being "The Outlaw Josey Wales", and let me say I can't say enough good things about this film.The first thing that comes to mind is the films dialogue. Not something you usually remember when speaking of westerns I would imagine. This film has so many great lines I'm not going to bother listing them hear. What strikes me about the dialogue is how it manages to get some rather poignant political commentaries across about various issues of this time in our countries history with out being all that preachy or heavy handed. We have here everything from commentaries on the role of government to race relations to warfare in general.Another thing that comes to mind is the Fletcher character, who is somewhat of an oddity in films these days: The anti-villain. Its only fitting that in a film whose primary protagonist is the quintessential anti-hero that he is juxtaposed with such a character as Fletcher, someone who seemingly admires Josey and to a certain extent agrees with him. Though he is surrounded w/the typical one sided easy to hate "villains", his ambiguity is refreshing. In many ways it is the Fletcher character that keep the film from feeling to generic.It's these subversive elements to the film that manage to undermine its rather formulaic elements. The film wants to be a generic b. picture, but it just cant quite pull it off. It has to many good things going for it to allow it to be that kind of cookie cutter western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is far and away the best Clint movie of all time. Better than Kelly's Heros???? The time they spend for character development and they way the characters intertwine in and out the show is great. Chief Dan George almost steals the show. ("endeavor to persevere") The show is naturally broken into three segments based on the characters that accompany Josey. These characters overlap and reappear during the movie making an interesting thread that runs thru it. The movie is loaded with some of the best lines of all time... "Die'n ain't much of a livin' is it boy?" "You going' pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?", "If one of you has to, take that ole woman over there... she might be worth one donkey." The list goes on... How can you slam this movie unless your some "Fudge Packer" (see other review). Maybe Sandra Locke's part is a little off the wall but Clint was doing her at the time and you do get a sample (boobs and butt shot) of what Clint's seeing in her acting, unless you're watching the cut version. I need to read the book "Going to Texas" to make my Woodie go down.</fullReview>

One criticism of the film is that Wales is seemingly invulnerable. That is exactly Eastwood's point. Though Wales IS invulnerable, he cannot defeat all of his enemies without becoming a part of the "community of man" again. A great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Outlaw Josey Wales is a cinematic masterpiece and by far Clint Eastwoods best. By the end of the epic 2 hours 11 minutes you could only give praise and excellence to this stirring and classic western. Eastwood plays a Missouri farmer who after his family are murdered decides to go and hunt them down and kill the ones responsible. Eastwood portrayal of Joswey Wlaes couldn't bee bettered because of his mesmerising acting, significant style and worthy flair to dominate the screen. The landscapes and baron wastelands all play a role themselves giving the audience a feel of uneasiness and savageness that once was the west. Eastwood, whilst delivering hard-boiled acting also slips in a few jokes hear and there to give a sense that the film is NOT totally all dramatic and he does this well. John Vernon is perfectly cast as the cold-hearted Fletcher as so are the other actors involved.All in all The Outlaw Josy Wales is perfect in all areas, moving, dramatic, thrilling, adventurous, humorous and full of action. Eastwood has surely out done himself and to be honest this is the best film of the seventies and a profound competitor for one of the greatest cinematic achievements in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood doing what Eastwood does best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne fans may well disagree, but if you ask me; Clint Eastwood has no equal when it comes to westerns. His mere presence ensures that the film will be well worth seeing, and like all his previous and later westerns; that statement is true of The Outlaw Josey Whales also. Not that this film is an Eastwood performance and nothing more, of course - his starring role definitely benefits the proceedings, but the story Eastwood presents is certainly nothing to be sneered at! The film is an epic in every sense of the word, and through the sprawling locations and lengthy plot, Eastwood's fourth film as director and star serves as both a fitting tribute to Sergio Leone; the director whom he made his name with, and an excellent western in its own right. The plot follows a farmer whose family is murdered by Union soldiers. He joins up with a Confederate guerrilla unit, and eventually finds himself living within a community. Overall, we follow him as the war turns him from a simple farmer into the most wanted man in the west.You can always count on a strong lead performance from any film that has Clint Eastwood's name at the top of the actor's credit list, and The Outlaw Josey Whales certainly doesn't disappoint in that respect. It's obvious the director and star put his heart into this film, and even though he's merely playing the anonymous drifter that is synonymous with his name, the performance comes off with real verve and the man is always believable in his role. As you might expect from a western, the film is heavy in the action department, and Eastwood ensures that his film is never too far away from another shootout. However, the real impact of the movie doesn't come from a weapon, but from the progress that the central character makes throughout the movie. Any other person in an Eastwood film is always going to be second to the man himself, and this is certainly the case here. However, the likes of Chief Dan George and Clint's then girlfriend, Sandra Locke still manage to make an impression; even if it is obvious why the latter is in the movie. On the whole, this film is sure to please western fans, particularly those who are a fan of the great man behind this one. Well worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperate Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of this brilliant movie Josey Wales has a wife, a son and a small farm. Before the end of the opening credits he has only bitterness. With his family having been killed by union troops he joins a group of rebel guerrilla fighters; but the war is lost and his comrades plan to surrender so that they can go home to their families. Josey refuses to join them and then suffers the anguish of seeing his comrades betrayed and gunned down. He intervenes and kills many union soldiers before making his escape with one still living friend and then the story of the movie starts.Even though he has little to live for Josey decides to head for Mexico and hopefully a life of peace but a $5000 bounty on his head ensures trouble all along the way. This huge reward along with tales of his exploits makes him a famous outlaw and a number of people try to take him in. This is where the movie shines for me. Through every confrontation Eastwoods character is impassive and unafraid but the demeanour of those attacking him is never so. To them he represents an incredibly dangerous escape from their desperate lives. The scenes of confrontation crackle with sweaty tension as trappers, farmers and bounty hunters take on this implacable, fearsome warrior for the small chance of living their dreams.The scene in the trading post is typical as the spiteful, loathsome owner pleads for a share in the Wales bounty he thinks the trappers are going to get then hides in misery when Josey prevails.but this is not a miserable movie. As the story progresses Josey acquires a new family. A chief, a squaw, some pilgrims and a red bone hound. They fall under his protection and in turn they save his soul.The story comes full circle from peace and love at the very beginning, through adventure, violence, tragedy. humour and nobility, back to peace and love at the very end. I cannot recommend it highly enough; it also contains one of the best lines in movie history. "Dyin ain't much of a living boy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no clue on how to describe this wondrous western. While I was watching Hang 'Em High on TV, I noticed that after that movie, The Outlaw Josey Wales would be showing, as well. Since I am a Clint Eastwood, I couldn't say no to this great western, especially one that Eastwood personally directed and personally acted out the role of Josey Wales, a Missouri farmer who becomes a wanted outlaw. Josey Wales makes friends along the way of running away from Fletcher's gang. After watching how impressive Eastwood did in Unforgiven, being both an actor and director, I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed watching Josey Wales. Many men hunt down Josey Wales for the money he's worth, but Josey always manages to defeat them. Be it alive or dead. I give this movie a score of 10/10. Truly one of Eastwood's greatest American westerns. Eastwood's performance is once again inspiring and there is a bit of a sense of humor now and then in the movie. Any western or Eastwood fan would be proud of this film as I am myself. I congratulate Eastwood once again as he becomes a triumphant western figure in every western he stars in. In this case, he is the Outlaw Josey Wales!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the ultimate Vietnam Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood truly outdid himself with this movie. He attempted to do something that few other directors were willing to deal with during this period... he attempted to offer America closure... for Vietnam. The film was made in the final days of the American participation in the conflict and is a pastiche of types that we should be familiar with from American life during Vietnam. Wales is the bitter veteran, tired of war, who comes to protect this band of innocents from the savagery of war. However, he comes to the conclusion that, in the end, it is better to sue for peace and allow all sides to live together (something that is opposed by the American gov't in this film, who are more concerned with vengeance than justice). His symbolic marriage to the 'flower child' (Laura Turner, played by Sondra Locke) is the final signal that America MUST heal itself, the hawks and the doves are not, in the end, enemies, but must reconcile.The Outlaw Josey Wales is, simply, a fantastic and beautiful movie, one that must be seen and experienced repeatedly by anyone who claims to be a fan of the genre. While it may have functioned as a symbolic closure for Vietnam, it continues to have meaning today... it continues to have validity in its comentary about America and and our way of life. In much the same manner that Fight Club comments on where America has gone wrong, TOLJW directs toward where America can go right. Eastwood has tackled these issues before and since, but never so well and never so beautifully. The Outlaw Josey Wales is a film for the ages, and I hope that more people get a chance to watch it. I know that a lot of people my age have an aversion to watching older films, and I find that to be a great tragedy, so I hope that the fact that I, as a 28 year old male, can appreciate these films might possibly influence others to make an effort. There are a lot of great films, enjoy as many as you can.</fullReview>

Sondra Locke ( The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, 6 films with partner Eastwood). Bill McKinney ( Deliverance, seven films with Eastwood, The Green Mile). John Vernon ( Point Blank, Topaz, Dirty Harry, Charley Varrick). Music is by Jerry Fielding and cinematography is by Bruce Surtees. Editing is by Ferris Webster. Josey Wales switches from a simple peasant farmer to stone-cold killer... His shooting becomes as precise as his tobacco spitting... The story is about a Missouri farmer whose family is murdered n how he turns into an outlaw to take revenge. All in all The Outlaw Josy Wales is perfect in all areas, moving, dramatic, thrilling, adventurous, humorous and full of action. Eastwood has surely out done himself and to be honest this is the best film of the seventies and a profound competitor for one of the greatest cinematic achievements in movie history. There are plenty of decently- made action sequences throughout the movie. The characters are also pretty well- developed and most of them are lovable. I like how its a kind of adventure story as well, taking place in several regions of the West. Very atmospheric n moody film. A bit long but doesn't hav dull moments.

		<shortDescription>Could have been a classic, but goes on a bit too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Outlaw Josey Wales" would be a classic western if not for one fatal flaw: it drags a little in the middle part, and goes on a bit too long.With editing, it would be a small masterpiece.It tells the story of the titular Josey Wales, a Confederate soldier whose family, and later his regiment, is massacred by Unionist rebels. He becomes an outlaw and heads into the wilderness with a price on his head, picking up a band of unlikely compatriots who have all been screwed by the army of the North in some way, namely an elderly Cherokee Indian, a young Navajo woman, an elderly Kansas dame and her young granddaughter. Behind the scenes of Wales' pursuit is Captain Fletcher, a Unionist officer played by one of my favourite actors, John Vernon, as someone who is uncomfortable with the violence with which Wales' band were treated. Wales is headed for a confrontation, but it may not be with the ambivalent Fletcher, who he may have more in common with than he realises."The Outlaw Josey Wales" features many great moments, such as when Wales shoots the rope guiding the Union soldiers across the river on the barge, and when his first charge dies. It lags in the middle though, and would have been much better with a tighter script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Introduction to Eastwood Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have learned by this point that westerns are filled with despair. The Outlaw Josey Wales gives audience a full dose of despair almost immediately. We are introduced to Josey Wales, a post-Civil War southerner who is thoroughly disheartened by the atrocities from the war he has witnessed. Refusing to succumb to the northern way of life, Josey continues to provide for his family in the way he has always known. Once tragedy is brought upon the Wales family, Josey retaliates, then quickly adopts a vagabond life as a fugitive on the run. Josey seems quite content to live life as a loner, responsible to and for no one, until he meets a fellow he can't shake. Josey forms a bond with the young man which yields mutually beneficial results as the young man saves Josey's life in a pinch. The tale of vengeance knows no bounds as Wales escapes many seemingly impossible to survive shootouts against those responsible for his despair. Clint Eastwood is the perfect actor for the role of the loner Josey Wales. He is completely believable as a man that needs no one, nor their approval. Even playing a loner, Eastwood's performance is action packed, and intense. Also, the cinematography in this film is breathtaking. Perfect shots of trees and mountains allow the audience to feel like a silent partner, saddling up for Josey's trip. Eastwood, acting as director on this picture as well as star, also uses clean quick cuts throughout each scene, a style that he had perfected through his Dirty Harry series. Aside from the beautiful photography of the film is the starkly gloomy way it is shot. In combination with the score and motion of cuts, a morose mood encompasses the picture. This film was a joy as my introduction to Eastwood westerns, and will doubtfully be the last one I take in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrowing..... Reality of the Civil War is Frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was required viewing for a college drama class. We had to watch a number of movies from all genres and periods. Many of these viewings were instructional only and frankly there was little entertainment value. This movie is not in that category. This is probably the best western I've seen from a purely objective viewpoint. That said, I feel this movie preaches the Southern cause from an indirect angle in order to influence our feelings about the modern world in light of that outcome. The "unjust" Union, nefarious Union outlaws, and a total disregard deflection from anything slavery being a factor in the civil war is designed to give you a revisionist lobotomy and make you feel good about it. I found myself enjoying the storyline and hackneyed plot that flows more like a backwater slough than a free flowing stream simply because it wasn't entirely predictable and had a mix of endearing ne'er do wells with many quirks and comedic relief moments. While stories of this sort are certainly true and even one's absurd to the point of illucidness are fairly frequent in biopics such as Ang Lee's "Ride with The Devil", this story is all to high on the South with no swing of the pendulum. This is because of the bias of the author.I was able to get inside this movie because sadly my great grandfather was a confederate sympathizer along with Forest Carter. My grandfather and Forest Carter saw some kind of glory in the lost cause and wished it to continue. After further research I found that Forest Carter definitely had racist sympathies. He also fabricated "The Education of Little Tree" which was written as a true story. This effort tells the story in such a way that it would seem all the Southerners in Missou are good and all the Jayhawkers are bad when in fact there were atrocities on both sides. Enjoy the ride but read the history yourself. I guess one admirable quality about the film is that it does play the devil's advocate the pitches the truth as being from the confederate side which is almost always maligned and certainly not every person on that side was evil incarnate. The danger is the selling of ideology and undercurrent influence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ghost of Tom Joad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An overlong but otherwise fine revisionist western, "The Outlaw Josey Wales" stars Clint Eastwood as the eponymous Josey Wales, a muscular farmer whose family is murdered by Unionists during the American Civil War. Angry as hell, Wales slaps on a pair of six-shooters, hops on a horse and goes looking for vengeance.What initially seems to be a traditional "revenge tale" designed to ennoble the Confederate cause, though, is quickly complicated. "Men can live together without butchering one another," Wales says, as he begins to assemble a family of Native American Indians, misfits, drunks and abused women. Acting as their protector, Wales cocoons his flock in a tough farm house, a private fortress designed to defend the down-trodden. By the film's end, White Man and Indian, North and South, have learnt to tentatively get along. "The war's over," we're told, as mean men learn to put down guns.Ironically for a film espousing peace and racial harmony, "The Outlaw Josey Wales" was based on a novel written by Asa Carter, a KKK member and segregationist. This is perhaps why there are no (few?) black people in the film, and no references to slavery. Elsewhere the film's hippie values rub oddly against its fondness for blood and squibs. Like "Soldier Blue", or Eastwood's own "Unforgiven", "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is ultimately an anti-violence western which gets its kicks off kills."Wales" was initially directed by Philip Kaufman, before mega-star Eastwood kicked Kaufman off the project and took up the directorial reigns himself. The film's aesthetic ? flat and functional - attempts to mimic the works of Don Siegel, John Ford and Sergio Leone, but Eastwood's not strong enough a visualist to match his forefathers. Eastwood's charisma, and a script packed with snappy dialogue, helps make up for this. "Wales" was the second western directed by Eastwood, and was to be the second directed by Kaufman, who filmed the subversive "The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid" some years earlier.7.9/10 ? Other recommended, idiosyncratic westerns: "McCabe and Mrs Miller", "The Beguiled", "Two Mules for Sister Sara", "The Long Riders", "Bad Company" (1972), "The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean", Altman's "Buffalo Bill and the Indians", "Hombre", "Hud", "Wagon Master", "The Ballad of Cable Hogue", "Open Range", "Wild Bill" (1995), "Tombstone", "My Darling Clementine", "Red River", "Ulzana's Raid", "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance", "Lonely Are The Brave", "The Shootist", "Broken Lance", "Viva Zapata" and "Ride With the Devil".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Josey Wales - do not let him go out. I'll go to hell if necessary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of a great movie. Many certainly will think about Josey Wales, exceptional western directed and starring by Clint Eastwood. Josey Wales -1976 brought a new vitality to the genre, especially the U.S. market, which at the time still resented the transformation occurred with the mass production of westerns in Europe particularly in Italy. Clint leverages the basic features of the "unnamed man" born of the creativity of Sergio Leone in the three movies he directed starring Clint. Josey Wales is a hybrid of man and nameless lone rider, absolute hero great American Westerns. A hero who comes from who knows where, usually after any trauma, like the death of family members, or an act of extreme violence and running, lone and fearless his revenge, his reckoning. We can also observe in Josey Wales very evident traces of Nevada Smith another great western starring Steve McQueen. But Josey Wales has its own life, has its own personality and he does not forgive. Joins an old Indian, to an abandoned Indian, a mangy dog, a young and an old lady survivors of caravan and follows with its accompanying his unusual path, killing anyone who threatens him and destroying what appears to him as an obstacle. Often notifies that will go into action spitting to the side. Thereafter, it is hell. Josey Wales not forgive and never be surprised. It's a great movie and Clint Eastwood have here one of his best performances, matched only years later in 1992 when he realized "Unforgiven" and won an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dying ain't much of a living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Eastwood, it was his "iconic" character that makes the movie. A classic western filmed mostly in Utah and filled with nonstop gun play, humor, romance, and some of the best one liners in any Western to date.Josey Wales was dragged into the depths of hell during the civil war as his family was killed by union troops. I couldn't think of a better actor to play the leading man other than Clint Eastwood. He doesn't talk much during the movie but uses remarkable facial expressions and body language in replace of it. When he does choose to talk he sparks some classic quotes like "are you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie" and "dying ain't much of a living." I was more impressed with the supporting actors used in the film. Chief Dan George as Lone Watie really makes the movie as Eastwood and George play off each other really well. Paula Trueman as Grandma Sara was also an excellent addition with her "too proud, I'm the best" mentality as she gets knocked off her high horse and built up again.My favorite scene is with Will Sampson as Ten Bears. Josey rides to meet him alone to save two of his new friends that Ten Bears has buried in the ground from the neck down. The conversation that takes place is very symbolic right before they each come to agreement with a blood pact.The final confrontation with Jon Vernon as Fletcher and Wales is outstanding. The first time I saw this film I didn't expect it to end that way but it was fitting the way it ended. A classic western that everyone should have sitting on their shelf.</fullReview>

He puts the Man With No Name behind him and moves on towards Unforgiven.His dialogue with Ten Bears, the feared Comanche chief is very good cinema and both actors do a very good job. It is quite stirring stuff.While Clint is very good in this, it is Chief Dan George who steals the entire show. Apparently Clint simply gave CDG an overview of a particular scene and let him ad lib almost every line. It is one of the more remarkable performances I have ever seen.I was never able to get onside with Sondra Locke, although she is passable in this. I can't work out what Clint saw in her. She is to wimpy while her mother comes across as a much tougher cookie.The movie has all the hallmarks of a good Eastwood western. Plenty of action, blood and gore, great one liners and a good (if not perfect) linkage with history.Great entertainment. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A man likes Wales lives by the feud."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is seen as a 'revisionist', seeing as up to that point Hollywood had not done a film so effectively reversing the roles of the Union and Confederate as protagonist and antagonist. Of course, Hollywood drew inspiration from the 1966 Italian film "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" which had a decade earlier portrayed the reality of the Civil War, war in general; there is always evil on both sides. Who better to build on this than Clint Eastwood himself? His character is very similar to his prior Man with No Name role, but this time around its not mystique and few words that make the man. Sergio Leone's Man with No Name is iconic for those attributes, but Josey Wales is something entirely different. He is still a deadly gunslinger yes, but we also know what drives him, adding to the connection. Of course, Eastwood stars and directs, which blows one away when you think about the level of thought put into this. Wales is a fantastic character with some of the best lines ever. Jamie (Sam Bottoms) says they should bury the body of two bounty hunters who were after them, and Wales replies "To hell with them fellas. Even buzzard gotta eat same as worms." He then proceeds to spit on the fallen man, what a strikingly bad-ass character.The cast is also pretty incredible here. Sam Bottoms was damn good in his role, and Chief Dan George was the right mix of humor yet sincerity. Will Sampson of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" appears briefly, quite awesome and Sandra Locke is also very good as well. Bill McKinney is the real villain of it all, and he does nicely. I loved John Vernon as Fletcher because he's a truly well-layered character, second only to Wales himself really. He carries the sins of the war, and what came after, on his shoulders and Vernon shows the pain of guilt all too well. The ending confrontation between Fletcher and Wales is one of the best out of not just the Western genre, but films in general. If there's a theme to this film, among many actually, the most poignant is that there always comes a time to put down the gun.The action in the film is definitely high class shoot-outs, but the photography of Bruce Surtees is indeed beautiful, capturing the landscape quite well. Any scene in the rain feels quite downcast yet leaves you in awe. And the score by Jerry Fielding is definitely another highlight of the movie. Definitely check this one out if you're a fan of Eastwood, Westerns or cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great western about a man becoming legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the title and the poster I first thought this was going to be about a bank robber and a band of thieves or something along that line. The plot is about a regular guy named Josey Wales(Clint Eastwood) filled with anger after his family gets killed by pro-Union group. Out of anger Josey Wales joins up with the confederates to get even with the Union group for what they done. Even when the confederates lose the war Josey Wales refuse to give up and keep on fighting and soon he ends up on the run with a bounty on his head because of it. Anyways he ends up having to overcome many obstacles because of this. This film shows what a man is capable of when you push him to the limit to the point he has nothing to do in the west. Even if Josey Wales fought for the confederacy, you can't help but actually like the guy because of the direction of it all. Wounds and emotional scars can heal, not completely but he can heal slowly and that is what happens as the story progresses. And it pulls this off quite well for the most part, especially with the companionship. And Josey actually comes off as a hero to some degree. Again he is likable still because of what he had to go through and the way he overcomes the obstacles he faces. Also this is far from being a dry western, it has a lot of action and shoot outs. In another words this is a western with a lot of entertainment value. The human nature aspects in this movie while portraying the west is believable and sometimes it will keep you thinking, although this movie is a western with a lot of action it has more going for it than that. The ending in this is sort of predictable and yet it is just really well thought-out and very satisfying. The ending is one of the best part about this movie, in a good way of course. To sum it up it's a entertaining western journey with emotion. And during the journey you actually sort of get attached to the characters. The premise of a regular man becoming a legend in the west is done just right. This is a wonderful western that I highly recommend to any western fans and even the general audiences that like watching movies to see. I for one thoroughly enjoyed this western, another amazing job directing and acting in your own film Mr. Eastwood.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before William Munny . . . there was Josey Wales</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly my favorite Eastwood Western. In adding depth to the main character of Josey Wales (which also tends to permeate the rest of the film), there's just ... more ... to this film than any he's headlined up to this point. It's not necessarily that it's anti-war in its sentiments, but there's the humanist element to the piece.On the surface, Wales is not unlike William Munny ("Unforgiven"). He leads a normal life until he's forced to revisit his murderous past. In this case, it's when his home and family are stripped at the hands of pro-Union guerillas. Wales takes up arms, joins the Confederates, and cuts a bloody swath across the plains of Missouri. As the war comes to a bitter end for the Confederates, Wales refuses to surrender and takes to the wrong side of the law. As he flees from the pursuing Union forces, he happens on a wily old Cherokee (the scene-stealing Chief Dan George) and a young Navajo woman (Geraldine Keams), and winds up rescuing an elderly woman and her granddaughter (Paula Trueman and Sondra Locke, respectively) from commancheros. The irony here is that this murderous outlaw is able to regain a sense of humanity through this motley band.It also helps that the script is imbued with a dry humor flowing throughout. Unlike "Unforgiven", this is helpful to the audience in relating to Josey Wales.But it wouldn't be an Eastwood Western without shootouts, and they're certainly present and accounted for (including an explosive scene involving a gatling gun). The difference here is that they tend to be less abundant with the film's relaxed pace. Certainly not a weakness as it adds to the journey we take with Wales. It also helps that Eastwood has a little more to work with this time around in a Western, than just his usual steely persona.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest westerns of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the Man with No Name to inspector Harry Callahan, Clint Eastwood proved that he is a master at creating memorable characters. Out of all these my favorite has to be that of Josey Wales, a character whose complexity reminded me of John Wayne's Ethan Edwards from "The Searchers".Shattered by the murder of his family to a group of Union soldiers and looking for revenge, Josey Wales joins a Confederate unit in order to find a new meaning in life. The time he spends fighting transforms him into a skilled gunman, but also takes away his humanity from him. He becomes a wanted man when he refuses to surrender to the Union and a group of soldiers led by the merciless Captain Terrill sets out in his pursuit. Josey is joined by fellow trooper Jamie (Sam Bottoms) who manages to assist him despite being wounded by the Union troops.This is not only one of Clint's best westerns, but one of the greatest westerns of all time; it has everything that a film needs to be great. "The Outlaw Josey Wales" has an engaging storyline with a well developed central character and plenty of memorable quotes ("Are you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?", "Get ready, little lady. Hell is coming to breakfast", "Dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy" etc.). While Eastwood the director does a remarkable job behind the camera, it is Eastwood the actor who is even greater here. Josey Wales is one of his finest creations, a tough and complex character, one of cinema's great antiheroes. Throughout the film we witness his transformation from a hardened gunslinger who lost his faith in his fellow men into a man who manages to regain his humanity and is ready to start a new life. The moment that probably marks his transformation is his conversation with Indian chief Ten Bears (Will Sampson), a brilliantly acted scene that is very powerful in the context of the movie. The characters that Josie encounters are also well developed and they are very different from one another. That would not have been possible without great performances from the supporting cast, Chief Dan George and John Vernon being the ones that are especially good.Clint Eastwood's westerns are known for their revisionist style and this film makes no exception. For instance, the native American characters are different from those of traditional westerns and I found their portrayal more realistic. This is a film that can be watched over and over and I consider it to be very appealing to modern audiences as well. Clint Eastwood is a master of the western genre and this is one of his greatest achievements.My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit off kilter, as westerns go, this is none the less, a great film. It re-imagines the western genre, using the commonality of vengeance and loss, as the moving narrative, despite featuring a confederate soldier as the protagonist of the film. He witnesses the slaughter of his home and family by the mercenary "red legs", who traverse the Southern countryside waging a guerrilla war against the south on behalf of the Union. Josey joins up with an equally ruthless band, the Bloody Bill Anderson group (a true historical brigade), but again watches his adopted family's slaughter, this time at the hands of some double crossing Union officials offering "amnesty" at the conclusion of the war. Here, Josey begins a lonely odyssey on the run from the redlegs who've been commissioned to hunt him down and kill him. Several darkly humorous lines common in the Eastwood repertoire, appear, along with the one time Mrs. Eastwood, Sondra Locke. Great Journey of one man, first of vengeance, and then of forgiveness. But not after some excellent gun battles, and fight sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring Clint Eastwood, Chief Dan George, Sondra Lock, John Vernon, Bill McKinney, and several other talented actors and actresses, "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is a very well-written and well-directed Western movie. The old plots of seeking revenge for the death of a loved one(s) comes back to life, but much more complex and powerful than some of the others. Clint Eastwood is flawless as both leading actor and director.There are plenty of decently-made action sequences throughout the movie and considering how obsolete 70s special effects are today, it was very surprising. The characters are also pretty well-developed and most of them are lovable. I like how it's a kind of adventure story as well, taking place in several regions of the West.The only thing which I personally feel could have been left out of the script was the love story. It just seemed very badly developed and unnecessary to the movie. It probably was just thrown in because Sondra Locke (Clint Eastwood's at-the-time girlfriend) was part of the cast."The Outlaw Josey Wales" is one of my favorite Westerns and probably Eastwood's second-best work on the Western movie genre. It's movies like these that keep the genre alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many films were made about the people of Missouri and Kansas after the civil war, but "Josey Wales" is my favorite, specially because of the last scenes, which show a light at the end of the tunnel. Eastwood is superb, and seeing the film now we realize what a void he left after he stopped doing westerns, no one could replace him, he was unique. The film started being directed by Philip Kaufman, but Eastwood wanted to do it his way. I think it would have come out even better if Kaufman had stayed, I liked his style and Eastwood in my opinion is not as great a director of westerns as he is an actor. After Josey Wales refuses to surrender to the Union, he unwillingly becomes the leader of some people who have their lives marked by tragedy. There is the Indian Chief trying to adapt to the new conditions, the Indian girl who has been mistreated, two women from Kansas who are running away from the horrors of war. They want to get their self respect back and they all are going to help each other. What is impressive is how the minor characters have great performances.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be my favorite Clint Eastwood movie. Clint is excellent in the title role, and I like Josey Wales as a character perhaps more than any other Eastwood incarnation because he's human, has a heart, and never pulls his gun on anybody who hasn't drawn a gun on him first. The movie has aged beautifully. The DVD is the only version worth watching, thanks to the letterboxed compositions. God, does Eastwood know how to frame and shoot a movie. Visually and technically, "Josey Wales" is as good as these things get -- and it's almost 30 years old! I was also pleased to discover that this isn't the typical revenge flick, a'la "Dirty Harry" and Eastwood's Man With No Name pictures. Wales does have a score to settle, but he has morals and regroups with a renegade community of social outcasts who end up saving his life (as well as his soul). The whole movie, basically, is about how Wales goes about accidentally accumulating the companions he needs to overcome the bad guys (who are almost stereotypically bad). What's more interesting is that Wales' newfound saviors include an old woman, two Native Americans, and ... gulp! cringe!... Sondra Locke. Oh, well. Every movie must have its flaw, and she's definitely it. There's also a lot of unexpected humor. I love the scene where Josey sends his Union tormentors on the "Missouri river ride," which is immediately preceded by the great moment where he asks the snake oil salesman how the elixir works on stains. My favorite moment in the film is the scene in which he rides out to meet with Will Sampson as Ten Bears, the mean Comanche who aims to slaughter Wales' crew. This powerful moment elevates Wales to the status of a true hero. Oh, there are some annoying bits. Eastwood spits tobacco entirely too often, and the picture softens up and drags just a bit in the middle. But it's all worthwhile, building up to an exciting climax and a final scene that allows Josey to maintain his mystery while still riding off into the sunset. This is a great movie. Watch it and "The Patriot" as a double feature and see if you can find any similarities.</fullReview>

The film is good at story-telling as well, with Josey Wales on the run and meeting up with a variety of people along the way.

		<fullReview>During the American Civil War, a farmer's wife and child are killed by Union soldiers in front of his very eyes; their simple but homely homestead burnt to cinders. Josey Wales joins a group of Confederate guerrillas in order to satisfy his sudden bloodthirsty desire for revenge. At war's end, the rest of the group capitulates and the remnants are massacred by the Union Army. Wales is declared an outlaw.People start to gather around him, a young confederate, a disaffected and wise old Indian man and a proto-hippy and her respectable auntie. No matter how much he declares his indifference to their company, the more they gather. He spits tobacco on the dog who only barks and comes back for more. It becomes almost genteel in the middle and comes dangerously close to moralising but avoids doing so. This movie has it all and was not even nominated! Unspoken romance, social commentary on solitariness, death, Clintisms - "You a bounty hunter?" "Man's got to do something for a living..." "Dying ain't much of a living, boy..."An excellent cast. Fitting music.THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES manages to be beautiful and poetic (In a 'Clint' film you probably ask?). As noted by another viewer, "it manages to be epic---truly grand, covering broad territories interior and exterior, a lot of emotion...without posturing or self-conscious bigness." Josey's peace-making with Ten Bears is truly inspirational and moral. This movie will have a profound impact on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An earlier critic said this was pure fantasy. Maybe in the characters personalities if they are historical like "Bloody Bill" Anderson. But this movie was accurate in the guns used in the Civil War. Perhaps the blackpowder guns did not smoke as much as they should and they never jammed due to a cap getting caught in the works. Josey always had plenty of shooting irons like the border raiders would in case of malfunction and the complicated reloading with cap and ball pistols. This may be the best ever western with only a few in the same league. (Ride the High Country,The Professionals,The Wild Bunch,The Tall Men &amp; Big Jake &amp; The Shootist) come to mind without too much thought. Anyway, for the acting,story,casting I give this 9/10, and wonder if it should be a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood and under rated western epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an epic in the largest sense, but folks either don't seem to understand it or I'm putting things in that aren't really there. I find this a superior tale to my other fave, 'The Searchers' in that it recounts the making of this nation from a mismatched set of strangers to a group working together for a common good. Eastwood is a peaceful farmer who symoblically dies when his family is killed by renegade Union soldiers during the War Between the States. His 'ghost' persona, untouchable as it's not within this realm, wreaks horrible and constant revenge on his enemies until he finds a reason to live again. As soon as he does, he becomes vulnerable and in fact gets wounded. Luckily for him and the movie's timing, his resurrection as a human comes just as he's finished off all his direct enemies save one who he comes to terms with. Oddly enough, I never found Eastwood's man with no name movies even watchable, but I sure like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Eastwood western, another Eastwood masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A signal quality of Eastwood's movies is the excellence of supporting actors. In this case, Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, John Vernon and Paula Trueman -- some major support -- Dan George, Sandra Locke -- some more minor roles -- John Vernon and Paula Trueman, who was in but one scene and gave tone and verisimilitude to the story. Josey Wales escapes a slaughter of his southern comrades by yankee soldiers after the surrender of the South. A wandering indian (George) becomes his muse and mentor as they seek escape to Texas. Commancheros, Commanches and the yankee search and destroy party do their best, but Josey brings a Kansas family, himself and his indian friend to peaceful coexistence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But now I see Clint Eastwood in the true light. He is a superb actor and a superb director and he deserves all of the accolades that can be showered upon him. I have never seen a Western the likes of 'The Outlaw Josey Wales'. The philosophy in this masterpiece of a film is truly educational and enlightening. The point made and well declared is 'eventually we must forgive'. Would that this were required viewing on TV screens in Northern Ireland, Israel and the surrounding Arab States, Serbia and Kosovo, and India and Pakistan. I have seen this movie just this once (last evening) and now I know for sure that I will see it again and again whenever I can. It took me so long to appreciate the genius of Clint Eastwood. As I said, the blame is all mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great morality play, and he got the history right, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie truly defines Clint Eastwood as a movie maker, and although it precedes Unforgiven by almost 20 years, powerfully resonates the themes that the director would later turn to his advantage in that award-winning effort. Eastwood's story of a man whom events turn from a simple farmer to soldier to outlaw to savior rings true, and doesn't glamorize any of the characters of the "Wild West" as so many movies before and since did. Eastwood's Josey Wales is a flawed man, prone to violence; his enemies don't tend to live very long (of course, as his elderly Indian companion points out, neither do his friends). But his innate protective instinct results in the creation of a new "family" to replace the wife and child whose murders lead him down the outlaw's trail. Along the way he encounters bloodthirsty cavalrymen, noble and pragmatic Native Americans, and a variety of assorted ne'er-do-wells who undoubtedly populated the true "Old West", but never Hollywood's version. Striking visuals by a director with a truly unique style. My favorite Eastwood film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Western Genre has been good to Clint Eastwood, making him a star. He has also been good back to that genre, making one of the greatest Westerns ever, Unforgiven. The Outlaw Josey Wales was also the Western that gave Clint Eastwood his big break as a director, showing what he is capable as a filmmaker.Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) is a peaceful farmer who is ends up joining the Confederate guerrillas when his wife and son are murdered by a band of Union soldier known as the Redlegs. When the war is over, Josey refuses to surrender with the rest of his band to the Union who are betrayed by the Union commander, Terrill (Bill McKinney). Soon a price is put on Josey's head, with every bounty hunter, rebel, criminal and huntsman wanting him. But Josey meets allies on the way as he looks to settle for a peaceful life.1976 was a great year for film because of the releases of the likes of Taxi Driver, Rocky, Network and All the President's Men. The Outlaw Josey Wales can easily stand along side them. Eastwood directs at a brisk pace but still letting us into this tough world and get to know the characters as the embark on their odyssey. The landscapes are rough and tough, you would need to very resourceful to survive. The picture is complex because they are many different factors: there are rebels still fighting the Union, The Union is on the hunt for these people, there are ex-soldier who become bounty hunters because the war is over and different Native American tribes who have different allegiances. There are some clear influences from Sergio Leone, from the colour pallet, the way the action was shot and handled and the use of close up on the eyes. The final action scene reminded me of Zulu because of the shooting from the house, whether that is deliberate or by accident I do not know, but reference Zulu is of course always good. It is both an entertaining and thoughtful film.At the beginning Eastwood shows a vulnerable side in the beginning of the film which is rare and very well done before delivering a character that embodied his Man With No Name character, a tough rogue but despite his demons is a decent man. John Vernon plays an interesting character in the form of Fletcher because he is a reluctant villain, forced to work with the bad guys and knows it is either him or Josey. He was a more complex character and more sympathetic. The acting throughout is strong, there is complex characterisation and characters do actually change during the course of the film.The Outlaw Josey Wales is a great Western, able to match the likes of The Dollars Trilogy and Unforgiven. It was the start of what was going to be a great career as a director for Mr. Eastwood. The only thing left to say is that it has an 18 rating in the UK but now it would possibly get away with a 15 now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's outstanding revenge western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many fans regard THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES as Eastwood's best western, although for me it's a toss-up between this, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY and UNFORGIVEN. All three of them are utterly brilliant in their own way, but OUTLAW has a special kind of atmosphere all of its own. It's a film that brims with power, painting a picture of a violent and bygone age, a lawless world in which the next traveller along the road might just as well rob and kill you as pass the time of day.On the face of it, this film has a standard revenge story in which Eastwood relentlessly tracks (and is tracked by) the mob who killed his wife and son. But there's so much more to it than that. This is a thematic film detailing life, loss, death and loyalty, while exploring aspects of the old West from the point of view of Native American characters, who are always handled with dignity. Another thing, often missing from Eastwood's other westerns, is the humour, which offsets the violence nicely. The running joke with the spitting tobacco is among the funniest things I can remember witnessing in a movie.Eastwood is excellent in his dual role as director and star, and Philip Kaufman's screenplay is as gutsy as it is compelling. The film looks splendid, bringing to life the remoteness and character of the wilderness locales, and is populated by a sterling cast of whom Chief Dan George is the best: one of those character actors who makes scene-stealing look like an effortless pastime. Altogether an excellent little film made with real heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's Finest Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is known for his role in the TV series, Rawhide. After his directorial debut in his first western, High Plains Drifter, he decides to make another western, but this time, it was a hit to success. Now, he is at it again in The Outlaw Josey Wales. Eastwood plays the outlaw Josey Wales, a man who's family is killed by Union soldiers. So, he gangs up by guerrillas soldiers during the Civil War era. What Eastwood make out of a western is his character's traits. He explains that a man's land is fresh in its pride of glory, revenge and poverty. He does the same thing in Unforgiven, which won the Best Picture in 1993. In my words, The Outlaw Josey Wales is a great western before Eastwood's Unforgiven before because he does the same thing, with different character and personality traits for their own point of view. His camera work is also a great piece of direction that he have that is really special to him and the movie himself. All in all, The Outlaw Josey Wales is a great western with great direction from Eastwood and himself as a actor. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that cuts close to the bone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare when a film made from a book turns out to be better than the book. I couldn't finish "Gone to Texas" I found it so boring and pointless. Then Eastwood made this film from it. I think it's his first masterpiece. Much better than "Unforgiven" which I found to be rather slow in places. I have a colorful family history and this was one of the first, and still one of the best, films ever made about a place and time that I'm very familiar with at a personal level. Apart from that fact it's a classic revenge tale with all the overtones of Classical Greek Tragedy. A wronged and damaged man goes on his quest for personal justice and nearly reaches mythical status. When the vehicle for his quest ends, he chooses to continue on alone. He then finds himself forced by circumstances encountered along the way to try to outrun himself and leave his terrible past behind. But, of course, that past is hot on his heels in a quest for vengeance all it's own. Some may call it just a western. It's much, much more than that. I think it's one of the finest historical character studies ever caught on film. Eastwood has often been called a limited actor. Maybe he is. But when the perfect roll for his ability is there, he not only can scare the daylights out of you, but he can also touch your soul. And he does it here. You don't have to be a Civil War War buff to enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a western nut. This is great movie making by a very talented guy with steely eyes. The touches of detail, historical, psychological, and emotional are all there. This was one of the early films in which Eastwood had all the say so in making. He's not made a bad or so-so film since. It's a great film and should become a classic with the passage of a little more time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the coolest westerns ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I would have to choose the finest western of the 70's, choice between "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "High plains drifter" (released four years earlier) would be an extremely hard one to make - practically impossible. Both of these movies are brilliant, gorgeous, remarkable masterpieces and for a high-class Eastwood freak like myself overwhelming blessings from heaven. Maybe I'll just settle for simply saying that the divine Eastwood directed and starred in two of the greatest westerns of the decade in question. "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is a phenomenal movie - it represents the very cream of the 70's filmmaking. Characters are peculiar, plot is inventive and Clint is in the role I love seeing him - the cool, tough, unshakeable and hard-boiled hero. Sergio Leone and Don Siegel influences are well in view. Just a little detail I adore: "The Outlaw Josey Wales" includes one of my favorite Eastwood one-liners - "Dying ain't much of a living boy". If you want to see truly a special western, try this one. Miraculously wonderful experience. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, The Outlaw Josey Wales ranks as one of the best films of its genre. Clint is terrific in the lead role with fantastic support, in particular from Chief Dan George (as "Lone Watie") and John Vernon (as "Fletcher"). The film contains many memorable scenes, great "one-liners", and photography and direction is first class. If there is any one out there who has not yet seen it, I urge you to go down to your local video/DVD rental shop and treat yourself to an excellent evenings entertainment! I have watched it on countless occasions and have truly never tired of it. I have just bought the DVD, complete with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack and I'm very pleased with the sound quality in particular.

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's turning point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not "the last of the traditional Westerns," this film is certainly among the last, and certainly the best of the last. All of the obligatory elements of the traditional Western - larger than life hero, blazing final shoot-out, horse chases, Indian troubles, etc. - are here; but Eastwood has added some important revisionist Western touches that remind us we ain't ever going back to the days of Roy Rogers or even the "Man With No Name" Spaghetti Western films. The hue of the film thus casts an elegiac shadow over the undeniable heroism of the main character - his war is over, both really and symbolically, and he is just in the process of waking up to that fact.The weakest part of the film is its dialog, which never quite reaches the majesty that Eastwood is clearly looking for it. But this is largely compensated for by crisp performances, a marvelously quirky story, beautiful camera-work, and an excellent musical score.The editing, too, may leave some feeling unsatisfied; but it is very much part of its era, and there are moments when it reaches real poignancy, especially in the ranch scenes toward the end.This was very much a turning point film for Eastwood; critics had fallen in love with him for "Play Misty for Me," when they suddenly realized they had a young director who actually knew how to make a film. But that film has neither the meat nor the potatoes we find in this. The depths of this director are not here yet fully sounded, but we can see that they exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After his family is killed by a band of cutthroats secretly employed by the Union Army, farmer Josey Wales goes out to fight for the Confedarcy with a guerrilla unit. After the war is over and his unit surrenders to the Union they are killed as traitors despite peacefully giving up their arms. Josey Wales sets out for revenge.The film explores a poignant topic, one that Clint Eastwood recently returned to with his back-to-back war features of 2006, how a country is affected by war. How people in and around it are changed willingly, unwillingly and incidentally. In a good move the film spares the audience historical background and just settles on developing its characters which gives a real connection with what is going on.However, the film's pace is too slow. Some scenes just drag and drag. Granted that this isn't an action movie so breakneck pacing is not expected and would even be silly, but there could be many trims here and there for a brisker presentation of the same thing at no expense of the message or story.That aside, the historical message which still has relevance today, makes the film worth watching. --- 7/10Rated PG, very generously, for violence. Not recommended for viewers under 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Must See" for History Buffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an accurate portrayal of the incredible abuses that common citizens of our nation endured at the hands of Lincoln's armed thugs during the War for Southern Independence. An incredibly strong performance by Clint Eastwood, with outstandingly empathetic direction. For anyone who enjoyed this movie, I would recommend the recently published book, "Manse", which chronicles the life of Manse Jolly, of Anderson SC. The book is a historic novel, and his life closely parallels the tragic life of the fictional Josie Wales. This movie, like many others that deal with the War Between the States, is a composite of the life and times of many who were involved in this tragic conflict. Eastwood did himself proud with his attention to detail, and with casting in this movie. The casting of Chief Dan George was genius, as he is a descendant of a Cherokee native American chief, who was the last Confederate general to surrender at the conclusion of the war. In a historic context, this movie goes a long way towards demonstrating the conflict of "total war", which was adopted by the Union at the outset of the conflict. This doctrine, in which civilians are legitimate targets of armed forces, was counter the the seventeenth-century European code of warfare, which expressly prohibited targeting civilians. The sensitivity that Eastwood has shown in directing this movie adds greatly to this movie. It is truly one of the best westerns, and war movies, I have ever seen. In summary, a very well acted and produced movie, which is a "must see" for history buffs and those who study the War Between the States.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid western with nice touches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing his wife and children killed and his house burnt by Union soldiers peaceful farmer Josey Wales is hardened for revenge he joins a group of renegades. However when the Civil War ends Josey's group is betrayed into surrender and are killed. Josey escapes and is branded an outlaw. As he tries to get away he becomes more and more hunted but begins to gather together a group of misfits as he tries to leave it all behind ? reminding him why he is running in the first place.Despite being a little too long this is a good western from Eastwood who also showed that he can direct a good film (despite the odd blip beforehand). The film starts out as a standard revenge-western with all the usual clichés of killed family etc. However at some point it changes to a more genial tone where, although Wales is still being hunted, he is also unwittingly gathering a foster family of misfits around him. While the revenge core is still there, this funnier theme adds value to the film and makes it much more entertaining.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The film does last a little too long considering and some of the shoot outs are silly. I know that Wales is supposedly ruthless but it does get a little thin when he repeatedly can take out gangs of men without getting scratched. The sad result of this is that the fights do lack excitement and tension ? the climatic fight should have been thrilling where instead it is a bit by the numbers.Eastwood is good. Not only does he act the tough side well but he is good at the lighter stuff when required. Chief George is funny in support although the rest sort of come and go. The bad guys of the piece make some impression (specifically Wales' commander) but really have too little screen time to make us hate them enough.Overall this is not one of his best westerns but it is still quite good. The film neither manages to be hilariously funny or action packed ? but it does manage to fall somewhere in-between and is a nice mix. Not without flaws but an enjoyable western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had a favorite among Clint Eastwood westerns it's a tie between Joe Kidd and The Outlaw Josey Wales. If I was planning a personal Clint Eastwood festivals, these two would be my western choices.Clint's a bitter man in this film and how he became The Outlaw Josey Wales is part of the story here. He's like John Wayne's Ethan Edwards from The Searchers, he doesn't believe in surrendering. Not after Union irregular Redlegs murdered his family and burned his farm to the ground. Before the first shot was fired on Fort Sumter, the war was being fought by irregular partisans for several years in Missouri. It was a key border state and both the Union and the Confederacy made claims to its loyalty.When one of Clint's fellow raiders, John Vernon, sells out the band after Appomatox, Clint and a wounded Sam Bottoms escape and travel south. Bottoms eventually dies of his wound, but Eastwood keeps both finding fellow vagabonds to travel with. He also keeps running into people who want to collect that large bounty on his head that keeps growing after Clint deals with them in the usual Eastwood manner.The relationship between Eastwood and Bottoms is very interesting. It's like the one with Clint and Jeff Bridges in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot without the sexual overtones. Bottoms gives an extremely touching performance, he was my favorite in the film.Before Clint knows it he's collected himself quite a motley crew of wanderers who coalesce and form a community. And like it or not, he's become the focal point of that community, almost the way James Stewart did for the folks of Bedford Falls in It's A Wonderful Life.Chief Dan George becomes part of the group, a full blooded Cherokee who fought on the Confederate side. Most of the Indian nations did just that, those who were settled in the Indian territory which later became Oklahoma. Eastwood had a very good eye for historical accuracy.In fact that eye served him well as the director of The Outlaw Josey Wales as well. The whole tone of The Outlaw Josey Wales reflects in the cinematography and the performances of the players. Clint did a great job in capturing the mood and feel of the devastation of the South after the Civil War. Gone With The Wind did that, but that dealt with the planter class whereas The Outlaw Josey Wales deals with people who never owned any slaves, couldn't have afforded them if they wanted to own them. It's part of what makes the film so poignant in its way, much more so than Clint Eastwood's films normally are.In a decade which certainly saw fewer and fewer westerns being made, The Outlaw Josey Wales is one of the two or three best to come out of the Seventies. It's definitely in the top ten of Clint Eastwood's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aftermath of the "Hard war" within the Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caught in the middle of the Kansas-Missouri Border Wars (a sub chapter in the US Civil War, also known as the "Hard War" for its brutality and ruthlessness), Josey Wales joins a Confederate (Missouri) guerilla group to exact revenge on the Union (Kansas) soldiers who burned his farm and killed his wife and children. Wales fights with great success but his efforts are for naught, as the Union eventually wins the war. In the week that the news of the Confederate surrender at Appomatox arrives in Missouri, Wales and his men are asked to surrender by one of their officers. Most of the men agree. Wales, untrusting, stays in the hills and watches what happens to his men. His lack of trust is well founded, as once the Missourians are disarmed, they are led to execution in front of a Gatlin Gun (early version of the machine gun). Wales comes down to help his men and the rest of the movie begins as Wales seeks sanctuary (as many Confederates did) in Mexico as he is relentlessly pursued by a Union Captain.Along the way, Wales meets and helps what grows to be an unlikely band of outcasts and "losers" who have been trampled and nearly destroyed by those (usually the "authorities") stronger than them.</fullReview>

The plot often fails to make sense or rise above a general "these are sum bad dudes" mentality; all the villains are one dimensional monsters bent on raping and pillaging. The Indian characters verge on racist parody and the film never seems to decide if its a comedy or a serious drama. Indeed, I frequently find myself wondering if they intended it to be funny--but im never quite sure. It's so terrible I almost find it entertaining in the vein of Troma team films or stuff like Repo Man. Just surprisingly bad.</fullReview>

No one is faster, tougher, smarter, or delivers better one liners than Mr. Josey Whales. "You boys gonna pull them pistols or whistle Dixie." Eastwood made a lot of great westerns that I wish had blu ray quality. But out of all of them, The Outlaw Josey Whales ranks number one. What a great supporting cast too.

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a Clint Eastwood's best classic western masterpiece film with a ton of great one liners , ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) is another Clint Eastwood's direct debut after the success of High Plains Drifter (1974), The Outlaw Josey Wales is another western classics and Clint Eastwood's second best masterpiece that he directed! I love this film and it is my fifth favorite Clint Eastwood western movie. This is one in my top 5 Eastwood western films. I just love this movie to death and I love the story and the actors that it is in this film. Without any doubt, it is clearly one of the best westerns ever done, with a ton of great one liners! "you gonna draw those pistols, or whistle Dixie?". Clint is THE man! This is simply a superb western flick. The writing, acting, direction, production, It's just plain old solid in all aspects. And of course there's the classic one-liners that Clint's characters have been known for: "Aren't we gonna bury them guys, Josie"? asks the kid. "Buzzards gotta eat, same as worms" replies Josie. Classic Clint.Plot: An ex-Confederate soldier who returns home after the war to find his family murdered by a rogue group of Unionists. Refusing to surrender, he sets off on a path of lethal revenge, pitting him against his former commander.This is a classic western film set on the old wild west , the plot stars off after the end of the Civil war in USA, a soldiers that his family was murdered by the Union soldiers, doesn't surrender and flees all his friends dies by the end of war and they are double crossed. Josey Wales becomes an outlaw, who has to run away, he is pursed by Union soldiers and bounty hunters who want's him dead. This was the first time we see Sondra Locke working together with Clint Eastwood, she was his girlfriend during that time. They made 7 movies together and this was their first film together. Sondra started even in Sudden Impact (1983) in the fourth Dirty Harry franchise, she played Harry's love interest. Sudden Impact (1983) was their last film they worked together before they broke up in 1989. Still the movie has everything that I love about westerns, bounty killers, outlaws, union soldiers, Indians and a tons of shootouts.Everyone does amazing job, the pacing and acting is superb. No CGI or shaky cam, It is a film of portraying of how the old west really was. Clint Eastwood's "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is a strange and daring Western that brings together two of the genre's usually incompatible story lines. On the one hand, it's about a loner, a man of action and few words, who turns his back on civilization and lights out for the Indian nations. On the other hand, it's about a group of people heading West who meet along the trail and cast their destinies together. We meet his character, Josey Wales, just after the Civil War. He's an unreconstructed Southerner, bitter about the atrocities he's witnessed, refusing to surrender. When Northern troops cold-bloodily murder some of his comrades, he mows down the Yankees with a Gatling gun and becomes a fugitive. So far, we're on familiar ground; Eastwood plays essentially the same character he's been developing since the Dollar Westerns. He says little, keeps his face in the shadows, has an almost godlike personal invulnerability, and lives by a code we have to intuit because he'd die rather than explain it aloud.Eastwood's skill before and behind the camera connected with audience for it's humor and tenderness as well as its hair-trigger action. The editing is outstanding, the score is awesome. This is a Great film, However while this film may be one of my favorite westerns, my favorite is always and forever For a Few Dollars More. The dialogue as well as the camera angles, where superb. This movie is a great expression of western life. It speaks on so many levels yet retains its purity in telling a story of a man who lost his whole identity because the actions of cruel men in a war he did not start. Josey Wales is a man set on a path of reckoning and vengeance for the family and life he lost.Overall: I love this movie and it get's a perfect 10 by me. It is my fourth favorite Eastwood Western film that I will always watch it. The Outlaw Josey Wales is a 1976 American revisionist Western DeLuxe Color and Panavision film set during and after the American Civil War.

		<shortDescription>A Missouri farmer's past dictates his future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed and starring Clint Eastwood, The Outlaw Josey Wales is deemed by some as one of the last exceptionally good Westerns. Wales(Eastwood) is happy to farm his land in Missouri; but when his wife and young son are murdered by Union marauders, led by Captain Terrill(Bill McKinney), Wales is content with nothing less than revenge. His desire to be a lone killer is tempered by his thoughts of needing family and friends. Wales is quiet and is quick to blow away anyone who crosses him. The death he deals soon loses the look of revenge and appears to be just for the hell of it. Josey earns near-mythic status as a killer...a celebrated killer. But it is not like he doesn't earn friendship and support.The cast also includes: Sam Bottoms, Joyce Jameson, Chief Dan George, John Vernon, Will Sampson, Sheb Wooley, Sondra Locke and Royal Dano.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(63%) Without doubt a Eastwood movie. The plot is simple, the characters are simple, the direction is very unfussy and it tells its story well. This is a 70's PG so expect a fair amount of violence, a couple of rape scenes, and a message that if people wrong you then bloody vengeance is the only answer, not to mention a heck of a lot of spitting on a poor dog's head. The pacing isn't exactly sharp, but there's at least a realistic, gritty edge throughout. And old Clint plays an old west wronged man like no other, and it's clear that he has learned a thing or two from all those spaghetti westerns. Overall a good watch that all true fans should track down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of my all time personal favorites and it is my favorite all time western picture. The characters are perfectly cast especially Chief Dan George as Lone Watie. There is humor as well as drama and action. There are subtle aspects to the film such as the main character's progression in areas I will not mention as to not spoil it. This is certainly a subject to keep in mind when viewing. Lots of cool characters such as country singer Sheb Wooley and Les Lesser who later went on to play Uncle Leo in "Seinfeld." The scenery is fantastic in the locations. Another point is the accuracy of the feelings of the southerners in dealing with Northern occupation during the Civil War. Guerilla fighters were prominent on both sides and this is well depicted in the movie. There are many nuances such as authenticity to costumes, speech and the locations that make the film believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo, Mr Eastwood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This film was simply fantastic. I decided to watch it as I had seen Pale Rider &amp; Unforgiven and having enjoyed both those films, I decided to give The Outlaw Josey Wales a try and boy am I glad that I did; Josey Wales (Eastwood) is a farmer living in Missouri who finds that his life is turned upside down when a group of Union soldiers set fire to his home, consequently killing all his family. With the help of a confederate Guerilla unit, he sets out to get revenge on those responsible for killing his family; As revenge films go, this is one of the the best and it is also one of the best westerns that I have seen. Eastwood is in his element as Josey Wales and it's arguably one of his best performances. Nobody does icy cool or gritty like Clint Eastwood. One aspect of Outlaw Josey Wales that I did like was the thought and detail that has been put into the script; whilst Josey Wales is a sharp shooter who is far quicker than his adversaries, we see on more than one occasion that he has to outsmart his enemies in order to get the better of them (as you'll see some of the tricks he comes up with are ingenious). It was great that we see that Josey Wales had some vulnerability as this helped to create tension and also meant that the audience could connect with his character. Another aspect which I liked was the humour that was put into this film. In all honesty, I found myself laughing on several occasions throughout the film (sometimes on more occasions than films I've seen that are actually billed as 'comedies').Minor criticisms for OJW would be the length of the film (it is a tad long in my opinion) and I also felt that the ending was a bit weak. I would strongly recommend watching this film (if you enjoyed Pale Rider and Unforgiven, then you'll definitely enjoy OJW). In my opinion, this is better than those films and is the best western I've ever seen. It's also one of the better revenge films that I've seen and Clint gives one of his best performances. Simply outstanding!</fullReview>

There is no praise that hasn't already been said that I can add to. There is a picture of Clint as Josey circulating online quoting him as saying;''I have a strict gun-control policy; IF THERE'S A GUN AROUND, I WANT TO BE IN CONTROL OF IT."I just have to note that Josey Wales wasn't a bad outlaw by any stretch of the imagination. He just DIDN'T GO ALONG WITH BAD LAWS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ENFORCE THEM!Perhaps the main theme of this motion picture is really morality -- standing up for what you believe in, following through until the very end no matter how many trials and tribulations present obstacles in the way of the final goal. If you persevere, in the end you will prevail.</fullReview>

He praises the actor-director, saying, "Eastwood is such a taciturn and action-oriented performer that it's easy to overlook the fact that he directs many of his movies -- and many of the best, most intelligent ones. Here, with the moody, gloomily beautiful, photography of Bruce Surtees, he creates a magnificent Western feeling." All I know is that this film taught me that all people in Missouri are known to be killers of women and children. I will be sure to stay away from there!</fullReview>

But if your looking for those classic Eastwood lines, there are none better than the one's in this flick. The greatest of them all could be "Are you going to pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?" The gunfights are great-sure the movie lasts a while and the scenes with Sandra Locke are fairly boring-but overall this a great movie. Chief Dan George is hilarious. The Good the bad and the Ugly is great, the soundtrack makes it the best of all time-but Josey Wales has that quality that many will enjoy more. It kind of reminds me of Led Zeppelin. Sure "Stairway" is the greatest piece ever written, but there are plenty that would rather hear "Ten Years Gone" or "Tangerine."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood directs and stars in this interesting story of Missouri farmer Josey Wales, who has his family killed by Northern soldiers in the American Civil War, and then grieved and enraged, joins a confederate guerrilla unit, only to have to surrender when their side loses the war. However, despite the surrender, the unit is massacred, though Josey escapes, and not only becomes a wanted man, but something of a legend, as he finds himself the leader of an ever growing group of castoffs and refugees.Though a bit too long and at times uneven, this is otherwise a first-rate western, with many memorable lines delivered by not only Clint, but costars Chief Dan George and John Vernon. Morally ambivalent(not a flattering portrait of the North!), but still an appealing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the height of his career, Eastwood shines as outlaw Joesy Wales. The Civil War has ended, but the feud hasn't. John Vernon stars as Fletcher, who is unwillingly signed up to go catch the man along with a pack of renegades. As Josey runs, he picked up a few misfits that somehow feel drawn to him, one of which is none other than Sondra Locke, who at the time was married to Eastwood. What really grabs the audience is the landscapes used in the film. You go from a luscious earthy green seen in Missouri to the desert wastelands of Texas. Since the passing of the legendary John Wayne in the early 70s, Eastwood takes the helm of directing the remaining of his westerns that would eventually fade by the 90s. Certainly work a look if you like westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Best Western Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not done with my ranking of the top 100 Westerns, but "Josey Wales" will be in the top five, maybe second after "The Searchers".Here's what I liked:- Clint's best role ever by a long shot. He's at the top of his game here. A guy's guy. I've never been drawn into a character and cared about a character so much in a Western. This is the perfected Western loner, without all of Leone's unrealistic opera.- While we're talking about Clint, can we acknowledge that this great, great leading man was also a highly skilled and important artist behind the camera? Does he really have a peer? Charlie Chaplin?- One of the best collection of bit characters ever assembled. Each represents a different aspect of the West's colorful social texture. Each brilliantly played. Redlegs, Indians, ferry boat operators, mountain men, carpetbaggers, bounty hunters, snake oil salesmen, calvary soldiers, bartenders, Mexican rancheros, more Indians, saloon girls, homesteaders, commancheros. You wonder how he packed it all in.- A great Western doesn't get stuck in one place, but keeps moving restlessly through the vast formless spaces. "Wales" does this to perfection. Even better "Wales" moves from East to West, just as the rest of the country was doing at the time.- May have more memorable quotes than any other movie.- Flawless thematically, as the bitter alienated loner finds redemption by banding together with other societal outcasts.- A multitude of great gunfight scenes: the opening Gatling gun shootout, escaping capture by the mountain men, the shootout at bar where they save the Indian girl, the shootout with the four soldiers in the Texas town, the shootout with the Commancheros, the bounty hunter in the bar, the standoff at the homestead. Did I leave one out?- Clever and effective comic relief throughout. Chief Dan George almost steals the movie.- Perhaps the best use of Civil War themes in a Western. Only "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and "Dances With Wolves" compare.- Fully sympathetic revisionist Indian point of view presented without becoming condescending, melodramatic or maudlin.- Very well done meeting at the end with Commanche chief Ten Bears- John Vernon is a rock as Wale's "frenemy" Fletcher.- My favorite scene: "Well, Mr. Carpetbagger. We got something' in this territory called the Missouri boat ride."The movie did fall short in some respects:- The heavy, the redleg Captain Terrill, was poorly developed. Clint should have used a more charismatic actor and expanded the role. We don't get enough catharsis at the end when Wales kills Terrill because we don't know Terrill well.- Sandra Locke is a weak romantic lead. If only Clint had got a girlfriend back then who was a better actress and was sexier.- He didn't go out of his way to film any really spectacular landscapes. There could have been more dramatic backgrounds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's seek and destroy mission is a post-Civil War western that takes him far and wide in his search for the killers of his wife and son. Eastwood makes the transition from peaceful farmer plowing his fields to a quick draw avenger in this adventure that has the feel of a matinée serial, owing to his many close escapes from Union soldiers, bounty hunters and assorted ruffians. Eastwood has company during his odyssey, namely young Sam Bottoms, Chief Dan George and a squaw as he closes in on his quarry. The film has excellent color, striking scenic vistas and several gun fights where Eastwood never misses with his lightning-fast draw. Sondra Locke is Eastwood's love interest and John Vernon is a shadowy figure who knows the man Josey Wales is looking for. The film has a few comic touches and doesn't take itself too seriously. This movie is enjoyable to watch and is perfect escapist fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "The Outlaw Josie Wales" - and that old-fashioned use of 'The' seems to me to mark the attention to detail quite apparent in the movie - I couldn't believe the depth of character and plot. It has everything, from the pathos of the boy recounting the story of his father embroidering a handkerchief for him before he went off to the Civil War, to the remarkable action scenes and the superb acerbic comments from the old girl looking for her dead son's property where they all end up. This is film making of the first degree.Josie Wales himself develops as the story unfolds, from being forced into the war for revenge (see, for example, the magnificent "Shenandoah" made some years earlier, which still resonates with me), and turns radically bellicose, only coming to terms with his life after a long search, and the determination to live in peace with the Indians."I don't believe no six pistoleros gunned down Josie Wales. ... I'll go and tell him - the war's over." Magnificent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen that many Clint Eastwood westerns (outside of the Leone films, Unforgiven, Two Mules for Sister Sara, and High Plains Drifter), but I remember this one from about a month and a half ago, and like Eastwood's best, I got drawn into the story, and into the sympathies of the lead character, which I felt was the strong-point under the actor/director's control: a farmer, who's moved on from his old days, is living in the woods with his family. When a group of bandits come and burn down his house and kill his family, he gets devastated. Devastated enough, that is, to join up with a group of soldiers, left off from the confederacy, who are still after the union even though the war's over. Soon Josey Wales becomes an Outlaw, and is still on the track to seek vengeance on those who destroyed his life, but he can try to get back on track somehow.I wouldn't say this is a masterpiece of a Western- a couple of minutes I was hoping the film would get along to what I was hoping would happen next. However, I was more often than not pleased greatly by the skill and grace Eastwood had with telling his story, and indeed in this film the viewer gets a chance to see Eastwood in a slightly different performance than in his past films (for one thing he does go through an emotional shake-em-up before the opening credits). And there are some good, nearly breath-taking gun fights to go along with it.</fullReview>

If I had a nickel for every western that told of the noble Southern cause I could equip my own Ku Klux Klan brigade, just like the one of Asa Earl Carter who wrote the piece of crap, racist fantasy this movie was based upon. This really explains a lot about Mr. Eastwood and what a racist jerk and fascist he has been throughout his career.I am so sick of Dixie filth talking about how great the south is and how blah, blah, blah. How the North were just a bunch of raping, murdering scum and this goes back?at least?until Gone with the Wind. Learn some history, people. The South was a land without a middle class. It was ruled by a small, elite group of rich racists who were slave holders. Slavery was the issue that divided our nation and that is that. Either you are for slavery or adamantly opposed to it. The rich gentry had the poor white trash of the south fight their war for them, much like we do today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisionism=Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general message of the film, delivered in its clearest form from the mouth of Chief Dan, is that civilisation is bad, non-civilisation is good. Here civilisation is synonymous with white. It is an early example of the Hollywood revisionism which would lead to Dances with wolves and Avatar. From the get-go everything here is painted literally in the most black and white terms, where white is evil. The Union commits atrocities. White men are murderous, traitorous, women beaters and rapists. Even Commancheros turn out to be mainly whites with a few token Mexicans and blacks to form a Hollywood rainbow coalition. By contrast, the southerners are sentimentalised and Indians idealised. It is conveniently forgotten that the south was pro-slavery. The natives are either amiably comical (chief Dan), hardy and self sufficient (Geraldine Keams) or noble savages (Will Sampson and his band). The few good whites redeem themselves by living in the wilderness far away from civilised society. The machine-gunning down of southerner prisoners by the union near the start brings to mind similar scenes in films like the Great Escape. I cannot speak for the historical veracity of such things but as a piece of film making it is heavy handed. Other heavy handed scenes follow, hammering out the basic message in the most unsubtle terms. That's not to say there are not very good things here. Chief Dan in particular is highly engaging.There are some memorable images and much good dialogue. The great speech near the end when Wales becomes a blood brother of the Comanche chief in which people can get on with people without governments is a great libertarian tract. No doubt Eastwood was drawn to this aspect of the script, since it is a familiar trope in his work. I find it odd though, that the blatant propaganda contained here is so little commented on. Perhaps Eastwood's fans simply gave him the benefit of the doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is just...great! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always, and, will always, respect how Clint Eastwood portrays characters who 'know' that they are doing what is right; but, I dislike how those characters always have to prove that to others.In this movie, as Clint was in the "Man With No Name" 'Spaghetti Western' series; and, the "Dirty Harry" series; and, even all the way up to "Gran Torino,"...this noble "AMERICAN" actor/character(s) also has to 'prove' that what he's doing, he's doing for all the right reasons.No one should have to 'prove' goodness,' and, if they must, they're usually up against a patch of judicial, political, and, crooked scum!So many people frown upon those who actually fight for what is right and say "Let the law handle it." Well, if the law was handling it, there would be no 'IT.' But...what if it's "The Law" that's committing the crimes, as is the case here? Who can you go to? Who can you rely on besides yourself?In this movie, Clint portrays a meek Missouri farmer who minds his own business and lives a quiet life with his wife and son on a farm (much like Michael Landon in "Little House On The Prairie"), until a band of Northern brigands ruins that. Then, after losing everything, the meek farmer is recruited as a Confederate soldier; and, then, the same a-holes who ruined his life blame "HIM" for fighting back against them!?!? This is why I always liked, and, always will like, and, respect, the 'underdog' characters that Clint Eastwood plays.Everyone loves a hero (largely in secret) - but, very few want to be one. Just as everyone nowadays supports US Troops overseas - but, very few want to be one!?!?I believe that even before I could walk, I was a Clint Eastwood fan.MM/USN 1985-1993</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another quality Eastwood western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because he is such an iconic movie star it's sometimes easy to forget just how good a film director Clint Eastwood is. In fact in several of his best films he not only starred but directed as well. I think it's only fair to say that it's a somewhat impressive feat to make such a mark in front and behind the camera at the same time. The Outlaw Josey Wales is in fact Eastwood's fifth film as director/star, so even back in the mid 70's he was very established behind the camera in Hollywood.This was one of his westerns, a genre that he did seem to have a particular fine touch with. It's sort of a road movie in many ways, seeing as it is about a westward journey undertaken by Eastwood's character; a trip that is punctuated with a series of encounters and in which he picks up an eccentric and increasing number of companions on the way. To this end, it's more episodic than most other Eastwood westerns. It's set in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The story is propelled by one Confederate man's quest for revenge, when his family is massacred by renegade Yankee troops. He refuses to surrender to the U.S. army and after a bloody skirmish is labelled an outlaw by the authorities and is pursued by a posse and various bounty hunters.The above storyline does make this sound like a typical Eastwood western but this one is a bit more warm-hearted than the others. Despite the revenge theme, the focus is often more on forging a peaceful life. The increasing number of people who join him in his march west form a rag tag 'family' which is effectively a substitute for murdered one. This allows him to help protect them and feel a constructive part of society again. Through his quest for vengeance he ultimately rediscovers his humanity. All of this adds an extra dimension to proceedings. Moreover, Eastwood's character Josey Wales starts out as a humble farmer with an actual name, making him more realistic and removed from the mythic gunslingers Eastwood played in the Dollars Trilogy and his own films High Plains Drifter and Pale Rider. On top of that the story-line also allows for comment on varied subjects such as war and race relations, so there is quite a bit of scope in this one. But fear not, there is still room for plenty of traditional western violence! There are lots of gun-fights where Clint blasts away a series of highly unpleasant individuals. On the other side of the spectrum, there is one scene which features an attempted gang rape, which naturally was very disturbing. But on the whole, this is a 70's western that incorporates many different strands of the genre and ultimately adds up to another success for Eastwood both as star and director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I have to say is: I am not a huge fan of Western movies but I do know a great Western film when I see one - The Outlaw Josey Wales IS a fantastic Western film that is most definitely worth viewing. (And, again, I do not say that about many Western films).The Outlaw Josey Wales captured my attention - I felt I was carried back in time, a time where the Western World was in fact wild and battles took place to govern the people. The Outlaw Josey Wales has a good story to tell about the governing of the people during the days after the American Civil War.Outstanding performances, sets, costuming, cinematography, acting and story. This is a must see film for fans of Western films - and great for those of us (like myself) that are not into many Western movies.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what it is but ol' Grizzle-guts must be getting to me in my old age. For years, I've either scorned or avoided Clint Eastwood's movies derriding them as slow-paced, minimalist and clichéd, but I'm gradually coming round to his style, because this seemed to me a classic western from the old school.With Eastwood himself, naturally, as the loner with a grudge, there's not much to the plot as his title character seeks revenge on the Union renegades who've killed his family and burned down his house; you won't be surprised to learn that he duly catches them up and metes out his expected summary justice. What sets it apart however is the assembly of eccentric personages he meets and interacts with on his crusade, including a wizened old Indian, a downtrodden Indian squaw and a haughty Southern Lady and her cat-got-her-tongue straight-laced daughter.The various shoot-outs are excitingly rendered and play well off the film's more ruminative elements, while there's a fair smattering of earthy humour too, none more so than when the Indian girl selects her unexpected, shall-we-say, nighttime companion. The cinematography is fine and while the film unfolds at Eastwood's trademark measured-speed, his direction is sure and down-to-earth.As "family-man goes native", Eastwood spits out his lines with as much disdain as his perennial chewing-tobacco, but gradually returns to humanity through his experiences with the band of gypsies he encounters. Yes, his endless ingenuity, not to mention luck, apparent invulnerability to harm and ability to overturn the most improbable of odds are hard to credit but we'd have had a much shorter film if events had taken their natural course earlier on. No, I really enjoyed this stirring western and can't deny Eastwood's ability to make us empathise with bloodthirsty, seemingly unappealing characters who seemingly speak in monosyllables and work outside the law, although that probably owes more to my outlook to authority figures than true cinematic appreciation, sorry Clint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good revenge Western from Clint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Outlaw Josey Wales" Eastwood directs an entertaining and fairly conventional western revenge tale set in the aftermath of the American Civil War. It certainly holds the viewers interest, even if it strays into cliché at times.At the beginning of the movie we see an idyllic scene as Josey (Eastwood) and his young son work in the Missouri fields. However tragedy strikes as a militia attached to the Union army attacks their homestead. Wales is knocked unconscious but survives. He awakes to find his home destroyed and his family slaughtered. He resolves to avenge their death and joins a Confederate guerrilla group, seeing this as the best way to find leader of the gang that killed his family. He has become an excellent soldier and is soon one of the senior members of the group.However the war is nearly over and the Josey's group are offered surrender terms. They all accept except for Josey, who is determined to find the men he is looking for or die in the attempt. His comrades are betrayed however and only one survives to escape with Josey. Now they are on the run, with the man he has vowed to kill leading the chase.The rest of them movie is an entertaining chase as Wales meets up with and loses companions along the way. He appears to be able to kill any number of "bad guys" simultaneously, without getting hurt himself. Perhaps Eastwood lets his ego get the better of him by bestowing the character he plays with almost superhuman powers. Directors licence I suppose you'd call it! The ending is fairly predictable but still satisfying.The cast is very good. Eastwood, as usual, seems to be playing himself. There are some excellent supporting performances, especially from Chief Dan George as a "civilised" Native American. Bill McKinney plays the bad guy with appropriate relish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood may have only won an Oscar for Best Director in 1992 with UNFORGIVEN, but he had a rehearsal back in 1976 with another great offering of the genre, THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES.With a similar structure to UNFORGIVEN (which was written initally by David Webb Peoples around the time of JOSEY WALES' release, Josey Wales (Eastwood) is Will Munny before that film opens. Having lost his wife and family in a Civil War attack, Wales is asked to sign up for the cause and enlist. However, on arrival at the registration area, he discovers a double-cross whereby his fellow enlistees are shot. Wales uses a machine gun to gun down the enemy, then goes into exile, pursued by people determined to track him down. Along the way, he meets a variety of similar exiles and together they form a bond whilst eluding their pursuers.It's as impressive as others have mentioned and a good introduction to the genre like films like WYATT EARP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I should say that this is one of my all time favorite films, maybe my favorite. Plenty of people have said great things so I won't repeat those points. The one issue that I think is important is that the historical issues raised by some are, in my opinion, of no consequence. The movie is basically about thisinnocent character who is pushed into a life of vengeance and as a fugitive,eventually rediscovers a family, reconnects in some way with civilization, and is ultimately redeemed, freed from his self destructive path. People refer to this as a tale of vengeance but I think it is a tale of Redemption. He of course no longer really belongs to civilized society though he acts as its benefactor. This is a classic western archetype (check out The Searchers, probably the greatestexample of such a character). My point is that I don't find any inaccuracies as critical to the value of this movie. Certainly there were instances of Northern atrocities. Sure, perhaps the standoff wasn't realistic but most drama is found in extra ordinary events. And I'm not even studying the smoke from the guns. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's other westerns have usually featured the "man with no name," a loner who kills all the bad guys. Josey Wales also does that, but has a reason for being like that, he's a former confederate soldier whose family was killed.Not only does the main character have a name and history to him, but the entire movie is filled with memorable characters, such as Chief Dan George's aging Cherokee, fuss-budget Grandma Sarah, and a carpetbagger in a lily white suit that gets soiled at every turn.It's also depicts the post civil war south more accurately than most movies, down to the language and firearms. It's not quite as good as "the good, the bad, and the ugly," (The ultimate western) but is highly entertaining and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midstream for Eastwood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are about three minutes of genuine pathos in this film and they come at the very end. Clint Eastwood, as the eponymous outlaw, has been pursued across half the nation by bounty hunters, law officers of various types, and Union soldiers. He's just been involved in a gunfight against impossible odds and though he and a few friends have killed all the blue bellies, Eastwood has been wounded in the upper right quadrant.His chief enemy, a viperous Redleg played by Bill McKinney, has ridden away from the fight. Eastwood follows and kills him with his own sabre. He then repairs to the dilapidated saloon for a shot of medicinal red eye before trying to make it back to his home and friends.However, after all he's been through, wounded and in pain, he finds two more men in the saloon, looking for the renegade Josey Wales. One is a stranger. The other is an old acquaintance from the Civil War, John Vernon, who has worked for the Union Army since the surrender.The few people in the saloon are friends of Eastwood's and they lie to the Union men, telling them that Josey Wales was killed dead in a Mexican shoot out. The stranger accepts the story and has one of the customers sign an affidavit to that effect, but Vernon has recognized Eastwood.Eastwood and Vernon step outside, facing each other, and Vernon says he doesn't believe the story about Wales' death. He thinks Wales is still alive and if he encounters him, he'll give him the first move. He owed him that much. Eastwood makes no move to pull any of the several guns he's always packing around. Vernon glances at Eastwood's boot and sees a few drops of blood spattering on the tip. Then Vernon -- and the viewer too -- suddenly realize the ordeal that the tight-lipped Eastwood character has endured, enough hard riding, blood, violence, loss, and murder to last a dozen lifetimes. And Vernon says that if Josey Wales isn't dead, Vernon would tell him, "The war is over." A long pause before Eastwood replies, "I guess everybody died a little in that war." Eastwood rides off towards home, slouched over in his saddle.I wanted to mention the good part, and it IS well done -- well written and directed -- because the rest of the movie doesn't live up to it. Right off the bat, the Union soldiers from Kansas raid the home of Eastwood, a peaceful farmer, burn his house and kill his wife and children. The rest of the movie is a story of revenge. Revenge is an easy motive to identify with, especially when the pillager and murderer is the evil Bill McKinney who's never played anything BUT brutal and stupid rural characters. (He was the cracker who sodomized Ned Beatty in "Deliverance.") Well, revenge is easy to understand, but it can also provide an engine for endless cruelty if one wants it to. Fritz Lang recognized this in his American movies, "The Big Heat" and "Rancho Deluxe." Eastwood pulls off some repugnant stunts here, against people who sometimes are obviously evil and sometimes not.Eastwood not only starred but directed, and his direction shows him at a sort of tipping point between Sergio Leone and Eastwood's own later films. Gigantic close ups of wet faces and glistening teeth alternate with grandiose high shots of galloping horses. Eastwood's Josey Wales is his familiar Western figure, taciturn, slightly mean, given to spitting tobacco juice on dogs, full of provocative insults. "Well? You gonna pull those guns or stand there whistlin' Dixie?" When he tries to speak in ritualized and poetic English to the Comanches, while making a peace proposal, he fails. Perfumed speech is not his forte. And when he rides off into the sunset, it's without any suggestion of remorse for the hundred or so dead bodies he's left in his wake. Sandra Locke is a fetching young blond who sounds as if she'd just graduated from Vassar. Chief Dan George is fine in everything he does. One suspects he's not acting at all, just trying to get his lines right, but they come out the way they ought to. Paula Trueman, as Granny, is splendid.One thing I'm not sure the writers intended, but the movie is anti-Union in sentiment. Not pro-Confederate, just anti-Union. Nobody connected in even the most remote way with the United States Army is any good. At best, there are four harmless, doltish youths (whom Eastwood kills). At worst, they are treacherous creeps who line up Confederate prisoners at the surrender ceremony and mow them down with Gatling guns. In an amusing scene, Chief Dan George tells Eastwood how they screwed him out of his house and killed his family too. No mention of the Cherokees owning slaves, just like the plantation owners they learned from. No mention of slavery at all. The Civil War itself is economically reduced to a fuzzy montage of battling figures and an abundance of smoke. All these scenes I've mentioned are dark, cold, and uninviting. It's not an attractive movie.It's worth catching because it has a few good minutes in it, above and beyond the appeal of the traditional violent Western. But as he edged into his 70s and now his 80s, Eastwood's output was to become far more sophisticated, far more thoughtful, at times approaching art.</fullReview>

Last action scene with the sword I said I can't take it anymore. Clint was holding wrist of the guy who held the sword. He should look like he was forced but Clint tries to grab that guy's wrist during the action. A director should shoot again that scene normally but if you are both actor and director, this will be a problem as we saw. I didn't regret because Clint was really cool and fit the role.

		<shortDescription>The Outlaw Josey Wales</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I found out this film was in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and featured one of my favourite quotes, I had to see it, directed by star Clint Eastrwood. Basically Josey Wales (Eastwood) is a farmer who has his family murdered and his home burnt to the ground near the end of the Civil War. After this he heads west becoming a renegade joining a group of rebel guerrilla fighters who fight the Union, but when Captain Fletcher (John Vernon) persuades the group to surrender, he still holds a grudge. Wales is now a wanted man, as he is killing lawmen and stuff, and a bounty of $5,000 has been placed for his capture, and he is slowly joined unwillingly by companions. These companions include elderly wily Indian/Cherokee named Lone Watie (Chief Dan George), and granddaughter Laura Lee (Sondra Locke) who he saved from a band of Comancheros. After many encounters with men with guns, including law men and men wanting the reward money, Josey and the gang face the last showdown cornered inside a ranch house, going against Captain Terrill (Bill McKinney) and his men. Also starring John Vernon as Fletcher, Paula Trueman as Grandma Sarah, Sam Bottoms as Jamie, Geraldine Keams as Little Moonlight, Woodrow Parfrey as Carpetbagger and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Will Sampson as Ten Bears. Eastwood does his usual great nearly completely quite and smooth character very well, Locke is a little irritating (as usual), and George gets his moments too. "Well you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?" is a great line from Clint, the gun play is fun to watch for Clint's fast action, and there are enough action filled moments to keep you watching, a good western. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Jerry Fielding. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

And, to some degree, "The Magnificent Seven". All of these movies will rank higher than Josey Wales.

		<shortDescription>Clint's finest hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the end of the movie there is a scene where Clint playing the eponymous Josey Wales signs a pact in blood with one of the characters. The other guy is an Indian and for him such things are a serious affair and are meant to be done with passion care and utmost concentration. Josey Wales is an outlaw who understands such things but is not a passionate fellow. So the Indian makes a huge incision in his hands while Josey just makes a small cut. Maybe I am reading too much into the whole thing but I would like to believe it is intentionally the case. And it is this attention to detail that I love about Eastwood's films. Whatever you say about the guy he can act. He can direct. And when the two go together you get to witness pure beauty on screen. Eastwood plays the character with his trademark grimace. The movie opens with him farming in the fields which interestingly would also be the opening scene of his other acting-directing masterpiece that is 'Unforgiven' He goes home and is entire home is set on fire and what other option has he got but to become an outlaw and wreak havoc on those who took everything away from.It is set in the end of the eighteenth century. America has just gotten independence and is trying to make everyone submit to its authority but is finding it hard to do. The outlaw Josey Wales is an entertaining Western as entertaining as any of the other ones but it is trying to do more and trying to say many other things. So the gunfire and gunfights might be a little on the lesser side. So if you are expecting The Good,The Bad and the Ugly you might be disappointed. If you are looking for a good movie in it's own right that you gotta give this one a shot.</fullReview>

Clint (The good), and Eli Wallach (The ugly) are nothing more than scam artists. Van Cleef (The bad) is a corrupt union sergeant that does murder for hire.They all find out about $200,000 in gold coins stolen from the union army, now hidden in a grave in a graveyard. The only problem is the location is broken up into two secrets (the name of the grave yard, and the name on the grave), and neither one of them knows both secrets.You set this against the backdrop of the Civil War. Thousands of real good men (both North, and South), fighting, and dieing each for what they believe in. We have a depiction of the hell of the Civil War, and we have these three bad guys weaseling their way through it to get to a fortune in stolen war funds.This is one of the ultimate "Anti-Hero" films of all time. The "Good Guy" doesn't always win. In this case the "Lesser" of all the evil guys wins. He's still a thief, but you find yourself rooting for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love westerns but this movie bored me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was always mixed about watching this movie. I love westerns and I love Clint Eastwood, but I hate most movies loaded with hype and I think American westerns have sucked since The Magnificent Seven. Spaghetti westerns came in the picture and made anything else seem worthless.I watched this last night for the first time, I was wanting so hard to love it and be entertained but I wasn't, I was bored and angry.The movie had so much cheesiness with the direction and the guys riding and shooting into the air in its opening credits that I felt embarrassed. The first fight scene with Clint riding into the Yankee camp with guns blazing in open range as an easy target was just bulls**t. The way the scenes jumped around at times was so hard to keep up with what was going on and who was doing what.I like Eastwood as a director and I like Phillip Kaufman as well and Eastwood replaced him so perhaps either of them could've shot those scenes that I didn't like, The majority of the movie I thought was shot great, it was just those first few scenes in the movie that were over the top sloppy.Not Eastwoods best acting, but it was good. I personally think he went from being an honest noble farmer to being a rude outlaw very quickly and I was confused, he was practicing shooting and not doing so well, he was hurt but not badly so why couldn't he shoot, was it his anger about losing his wife and child, if so could he have really went from half ass to hero in a few days, and would he have been so eager to jump in the sack with the other girl shortly after? And how did he become so notorious, was he a gunslinging outlaw before all this, perhaps this is a sequel and I don't know his back story. I think my ignorance on that may be a joke to some, but as watching this movie as an independent release and not part of a sequence of films or a sequel I really needed to know this guys back story and I didn't get it. Most westerns allow you to get a sense of a man and who he is or was, but I didn't get it here. I think of truly great westerns like Death Rides a Horse and how you know the boy worked hard and practiced hard to become great and seek his revenge, This movie posed the question...If someone shoots my family can I quickly turn into a magnificent gunslinger and seek revenge....No, I cant and this plot had loopholes for me, but I analyze the crap out of everything.I mentioned above he was rude,I think he was way too rude. Every time he spit it made me like him less, on dead outlaws it was fitting, but what did the damn dog do to him? He was just rude, but he still did a great job.The supporting cast was mixed, some did just as you would expect. Some actors stood out and were very likable. The old Native American (Dan George)was great, I heard he had trouble with his lines, but he did so great on film I could care less about technicalities off screen. John Vernon plays a wonderful jerk in all of his movies and he did well here. Will S. as Chief Ten Bears was perfect, gotta love him. Worst actor goes to Sam Bottoms. He is such a horrible actor, I am not sure where he is from, but he has a heavy accent that makes him a bad choice for many of the simple southern accents he uses in movies, this one was the worst I have seen him in. What a joke...The movie was from the mid seventies, I cant imagine anyone wanting to see a movie with a story that had been done a million times unless it had a great director, great score, acting and a nice side story to back it up. This movie was mediocre at best. I have watched many of Eastwoods movies and this isn't the worst, but it sure as hell ain't the best....3 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two words: Pure Fantasy. As the Civil War in the far West (on the Kansas/Missouri boarder) holds special interest to me, I found this film to be so unbearably bad that I couldn't finish. Yes, I know everyone hates the people who review without finishing a movie, and know too many histroical details to suspend a little belief. In that case, let me express the praise that it is the only film to my knowledge featuring Senator Lane, correctly portrayed as a brutal murderer, and Terrill, the outlaw who in real life slayed Quantrill. The boarder wars were the most horrendous part of the CW, but here we have all the attrocities on the Union side, with the Conferderates as innocent patriots. Union militia Red legs, (the worst of whom would never knowingly harm a woman or child) murder Easton's character's family, and bushwhackers taking (Glenville Dodge) surrender offer at the end of the war are Gatling gunned down (not that they had any Gatling guns out there at that time) something which didn't happen, even to the worst of the bushwhackers. Ever wonder why "Bloody Bill" Anderson, portrayed sympathetically in this film, got his nickname? He killed a dozen plus men in the Lawrence Massacre, raped a slave girl, tied dozens of scalps to his horse bridal, tought his horse to trample people, brutally murdered unarmed soldiers at Centrilia...among other things. Yeah, I know you all will hate this comment, because I myself get irritated when people point out massive plot holes in movies I enjoyed. But I wonder why Eastwood didn't just set the movie outside CW history altogether if he wasn't going to make the slightest effort to get it right. For everyone who agrees with portraying the Confederates as all nice and perfect...Well, enjoy this movie, the events featured couldn't be further from the truth. Anyone who is actually interested in an accurate portrayal of the Western Civil War, see Ride With the Devil (1999). It is an excellent, balanced, haunting film, though nobody seems to know about it. And it's even told from the Confederate perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no mercy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays "The Outlaw Josey Wales" looks kind of hokey but when it came out it no doubt was the cat's meow. Clint Eastwood, who also directed, plays a farmer whose family a group of Jayhawkers murders. So, he joins up with a traveling band to take charge. And you know that Clint shows no mercy! Clint Eastwood considers the movie an anti-war statement: despite the horrors of war, war is what forces people to be their most creative (it takes the worst possible venture for creativity to flourish). But ignoring that the movie is pretty intense, if a little silly in some scenes (the river scene looked as if it was there for comic relief). Certainly worth seeing.Also starring Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, John Vernon (Dean Wormer in "Animal House"), Paula Trueman, Sam Bottoms, Geraldine Kearns, Woodrow Parfrey, Joyce Jameson, Sheb Wooley (the singer of "The Purple People Eater") and Will Sampson (Chief in "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a long time I thought of this film as a revenge epic, but upon watching it again recently I think not, because Josey ends up being hunted. A good flick overall with some strong performances and lines, but there's much that is too unlikely to accept: i.e. the Red Legs kill his family but leave him only wounded, the Union soldiers who cross on the raft making themselves sitting ducks (to which Wales takes little advantage of by only shooting the rope rather than his helpless pursuers) and the silly shootout at the end where the hunters all get killed and one of Wales group gets hit (other than his wound). But then again maybe it's just because I'm a Yankee. Who knows?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good one of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the eponymous hero, in The Outlaw Josey Wales Clint Eastwood does what he is required to do, and of its kind the film is a winner. The trouble is that more than 30 years on, 'its kind' is looking a little dated. Eastwood, of course, made his name in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, whose at the time novel naturalistic portrayal of the smelly, dusty brutal west set a new benchmark for westerns, and any such film which subsequently set out to show the good guys in white hats, with pristine clothes and an admirable array of good manners along the lines of Shane and all those John Wayne horse operas began to look very dated indeed. From then on in, every film had to show the West as a godforsaken, dusty hell-hole, and it remained like that until when, not many years later, the western itself fell out of favour. Still, the down 'n dirty western relied just as much on cliché as the old-style films did, although at the time those clichés were new and unfamiliar and thus these films were much lauded for their 'realism'. Thirty years on they are a little more obvious: the feisty old woman who's as good as any man and can handle a shotgun, the noble Indian (make that Native American) chief, the unscrupulous politician, the young chap of comes of age, the demure young woman who falls for the hero, the hero himself who magically will survive every gunfight more or less unharmed, despite, in some cases, having at least 20 guns being fired at him. His opponents are always lousy shots. He, of course, is a great shot and his six-shooters have a never-ending supply of ammunition. As for that gritty realism, it seems rather odd that the rest of them should enjoy a midday hoedown, complete with fiddle, while Josey gets on with the work of branding the cattle. And I do doubt that in the real West the Sondra Locke character would trot around all day, every day in a pristine white dress. Not out there in the wilds she wouldn't. The Outlaw Josey Wales covers the whole range of clichés and if that is your bag, you'll like it. If you want the homespun pearls of wisdom of the kind you get in virtually every Hollywood western, this is your film. If, like me, you have grown rather weary of them, well . . . Reviewing Unforgiven for this site a month or two ago, I was rude enough to observe that, for this man at least, Eastwood can't act his way out of a paper bag. He does one thing and does one thing very well: portray the 'man with no name' (although, of course, latterly he did have a name, but you know what I mean), the character he first played in A Fistful Of Dollars. But beyond that and you're asking far too much. Ask Eastwood to drawl, show extreme cool in extreme danger and invariably outwit the enemy in a seemingly impossible situation, and he always delivers. But don't ask for anything more. I admit I am being harsh, and this film cannot sensibly be blamed for having been made more than 30 years ago. And if I'm honest, I am, in some ways, not the audience for whom it was made and to whom it will undoubtedly still appeal. The Outlaw Josey Wales deals in the myths of the Old West and being a Brit without a drop of American blood in him, they are not my myths. But for the average American, living in a sprawling suburb, perhaps, with a tedious commute to work through other suburbs, spending the best part of two hours indulging and losing him or herself in a slice of Western nostalgia, this film is sure to hit the spot. One last point: Eastwood is also a very respected director, and although I have claimed that as an actor his has a limited range, as a director he knows all the moves. The shame is that none of those moves is original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Clint Eastward fan, I am a western film fan. I missed this when it came out in 1976,My feeling towards it probably would be the same as tonight's viewing. The film has just about every western cliché imaginable. They were being more realistic in showing nudity, &amp; lo &amp; behold we see Sandra Locke's naked behind (could have been a body double), (she is about to be raped by some bad guys.) In real life she &amp; Clint were together so she is saved.It also way, way too long. 136 minutes is much too long &amp; dragged out.The acting is good, Chief Dan Geoege has a nice featured role, at least he was not the usual cliché Indian, BUT where did he learn to speak such good English.(this became a new western cliché).The villains now are the Union (post civil war) Officers,rooting out the last of the so called Southern rebels. Of course they all are after Josey Wales &amp; he gets every one, What a marksman?.The best thing about the movie are the very realistic sets &amp; setting, It was filmed at various western US locations, I recognized Old Tucson in Arizona very easily.Clint had yet to become the great noted director he is today.I think the main reason,is that now he has more control. In 1976 the studios ( Warner Bros) in this case had control.This is not a terrible film, just overly long &amp; full of clichés.Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 77 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) does a lot of spitting this post-Civil War epic. Is he the Spitting Oulaw? Fastest spit in the West? It seems to be an attempt to assert the romantic individualism of the South against the cold Northern invaders.Are you looking for tired and well-worn clichés?: a hard-luck but cute Indian girl repeatedly gets knocked off her feet or worse; a sneaky boatman cringes and leers; a spry old woman (Paula Trueman) bustles about with a broom, shrills out hymns, and grabs a rifle to shoot marauders; a doe-eyed young woman (Sondra Locke) opens her eyes reindeer-size to convey fear, passion, or bashfulness; a young follower of the outlaw (Sam Bottoms) manages three distinct and radiant deathbed scenes on one bullet hole.Eastwood, as indicated earlier, doesn't act; he spits. He is also the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the civil war is ending, a rebel seeks revenge against Yankee soldiers who slaughtered his family. After Clint single-handedly kills about two hundred soldiers in five minutes, he becomes America's most wanted, and there's no place to hide because apparently every person in the country knows who he is (they must have seen his picture on the evening news or perhaps the Internet). Clint expands his acting range here, adding precision spitting to his usual squinty eyes, gritted teeth, and whispered delivery. Locke plays the school marm type that Clint falls for, although she has only about five lines. The only good thing about this never-ending Western is Chief Dan George.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood Hero-worship stretched just a tad. A film full of death &amp; soundbites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a great admirer of Eastwood, more so for his unique directing skills rather than his rather staid acting abilities. Unforgiven is perhaps his zenith in both departments - a vicious story of life &amp; death and what it is like to kill a man with humility: no heroes, ponchoes or chewed tobacco here!Compare Unforgiven to this rather overblown bloodfest where killing is just like collecting apples from a tree. There's no remorse, no concern, no pity, no nothing. Yes, revenge is nice after seeing your family &amp; friends gunned down and then being betrayed by another so-called friend.However, Eastwood simply doesn't know when to stop the bloodshed. Wherever he goes a scene is set where bullets will sing and someone (never Eastwood)is going to die. It reminds me of the computer game "Doom", just going round blasting at things, not knowing when to stop and to Hell with the consequences.The film itself is generally quite good, save for all the killings, and the supporting cast is quite exceptional, especially from Chief Dan George as the misplaced warrior chief living in a different world, a different time &amp; different rules. For me he stole the show, surpassing even the rather smug Eastwood by a wide margin.Although the message throughout the film is clear (that "we all died a little in that damned war") Eastwood never really means what he says. Sure, he has to defend himself but there's only so far one can stretch reality before it becomes hokum. I'm thinking of his one-man raid on the army near the beginning of the film - just him against 80 or 90 well armed troops. He may have a deathwish but he doesn't even get scratched!And this is why I think Eastwood's platonic messages that "fighting is bad" and "Dying ain't much of a living" falls on its face; is it really necessary to show so much carnage?; is it really necessary to treat the viewer like an idiot when we see him ride into battle surrounding by what seems like an invisible bullet-proof force and no matter what he does he can do no wrong and no one can harm him either.Outlaw is nothing more than a mosaic of all the best bits from his previous westerns cobbled together with the undertone of vengence as the excuse for excess. That's why I'm rather glad he finally came to his true senses and produced a far more thought provoking film in Unforgiven.**/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Outlaw Josey Wales is set during the Civil War &amp; starts as Missouri farmer &amp; family man Josey Wales (director Clint Eastwood) house is burnt to the ground &amp; his family killed by renegade soldiers, he is slashed across the face &amp; left for dead but he isn't &amp; he joins William 'Bloody Bill' Anderson's (John Russell) gang... Jump forward to near the end of the Civil War &amp; Bill dies, his gang is the last to accept amnesty from the Union to stop their fighting. The gang, but not Josey, decide to accept the Union's most generous offer but the Union think they are better off dead &amp; shoot them all despite Josey Wales best attempt to save them. The Union send Captain Terrill (Bill McKinney) &amp; ex outlaw Fletcher (John Vernon) to find &amp; kill Josey as well as putting a large reward on his head which means his journey to Mexico becomes a perilous one...Staring &amp; directed by Clint Eastwood who replaced Philip Kaufman as director which was a controversial move &amp; prompted the DGA to rule that no current cast or crew could replace a director on a film &amp; has since been known as the 'Eastwood Rule', anyway The Outlaw Josey Wales is considered to be a classic amongst many but that's not a feeling which I share as I thought it was a touch dull. The script by Philip Kaufman &amp; Sonia Chernus was based on the novel 'Gone to Texas' by Forrest Carter &amp; is as much a drama as a traditional Western which is fine if you like watching films that last for well over two hours where not that much actually happens, to me it just felt like Wales on horse back riding from one situation to another without much purpose to it. I couldn't really get into it, I didn't like the character's that much, I didn't think the story was anything special &amp; it's pretty slow going at times with a run time that lasts over two hours. I don't know why really but I just sat there watching it &amp; just not being able to get into the story or particularly caring about what was going on, I thought it was alright for sure but just not the solid gold classic I had been lead to believe. Overall a bit of a disappointment as I expected better.Director Eastwood does a fine job although it's likely that some of Kaufman's footage he shot before he was replaced found it's way into the final cut with some impressive cinematography which utilises the barren landscapes &amp; the period detail. There's not much action in this one, no one other than Wales seems able to shoot straight as Wales blows everyone away with out much trouble. As I said this feels more like a drama set in the wild west rather than an action packed shoot 'em up. The violence is kept to a minimum with a few bloody gunshot wounds &amp; nothing else.Technically the film is very good with good period detail &amp; production values, set in Texas it was shot mostly in Arizona &amp; Utah. The acting is fine by all involved. You wouldn't have thought The Outlaw Josey Wales would have much in common with Killer Klowns From Outer Space (1988) but both Royal Dano &amp; John Vernon who appear in this featured in Killer Klowns From Outer Space. From The Outlaw Josey Wales to Killer Klowns From Outer Space, there's not that much difference there.The Outlaw Josey Wales is an average Western as far as I'm concerned but i could easily see how someone might like it much more, I just couldn't get into the story or character's that much unfortunately. Followed by The Return of Josey Wales (1986) with Michael Parks taking Eastwood's staring &amp; directing duties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a long-time fan of Eastwood's who had never seen this movie, I was particularly disappointed. The plot drifts aimlessly from unrelated anecdote to unrelated anecdote, with little connection between them. The only tie is the continual search by the Redlegs for Wales, otherwise the story is meaningless and very shallow. Chief Dan George was apparently brought in for comic relief, but all the failed attempts at comedy in the movie make it a parody of parodies. Nice try for a second directing attempt, but Clint obviously needed many more years of experience to direct a movie that produced the power and the impact of Unforgiven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all, but there are so many better Clint Eastwood Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed by this film, as this was the last Western Eastwood has made that I had not seen. Given how wonderful most all these previous films were, I had extremely high expectations for the film. Had I never seen one of his Westerns before, I might have appreciated this film more,...but I knew they could be so much better.The first half or so of the movie was the slowest moving and uninteresting. It mostly just consisted of Clint trying avoid capture by bounty hunters and Union soldiers after the war ended. This didn't seem particularly inspiring or interesting. However, it did pick up when the incredibly odd character played by Chief Dan George entered the movie. While this character was ridiculous and pretty anachronistic, he was so funny and weird that I really found myself ignoring how ridiculous the character was and was thrilled to see him breathe life into the film.In addition to George, the story itself improved drastically when Eastwood no longer just ran from the law and killed bounty hunters but actually found some settlers to care about and care for. Their plight gave the movie some much needed tension and humanity. The only negative about this section of the film is when Sandra Locke is nearly raped by a band of Comancheros. The rape scene and subsequent nudity should have earned the film an R rating, but oddly despite all this it received a PG. This is really odd, as UNFORGIVEN was rated R, yet is much less explicit than this film. All I know is that this is NOT a film for your kids, though without this brief scene the film would be fine for your teens.Pluses were the characters introduced into the last half of the film (not just George), the excellent conclusion and the fact that the film does dare to be different. Minuses are the slow pacing and uninteresting first half of the film, the excessive need to show Eastwood spitting tobacco juice EVERYWHERE again and again (yuck!), and the relative quality of the film compared to other Eastwood Westerns. The others are just so good, this one looks limp in comparison.</fullReview>

It's one of those movies with Clint's girlfriend in it only because she's his girlfriend. The best part of the movie is the Indian recounting the white politician's phony encouragement for them to "endeavor to persevere."The emotional stuff isn't believable, and that's all this movie has. The part where he's cornered by Laige and his cohort is kinda funny. Definitely not one Clint's best, not by a long shot.</fullReview>

Not one iota of atmosphere, and the action is spaced out and ho hum. Eastwood plays a Southern redneck who wants revenge (wow, isn't that original?) So we have another of the billions of revenge tales, and this one isn't even interesting. He just kills anyone he sees, not the people he has a beef with. His character is just a one dimensional jerk. So the writers were smart enough to put in a reasonably likable sidekick, but even he can't pull this movie out of boredom. There is no one and nothing to care about. Watching this film is an ordeal, and if you want to torture someone, tie them up and make them watch this.</fullReview>
