		<shortDescription>Easily the best thing that has come out all year...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. In fact, it is a better film. I say that primarily because I am sick to death of Americans using World War II as a basis for films that generally amount to little more than propaganda. Of course, Enemy At The Gates comes off as being somewhat fantastic due to its attempt to balance entertainment with historical fact, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it all the more entertaining to watch.A lot of historians have it that the battle of Stalingrad was the most unpleasant one fought during the second World War, and this film's set design and cinematography capture that impeccably. When the Russians are battling the Nazis, you get the idea that if the Nazis didn't kill them, malnutrition, tetanus, scurvy, bubonic plague, or a million other things would. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes lend authenticity to their roles that makes it even easier to follow them on their personal journey through hell, and Ed Harris is scarily convincing as a high-ranking Nazi. The real surprise here, however, is Rachel Weisz as Sergeant Tania Chernova, and the very heart and soul of the film. When she describes the reasons why she decided to take up a gun and battle the Germans, it all makes so much sense that you just want to buy the poor girl a beer and give her a good warm embrace. Not that such things would erase the scars that her character bears, but one would feel obligated to try.Writer/Director Jean-Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. It's very tricky to get these two things in proper sync, but they more than manage here. They also don't rely on any hokey photographic effects to tell the story, simply letting you see everything as clearly as possible, letting your imagination do the rest. Anyone who's read anything credible about the inhuman suffering the Russian soldiers endured during this battle will have no trouble filling in the gaps that the narrative leaves about their living conditions. The blood and gore shown during the battles is also very conducive to the atmosphere. Rather than just expecting you to believe that a solider gets his stomach spread all over half a kilometer of pavement by enemy bullets, they show you so you can get a feel for how bloodthirsty both sides in the confrontation were. Even the sex scene doesn't look out of place here.To make a long story short, this is the first film I've seen in a long, long time that I haven't been able to come up with a list of criticisms for. It is simply excellent, and the 7.1 rating it is currently stuck with does not do it justice. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and it is miles above the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbour. Vassili Zaitsev would be very happy that his struggle has inspired such a commendable piece of art - it is exactly the sort of thing he and millions of others like him (on both sides of the planet) were fighting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bursting into my Top Five war movies of all time is this film. A gritty and realistic portrayal of one of the worst battles in the history of war - the 1942-43 armwrestle for the city of Stalingrad. Much has been made of the actors speaking in their native accents, but this seems a trivial complaint - the film is in English after all! More important is the masterful manner of speech of the actors - Bob Hoskins' gutteral exultations as Ukrainian potato farmer Nikita Krushchev; Joseph Fiennes' pompous and proud intonations as the political officer; Jude Law's common man for the peasant turned soldier; Ed Harris with the clipped and crisp tones of a German officer.This is my pick for the best film of the year so far (August). It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, with horrific scenes of the violence of war, brilliant dialog and heart-wrenching tragedy. Expect to be moved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A selective distortion of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" by William Craig was a great history of the Battle of Stalingrad as retold by living participants. "War of the Rats" was a powerful, moving dramatization of Zaitsev and the Soviet snipers who fought at Stalingrad, as well as the Germans who opposed them. I thought that the movie would be based on at least the novel. I was disgusted to find out that the producer/director/writers chose to throw both of these memorable books out the window and instead manufacture their own vision of the battle that provided absolutely no historical insight, replacing the great stories of the two books with warmed over putrid anti-communism.The movie goer gets no insight into the complexities of why Soviet soldiers fought and defeated the Germans at Stalingrad. Instead we are given the impression that the only reason any Soviet soldiers fought there was due to the threat of being machine gunned by the Stalinist "blocking units". Then suddenly, one commissar has a brilliant idea to "create a hero who will be an example" and the whole battle turns on Vasily Zaitsev. None of the other real acts of heroism at Stalingrad are shown, such as the soldiers who held out for 53 days in "Pavlov's house".Further, the main function of Zaitsev's publicity in the Red Army newspaper was to popularize sniper techniques. This was not shown. Nor the sniper school set up where snipers were "mass produced" to harrass the Germans. The heroic deeds and harrowing adventures of the real Tania Chernov are never mentioned. Her being blown out of the boat on the Volga, surviving the journey through the sewers, behind German lines, her responsibility for the loss of several fellow snipers and Zaitsev's anger with her for that, all would have made great scenes.The tension and suspense of snipers hunting each other for days was completely missing as well as the long range aspect of these duels. The ludicrous scene at the end where Konig and Zaitsev confront each other "High Noon" style was absurd. No sniper would expose himself like that, let alone battle hardened troops by that point in the battle, even Germans.The insipid speech by Commissar Danilov at the end about "there will always be rich and poor" was apparently thrown in to reassure the viewers that the director and producer do not sympathize with "Communism".All in all, this movie was a travesty both as art and as history. It did a severe disservice to both. Soviet soldiers who fought and died at Stalingrad did not only do so out of fear of NKVD retaliation. Patriotism against a genocidal invader was a real part of it. And yes, many actually believed that they were fighting for a better future, that they were saving socialism. Why is it that Craig's book and Robbins novel can convey these complexities of the battle of Stalingrad while all we get from the movie is an insipid love triangle, rediculous "sniper tactics" and lots of good old fashioned anti-communism. You don't have to cover up the truth about the crimes of Stalinism to make an accurate portrayal of Russians in the battle of Stalingrad. But you don't have to churn out an anti-communist diatribe either. The truth will not be found in either. Certainly not in the sorry cinematic adaptation of "Enemy at the Gates". The only thing it has in common with the history is the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extrordinary work of raw skill and imagination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gut-wrenching and impressive hide-and-seek thriller that uses the bloody battle of Stalingrad (during the second World War) as the clever disguise here for a real battle of courage and determination. The film follows a young and highly talented Russian sniper from the Urals, Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law - "eXistenZ", "The Talented Mr. Ripley"), who gains national fame from the help of Danilov (Joesph Fiennes - "Shakespeare in Love"), a propoganda officer and his true love and fellow sniper, Tania (Rachael Weisz), who is also flirting with Danilov.However, the Germans have an ace sniper of their own in Erwin Koning (Ed Harris - "Pollock"), a seasoned and out-spoken Major who comes to Stalingrad only to pick off Vassili. And before Koning leaves, his superior officer asks how he'll find Vassili. Koning says, " I'll fix it so he finds me."The love triangle that director Jean-Jacques Annaud and co-writer Alain Godard put in the story shows that the pair took a chance and I'll give them credit for doing it. Plus, the love scene that Law and Weisz have is one of the strangest (no offense to either one) that I've seen.The film's best moments come when Vassili tries to catch Koning off guard, but the problem is Koning is aware of what Vassili is capable of. I won't say how it's done, but the final confrontation is a genuine nail-bitter.All of the performances here are powerhouse and that includes Bob Hoskins as Nikita Kruschev, a snarling and impatient man and Ron Perlman, who portrays Koulikov, a lieutenant whose teeth are all metal and serves as a guide for Vassili.Robert Frassie ("Ronin") handles the movie's photography with care and the appearrence of Stalingrad itself reminded me heavily of the war-torn cities shown in Spielsburg's "Saving Private Ryan" and Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket". Also, James Horner conducts a tender and extremely mournful score that leaves a quiet yet important reminder of how awful war is."ENEMY AT THE GATES" is an extrodinary work of raw skill and imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opening the gates of my mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance I must admit I thought "Oh no!" not another war movie trying to cash in on the success that Saving Private Ryan had. However when I viewed this film it turned out to be a great surprise in my mind. Its the story of a man brought to fame in a form of propaganda to help the disintegrating Russian forces keep faith. The boy (Law) was obviously talented however nearly lost his own faith when poised against his greatest challenge, the prized German sniper. The story line throughout kept me glued to the screen leading up to a wonderful climax.The wonder of friendship and love also have a great deal in the plot and realistically portrays both in those times of chaos and death. I urge any reader who is doubting this films credentials to swallow their pride and sit down to watch this film. You will not be disapointed in the least.In saying this I would like to just add that I feel there could have been improvement in the accents as sometimes I was finding it hard to grasp that the Germans were fighting the Russians and not the English, but otherwise 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating film about the strategy of two great snipers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Enemy at the Gates," the future of the greatest battle of World War II, would be decided between a young Russian sniper and an aristocratic sharpshooter from Germany sent to kill him? Jude Law and Ed Harris sit for hours waiting for the right moment? It was a duel set in the siege of Stalingrad? Stalingrad was one of the biggest and bloodiest battles of World War II, and in the midst of this huge battle, these two soldiers were hunting each other down? The film opens with the harrowing transport of thousand of Russian soldiers across the Volga River to Stalingrad? The recruits were packed onto steamers, barges, whatever they could find to ferry them across the river? All that under a deluge of shells, bombs and explosions? By the time Vassili arrives to Stalingrad, the Nazis have a distinct edge, and Soviet morale is at an all-time low? Leading the Russians in their seemingly futile defense is Nikita Kruschev, played by Bob Hoskins? The Germans, at that time, were overrunning the place and the Russians were in an appalling state? It was the most awful battle of the war? Joseph Fiennes plays Danilov, an idealistic Russian officer who passionately speaks about his belief in getting the troops to turn the grave situation in Stalingrad around? He finds the perfect inspiration in Vassili? Rachel Weisz plays a young woman who volunteers to help in the war effort? She's literally protecting the people she grew up with? When she meets Vassili, he just has a natural intelligence, a natural instinct? Jude Law is remarkable as the young sharpshooter Vassili Zaitsev who conveyed both humanity and intensity? There's such a fierce intelligence and liveliness in his eyes? He can also be very quiet and internal? Vassili found the complexity within the silence and stillness? In fact to be a sniper is very much about a man of action through stillness? Vassili represented the ultimate hero, the symbol of someone who could instill hope and belief in victory amongst the troops, because his skills as a sniper were unparalleled? Ed Harris played Major Konig, the German sharpshooter sent to hunt down Vassili? He knows that Vassili was picking off German officers with some regularity, and was becoming a folk hero for the Russian soldiers as well as the Russian populace... He decided to eliminate him? The casting of Ed Harris opposite Jude Law resulted in a striking visual link between their characters? They both have these unbelievably penetrating blue eyes? And director Jean-Jacques Annaud began to see the duel through their eyes? And one of the first shots of Ed Harris was a close-up of his blue eyes? Annaud painted the tensions very clearly and concentrated purely on the eyes of the Jude Law and Harris and, of course, on their rifles and how they were hidden and what they were doing? Basically, the core of his camera is the duel of their eyes, duel of men, duel of snipers, therefore a confrontation of people that scan the surrounding buildings, and try to decipher what they see?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining disinformation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the Battle of Stalingrad. Things are not going well for the Red Army. The film suggests that should they loose this battle they will also loose the war. But the soldiers and the officers only know defeat, they have no hope of victory.Enter a political commas (Fiennes) who has witnessed superb shooting by the soldier Zaitsev (Law) - killing a bunch of German officers taking a shower very near the front line (sic!). Zaitsev is turned into a sniper and his exploits are front page news all over the Soviet Union. He and his comrades are so successful that the German army ceases to function properly, only a few hundred meters away from the river Volga and Victory.This is the setting for this movie, and the sniper duel that follows between Zaitsev and his German counterpart Konig (Ed Harris) is good entertainment. The love affair between Zaitsev and the female soldier Tania (Weisz) does not add to the suspense, but is forgivable. Some people like romance in movies, and why not? It does not make the story any better though.Some people seem to believe that this movie is historically mostly accurate. That is not correct. There was a battle in Stalingrad. It was a bloody mess. Zaitsev was a good sniper and he killed a lot of Germans. Almost everything else in this movie is fiction and/or unrealistic. It is impossible to get every detail right, but in this movie the main plot - the duel between Zaitsev and Konig - is pure fiction and Soviet propaganda. And the idea that Zaitsev sort of "won the battle" is also absurd. He was part of their delaying forces in the city. Operation Uranus - a pincer move with tanks - was what really won the battle.Enjoy the movie if you like. The acting is good, the scenery and costumes are OK, visual effects mostly OK. Just do not think you are learning history or are seeing realistic military tactics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense war drama that centers the viewer in the German invasion of Stalingrad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply want to weigh in with a very positive response to Enemy at the Gates. Taken as a historical drama rather than an attempt to flawlessly depict an historical incident, this is topnotch entertainment. "Enemy" portrays the conflict between a young Russian sniper played by Law and the German sniper (Harris) who is sent to kill him during the German attack on Stalingrad during WWII. Apart from a scene which awkwardly caricatures the Russian field commanders and the occasionally distracting accents, the film successfully immerses the viewer in this tense war drama. Appreciate it it for its tight focus, uncompromising realism, and fine characterizations by the main actors. Research the historical accuracy later, if you must, but don't let it spoil the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gross misrepresentation of the historical facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so much about Hollywood propagating stereotypes and an ideological agenda and too little about portraying the true History behind the story. The Germans as usual are monsters and child killers and the Russians are controlled by a brutal communist ideology. The movie missed the true historic dimension of the tragedy that Stalingrad was, the horrific losses of life on both sides and how human lives are worth nothing during a war. The part that I found the most untruthful was the killing of the boy by the German sniper. In order for this story to be true we will have to believe that a 12 year old Russian kid in Stalinist Russia was capable of speaking perfect German and Russian to communicate with his enemies and move back and forth between the two sides unless of course both combatants spoke English during the war. So much for Hollywood and historical facts. Chepe (jmek052)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The futility of war, and what causes it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this film. It is one of the best movies about war - what it is like, and what causes it. I know some people find the love story hard to take, but it is there to illustrate how jealousy and envy can lead to irrational acts, hate, and even war.At a time when the world is racing toward armed conflict yet again, this film is a timely reminder of the ultimate futility of war. The opening sequence is one of the most horrific I have ever seen - comparable to that incredible opening scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But unlike "Ryan", this film does not become a flag-waving one-sided analysis of war. Instead we get an in depth, and very moving, look at the reality of being human in a war situation - whether male or female, German or Russian. And Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris all give superb performances. I was a bit hard-pressed, though, to believe Bob Hoskins as Krushchev.Jean-Jacques Annaud is a remarkable director, with a strong visual style, and deserves to be recognised as one of the contemporary masters of cinema. Ten out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something missing here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" seems as if it can't make up its mind as to whether it is a brutal war epic or an affectionate character study. Both of these can work together and form a terrific movie, or they can seperate and become their own. This one's in-between. It held my interest in certain areas, but yet also left me a bit disgruntled by the way it manipulates its audience. And there's a silly love story thrown in for good measure. That does it.Jude Law plays Vassili, a Russian sniper during World War II whose name may have been inspired by Vasoline gel as a funny in-joke. Vassili used to be a shepherd and learned how to aim a gun when he had to pick of wolves from a distance. There's a terrific opening sequence that reminded me of D-Day assault in Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan." But this battle goes on for too long and doesn't move like it should.After the mini-assault in the beginning of the film, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) is introduced as the political officer assigned to Vassili's unit. They take a liking to each other, but they both also take a liking to Vassili's neighbor, Tanya (Rachel Weisz). Tension builds between the two men as Ed Harris comes into this mess, playing Konig, a Bavarian man who is assigned to assassinate Vassili. He makes a remark that he will not find Vassili. He will let Vassili find him.Here starts a quite amazing story that could have been tremendous given a better touch and a better editing job. The movie isn't too long by the standards of most war films, but it certainly seems longer than most war films, and when you start to wonder why the faults of the movie start to hit you like a bag of bricks.There's an interesting and disturbing scene at one point when Russian soldiers are inside a demolished building. There's a big gaping crater at along the interior of the house, and the crater created a large hole in the wall overlooking the surroundings outside. Vassili does a leap of faith and makes it across unscathed. But the man who jumps next has his head blown apart mid-way across the crater. We then see Konig outside in a ditch, his sniper rifle smoking.Scenes like this make the movie rise out of mediocrity for a moment or two before it slips, like the dead man who tried to leap across the hole, into a crater. Perhaps this is the main fault of "Enemy at the Gates"--it tries too hard. Or perhaps too little. I liked the idea of a cat-and-mouse game set in World War II. But it isn't put to good use. The scenes that should come off terrifying, potent and paranoid come off simply as boring. There's a scene in the movie when Vassili is trapped behind an object with Konig right outside, his sights set on the boundaries of this object. Vassili makes a run for it, he's dead. He stays around long enough, and he's dead. But the paranoia of the scene never builds. My mind started to wander. That should never happen in a film like this.Jean-Jacques Annad ("Seven Years in Tibet") knows how to evoke surroundings, but his characters are wholly unbelievable on the whole, and every time he is given good potential for a tense scene he seems to nod in the director's chair. The love story is reeking of the typical Hollywood treatment. Whereas a film such as "Braveheart" uses its tender love story to a definite advantage in regards to the story, the love story in "Enemy at the Gates" does little but tarnish the film's remaining image. And that's too bad.2.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this movie. War movies are difficult to pull off as it is, at least historical ones, but this one fails more miserably than any I've seen. There are some okay moments. There's a few good moments between actors, and occasionally you can get the tension of the cat-and-mouse game of the two snipers. However, the rest is terrible. It's all war scenes, with one drinking scene and one sex scene. There's no chemistry between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz, and this is the probably the main reason why the sex scene is so weak and distasteful. It seems a little like a last-ditch attempt to say both "Look! These characters really do have a relationship! They're having sex!" as well as "Look! It really is hard for these characters! They're having sex on a tiny cot!" Not to mention an excuse to show Rachel Weisz' ass.This is two hours of my life that I want back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not about real people and problems but about Freudian archetypes like the handsome hero, the two lovebirds, the genius little boy etc.First off, real Vasiliy Zaitsev was ugly, but I guess that would be too complicated for the Western audience so they used boyband like, raspberry looking Jude Law instead. Who cares for the complex truth when there are so many good feelings to get.Second, if a 12-year old boy would reach the proficiency with German language that would allow them to talk freely to an officer, the NKVD would not let him walk around freely, they would lock him up in the Gulag or at least use them for their own purposes. In any case, he wouldn't run around in shorts and a thin jacket in the Russian winter that killed the German army.Third, when the Russian people are undergoing genocide and the fate of the world is being decided in Stalingrad, a soldier would not run around in his bunker, happy that his face has been printed in the Pravda, like a hipster who just opened its first weblog. I realize that modern Western people are all about recognition from their peer group, but trust me, during the biggest war in human history, people had other problem's on their minds.If you watched this film and you didn't feel intellectually insulted, I suggest you.... take a Russian history class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ENEMY AT THE GATES / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French: "Enemy At The Gates" takes place in 1942 and details a cat and mouse chase between two snipers. The mouse is a young Russian named Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who arrives on the shores of the Volga River to defend Stalingrad, an important city in which the German's are attempting to capture. Zaitsev soon finds himself befriending a political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), who is impressed by the soldiers quick skills and decides to glorify him through the local press. Zaitsev becomes a political icon for the locals, giving them encouragement and increasing their hope for victory.  The cat is an opposing sniper named Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a famous sharpshooter called upon to kill Zaitsev. Koulikov (Ron Perlman), another talented sniper, is assigned to help Zaitsev in killing Koenig before the Major takes a victory shot. To further complicate matters, Zaitsev falls in love with another soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz), whose parents were killed by the enemies, and wants to redeem their honor.  "Enemy At The Gates" certainly paints a vivid, graphic depiction of war. The atmosphere is unsettling and bleak, the characters are almost always dirty and sleepless, the fighting scenes consist of brief, short, instantaneous shots, but the sequences are fast-paced, genuine, and disturbing. The city looks battered and tormented. The dialogue goes hand and hand with the character's actions; the plot is challenging and the movie is focused, about something solid. In the sequences where Koenig and Zaitsev challenge one another, the tension is very effective. The movie tends to realize that, and concentrates a great deal of effort in making those scenes suspenseful and taut.  Joseph Fiennes plays a meek, nervous character and does a good job at bringing him to life believably. Jude Law, whose last work in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" provides a tough act to follow, accomplishes great things with a determined and assiduous character. Ed Harris is the standout actor here, in a harrowing, steadfast, juicy performance. Rachel Weisz cannot do a whole lot with her character, however. She often feels strained and contrived."Enemy At The Gates" tries hard to express the subject of the media's influence in our culture. If the film, co-written and directed by Jean-Jaques Annaud ("Seven Years in Tibet"), would have stayed on that concept, it would have been a whole lot better. The romance between Zaitsev and Tania is kind of unnecessary, and I am not sure if the sex scene is obligatory or advances their relationship. This love side story lacks passion; a lot of it feels mechanical and routine. "Enemy At The Gates" is still a consistently intriguing war film-rare because it does not involve Americans. While we are never really concerned about the outcome of the actual war, nor do we entirely care about several aspects of the main characters, there are many good scenes of suspense, and the overall mood of the movie is effective. "Enemy at the Gates" is worth seeing if it sounds interesting to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Massive failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many things that went wrong in this movie that treating them all in paragraph form would probably exceed the one thousand word limit imposed by the Database. I do believe, however, that all the problems can be wrapped under the single title "Mood."What is wrong with the mood in Enemy At the Gates? Everything. Let's start simply: music. Despite a reasonably solid history, James Horner embarrasses himself. For his sake, I can only hope that Arnaud can be blamed for this, and not Horner (I enjoyed his work in Legends of the Fall.) The music is constantly "Mickey Mouseing" the action on the scene; that is, in case the viewer is too dumb to understand what's happening visually, the music clues him in. When we first encounter Ed Harris, the music keys up an evil score -- in case we had thought these were the Good Nazis. When trouble seems to be brewing, the music mimics it. This is not necessarily a cardinal sin. Most movies, to some extent, use music in this fashion. But when it is as invasive as the music of GATES, it deserves a demerit.Accents. I had several discussions about this before seeing the film, defending GATES on the basis that "Russians don't sound accented to each other when they're speaking, so there's no reason to accent a supposedly all-Russian army. Unfortunately, the director (Arnaud) made some grievous errors with the accents. First of all, within a country as large as the USSR, regional dialects are pervasive. However, the only "regional accents" we hear are US or British accents. Which means that Jude Law -- supposedly an uneducated peasant -- speaks with his usual British flair. Secondly, Arnaud at times seems to forget that the Germans are speaking German and the Soviets Russian. As a result, Ed Harris can easily converse with a Russian boy with no linguistic problems (is the message that a German nobleman learned Russian, or that the boy knew German? I do not know.) All in all, it's another invasive element.Stalingrad. It certainly looks pretty enough (or, impressively destroyed), though Aranaud spends an inordinate amount of time showing us a symbolic statue of Stalin (it seems that not just American directors are obsessed over Russias old cast-iron statues.) Yet geographically, we start to run into problems. Any character can find any other character within a matter of minutes -- despite the fact that the city is a warzone, rubble-strewn, and gigantic. It's simply strange, and more than slightly silly. My friends and I were laughing constantly by the end when Arnaud's harsh cuts (which would often show dramatic lighting changes within a single scene) would teleport Law from the Volga to the front and back again before breakfast was done.We see one civilian (excluding a rushed evacuation scene) the entire movie. We never get ANY notion that this is a populous city that is being annihilated. In fact, the closest thing we get is a cliche, "This is my home" (with Horner playing it up for us, of course)...the woman saying that evacuates within two minutes. No one else ever mentions anything.The love story. Jesus H. Christ. The one provoked fits of laughter -- especially from the girls in our group. One excellent scene has Jude Law and Racquel Weisz engaged in intercourse, in a tunnel, surrounded by 30 sleeping soldiers on all sides. Aside from the fact that Weisz achieves multiple orgasms this way (or so her ludicrous acting would suggest), she seems to really enjoy having Law's filthy, filthy hands rubbed over her face and lips. As I said, laughable. Much like the friendship between Fiennes and Law, the romance between the three seems based on convenience. Fiennes and Law become fast friends because they are using each other for fame (isn't that the truest form of friendship?), and Weisz has two fans because she's attractive and extremely sexually liberated. There is certainly no suggestion -- except in the apparent expectation on the viewers to fill in this element -- that there is anything ROMANTIC going on between Law and Weisz. If there was, it got cut in favor of the scene in which the snipers, having pinned down their adversary, take a break to have sex and sleep. Unfortunately, their young friend pays the price of their licentious habits.I could go on and on about the way Arnaud insults our intelligence. The Russians smoke hand rolled cigarettes looking like joints -- the evil German smokes gold foil, machine rolled cigarettes. In case we forget that the Germans aren't really worse than the Russians, we are reminded of various attrocities. In case we don't know what the Battle of Stalingrad was, the film explains it with an expository introduction complete with the colored Nazi region of a map expanding into the Soviets. Oh, the Soviets are red, in case you forgot they were Communist.The movie is a farce; what pleasure is to be had is in spite of the movie. The cast is full of excellent actors, who I suppose help carry some of the bloated weight of the movie. The special effects are neat, if misused. The sniper scenes are...well...sniper scenes, but you get a good hour of them if they're your thing. And you see Weisz's naked rear.Yay.There are so many better movies made about WWII -- both from the European standpoint and the American. If you're looking for a movie about the Evils of Stalin, I recommend Burnt by the Sun. As for WWII flicks in general, there are enough that you can darn well find one yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What most fascinates me here is the different tastes people have; I simply can't believe it when people praise this film. It must be a joke! It has to be...This movie had nothing good in it except the WWII setting, which I hope would be exploited more. The characters were shallow and acted idiotic, emotional outbursts just came out of clear blue sky and ended in a few cheering words like 'it'll be OK..' It was like watching a cheap soap opera.Acting was terrible (apart from Ed Harris, who, BTW. didn't come across as a character who'd hang a little boy. Why did they have to put that there, wasn't there any other way of getting people interested in the outcome of the duel??? Why doesn't hollywood let us take our own sides instead of pushing us to a situation where there are no longer any options?). Jude Law, who I used to think as a good actor, landed on his butt in this one. He's SOOOO British, that it's kind of hard to accept him as a shepherd from the Urals!All in all, if you liked this movie then a) you're hot for either one of the lead actors and can not think clearly b) have a limited capability of understanding quality or c) you must be joking, which is probably the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A joke, from both a historical and a cinematic points of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I think it was a mistake for the screenwriters to pick and choose such a big event in the history of WWII, a turning point so to speak, only to have it placed as a background, to something so much less significant, a duel between two snipers. If one has never read anything historical or seen any chronological movies about battle of Stalingrad, or any other battle for that matter before seeing this movie, one might even wonder, how did Russians win the war at all? With one rifle per four hands? Against tanks? And aircraft? And heavy artillery? You know there's only so much even a drunken Russian can do with his ? of a rifle. I see all these peoples' comments complaining that the main characters' accents were too British or too American and that that spoiled the true Russian Character, however the Hollywood makers portray that to be. But, being Russian myself, I saw nothing in the movie, at least on the Russian side, that resembled any truth to even how people spoke to each other, how they interacted with each other. They just didn't seem Russian to me, and it didn't matter what accents they used. These characters were biased cardboard characters, speaking cardboard character lines, and acting, well, cardboard-like. In the opening scenes of the movie they show a bunch of unarmed people thrown into battle only to be massacred by well armed Germans. That's a crock of sh*t, pardon my Russian. Basically by 1942, Hitler's army was fighting on two fronts, and it was very, very tired. Both sides were. Both sides were running out of people and supplies. Mostly, Battle of Stalingrad was a two-steps-forward-one-step-back kind of war. People charging and taking over some useless strategic point and then being thrown back, and then charging again. It was a battle to see who had a bigger stamina, because both sides were low in numbers. But it was also a battle involving tanks, artillery, and planes on BOTH sides. In the movie they omitted that, showing us diving Stukas, and yet surprisingly, no anti-aircraft guns firing at them, no Russian planes in the sky, just two soldiers armed with one rifle. Bullsh*t. No number of Vasiliy Zaycevs or Tatyana Whoevers would be able to stand off, and more even, reverse the tide of war against Germans, without having, basically an equally, if not better, equipped army at their side. If you look at the numbers, about 250,000 German and about 100,000 Russian soldiers lost their lives over Stalingrad. Well from the movie it might seem the opposite. Plus the whole mood of the movie. Russian soldiers, seemed no different from prisoners, defending Stalingrad only because of the muzzles pointed at their backs. But actually, believe it or not, many of these people were defending their motherland, their wives, daughters, sons, etc. and they were doing it not because they were to be shot otherwise, but because they loved their country and believed in its future. True, there were special NKVD units that were ordered to fire on retreating soldiers. But there was no other way, at that point. If Stalingrad would've fallen, that would greatly demoralize an entire Red Army, and cause an even greater loss of life. But by no means were soldiers thrown into battle, half-armed into their certain death. That would just be pointless, even for ruthless Russian Generals. Plus when they showed Kruschev commanding the front, I fell off my seat laughing. I can go on and on, and this would be a never-ending story, except that I don't want it to be as boring and as never-ending as the script for Enemy at the gates. Advice for people who like a little reality in their movies, don't see it. It sucks. I try to picture Private Ryan done by the same director. It just wouldn't be Private Ryan, but some stupid unrealistic war flick, sort of like U-571.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy Stalingrad has no relation to history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates completely misrepresents the history of the battle and slanders the brave sacrifice of the Soviet people to defeat Nazism. I strongly recommend reading the book 'Enemy at the Gates' to see how little of the movie is true.The story of the sniper is one small story in the book that was complied from hundreds of interviews with veterans from both sides. The story of the sniper was significantly changed for the film from the true story which is much more compelling.All the Generals who actually led the battle are ignored in the film except Kruschev. Kruschev was Political Commissar at the Front level and was involved in the overall planning of the defensive battle and the encirclement of the German 6th army at Stalingrad. He did not command the 62th army in Stalingrad, this was General Chuikov, a true hero. The entire battle was commanded by Marshal Zhukov ( the general who never lost a battle ) in close collaboration with Stalin. After the death of Stalin, Kruschev had his role inflated and Zhukov, Stalin and Chuikov ignored.There is no sense of the battle in the film either at the unit level or overall. The Red Army used firegroups of 25 men armed with bags of grenades and sub machine guns to fight the Germans house to house in the rubble. There was little of the human wave tactics portrayed in the film. Building were fought over room by room and floor by floor. No one went in the open as this was certain death to either side.The battle consisted of the Red army holding on to a tiny corner of the city while the German forces were ground down. When the Germans were weakened, Soviet reserves north and south of the city broke through the weakened flanks off the Nazi forces and surrounded the entire 6th Army and part of the 4th Panzer Army.The 6th Army was Germany's greatest strike force, the same one that conquered France so quickly. At least 330,000 German soldiers from its elite force were killed or captured. Only about 10,000 survived to return to German after the war.Germany never recovered from this loss and it marked to start of their defeat.Please read the book Enemy at the Gates and forget this terrible film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a russian I want to say that many russians are offended by this movie. Though it has some real stuff in it, many things are stupid and even abusive. Like russian soldiers being brought to the front line in the sealed cars with barred windows like criminals or some sort of cattle. Or soviet officers only drinking vodka and shouting around. How did they win the war only doing that?A Hollywood director sitting in his cozy chair can't even imagine what was that war like. And I think he doesn't want to. In Russia, we've been taught a little about the war. Stalingrad had a long battle in the middle of a coldest winter of the century. People were starving and freezing to death. And a red-cheeked boy walking around in shorts (at -40!!!) looks like a stupid joke. So does a soldier woman with long painted nails putting on her make-up before the attack. So does the slogan in Russian on the wall "Long live the socialism". Does the director really think the Russians were such maniacs to write on the walls how they loved the socialism? "We will win!" That's a real slogan from that time.This movie has a lot more inaccuracies but I can't and don't want to enumerate them all. Just... the director should be embarrassed of his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***CONTAINS SPOILERS -- AT LEAST SOME KIND OF --***I've re-watched this film just 15 minutes ago...And i didn't realized that there is so much political thoughts spreading from all over scenes before...I want to congratulate Hollywood from here.They made a movie about a Russian sniper, which many believe that doesn't even exist and also believe that it was just a made up Russian hero during the war to encourage the people just as the film shows up, and a German sniper named König, which is also made up German sniper according to the German sources, who challenges him in Stalingrad.Action is good, sniper films always attract me much. But the thing is from the first scene to the last, fascism, communism, and socialism is criticized all over the scenes, with every dialog especially the ones between Danilov and Zaitsev, and Koulikov and Zaitsev.But hey!.. It's a Hollywood film!...you can't expect it to criticize the capitalism, which this film comes right from its heart.Pff..I don't say that fascism is good or communism is good or socialism is good... As long as men live all kinds of systems have their flaws.Right? All i want to say that i haven't seen a film as one sided as this one for a very long time.Good Job Hollywood...Apart from the political position of this film i gave it a 5/10 for it's unnecessary sexuality and making the German sniper look like a fool...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie can only be advised to people who like nice visual effects and tend not to think about what they watch. Otherwise, disappointment is waiting for you. Fact errors are big and disturbing: Main character - Zaitsev - is shown as pretty but rather dumb shepherd boy from Ural who can hardly write and read. Real Zaitsev before Stalingrad was head of financial department and during the battle wrote two books to prepare snipers! Hrushev. This man was shown only because Western spectators may heard something about him (being one of USSR bonzes in 1960s). The real hero of this battle - General Chuykov - was not even mention.Political correctness...Jewish girlfriend (despite real Zaitsev's Russian wife), homosexuals kissing in Russian army 'night party' before battle... this don't deserve being mentioned.Summary: even although the movie was made by French team, it is as far from truth in showing the battle and characters of Zaitsev and Russian soldiers, as it was made by a Marsian team.Vote: 2/10 for great visual effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what really happened between Zaitsev and Koenig?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**CAUTION! SPOILERS! MIGHT GIVE AWAY SOME OF THE CONTENTS**Remember what Dumas-father (of the "Three Musketeers") said about history being a hanger on which he put up his work for display? Movies are work of fiction; there is no law saying they have to be 100% accurate. But then, can even professional historians claim to be 100% accurate (and presumably they are paid to be exactly that)? Still, I cannot resist the temptation to join in the argument whether THE Duel really took place.Some say it never took place, dismiss the story as propaganda, or question the identity of the German ace sharpshooter. I wasn't there (Duh!), but, contrary to some comments on this site, I know for certain Zaitsev was NOT silent on the matter. In memoirs published in Russian in 1971, Zaitsev DID leave a fairly detailed account of A Duel with a very skilled and experienced adversary. Note that, for both sides, enemy snipers were top-priority targets together with officers and machine-gunners. So, sniper duels were fairly common. By Zaitsev's own words, him and other fellow snipers had participated in (and survived) many such engagements. This particular German sniper he calls "Major Konings" and identifies him as the head of the German sniper school flown in from Berlin. This is, of course, to the best of his knowledge - based on intelligence (which could potentially be faulty) and the documents he picked off the body. So if the names don't match, might be people are talking different engagements, or different aliases of the same person.Assuming this duel is THE ONE, the win for Zaitsev was a result of patience, persistence, the German's unwillingness to change an excellent position under a sheet of metal (authentic detail in the movie!), and most importantly, help from Zaitsev's team. Danilov did get shot (not mortally) the day before the actual duel, though not intentionally - just a little too eager to point the position of the German Major to Zaitsev. It was Zaitsev's teammate that baited "Konings" into shooting the day after, and, pretending to be hit, lured him enough to poke his head out of his hiding place.Other notes (mainly based on Zaitsev's memoirs mentioned above): 1. Zaitsev's family name derives from the Russian word for "hare"; another famous Stalingrad sniper was Medvedev, derived from the Russian word for "bear". Not surprisingly, snipers trained by Zaitsev were called "bunnies", by Medvedev - "cubs".2. Zaitsev was short, stocky, blond and blue-eyed. He had no commanding physical presence and indeed started his military career as a clerk in the navy.3. Before the war, Zaitsev's civilian occupation had been a hunter, not a shepherd. His father and mother were very much alive; however, he was his Grandpa's favorite and felt closet to him.4. According to Zaitsev, their division crossed Volga at night, without being attacked and without casualties. Hi mentions being armed with a submachine gun (but then, this reality wouldn't look as dramatic in place of the corresponding movie scenes).5. Zaitsev did use a teammate of his at least once to blind his opponent with reflected sunlight to escape from a tight spot.6. It was actually Zaitsev himself who was wounded by a mortar round and met victory at Stalingrad in a hospital. Since his vision was impaired, he finished the war as a commander of an anti-aircraft battery - part of the army that participated in the taking of Berlin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy At The Gates is a film that's overflowing with anti-Communism. I hate it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French film director Jean-Jacques Annaud should be ashamed of this film. I know there's plenty of anti-Communism in the French media, but this is going too far. He managed to make a misleading film about the most important battle of the 20th century, and then he put it into wide release so that as many people as possible would watch it. The amount of bias and misrepresentation in this film is astonishing. Here's a list of some of the things that are wrong with it:- the Western actors playing Russians don't behave or talk like Russians. - Russian soldiers were not brought to the front line in cattle trucks like Jews being sent off to German concentration camps. - the Russians did not mount suicide charges against the Germans, but fought them house to house. - Nikita Khrushchev (played by Bob Hoskins) was not a murderous old fatso. This is 1942 we're talking about, not 1962. At that time he was much younger and slimmer. - the toothless Koulikov was included in the film just to make people think that Stalin has people tortured. And maybe to show off Konig's sniping skills. - Russian soldiers were not hooligans who made out, drank vodka, and play farting games at night. They instead tried to get as much sleep as they could during the battle. - the morale of the Red Army did not depend on Zaitsev's sniping successes. - Danilov was included in the film mostly to show that there were political commissars in the Soviet Union. In reality the commissars were excluded from the army during the war. - there were no huge statues of Joseph Stalin everywhere in Stalingrad. - huge portraits of Stalin didn't hang in the Red Army headquarters. - it was the Russians who played the speech mentioning that every 7 seconds a German soldier dies in Russia. This was done when the Germans were close to defeat. - the Red Army did not offer lavish banquets to heroes like Zaitsev. The man stealing the fruit from the table was included just to make people think that there's inequality in the Soviet Union. - before he gets killed, Danilov makes a speech. What's it about? It's an anti-Communist speech. - the film includes sniper duels that don't take place in real life. - Stalingrad is the bloodiest battle in human history, but in this film you don't get to understand the scale of the battle at all. - while watching Enemy At The Gates I got the impression that more Red Army soldiers were killed by their superiors than by the Germans. The film falsely shows Red Army officers killing their soldiers left and right because of cowardice. - the Russians were not short on rifles during this battle. Russians had all the equipment they needed in this battle. - Konig's fantastic shooting isn't possible in real life. - the "sniper's duel" shown in the film is fictional. The real duel between Zaitsev and Konig was different.Watching this film viewers may easily think that it's the invading Germans and not the Russian defenders who are the good guys. It's certain that the director is fond of the Germans, and that he's anti-Communist. While reading the comments here it became clear to me that most viewers take this film seriously. Because they don't know better they'll be left thinking that this is how Russians behave and that this is what the war was like. This sort of film-making is really unprofessional. The director should have at least done some research and watched some Russian films before filming the dreadful Enemy At The Gates. Also, he should have put aside his political views.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts with some scenes ripped off from Saving Private Ryan, only not as good and not as shocking. None of the characters seem real (not even Jude Law, otherwise a great actor -Gattaca). There is no way anybody could be fooled even for even a brief moment that this is not a film. At the end of every scene that went wrong somewhere (cliché/not compelling/bad acting/shallowness/ combination), I couldn't stop thinking that this could and should have been a great movie, as both its basic story, theme and setting offer vast possibilities for this. There were too many characters in this film as well and you can't possibly relate to all of them. Most of the characters seem incredibly naive. It's been a long time since I've seen anything like this. Even most of the (combat) scenes are naive, until Jude Law and his newfound 'love' start doing it in a room filled with sleeping soldiers. This is without a doubt the most shocking scene in the movie (mainly because they all seem like oversized, dumb, innocent children instead of soldiers), but I'm quite sure this wasn't intentional. Ed Harris' play is ok, only he seems to be forgetting that he's not supposed to be a friendly guy in the story until all of a sudden he commits a horrible crime at the end of the movie (his 'nice guy turns nasty'-performance doesn't cut it in other words). Joseph Fiennes as Danilov is just plain ridiculous as are most of the other actors, who for the most part just play caricatures of past roles. Don't go check this out, even (or especially not) if history interests you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ENEMA AT THE DOOR: an Foreigner Will Not Notice, a Russian Will Not Forgive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to see the widely publicized in the West movie "Enemy at the Gates", directed by Jean Jaques Annaud. After "Saving Private Ryan", which had left an overall good impression, I hoped that this Hollywood product would turn out to be on the same level. But contrary to my expectations... Well, let's start from the beginning. From the first moments I was struck by the rosy, well-fed faces of the Russian soldiers going to the front. Of course, I understand that life in the West is nice and sweet, but where were the makeup artists? All Soviet soldiers wore brand new greatcoats. Throughout the entire movie I only saw well-fed, not to say fat, faces, and even Danilov's three day stubble (incidentally, why does he walk around unshaven in the army?) badly masks his well-groomed face. I think the director never even considered the fact that life on the Soviet home front in 1942 wasn't sweet, McDonalds restaurants just weren't there, and sausages didn't get buttered. I was also amused about how people riding inside the freight rail cars were standing. I think the director has never even tried to imagine how it felt to ride in such a car, how it shakes you from side to side, and far from anyone would manage to stay on his feet. Meanwhile, the train arrives at some station, all the civilians are unloaded, soldiers are herded inside, and... some men started locking the cars! That's right! It turns out that Soviet soldiers had to be padlocked. Why? I don't know. Probably, the director believes that our grandfathers fought only from fear, that if it was up to them, they would've ran away, and nobody would've been left to fight the valiant German army. Meantime, the train arrives at the Stalingrad station, the padlocks are unlocked, and evil officers start dragging the soldiers out of the cars! And another political officer stands nearby (probably, the chief one, and a big boss above the other political officers), waves a red flag, and yells into a tin megaphone. I don't know how our Western comrades see this picture, but it sent me into a spasm of laughter. I haven't seen such a silly scene even in the comedy series "Fitil'" (Fuse). But speaking seriously, this is already an insult, and it's more serious than it could seem in the beginning. Russian soldiers are shown as dumb cattle, led by the evil devils-political officers. And incidentally, political officers were different. Sh*t can occur anywhere, not just among the political officers, that's why depicting them in such perverted manner looks extremely insulting. And that is exactly how they are depicted! I specifically made several screen shots so that you could see that people with the most disgusting faces were selected for the roles of political officers. I don't know, why Jaques Annaud feels personally slighted by the political officers, maybe they stole his money or a cow, but his bitter hatred for our grandfathers literally oozes from the screen! The scene where the soldiers were unloaded from the train reminded me of a mass escape from a psychiatric hospital, but not the Red Army. I don't know, perhaps the US Army troops unload in just such a manner? The scene of an attack. I was simply shocked by the fact that the attack began at the whistle of a mad officer! Who proposed this nonsense to the director? Or did he think really hard, and then couldn't come up with anything better? Probably it's what they call "artistic license". The attack itself follows the best traditions of the Western idea of how could the Russians attack. In other words - complete rubbish. Soldiers simply run as fast as they can at the machine guns, like a herd of cattle! Machine guns fire long bursts at them. This insulting stupidity, under the name of "Human Waves", was invented in the West during the times of the Cold War, and Jaques Annaud simply faithfully portrayed that fairy tale on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I must say that my review is not unbiased. I am an avid WWII historian with a deep fascination of the Russian side of it. The Russians suffered over 20 million dead in that war and bore the major brunt of the Nazi defeat, yet their contributions are virtually ignored in this country. So when I learned that a major movie was being made about the pivotal battle of Stalingrad, and from the Russian perspective no less, I was giddy as a school boy and counted the days till its release.What a letdown. I walked out of the theater feeling cheated.A brief storyline. The movie follows Vassili Zaitsev, a young Russian soldier thrown into the hell of Stalingrad. He turns out to have quite a talent for picking off Germans, and his story is latched onto by an ambitious political officer who inflates his deeds in the Soviet press to almost mythic levels. The Germans catch wind of his fame and dispatch an expert marksman of their own to bring Zaitsev down, and a duel of the Stalingrad snipers begins.First I'll point out what I liked about the movie. The technical accuracy was superb. The uniforms, equipment, and scenery were all dead on the mark (I did catch a glimpse of a Soviet helmet with a post-war Czech liner, but that's splitting hairs). They even made the effort to replicate some famous Stalingrad landmarks, and the special effects and cinematography were masterful. The highlight of the movie was when he gets off the train and sees the battered city for the first time from across a corpse-strewn river, a river that he must now cross.Now for what I hated:1. Even though the movie was taken from the excellently written and entirely factual book of the same name, the movie itself is pure fiction. In fact Zaitsev's story takes up all of two pages in the book. Much like with Braveheart they took a bare skeleton of actual events and pretty much made up everything else. This to me is a great and unforgivable sin.2. The love scene. It was totally inappropriate and unnecessary, not to mention it looked like he was killing her rather than making love to her. Did the producer hope to draw in women viewers with that crap? Certainly no war movie buffs that I know want to see that kind of garbage.3. Zaitsev's character. Vasili Zaitsev was in his 40s when this story takes place, and he was a trained sniper. He wasn't a Hollywood pretty-boy with gel in his hair.4. The ending sequence. I don't want to spoil things for anyone, but these two supposedly 'expert' snipers violate every known rule in sniperdom. They weren't quite Johnny Rambo, but the sniper game is one of stealth and patience, and neither one display it.But I guess my loudest complaint is that this movie had sooooo much potential, and this story sooooo needs to be told in this country. However, instead of sticking to the facts and appealing to purist nutcakes (like me) they had to pollute it with their Hollywood 'improvements' in an attempt to market to a mass audience, which only succeeded in alienating everybody. This could easily have become a great classic war movie like Patton or Band of Brothers, and I truly mourn for what could have been. Go out and buy the book, you will be a better person for it. Overall 2/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Harris (the Nazi) and Jude Law (the Russian) are matched against each other as World War II snipers serving their countries. Joseph Fiennes is also good in a pivotal role as is Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushchev and Rachel Weisz as a strong female character. This is a compelling look at the constantly needed reminder that simply, war is terrible and the innocent victims that suffer is even more tragic. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud's still framed direction has always lacked a depth of character development but he still makes admirable films for the high end lovers of film art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my American friends told me about this Movie I thought I might enjoy it. After 5 minutes I did not know whether to be angry or disgusted. The battle of Stalingrad(Leningrad is modern St. Petersburg up north, Stalingrad is Volgograd in Russia's south) has never before been so knowingly destroyed and revised to demonize and smear the country that won the war in Europe, and helped to fight and defeat Japan before it attacked the US in 1938-39.My family, hometown, and countrymen have never been so insulted in their fight for survival.The movie better describes a WW1 situation on the Eastern Front, not WW2, the USSR had become the largest industrialized entity on the planet by 1941. Blockaded Leningrad managed to produce its own version of an SMG even though it was mostly cut off.Germany invaded on June 22nd 1941, not 1942 as some who saw the film think. They 1st lost at Moscow and were pushed back. Hitler intended to cut off the South from the North by taking the Volga, and capture the oil rich Caucasus.He failed in all objectives, and not just in Stalingrad.True up to October 1941 Germans only suffered 1/3 the casualties of the USSR, about 300,000 compared to 850,000(plus up to 1 million people taken prisoner for their ties to the Communist Party and Army), still the greatest loss of German life since WW1. At Moscow all the Axis Nations suffered a humiliating defeat that over 4 months caused 500,000 dead/wounded/captured on the Axis Allies."Enemy at the Gates" was not interested in history.I never knew General Chuikov committed suicide, I was under the impression he lead the 62nd Army to victory. And it was not the Bureaucrat, Khruschev, who took command of the Soviet Army, but Veteran General Giorgi Zhukov, who employed massed ARTILLERY and AIRCRAFT on enemy positions. Actual Frontal Assaults never took place in the city.It was not human waves that won the battle. But Assault Squads organized for best efficiency in House to House fighting.The Germans had company. At the end of the battle an Army Group(B) of some 6 different Armies of Germans, Italians, Romanians, Hungarians, and Bulgarians surrendered.If young Russians take this movie seriously, then it is true that the Russian Educational System has fallen behind. Considering the footage of WW2 and the documentaries of it on Russian TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Been Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty solid World War II story but wasn'tas good as I hoped. It's still definitely worth a look and worth collecting if you like Word War II movies. Speaking of looks, this film got panned for its cinematography by some national reviewers because it was "too bland," but that was deliberate. It's a bland topography and a somber story. To me, it was refreshing to see a modern-day war movie with little profanity. It was supposed to be a true-life account of a Russian and German sniper going after each other. With that premise, it sounded like a taut thriller.Something was missing with this film, even though it had it's tense moments. Most of the story, not just the scenery, is drab and it takes a toll on the viewer after awhile. Perhaps it's the believability of the characters. There was no attempt by the filmmakers to have their actors sound plausible. For instance, Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz all play Russians.....with a British accent! Ed Harris plays a German with an American accent! Come on! Everyone sounded so phony it took away from the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious inaccuracies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has about as much relationship to the actual history of the Battle of Stalingrad as the "Sound of Music" has to the real von Trapp family. About the only accurate portrayal is that yes, there really was a Vasilii Zaitsev who really was one of the hero snipers of Stalingrad.Of all the errors the one I find most egregious is the complete omission of one of the true heroes of Stalingrad: Vasilii Ivanovich Chuikov, the general who took command of Stalingrad in Sept 1942. The man who declared "We will hold the city or die here; there is no land beyond the Volga!" Gen. Chuikov, whose tactics and use of "storm groups" and snipers held the desperately beleaguered city through not only house to house battles but floor to floor in the same building. To omit Chuikov from a film on Stalingrad is like omitting Patton from a film on the Allied advance across France.This is not simply Hollywood license; this is a distortion of history. It speaks to the contempt that the film's producers hold for the American viewing public that they had to use Khruschev because his name might be recognized rather than present historical fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great! Another American pro-"freedom of the rich" propaganda movie with loads of stereotypes and errors. The movie makes fun of the Soviet people and their struggle against fascism. They saved Europe from Nazism. More than 70% of the Nazi troops were annihilated on the eastern front. Unlike what most people here in the west think...Furthermore, people who don't know better are tricked to believe that the movie is accurate and that the arguments against certain political ideas are good and true. The movie also tries to be witty in its critique against the permanent struggle for a better life. The logic is: Whenever man struggles for freedom from oppression (poverty, unemployment and homelessness are also forms of oppression - only the rich are free) it fails. There's no need for even trying fighting for a better society. That's the meaning behind the movie. To make money and make soviets look evil in favor of our own "superb" society. Of course it's superb for the people who can afford to make the movie.Looks like only the ones with money can get their messages and ideas across. Both through movies and media.If anyone wants a more accurate description of the battle of Stalingrad one should see the German movie "Stalingrad". It's MUCH better. And there's no politics in that one...</fullReview>

Last weekend I was speaking with various members of a Russian WW2 re-enactment group and the subject of this film and Cross of Iron came up. Now I know why the guys were so non-committal regarding this cliché-ridden Hollywood schmaltz - British reserve! From my own limited reading about the German attempt to subdue Russia and the pivotal, drawn out battle for Stalingrad I can see why many of the comments from Russian viewers are so scathing and why they are so angry at the contemptuous way the film makers have ignored the tragic history in favour of a two dimensional war/love story.Read the comments with the filter set to "hated it" and you will see what a crime against history those involved in making this film have committed. One critic mentioned the unintentional comic moments in this badly written film - the first has just made me laugh out loud - Bob 'Oskins as Nikita Kruschev complete with cockney accent and a woolly 'at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely Inaccurate, Boring, Bad Rendition of Stalingrad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always get mad at my teachers if they rant about how historically inaccurate a movie is or how inaccurate to the book it is. But this movie makes me see why. I rented this film after doing a project on Stalingrad. I was EXPECTING inaccuracies, but oh boy how inaccurate can you get. The beginning had a good set-up, a cool map rendition of Germany's gain. Then it had an opening with the hero learning to shoot wolves with a sniper, but somehow he was afraid to shoot them. Interesting idea, but later in the movie, he is all but eager to kill the Germans. EatG then moves to him going into Stalingrad. It then gets slow and boring, and although there are tense fight scenes, in between is just a bunch of fluff. Then they decide to add in a weak love plot, which ends up being the whole movie. The ONLY movie on Stalingrad, the bloodiest battle in world history, only focuses on a dumb LOVE PLOT! But the thing that really made me see how terrible it was was the slow realization when I finally saw: this is a movie about Russians, but the characters speak English as their regular language, and have British accents. WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING THROUGH WHOMEVER'S MIND WHEN THEY MADE THIS MOVIE! I thought this movie was gonna be good, but I was blown away with how BAD it was. Do not see this movie, even if you are a Stalingrad enthusiast you will only hate it more. Rent any other film instead, this is my least favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of war movies. Especially world war II (obviously being from Russia). Let me say that Hollywood had done a great job on making WWII movies that relate to America. Congratulations to Spielberg on Saving Private Ryan, also great job Micheal Bay on Pearl Harbor. Tora Tora Tora, Midway, Ike, Tobruk, Empire of the Sun, etc. Those were all great movies. However, those were all Anglo-American battles. Lets move into the Russian front. Lets focus on Stalingrad, the biggest battle in human history to date. A battle that was fought between the two most powerful countries in the world (Germany and Russia), with the two biggest tyrants in the world (Hitler and Stalin), and with some of the finest weapons in the world. What does Hollywood do? They sh*t on it. First let me correct some historical accuracies: 1. Most of the crossing of the volga happened at night.2. In 1941, when the Germans first invaded, the red army did resort to one man having the rifle, and the other having the bullets. However by 1942, the industry in the Soviet Union rose so rapidly, that the soldiers were armed to the bone.3.The Germans spoke German, and the Russians spoke Russian. Neither of them spoke English.4. Nikita Khrushchev was nowhere near the battle. Marshal Georgi Zhukov, and General Vasili Chuikov were in charge of the battle, and in the end, Chuikov led the 62nd army to victory.5. There were no communist propaganda posters. There were war posters, urging victory.6. A ten year old kid would never run around in shorts in -40 temperatures.I could go on forever about the inaccuracies. Someone with no knowledge of history outside their country wrote the script for this. I guarantee that there is not a single Russian in the credits. As for the story of Vasili Zaitsev. He really was the best sniper in Russia at the time. He was leading a sniper school in the battle. His little sniper band was called the Hares (Zaitsev means Hare in Russian). There was more than one German supersniper sent after him, and they were all killed. The whole child spy story was a load of crap. The love story was completely unnecessary. I think the movie focused more on the love story than the actual dual. At least the love story in Peal Harbor was interesting, this one was complete schlock. Overall don't waste your money. Americans are good at making American war movies. If you want to see a movie about the Russian side of the war, look for the movie Osvobozhdenie (Liberation). Its hard to find, but its worth it. If you want to see a movie on the German side, look for Der Untergang (Downfall). Ignore this heap of garbage. My family fought in this war, and my great grandfather was in Stalingrad. This movie is a disgrace to him, to my family, and to the 22 million men who died defending Russia from the Nazi monsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film But No Classic Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked ENEMY AT THE GATES , but its flaws are very obvious . First of all is Rachel Weisz who makes a very unconvincing Soviet heroine with a very distracting upper class English accent , I guess this is to make the film more marketable to a potential female audience along with the inclusion of a love triangle which is slightly unnecessary and underdeveloped ( Witness the scene where it looks like Danilov is going to have the hero arrested as an enemy of the state and this is never followed up ? ) and did we really need to have the inclusion of a sex scene ? These small problems spoil the film somewhat and stops it becoming a classic epicNot to be negative I really did like this film for two reasons . First up is the portrayal of snipers . Once upon a time snipers were considered as being amongst an army`s bravest most competant warriors . This is still true today of course but media attention via such conflicts in Northern Ireland , the Balkans and the middle east and even recent events in America means " Sniper " is a word people associate with cold hearted murdering thugs and EATG rightly dispells this modern day myth. Secondly EATG shows us all something that is rarely seen to a western audience and that is the horror of the Eastern front during the Second world war . Hollywood would have us believe America won the second world war single handed but it was mainly the courage and sacrifice of the citizens of the USSR that was the major factor in the defeat of Hitler . The Soviet Union lost 30 million people during the war ( One in six of its citizens ) and just as many died through Stalin as through Hitler , something that is not forgotten by this film.All in all a good film but one that is inferior to CROSS OF IRON a film that I absolutely adore and consider to be the best film to feature the second world war as its backdrop</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie totally failed to engage me. The director (Jean Jacques Annaud) got himself into a confused mess when trying to make this good versus evil movie - he's comfortable depicting all Nazis as bad but he can't depict all Soviets as good and tries instead to portray a complex grey area. Unfortunately, he fails. The two characters who are battling it out (Jude Law and Ed Harris) raised no empathy with me and about halfway through the movie I realised I actually didn't care which one won provided one of them did and I could leave. The movie is also full of cliches (a love triangle, a young boy, a cold-eyed enemy, supporting characters early deaths - some of which you'll be grateful for!) and this does nothing to increase the enjoyment. Men might want to see this for Rachel Weisz as the beautiful young soldier girl and women will inevitably want to see Jude Law but find them in other films and maybe you'll be treated to a plot which you can enjoy. The only good thing about the movie is Bob Hoskins - and if that isn't a sentence to scare the living daylights out of you then you deserve this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started off with something of a bang and ended as a pathetic whimper - and in all honesty the middle was slow and torturous. Although Joseph Fienes made a reasonable effort as the ambitious love sick officer, his performance was completely nullified by Jude Law and Rachel Weisz exchanging hot glances and ladelling out their lines in a sort of South London British accent. Suspension of Disbelief was away on the Western front drinking French wine and chasing the girls. Perhaps the most appalling delivery was given by Eva Mattes (Mrs Fillipov) who was not only wooden and stilted but also fell pray to the lame brained idea that Russians are all British citizens who went on holiday and overshot Spain. The only one to really shine in the movie was Ed Harris who brings off the role of the cold blooded marksman with some style. Kudos to the casting agent who signed him on. The special effects were outstanding and I must say the battle sequences were shocking and believable, however they were too few to paper over the cracks. For most of the movie I was wondering where they had left the war. The love interest, the family drama, the personal issues ... all very diversionary but I went to see a war movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the special effects were very realistic, way too much emphasis was given to the Russian snipers dual with the German sniper. A truly great book, "Enemy at the Gates, The Battle for Stalingrad" tells the full story of the German 6th army's successful invasion deep into Russia until they were stopped at Stalingrad. While the movie concentrated on 2 central figures (the 2 snipers), the book goes much more into detail on how the Germans failed to support their flanks in the large areas outside of Stalingrad, poorly protected by their Hungarian allies. The fierce fighting to take control of the city lasted many weeks, from August 1942 thru January 1943 but it was the successful counterattacks outside the city that surrounded the 6th army and spelled its doom that was the real story of this battle. This was the most important battle of World War 2 that totally changed the momentum of the war and if you watched this movie you missed all these important facts. What happened to the 6th army after they were surrounded by the Russians and were ordered to "hold fast" and not retreat from Stalingrad while their army was still strong enough to break out and make a run for it would have made for a much more enjoyable and educational film. If you do not know the full story of Stalingrad, you can watch this film and not have a clue how the Russians end up winning this key battle (although you do learn which sniper wins the dual). If you are going to make a movie with the exact same title as the book ("Enemy at the Gates"), it would help if you followed the book a lot closer than this movie does. 2 stars out of 4 in my opinion. I was horribly disappointed in the film for those reasons. If it had followed the book, it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

The film makers are entitled to take artistic license, and although some historical characters are present in the film, it never even comes close to portraying the battle as it was. Much of the fighting lacks reality and the computer generated Stuka dive bombers attacking reinforcements crossing the Volga are totally unrealistic.The film takes a quick peek at several themes of the actual battle but explores none - including the character of Zaitsev himself, whose role in the battle was quite different from Law's character. It is worth mentioning that several other Russian snipers, in Stalingrad and elsewhere, killed many more Germans than Zaitsev. It is also amazing how many people believe that Konig is based on a real character called Hartmann, A good tale, but untrue. Still, its a decent film, but the real Stalingard epic has yet to be made</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best war movie I've ever watched!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All future war films that I watch will be forced through the sieve of Enemy at the Gates and I will be surprised if anything from America will even remotely touch the power of this film.I freely admit that I know nothing about the production except that it could not possibly have been made with American money-too many foreigners acting, too few swipes at the Russians and far too many positive comments about the hated Soviets.The opening war shots of the barges across the river ferrying fresh troops to the besieged Stalingrad was as harrowing as any war sequence that I've ever seen and to think that the reality of the Stalingrad meat grinder was vastly worse gives you chills-the landing on the shore with its inevitable battles shows reasons for the revolvers that officers carry.The second, but major section of the script, with the development of the mini-war between the German sent to Stallingrad to kill the now famous young Russian sniper provides as good a background for the remainder of the film as is possible to see in a cinema. The drama of the characters trying to play out some semblance of reality against the horrors of Stalingrad would tax the best of the best and the entire cast and crew deserve the highest accolades for their success in bringing this amazing story to the cinema.If you, as I did, miss this movie in the theatre then make every effort to rent it on video-it is brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most obvious propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I first have o admit that I was coerced into seeing this movie. I had heard many good things about it, and the fact that it wasn't an America vs. movie intrigued me. I hoped that this would be an evenly told story that had no ulterior motives. Boy was I wrong.This movie is probably one of the most obvious pieces of pro-war propaganda since John Wayne was alive. "U-571" is a little close, but nowhere near as obvious as this. Morals of the story: germans were bad, russians were good, sex leads to failure. That last one could be derived from the result of one of the funniest, and most gratuitous sex scenes in film history (including Caligula). What happened because of death? The hero couldn't perform his duties.I liked the fact that EVERYBODY spoke English. But, that paled in comparison to the fact that Finnes had a constant five-o-clock shadow, but was never clean shaven. That was amusing. The love story was lacking, the war story was lacking, about the only thing that wasn't lacking was the strange accents. The best part of the movie was that it was about propaganda. I don't know if that was supposed to have any sort of effect on the final shot.******SPOILERS******** The final shot was the ultra hero shot. With Finnes looking up and to the right (with his head at the left side of the screen), and the light glowing from the right side of the screen in his face. He's Superman!! Bleh. Also, the foreshadowing was obvious, the movie was put together so horribly that I found nothing intriguing about it. Russians are going to win, Fiennes will be the result, he'll get the girl. If you want a good war movie, rent Full Metal Jacket, Apocolypse Now, The Thin Red Line. Something not so obvious. Don't rent this tripe. 2/10</fullReview>

I haven't heard more terrible dialogue since the days I used to watch Dolph Lundgren and Michael Dudikoff B-movies. Annaud's directing is not that wonderful either. He doesn't manage to create a film as a whole but rather a blur of gun shots and big war scenes. To my great surprise the acting of Law, Fiennes, Harris and Weisz didn't help at all.

		<fullReview>i found the movie to be lacking big time in historical accuracy and realism in fight scenes. only one scene has a "big attack" by the russians where it only seems to be one block long where the rubble conveniently has made a 3 foot wall for the germans and they focus only on the main character in the movie and not what he sees when doing so (unlike saving private ryan) and the carnage? yes, you see already dead soldiers lying around but amazingly no blood or dismembered body parts all over. and how real is a fight between 2 sharpshooters where the only time you see anyone else is a phone line runner. there were about a million people with guns yet amazingly the only ones shooting are 2 or 3 characters most of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy at the Gates should have really been bombed during production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good for about 4 minutes (all action sequences). As soon as there was any character development, it bombed (when Law and Weisz are in the train going to Stalingard). It seemed that characters just showed up (Fiennes and Weisz) in weird and unmodivated/unrealistic times. The only entertainment was the sniper scenes, but of course, that isn't good enough for an entire film. The most expensive european made film was poorly written and was a waste of both the studios and my money. Weak, weak, weak. I really didn't expect expect this movie to be so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shameful bowdlerization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One is allowed some artistic license when making historical fiction, but this movie took an exciting true story and pressed it into the standard mold not just of Hollywood, but of social norms. Very often it chooses to make up a story rather than present the usually more interesting and exciting true account. Worse, it removed from the characters all those traits which didn't fit the version of history the writer wanted to tell.Let's start with the star, Zaitsev. He's portrayed as an uneducated solider with simple ways who learned to shoot as a boy. This allows him to be a moral contrast with the cynical and educated Commisar Danilov. This is the relationship the writer wanted, the common man does good versus the cynical politico.In fact, Zaitsev was an navy clerk before the war and a Sergent Major. He would have known how to read and write and would not have been shoved forward without a rifle in a suicide attack.Tania Chernova's character (Rachel Weisz) is the most bowdlerized. While Chernova was Zaitsev's student and lover, she was also a sniper of great skill with an incredible will to survive. She had a burning anger against the Germans and referred to her targets as "sticks" which she would "break". Her stories are interesting and daring as Zaitsev's own. Her introduction to Stalingrad is both true and as exciting as the one the movie makes up for Zaitsev. It is a great tragedy that she is reduced to nothing but a love interest of Zaitsev's.Stripping down Chernova's real character makes room for the largely made up Commisar Danilov. It allows Zaitsev, Chernova and Danilov to fit the conventional roles of "male hero", "female lover" and "male anti-hero".It is sad to see Hollywood take exciting, true history featuring strong male and female characters and change it into a comfortable lie. A lie about the goodly male hero who takes power from his innocence, his female lover, and their friend who is cynical and troubled because of his over-education and ambition. The standard Hollywood tropes: ignorance is strength, women are weak, too much education makes you go bad.For a much better account of the Battle of Stalingrad, please instead read William Craig's "Enemy Of The Gates" from which this movie takes it's title but from which it takes very little history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates will disappoint you if your expecting an accurate portrayal of the WWII battle for Stalingrad. The battle is used more as spectacular backdrop for its own story of a sniper duel and a love story. The movie has the feel of a New York Times bestseller, where fast paced action, plot twists, and romance, are combined into a familiar formula designed keep the audience entertained. For the most part the acting was well done, too bad no effort was made to speak one word of Russian or German or at least use an accent.The one part that this movie does shine is the set design and costumes. If you rent the DVD don't miss the behind the scenes look at how they created Stalingrad, yes, that's not a typo, they recreated Stalingrad from the ground up. That combined with excellent cinematography makes you feel like you've been transported back in time into this battle of epic proportions. Unfortunately this visual excellence makes you hunger for a deeper more realistic script. I give it 6 out 10 stars, very entertaining but falls short due to simplistic and sometimes sappy script. Well made but nonetheless a movie for the masses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mysterious thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can agree that the film has a lot of oddities from the point of history. Sure in 1942 the Russian Army did not suffer such a shortage in weapons as they did in 1941. Sure at the battle of Stalingrad officers did not say to soldiers that they would find their rifles in a battle. And special NKVD troops did not force ordinary regiments to assault shooting them from behind. They did that with the penal battalions mainly (which were formed of both officers and soldiers committed some crimes such as cowardice, looting, deserting, self-inflicted wounding and so on). But all those things did happen in the Eastern front so who cares that the did not happen at this particular place in this particular time. Anyway this war is still unknown to the West. I was pleased seeing allusions to the old neglected Russian Ballada o soldate - Ballad Of A Soldier (Jude Law resembles young Ivashov and Aliosha was a prototype for Vassiliy, both love stories started in echelon) Producers called the film a mysterious thriller and I would agree with them. The questions raised in the film stayed unanswered: Why and what for did the Russians struggled in that war and how they could win. They did not fight for loot definitely, they did not protect their rights since they did not have any. The usual Western answer (according to some books and Hollywood productions) is that they were propaganda addicted, slaves by nature, robots, speaking machines. But Law's character was not. Even a peanut named Volodia, Vassiliy's assistant, when captured by Germans did not even try to change his destiny, did not betray his friends. He put on the German uniform and was shot by the man whose life he saved. Germans kept saying that they had come to liberate them from bolshevism, Russian soldiers did not have any weapons, they suffered from propaganda and coercive violence from both their chiefs and German forces but they fought, made love, danced, survived and won many battles in comparison of which Al-Alamain looks like a petty bicker. When Tarkovskiy's Ivan returned from his missions he got a glass of vodka and a piece of bread, and sometimes a little bit of candies. Major Konig gives Sasha good portion of ham and a lot of chocolate. But Sasha helped Vassiliy and never Konig. Yes I agree that Konig's execution of the kid does not look natural. But on the other hand. What Konig was doing in Stalingrad in the middle of nowhere? Yes, he was a soldier and had to do his duty. Sure. But what should be his choice when he realized that the execution of the kid was the only way to complete his mission? Why should he stop doing his duty at this particular point? Sasha was not sure the first non-combatant kid killed by fair people doing their duty on that war. He was not even a non-combatant. Summarizing: I like the film. Actors were great (though Law was a bit emotionless trying to play innocence). It was a good try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top German and Soviet snipers hunt each other amid the ruins of Stalingrad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed most of Enemy at the Gates, but was disappointed by the conclusion. SPOILER BELOW! The story of how Vasily Zaitsev became a national hero is told well against the backdrop of the gruesome Battle for Stalingrad. The apocryphal story of Heinz Thorvald / Major Koenig's hunt for Zaitsev is the focal point of the movie.This plot device creates a number of unbelievable situations (e.g., three snipers being sent to clear a building, instead of a squad of regular infantry), but the storyteller manages to build suspense and keep it entertaining.The three leads (Law, Harris, and Weizs) all turn in excellent performances, as do Joseph Fiennes as Danilov, and the boy playing Sasha. I found myself feeling sympathy for both Zaitsev and Koenig, unusual considering that they were both fighting for despicable regimes whose barbarity is depicted unsparingly. The film accurately shows the kind of hideous stuff that happens in war without any glorification or sentiment. Like the characters, you really would rather be somewhere else.Anyone who has done any shooting will be bothered by certain technical flaws, i.e., hitting a horizontal cable at 100 meters is virtually impossible because the sniper would have to get the range exactly right. Even if he managed to aim on target, those type of sniper rifles do not group so tightly that you could hit a cable without a lucky shot. Also, Zaitsev's offhand shot at Koenig after he gets away from the stove would be unlikely to hit anything. But if it hit his hand, the bullet would break bone and sever a tendon, crippling his hand, before piercing the stock of the rifle entirely, with the remains of the bullet ripping a hole in Koenig's guts. If the metal frame of the rifle stopped it, it would still break ribs -- full sized rifle rounds have a lot of energy.But the ending really disappointed. After Danilov is slain, if Zaitsev had managed a lucky shot into Koenig's blind, this would have preserved a sense of reality. But for Koenig, drawn as patient, methodical, never makes a mistake, to leave his hide and expose himself, and for Zaitsev to do the same and take him with an offhand shot at pistol range, was just beyond loony. Both characters violated who they were in the film. This was too Hollywood "High Noon" for a film depicting otherwise believable people.Also Koenig, a regular Wehrmacht officer from an upper class family, not some Gestapo scumbag, would never hang Sasha for passing information that he fully expected him to give to the other side. At most he would take away his chocolate and tell him to get lost.But Zaitsev got the girl at the end, so I could smile. "Enemy" was entertaining, but the conclusion did not match the quality of most of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a horrible film. The first five minutes made me feel like I was watching a sequel to Saving Private Ryan, and that's fine. Though unoriginal, the gory realism of war is entertaining to watch for most violent mongering young men like me.But this movie quickly nosedives into several ludicrous sub-plots, and the battle for Stalingrad merely becomes the backdrop for two lame and hackneyed stories--a romance with two friends going after the girl, and a high-noon, Top Gun, who's the toughest guy on the block shoot-out.I came into the film expecting to be treated to lots of awesome, over-the-top battle scenes (eg Saving Private Ryan) and tense "nazis aren't a faceless enemy" (eg Thin Red Line w/Japanese soldiers) but instead get bored silly with annoying revenge cliches and cute kids. And the irritating love story and preposterous and forced mano-to-mano scenes? Don't get me started.This film hardly qualifies as a war movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is not worthy of the name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The creators of this film took one of the best books ever written about the Battle of Stalingrad and butchered it beyond recognition. Sure, the first twenty minutes were excellent, but the rest of the film was a waste of time. Yes, Zaitsev was a real person and the romance did occur, but the book gave this aspect of the battle no more than a page in total.In order to develop this Hollywood-style romance-in-war theme, most of the most fascinating and horrifying elements of the book and the battle itself were omitted from the film. The Italian, Romanian, Hungarian, and most of the main Russian and German personalities in the book were eliminated in order to develop the Russian sniper characters. Gone is the starvation, the images of people freezing to death, the cannibalism, and the real senses of fear, frustration and hopelessness so powerfully evoked in the book. It goes without saying that the horrors of the Axis soldiers' march into captivity and life in the Soviet prison camps were also allowed no place in the movie. The author, William Craig, spent several years traveling through Europe, North America, Australia, and the former Soviet Union to interview survivors of the battle, and it was a shame that almost none of his work was used for this film.Not only is there no mention of the Axis Allied troops so prevalent and important to the book, but the film gives little perspective from the German side. As with most Hollywood films, this movie shows the Germans as no more than one-dimensional, evil characters. The book shows that despite the atrocities committed by many German troops during the war, they were also human beings and some actually behaved as such. Ed Harris is brilliant as usual in his portrayal of the expert German sniper, but the character does not show the human side that the actual soldier showed in the book. They also portray him as committing war crimes in the film that others had actually committed in the book.The film does a pretty decent job of showing the suffering of the Soviet troops and people, while the acting and the opening battle scene are actually really good, which is why it does not get a 1, 2 or 3 rating. The potential was definitely there to create something on par or better than "Private Ryan," but the film's creators chose to do something more like "Pearl Harbor." It is no wonder that the film's producers waited until after the author died in order to ruin his vision.I would definitely recommend watching the first twenty minutes if you are a WWII buff or want to see something like the D-Day scene in "Private Ryan," but after that I would only stay tuned if you like love stories and clichéd WWII films. I can only hope that someday someone will decide to make a film that is more faithful to the book, because among World War II books, Enemy at the Gates is one of the few that is worthy of a far better one than this. If you really want to enjoy this movie, maybe it is best not to read the book, that way you will not be as angry and disappointed as I was.</fullReview>

This is a epic story of a subtle hero who ends up being painted, and with all right, as a god of warfare. You get to follow the Russian sniper through the battle of Stalingrad, in which he plays an very important role in taking back the Russian capital. A splendid movie that has you gripped in its immerse story-telling all the way to the end. A must see!Now all the acting in this movie are splendid and I especially liked Ed Harris and what he does with his character as the German officer who is, by his own request, sent in to terminate the Russian sniper, played by Jude Law. Law is good in his role but the real star of this movie is Rachel Weiz, who does a phenomenal job playing Jude Laws Love interest, also admired by Ralph Fines character who is one of the PR spokesmen for the Russian army.Now everything does not quite work out for Ralphs character but the end of the movie really took to my liking with him at least going with honor.

		<fullReview>The movie is a FAILURE: from the beginning, where multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to reproduce the eye-catching battle moments from "Saving Private Ryan" to the ending (as precisely pointed out by one of the reviewers here) in Clint Eastwood style. The worst stereotypes about both nations (Russian, German) propagated throughout the script; a war story brought down to the level of an output from a "versificator" machine in George Orwell's "1984". I thought I was too harsh giving it "2" (1 + 1 for Ed Harris's play - the only part worth seeing). Yet, besides watching Harris, it's a waste of time.

		<shortDescription>Could it be boring???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that has as much action as does Enemy at the Gates, in the end it's, well, boring.The actual battle of Stalingrad was epic and tragic. Historically all the elements for a powerful film exist. This movie almost starts to tell that story and then sadly slogs its way through battle scenes and over drama burdened by an odd love story/triangle that sorely lacks any kind of chemistry or interest. The result is like an odd mix of Sergeant York meets Rambo filled with Russians who have British accents.It's a shame because with an incredible cast like Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins and the always intense/powerful Ed Harris this should have been a home run. It's hard to tell if there's just not enough story to tell or the story to tell is poorly done. The acting is fine but goes nowhere. The visual are strong but that's about it.I really wanted to like this movie. I wanted it to be historically interesting told with action and plot. None of this happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty to snipe at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tries to deal with a lot of very big themes: Conflict, Romance, Rivalry, Loyalty, Self sacrifice etc, but unfortunately its elements do not gel and consequently it is a hotchpotch of ideas, poorly developed. Law's childhood experiences are shown in flashback at length then disappear without much relevance to the story, as are the brief mentions of Fiennes Jewishness or his letter rebuking Law among other things. On the other hand some things are hammered in, such as (the impossibly perfect) Rachel Weicz's high intelligence. We need to be told it again and again because we never see it. Fiennes character does somersaults, being at times, loyal then treacherous. I guess there is a point to this, in saying that love makes someone act out of character but it is not well enough developed to be convincing. Likewise the boy Sasha, as written, fails to convince; nor does his briefly appearing mother In the odd scene where she is told her son has gone over to the enemy. I'm guessing the script was trying to make some point here but I just did not get it.Nazis v commies can hardly have been an easy sell. It is hard to deal with the clash of two such unpleasant totalitarian ideologies as these without the movie-goer thinking "I hope they both lose!" Obviously the film makers tried to inject as much humanity as possible and probably veers to much into Mills and Boon territory at times ("He was a shepherd boy sniper and she was the intelligent courageous woman he loved!"). Since these days Romance means love making, a sex scene is required and is rather tacky.While I understand that this is a Hollywood fantasy-land (those looking for historical accuracy should look elsewhere) but the set and general atmosphere resembles a PC game. I would not be surprised actually it was made into one. The cityscape is more of a conquered city with a few militants holding out than one at a state of war. Apart from the opening, and a few bombing raids, no real fighting is seen, merely this duel of the rather gentlemanly snipers.Horner's music too is a self conscious effort to sound important, the main theme having more than a hint of Shindler's List about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, read the book, The War of the Rats if you want to know what really happened during the battle of Statlingrad. Obviously, this film is not the most historically accurate, thought it does have some outstanding tactical examples of small unit fighting.I could have done without the love story. What made this film good was the duel between Ed Harris and Jude Law. Rachael Weisz had a pointless role and I certainly would rather have seen more historical evidence in place of the love affair.I think the filmmakers would have done better to make the viewer understand how awful a battle this truly was. If there was a turning point on the Eastern Front in WWII, it had to be the Battle of Stalingrad. It had nothing to do with the exploits of one soldier and his girlfriend. In place of some of the overly-dramatic scenes between Russian soldier and commissar, how about showing the audience more background on things such as the German Wehrmahct's tactical supremacy over the Red Army, or the Soviet leadership's inability to lead.Still, this was more entertaining than it was good, and I found my viewing to be enjoyable.</fullReview>

Also Ed Harris did a great performance, one of the best characters in the film. Besides all this, the movie is okay, but they could have done a lot better.

		<shortDescription>An Epic That Might Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultimately this attempt, though well intentioned, was a disappointment. I read William Craig's book back in the seventies, in fact it was the first serious book I'd ever read, so when the movie came out, I was eager to see it. Making a movie about the Battle of Stalingrad is an obviously difficult thing to do--much harder than D-Day, or likely any other battle, the scope of the thing is hard to fathom. So, in essence, they didn't film the battle, but rather tried out a metaphorical battle--one between two snipers rather than two massive armies. The first ten or twenty minutes sets some of the stage, but the context is largely left out. Just the fact that they made a movie about one totalitarian brutal vicious regime in a death struggle with another totalitarian brutal vicious regime is something of a daring task, at least for American audiences--since we, as a rule, don't have much use for totalitarian brutal vicious regimes. It gives no real hero to root for--they try to make up for this by making Jude Law, the Russian sniper, just a poor rural boy caught up in things he doesn't understand and sets him up against an aristocratic German Nazi who's obviously somewhat gung ho about his work. They also try and make up for the brutal context by adding in an insipid love story that overclouds other very positive elements of the movie. The movie makers should have done a number of things: First they should have watched "Cross of Iron" by Sam Peckinpah, the only other western movie I can think of depicting the Soviet-Nazi conflict (the "eastern front"). I'm sure there are many movies, just very few that are played in the U.S. In Cross, they put a number of men in an impossible situation, and don't try and gloss over the nature of the conflict--it just is. The next thing they should have done is rewritten the entire premise--bringing Stalingrad down to just two snipers shooting at each other is an interesting concept, but it undercuts the vastness of the battle; maybe they were trying a metaphor, or some such nonsense, but it seems they just wasted a rather impressive set that could really have depicted the battle with some accuracy. I found it ironic that the Russians spoke in English accents, since, for some reason, as a rule, Nazis seem to speak in English accents in many WWII movies--not a criticism, just an interesting reversal.Any movie about Stalingrad is likely worth seeing, if only because Americans don't usually know much about it, we could benefit from some more info on the subject. But this movie is so much less than it could have been. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A heinous waste of time. Other than a few very brief scenes they manage to make the Battle of Stalingrad, often described as the most horrific episode in the history of the world, seem "lovably rustic." For the middle 8/10 of the film you have no sense that people are starving, thousands are being slaughtered, the very existence of the Russian nation is at stake. They pay lip service to these facts, but all you see is the unspeakably juvenile love triangle between the three leads. If they want to show us "the human face of war" the least they can do is make the relationships slightly more complex than an episode of Blind Date. And the only civilians shown live in a wonderful little cellar that's spacious and comfortable enough to make most Manhattan residents jealous. Want an example of how bad and predictable the action sequences are? A:"Stay down." B:"Oh no, the planes are coming." A:"Don't move, the sniper will shoot you!" B: "We have to run, the planes are coming!" A:"Don't move! The Sniper!" B: "I must run!" If you don't see that B is going to get a bullet in the head at the end of this, then maybe you'll find this a gripping suspense film. The worst sin of the movie? Instead of showing us the struggle of two opposing soldiers set against the backdrop of a sweeping historical event, they make the historical event ALL about the two men, even saying (over and over and over) "Whichever sniper wins, that will decide the war!" Talk about delusions of grandeur, the struggle of tens of millions of people mean nothing against the fates of two men who have such rugged good looks and great agents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uh, guys, there's a war on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt the title is an indication of what the film would LIKE to be about. The Germans forces were indeed "at the gates" - they are on the verge of capturing Stalingrad, they would lay siege to Leningrad, and at one point even Moscow appeared to be in danger. The situation was desperate. But after we're told all this, the position of the German army turns out to have no more to do with the story than the position of the sun in the zodiac. After a bitter, violent battle over - well, we're never told - nothing of a military nature happens again. Not even offstage. (Until the end, when, after a brief "offensive" of unfathomable significance, an epilogue tells us that the Germans were repelled from after all.) All the action in Stalingrad freezes so that we can watch a protracted duel between a Russian and a German sniper.Now I'm prepared to believe that snipers played a valuable role in this kind of warfare - I wouldn't know - but Vassili's primary value, we must assume in the absence of information to the contrary, is as propaganda - a means of keeping up the morale of the local troops. But there's something circular here. The snipers are the only people we see doing any actual fighting, and by the end of the film they seem to be devoting all their efforts to shooting a German sniper who is in turn doing nothing but trying to shoot Vassili. What does ANY of this have to do with, you know, the invasion?The fact that the troops of a hostile foreign power are on Russian soil (they haven't yet been defeated, and it looks to be only a matter of time before even Moscow would be overrun) doesn't seem to motivate the characters to do much. Nobody makes a single decision for the good of the war effort as a whole. Danilov builds up the Vassili legend because of personal feelings and is ready to tear it down later for other personal reasons; Tania wants to kill Germans - kill them herself, by hand, rather than help her fellow soldiers as best she can by working in intelligence - because they killed her parents; Danilov tries to transfer her to a safer job not because that's where she should be (it's a mere coincidence that that IS where she should be), but because he's hitting on to her; Vassili's heart isn't in the duel with the German sniper until he has a casual acquaintance's death to avenge. When Sacha's mother is told that her son is a traitor (now serving the forces who have bombed the city she grew up in to rubble), her only reaction is, "Perhaps he'll be safer with them than with us." Wherever we look, we see dreary personal concerns. Did any of these people notice that the enemy IS at the gates?If Anaud was trying to make his characters more plausible by making them pettier, he failed. When Sacha tells a third party what we supposedly already know - that Tania is in love with Vassili - it came as news to me. I hadn't seen any insipient love anywhere. I suppose I ought to have worked it out, by assuming that the single female character must be there to fall in love with someone and using a process of elimination to work out who it was (she plainly didn't care for one of the two candidates, therefore she must be head over heels with the other one), but really, even in a movie as dull as this, I have better things to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another prime example of why I hate Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" may be seen by your average historian as a good war movie. Things like "based on a true story" heighten it to some level of importance and integrity. The reality of it, and many films like it, is that it's just another cliched, contrived piece of Hollywood claptrap that is neither interesting nor inspiring. Put aside all of the hollywoodishness of the story structure and style of the movie, it fails on a geometric level to even maintain the casual viewer's interest with entertainment value. Whether this was made by a huge corporation which recycles film formulas or not, "Enemy at the Gates" is quite tedious. The "love story" is hackneyed and unengaging because of it's own cliche. The set-ups are never paid off with satisfactory conclusions. The characters are uninteresting because they wallow in their own cardboard cut-outness. This isn't even a good Hollywood movie. In terms of style, one can sense the "Private Ryan" rip-offs running amok. Huge explosions and gunshots are filmed at a similarly fast frame rate as the battle sequences in "Saving Private Ryan". Now, despite all of the cliches and imperfections of "Private Ryan", that film DID break new ground with it's style and vivid battle sequences which linger with the viewer long after the closing images. "Enemy at the Gates" is just a boring, uninteresting retread of war movies and pointless love-triangles that is as much a failure to innovate as it is to captivate and entertain. It's just another example of why I hate Hollywood and avoid it as much as I can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tried to be too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't a bad movie. I enjoyed much of it. I thought it captured some of war's grit and horror and the performances by Jude Law and Ed Harris were good. Bob Hoskins was great. I thought Rachel Weisz was also good but the rather sappy love story placed inside of this movie slowed the action and disrupted the flow. The story for me was about the duel between the two snipers. The love interest could have been introduced and used as in a minor way, such as giving Vassili a reason to want to live, but it took up too much of the screen time thus confusing the main point of the movie. Was it a war movie or a love story? It tried to be both and failed to gel into a whole movie. Still it was worth watching. War movie fans will have to suffer through the sap while love story fans have to endure the gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie about the Battle of Stalingrad 1942 World War II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible cinematography!!, High level acting!! and excellent directing!! really good war and historical film!.In this film i found an incredible representation of the Battle of Stalingrad, maybe the bloodiest battle in human history; with so touching scenes that will make you feel highly impressed about this war. The heroic acts of Vassili Zaitzev, are pretty well represented bye Jude Law; the cruelty of the war and its tactical movements are well shown here; with scenes that freeze me, like the killing of the soldiers that cowardly and scared retired from battle; and the air attack to the Russian boats.The movie is about Vassili Zaitzev (Jude Law), a great Russian sniper in the Battle of Stalingrad against the Nazi Germans, and who maintained a sniper's duel with a great German Nazi sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris), Vassili make a friendship with political officer Danilov, that publish constantly his killings and gave hope to a country that was being invaded by a Nazi empire! About the acting: Jude Law, simply, the best actor in the movie, showing a deep and very human side of a great soldier. Joseph Fiennes, really good as political and intelligent Russian reporter and publisher. Ed Harris, impacting and cold as his character, Rachel Weisz, good acting as a strong and passionate woman. Bob Hoskins and Ron Perlman are good too.Jean-Jaques Arnaud makes it excellent again! 8/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy at the Gates is no enemy of mine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a war-movie buff like me, you've seen just about all of them: Saving Private Ryan, Hart's War, Windtalkers, Men of Honor, A Few Good Men, We Were Soldiers, U-571--for time and interest' sake, I'll stop there, even though I could rattle titles off for pages and pages to come. Enemy at the Gates has joined the ranks of these unforgettable war films, which set themselves apart from other films in the genre because men in spit-polished shoes at shoot- 'em-ups is not all that is required. A compelling story has to be the very foundation of the film, there has to be at least a meager amount of activity going on outside of the battle, to serve as a distraction from the chaotic and war-torn events. Enemy at the Gates has the upper-hand to begin with, boasting a powerful concoction of your better actors--Jude Law (The Aviator), Ed Harris (A History of Violence), Joseph Fiennes (The Great Raid), Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener) and Bob Hoskins (Mrs. Henderson Presents). Its nail biting twists and turns will arrest your attention throughout this solidly-written script by Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) and Alain Godard (Two Brothers), with more than a few unexpected surprises. To keep the ladies immersed until the end of the 131-minute movie, it even has a little romantic sub-plot, which potentially turns out to be the bewitching undoing of the lead character.The battle takes place during World War II in Stalingrad, Russia, with sharpshooter Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) almost single-handedly bagging the bodies as promptly as they arrive, though things start to look grim for the Russian troops when the Germans move inward, and Commander Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) devise a "brilliant" plan to boost the hope of the civilians with propaganda-laden newspapers. Let the publicity began!Day after day, the underground newspaper reports on the finest soldiers and their number of kills, with the poster-boy Vassili's mug shot on the front page. But it wasn't all work and no play for Vassili. He drudged on like any soldier at war, and even had a little time for a sweet romance with a neighboring soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz)--though the citizens of the Iron Curtain weren't the only ones reading the tabloid. The German army had been following the heroic efforts of the Russians and had a hero of their own to trumpet, courtesy of Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a highly-focused soldier who obviously worked his way to the top by being the best at what he did as a marksman. He was sent in to counter the efforts of Russia's finest, whatever the cost, and pulled every trick out of his arsenal to ensure Vassili's defeat, which quickly turns into a game of cat-and-mouse.The performances in this motion picture were stunning to watch. Jude Law's character starts to develop early on in the film and continues until the curtain comes down and the lights go up, it'll linger with you. And veteran Ed Harris as Major Koenig dazzles with mystique, and an almost expressionless face that speaks loudly (not to mention how charming he looks in a uniform). The location wasn't too shabby either; the scenic mood feeling raw with muted colors, taking you back half a century with the help of Cinematographer Robert Fraisse (Hotel Rwanda).Enemy at the Gates is no enemy of mine. It'll shake you loose of the slop-stitch handiwork that you have become accustomed to, and raise the bar for craftsmanship in quality movie- making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vivid portrayal of an aspect of WW2 rarely seen in western movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This move is not for the squeamish. It portrays the horrors of war very explicitly. It is in my experience quite a rare one too. I've never seen a WW2 film from the Russian side before and was worth watching for that alone. One is left with the distinct impression that Russian soldiers were just as likely to be killed by their own army as the Germans. It is well known that the Soviet army suffered the heaviest losses in WW2 but in seeing this movie, especially the opening scenes, one cannot wonder at it when you see unarmed infantry being sent into enemy fire under orders to pick up a weapon when an armed comrade is killed. For them it must have been worse than 'going over the top' in WW1! The sheer callousness of the Stalin regime is brought out very strongly in this film. Mosty of the film of course was about the snipers. That was very vividly portrayed with lots of tension without losing pace even though it included a story of love and jealousy between two of the key characters. On the whole it was an excellent film that held me to my seat more so than anything I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Taut, Gritty War Movie Screaming to Come Out of a Drekky Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "Enemy at the Gates" with my husband, as I knew it was about his favorite battle of his favorite war that he watched continually on the Military Channel. After having to endure a harangue the whole way to the screen about how we would be seeing the real battle that won the war, not that inconsequential D-Day that "Saving Private Ryan" made such a big deal about as the U.S. didn't come in until the Russians already had turned the tide, I asked could he please be quiet during the movie and refrain from commenting on inaccuracies, etc. until after. But other than the clarification I needed between the Battle of Leningrad and the Siege of Stalingrad which I always mix up (whoops, I think I just did it again), and Hitler's and Stalin's fallacies as military leaders in relation to the symbolic importance of the Volga (and the movie could have used more strategic explanations), he and I pretty much agreed about the movie.There's a taut, gritty war movie screaming to come out of a drekky melodrama. The best parts are the battles, of troops and individuals. The opening sequence of soldiers thrown from trains to boats to the front line is terrific and frightening.The one-on-one between Ed Harris's Nazi sharpshooter and Jude Law's hunter (though he doesn't do working class too convincingly) is exciting.The most captivating surprising is Bob Hoskins as Krushchev. He completely inhabits the character and brings him completely to blood and guts life - showing just what it takes to survive as a top man to Stalin.There was also more potential in Joseph Fiennes' political officer as insight into propaganda that is only occasionally effective (after all, "Ryan" was similarly about a PR stunt).I thankfully dozed off during most of the ridiculous sub-plot of the love triangle. There appears to be only a couple of women living in this city, and they sure do get in the way, as these few can themselves provide multi-lingual translations, sex, food, lousy child care and brave sharpshooting.The music by James Horner is atrociously bombastic, wincibly so.(originally written 3/31/2001)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Loving it when Watched the Fourth Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am biased, obviously. I watched the movie in the movie theater when it first came out. I watched it on my brother's 14 inch flat screen monitor. Then when it was inexpensive enough, I bought the DVD . I watched the DVD again and again, and I still love it. I would share with you some few memorable moments in this wonderful movie.The first glimpse of Hellish Stalingrad:In the beginning, there was a scene that I thought was very powerful when I first watched "Enemy at the Gate" in the theater. When the Russian soldiers were shipped in to fight in Stalingrad, the box cart was locked from the outside. Then when it arrived at Stalingrad, the soldiers were let out. The camera shows the horrified faces of the soldiers as they got the first glimpse of the city. (I asked myself, WHAT WHAT is going on? What do they see?) Then finally the camera panned to show what the soldiers saw. And the dark hellish city in turmoil really hit me. I thought it sets up the mood of the battle in Stalingrad very effectively. But I think this could only be achieved on a big screen, like in a theater or in a good home theater.The sex scene: My wife and I both agree that this was one of the hottest sex scenes we have ever seen in movies. The setting was not romantic the least bit, i.e. among sleeping soldiers, no privacy. There was little actually nudity, or action. But the intensity between them was just incredible. If you have eyes for subtle but intense love scene, you should also check out Horse Whisperer.I thought the movie was smart, the story engaging, the actors were good. I would love to see more material in the extra feature. Overall it is a timeless piece of work that is worthy of collection for even people who do not love war movies.</fullReview>

(at the end it's OK :d)and that's just the beginning... really a lot of historical failures, one more, really bad one: what's all that lipstick on her in war and battle???in general, if you don't know anything about history, quite watchable, for me mainly because of Ed Harris...5/10</fullReview>

You can spend tons of money,use many high-tech special effects in a war movie like the one in 'Saving Private Ryan',but a war movie should not support one side and glorify militarism.Because of this 'Enemy At The Gates' is the best war movie that's been made in last 10 years in my opinion...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I paid my money to go and see this movie, with the feeling that i was going to get a raw and savage account of the realism of Stalingrad. From the outset it was clear that i was going to get a little less than i expected ! The special effects were fantastic, and the acting of Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes was second to none. I never really became involved in this movie, but saying that, i was never bored. The combination of good acting and great special effects were well worth ?4 of my well earned money. The problem i found with this film was that it wasn`t real enough. It was hard for me to suspend my disbelief at a "cockney" Krushcev, and even harder for me to swallow the rather dull and "Titanic" like love story ! Like most of these so called war classics, it started off with real promise and ended unconvincingly ! Despite this, i thought that this movie was pulled together simply because of its acting, the tension that is built up between Harris and Law, is what i paid to see !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining, edge of the seat adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read mixed reviews of this movie...so weren't expecting too much. What I got however exceeded all my expectations. Enemy at the gates is an entertaining edge of the seat adventure that never gets boring. Go to the cinema to enjoy yourself in an exciting action packed movie. However don't expect a history lesson. Despite its grand scale battles the movie is very inaccurate. Excluding the fact that annoyingly all the actors have either American or British accents there are many other goofs such as the fact that the Russian soldiers sing the Soviet anthem...when that had been written until AFTER the Second World War. You would think that with so much money spent on this movie the producers would have realized such a gaping error! The amateur script also lets down the experience a tad...with Jude Law limited to some really terrible lines which sound even worse with his very British accent. Nevertheless despite these cons there are enough pros in the movie to make this a damn fine flick! Ed Harris is superb as the Nazi sniper sent into kill Law, Rachel Weisz is stunning as the love interest, the music (although rejects from Apollo 13) is very moving and the action scenes are superbly recreated. All in all this is worth a price of a cinema ticket. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very effective thriller with only a few dead spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Vassili Zaitsev first arrives at the Russian front in Stalingrad, he finds himself stuck in one man's land and, before returning to his own lines, takes out five officers with one rifle. Looking for a morale booster, Political Officer Danilov uses Vassili as a hero to spur the other men on. However when the Germans' morale falls due to the snipers, they bring in Major Konig, an expert sniper, to hunt down and kill the Russian hero. Thus begins a game of cat and mouse between the two men.For some strange reason I had got the impression that this film was slow, overlong and dull. I can't remember where I got that impression from (maybe unfair critics?) but it stopped me going to the cinema to see it. As it was, I really enjoyed the film and was very pleasantly surprised by just how good it was. I expected something full of pretension and long, slow pauses but instead it was am effective little thriller which was tight in the right places and only a little baggy and slow at times.The film manages to give a good impression of the war in Stalingrad and, while not totally up to `Private Ryan' shock power, the opening 15 minutes are very realistic and very powerful. After this point the cat and mouse game is simply done but pretty exciting. The only aspect that I felt slowed things down a tad was the romantic subplot involving Tania. This didn't help the pace of the film but, with the way the film goes, was a necessary part of the plot overall.The cast are good all round, with even small roles taken by well known actors. Law is very good in the lead and he holds the attention well whether lying totally still or having a crisis of confidence. Fiennes is not quite as good but is still OK, his character is less clear and is very much secondary to Law's. Weisz is OK but it is hard to accept her clean skin and beauty in a character such as hers, she doesn't do a bad job, but I think it could have been better with someone else. Although Harris doesn't say very much he has a great screen presence and his character is strong for that as opposed to development. The support cast includes Bob Hoskins and Perlman.Overall this is not a perfect film but it is very atmospheric, with a great sense of time and place and the main game of cat and mouse is very enjoyable and quite tense. Much better than I expected it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the pitch:A game of cat-and-mouse = great! A game of cat-and-mouse between two snipers = even better! Make it a true story = whoa! Make it a war story = WHOA! Shoot it on rarely seen actual locations = hubba hubba! Cast it with an international A-list = excellent! Include perennial Academy-Award nominee Ed Harris = superb! Make the antagonist a Nazi = should be no problem for an audience to want to see HIS comeuppance!And now ... make the protagonists a Communist sniper and a Communist propaganda officer (Law and Fiennes, respectively)!This is exactly the task that director Jean-Jacques Annaud faced with ENEMY AT THE GATES. How does one make a movie where the GOOD guys work for Stalin, one of the most hideous human beings ever to walk the earth?Answer: Start with the script. By making the decision to give Mr. Fiennes and Mr. Law's characters dimensionality through love and friendships, the script is creating characters the audience can relate to. By the simple act of withholding the same information about Mr. Harris' Nazi, the script makes him a more dangerous antagonist who is already cold hearted and cunning (he uses a child to his advantage in a much more effective way than your standard movie villain). Throw in a woman who is unwilling to sit on the sidelines as war threatens to determine her fate (Weisz), and you have four compelling characters to lead your story.Next comes casting. Casting an actor that the audience inherently has come to trust over the years - Ed Harris - as a Nazi sniper antagonist, adds dimension to the film. All of a sudden, the audience is asked to take sides, not merely shoved one way or the other.Next comes the setting. By choosing to set the film in a place that is cold, unforgiving, and unrelenting on its best days (not to mention war) adds necessary tension and desperation. Then throw in utterly graphic and realistic war violence. Take all this and wrap it around a true story and you have a combination that should make an audience's stomach tie itself in to knots.Finally, hire a director. Who better for this hard-to-sell story than a man who has made a career out of untellable stories such as THE BEAR and QUEST FOR FIRE?Finally, then ... an undeservingly overlooked film that is certainly better than most everything else on the shelves of your local video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1 of 10. Don't trust the positive reviews. From beginning to end, this movie is dull, boring, derivative and uninspired. The characters aren't introduced properly, their actions remain erratic, their motives unclear. Ed Harris' performance, though not excellent, is the only one standing out in a star-powered yet helpless cast. James Horner's music is a wrap-up of previous works of his, mostly Titanic, lacking almost every possible bit of originality.The movie lacks pace, most of all, and the entire situation seems rather unrealistic - where's the battle, where's the fight? The sets may seem impressive, the effects solid, yet not breathtaking, money surely went into this. But money isn't enough.It's not about just telling a story about aspects of the Stalingrad battle. It should be about doing it right, making a great film instead of just telling a story. This is nothing but a piece of uninspired Euro-Trash, unable to hold up to films like Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart. I won't say not to watch it, on the contrary: It can be extremely funny, unintentionally, for it is truly, sadly, really bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So fluffy cuddly Jude Law is cast in the role of a ruthless Soviet sniper - yeah right, except you hardly get the chance to see him pull a trigger - no doubt because the producers felt that to see him shooting people would make him less lovable. Rachel Weisz appears as the love interest, with a smudge of dirt above one eyebrow to show how much she has suffered as a Red army soldier - the pair of them look like they belong at an English garden party rather than the siege of Stalingrad. There is no insight into Law's character except for some contrived flashbacks of him shooting a wolf with his granddad and no explanation of how he developed into a sharp- shooter. Even the action scenes are badly directed with little or no tension. Miscast, misdirected and poorly scripted, it left me rooting for the Nazi sniper just to put an end to this whole sorry farrago as he gives the only credible performance in the whole movie. This film doesn't even begin to tell the true story of Stanlingrad or the heroic resistance of the Russian people against Fascism. As for the tacked-on happy ending, this just reveals the whole enterprise for the cynical load of Hollywood dross that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Open these gates and let people in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching such films as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Patton;" I have come to appreciate war films. For this reason, I decided to see the latest war film, "Enemy At The Gates.""Enemy At The Gates" may be one of the best war films I have seen since "Saving Private Ryan" because it is executed perfectly. With incredible performances, script and the impact I felt; "Enemy At The Gates" sets the tone as the first great war film of the 22nd century. This film can be served as the appetizer to the main course coming out soon, "Pearl Harbor."Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins come together to re-visit the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The best thing about seeing each one of the actors perform was they all gave 100 percent effort to make the film as real as possible; they did an excellent job. Fiennes, Weisz and Hoskins were the icing to a cake that was delicious from the start.The highlights of "Enemy At The Gates" always came when Law and Harris were on screen because they played excellent psychological mind games with one another to win; furthermore, it was like watching master chess players playing for the grand prize. It was also enjoyable to see the strategies and tactics each would use to out-maneuver the other."Enemy At The Gates" drew me with its many action sequences similar to those in "Saving Priate Ryan." Also, the love triangle between the three main leads was interesting to watch and see how it would unfold. I felt like I was in the movie because the writer did an excellent job at making me feel exactly what they felt and experience what they were going through.There is no rule that states dialogue is needed for a successful film. While "Enemy At The Gates" has dialogue, the scenes that have none stand out in my mind the most because we see close-ups of both snipers and the expressions on their faces. This is incredible to me because the intensity shown on their faces speaks volumes about what the movie is really about.This may not be the best war film ever made but with two of the brightest young stars on the rise, an actress that is here to stay and a veteran that continues to turn in knock-out performances, "Enemy At The Gates" will be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Tribute To A Brave People: One Wolf At A Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Let's get the objections out of the way: it is just like real war: dark, ugly, gory, brutal and cruel. I hope I can show you why it is one of my favorite war movies. The opening image is the essence of Vassili, his failure to shoot the wolf to protect his grandfather's horse. If you grasp this metaphor, which is his character, this is why his constant self-doubt and worry consume him. The characterizations are just like real people not the typical Hollywood heroes and villains. SPOILER: Danilov kills Konig not Vassili, the movie shows you that he had not a prayer against icy Konig who was a sniper instructor. Danilov realizes he will never get Tania who loves Vasseli, Danilov stands for certain death and defeats Konig by spotting him for Vassili. This is why it is such an accurate tribute to the brave Russian people who worked together against the Nazi's superior equipment. The director, bravely, resists the temptation to paint Vassili as a superhero. By the end of the movie, Law conveys his character's desperation that Khruschev is growing impatient: what is taking so long? Stalin is tired of waiting: shoot him already! They work together just as the Russian people did in real life. Their collective bravery turned back the Nazi juggernaut; the turning point will always belong to their brave ancestors. Be warned, it is not idealized, it is filled with gory violence and hideous imagery, the worst being the quisling little boy whom Konig hangs from a lamppost as a warning. The Russians are not glamorized, Stalin's policy of shooting all troops who dared to retreat is on full display on the boat and in the city. Hoskin's Khrushchev steals the movie as one nasty piece of work, when one commander fails to stop the running away, Hoskins storms into his office. He proffers a handgun,"Perhaps you would like to cut through the red tape?" As he leaves the office, we hear the gunshot. The officers are all shaking and cowering before this legendarily ruthless man. Only Danilov has the guts to put forward Vassili as a positive example. The movie follows the duel between the Nazi's Major Konig, played like walking Ice by Harris, and Vassili. Konig's ruthlessness extends to his own kind, using one of his own corpses to try and ambush Vassili in the factory. I also loved the truth of the movie, Vassili warns Tania that the faces of his victims stay with him forever. After Tania relays the horror visited upon her family, he wordlessly hands her a sniper's rifle in reply. The only levity is Perlman's character who had the misfortune to be in Moscow training when Germany violated their alliance with Moscow and turned upon their former ally. Perlman recounts the comedy of returning under the worst of circumstances: an accused spy now.I understand the objections, many of them obtain, it is an ugly, depressing and bloody movie. Yet, it is a great tribute to the brave Russian people who turned back the Nazi hordes; if they had not stood so bravely, and taken so many deaths, who knows how the war would have turned out? These characters are complex, Vassili ultimately fails and is saved by Danilov who gives his life for his country. Little gestures of sacrifice fill the movie, dying men throwing their rifles to the next man, the biggest weakness is the slow ending. It features horrifically realistic imagery, not for children in the slightest. Even Konig, though a monster, is kind to the little boy right up until he hangs him for trying to set him up for Vassili. It is my favorite war movie for its realism and its ugly honesty about war. It is just like this: chaos, betrayal, nobility, depravity and bravery. Vassili is rendered as a deeply flawed, self-doubting human being who hates being drawn as a hero. One fateful display of his shooting skill, in front of Danilov, seals his fate. He is forever that little boy in the snow who failed his grandfather. This is a real hero, not a Hollywood cartoon; his nobility comes from his never giving up. A dark, ugly but noble tribute to a brave people who stood and died for the rest of the world. They have all gone to their rewards by now but we still remember them. Sometimes, one wolf at a time is the difference between victory and defeat. A Great Tribute To A Great People.

		<shortDescription>Hugely efficient war movie, with thorough authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This effective movie has a great, epic background over which to play the story - the battle of Stalingrad in World War II, which left the city in smouldering ruins and hundreds of soldiers (on both sides) dead. Like with most modern blockbusters, the budget is big (the biggest in Europe, it has been said), and there are plenty of authentic bombing raids and gun battles in this action-packed movie which only slightly drags towards the end. CGI fighters spit bombs down on to the ruined streets and the smoke from dozens of explosions fills the sky to great effect in some truly breath-taking battle sequences. The film doesn't shy away from the violence either, preferring to show in graphic detail the sight of bullets erupting through bodies and exploding heads, blood everywhere, particularly in a disturbingly realistic scene showing enemy fire peppering a group of soldiers huddled together on a boat.Over this intense background plays a story that is in parts a thriller, a tragedy, and a romance. The various plot strands are mingled perfectly to make one smooth-running film as a whole with well-drawn characters you can really care about. In particular, Jude Law gives a convincing portrayal of an innocent farmer boy, initially terrified out of his life when he is thrown headlong into battle, and gradually turning into a war hero through the propaganda of his friend Danilov (an understated and effective turn from Joseph Fiennes).The initial sequence in which Law proves his worth as a sniper is an excellently-shot piece of action. Into the story comes Rachel Weisz, as the love interest, a female Russian soldier, and there's even a love triangle thrown in there too for good measure between her, Law and Fiennes. However, most scenes are stolen by Ed Harris (looking very much like Anton Diffring) as Major Konig, a German war hero and top-notch sniper who engages in some tense and suspenseful cat-and-mouse games in the rubble of Stalingrad, sequences which are the best in the movie. Good support comes from a near-unrecognisable Bob Hoskins as Khrushchev, and Ron Perlman as a fellow sniper with a mouth full of metal teeth.ENEMY AT THE GATES is a well-made and intelligent blockbuster, convincingly portraying the realism of the war, peppered with many memorable scenes such as the macabre image of a young boy hanging from ruins on the horizon. Although the outcome is to be expected, the journey there is an eventful and often surprising one and never less than watchable. A shame that all modern blockbusters aren't often as intelligently scripted or acted as this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friends are enemy's at the gates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the gates is a dramatic WWII story of a Russian sniper and journalist and how they become friends and attempt to survive the war against the attacking Nazi war machine. But after the boys survive a massive German attack they make their way back to the base the journalist writes the story of the sniper and he becomes a hero of Stalingrad. Once the sniper becomes an icon he is used as propaganda just as much as he is a weapon of war.The story takes place in Stalingrad in Russia 1942 our main characters are Vassili the sniper commissar Danilov the journalist Major Konig the Nazi sniper and Tania the female sniper. The movie takes place in multiple places throughout Stalingrad.Jude law the man who Vassili did a phenomenal job just like the rest of the actors ED Harris (major Konig) Rachel weisz (Tania) and Joseph Fiennes (commissar Danilov) all did a fantastic job really pulled me into the film and got me invested.I have an overall interest in WWII history and I love to see it brought to life on the big screen. Especially since it is a representation of real events. If you have an interest in this type of film you will be invested into every second of every scene.One thing everyone needs to realize when watching a film like this is how the people effected felt, how it changed every aspect of their life. But during all of that you have to keep moving on and stay alive and moving.I would recommend this movie for someone looking for a history lesson on something they don't teach much of in school, I would give it a rated R rating because it has sensitive but it is well worth the watch.I could give it a B+ or an A it is a really good movie.I am Jordan Zimmerman and I'm a senior in high school, I'm working as a cook in a bar I love WWII history and continue to study the subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in extreme tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean Jacques Annaud's Enemy At The Gates makes a harrowing impact on the WWII genre, with a scope and vision that successfully transports us to the nightmarish battle of Stalingrad, near the tail end of an era of never ending bloodshed and terror. The large scale battle scenes which usually populate this type of film have been distilled into a much more intimate and exciting style of confrontation: elite sniper warfare. In the hollow, ash laden shell of a once great city, Russian patriot and expert sharpshooter Vassily (a barely acceptable, miscast Jude Law) tries to survive a nerve rattling battle of both the will and the gun against the German's answer to his legendary tactics, icy Major Koenig (a primal Ed Harris). Another man, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) is a brainy scholar who spins tales of his friend Vassily's heroic exploits to stir Russia into a frenzy effort in the desperate final weeks of the war. The two are steadfast friends and vital assets to both each other and their country, until of course, a girl comes between them. Tania (Rachel Weisz) is a Jewish soldier who falls deeply in love with Vassily, boldly acted by her in a powerfully affecting sex scene that shows what passion Rachel is capable of in her work. She has the skill to turn a character that's purposefully written to fail the Bechtel test miserably into something more than the script ever envisioned, and is one of the best actresses working today. There's a grouchy supporting turn from Bob Hoskins as an infamous military higher up, and a brief but memorable appearance by Ron Perlman as a disillusioned Russian soldier who's taken enough crap and seen too much. What makes this film such a winner is the excruciatingly suspenseful sniper battle between Vassily and Koenig, each a coiled viper of awaiting violence, scanning the horizon along with the camera, breaths drawn alongside the audience, ready to spring into explosive action and knock our socks off in one of the most impressive wartime duels in cinema. It's been said that the purest form of war is one on one. This film takes that notion and runs laps with it, throwing unending tension at us that doesn't let us go from its vice grip till the blood flows in tandem with our ragged exhales, long pent up in clammy apprehension.</fullReview>

Law is the prized Russian marksman, Perlman his brazen buddy, Weisz his possible love interest, Fiennes a true believer and Hoskins a solid Krushchev. On the other side Harris is the uncompromising German sharpshooter sent to end Law's run. This is done so realistically that it really doesn't matter how factually accurate it is, it is much more about atmosphere and feel so that individual facts per se are irrelevant. Everyone, including Weisz, Law and Harris are so damn good. A sometimes unpleasant but always gritty and unique look at the nastiest battle in modern warfare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We ran out of movies to watch that were available and thought we would take a punt on this film. However, we switched it off and watched some comedy instead after watching 1 hour into the film. Although the storyline was promising and the initial acting was OK, it was extremely off-putting to have British and American accents in a film that was based on a German army invading Russia...the authenticity in the acting is just not there (compared to Downfall for example, which is much better made and acted in the home language, German). It appears the Director was just relying on heavy hitting actors to pull the weight rather than thinking about the accents they actually had. For example, a Russian soldier ran into a building and then commented about how he had been shot through his "pants" referring to trousers (very American). Whilst most people wouldn't care about these things, I do pay great attention to detail and I would prefer a film that was as authentic as possible and the acting is a great part to how authentic a film is. I certainly won't be watching this again. If you want a bog standard American film to watch, then go ahead, but if you want a drama that was believable, avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic historical drama about the Battle of Stalingrad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie recently I was interested to see if others shared my opinion of the story. I was disappointed to see so many negative reviews, most of which complained about historical inaccuracies. This movie is not intended as a documentary of the battle. It's a drama based on the overall scope of events during a short period of several weeks at the height of the battle. The director takes artistic license to convey the apocalyptic carnage that was wrought by the Nazi's during their ill-conceived, make-or-break attempt to capture the city. This was total war and no person or institution was spared by either side during the battle. The opening scenes portraying the Soviet defenders crossing the River Volga to confront the Nazis are among the most stunning and terrifying battle scenes ever filmed, easily the equal of the heroic D-Day landings portrayed in Saving Private Ryan. Nothing is whitewashed or concealed. I am not a history expert but I assume and accept, as many other reviewers have noted, that there are extensive, albeit probably minor in the grand scheme of the movie, inaccuracies with respect to how the Russians managed their defenses, the frequent execution of soldiers deemed to be deserting their positions or retreating without permission, and so on. However I do believe the director portrayed the Russians in a very favorable and sympathetic light, as unbelievably tough, heroic and patriotic in the face of likely annihilation before a much larger and better equipped enemy. The story had to be told from the perspective of individual soldiers, mainly Vasily Zaytsev, a Hero of the Soviet Union who of course did not singlehandedly win the Battle of Stalingrad, but definitely made critical contributions by killing numerous Nazi officers and snipers, and more importantly, by inspiring the Soviets to fight on. Truly outstanding performance by Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushchev, and another surprise appearance by Ron Pearlman as a fellow sniper (in one scene the look on his face mirrors his role from "Quest for Fire"). The entire cast was great, this was a long, fascinating movie, it is no exaggeration to describe this movie as an epic production. Historical inaccuracies aside, the Soviets are depicted honorably as having fought back the Nazis to save their country, a turning point that spelled ultimate disaster for the ever-foolhardy Nazis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very thrilling despite the flaws!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is full of flaws, the needless triangle love story being the first to come to my mind, and many other illogical things, but above all for me it remained an entertaining film throughout, very gripping and thrilling, and for that alone I have decided to shower my generosity upon this one to give it eight one of 10.The thing to stand out for me from this film is that it is a lot strategy based, unlike a lot of other war films, including the good yet very over-rated 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) that is quite casually all about lives of soldiers during war and killings. Admitted that some of its strategic points too look very flawed at times, but that in my opinion still remains a thing worthy of praise. The scenes where they wait on for hours for each other with the gun, the traps that they set for each other and the way one escapes from another by inches, all of it make for an intriguing battle. Although not perfectly implemented, but I salute the film- maker for having come up with the idea of such a unique war film that is not after all not only about slaughtering.Ed Harris' mere presence as Major Erwin König stole the show. He looked quite suited to the role and was brilliant in his performance. Although Vasily Zaytsev does mention of a German major by this name having had a duel with him, it is a shame that no German record of its military show any evidence of any such major having ever existed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie war / drama / romance, all in one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film portrays the Battle of Stalingrad, considered by many the turning point of World War II, as it was the first crushing defeat of the Germans. The film focuses its history in Vassili Zeitzev, a soviet sniper who caused many headaches to the Nazis, killing his officers on the ground, something that was used by the communist propaganda machine to encourage the morale of Russian troops, worn by unstoppable advance of the Nazis. In this film, the story of Zeitzev intersects with Tania, a Russian girl who volunteered to help the forces defending Stalingrad, giving birth to a romantic plot that intersects the main one. Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud (who also wrote the screenplay with Alain Godard), the film has Jude Law and Rachel Weisz in the lead roles and also features Joseph Fiennes in the role of a political commissar, Bob Hoskins, embodying the Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev, and Ed Harris in the role of a German professional sniper sent by Hitler to kill Vassili.The wartime love is a theme that has made great films. One of the most notable was obviously "Casablanca". This film, however, takes place not only in wartime but in the midst of one of the most raw and bloody battles of the war, which makes it more interesting as it is not just a romance or a drama, nor a "conventional" war film. It's a bit of all three genres combined. The sound effects, soundtrack, visual effects, sets and costumes are noteworthy for their realism and attempt to portray the combat scenario. The actors were also very good, especially Ed Harris (who has got used to doing tough-guy roles) and Weisz (finally a movie without mummies and Egyptian stuff). Jude Law and Fiennes, together, deserve a special greeting as they were able to incorporate very well the emotional and psychological conflicts of his characters, two friends in love with the same girl.As more negative marks, I point out the lack of "chemistry" between Weisz and Law, which should have been more crafted by two actors. Some dialogue required a greater commitment on the part of writers. Also I don't understand how Khrushchev was involved in that battle when, in reality, it was led by Georgi Zhukov. A good war movie, worth seeing because it will please both those looking for action as for those who enjoy a good drama.</fullReview>

Why are directors and screenwriters reluctant to just tell the story they want to tell? I left this film feeling like I'd seen it years ago. And for those who are curious. Vasily Zeitsef was a real person (though not quite exactly the character portrayed by Jude Law, who still did an excellent job). Tania Chernova was also a real person and their live affair actually happened (she was also a Russian-American and was a sniper in her own right, I can only wonder why screenwriters didn't run with a more accurate version of their story).As for Major Koenig and the duel--no one really knows if this happened, the story comes completely from the Russian side, this could have been propoganda, pure and simple, though snipers in Stalingrad definately fought it out with each other. Oh, and Sasha was a real boy but played no role in the sniper events (the writers wrote him in, I guess, to make the film more dramatic).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a reasonable movie, worth watching once, but by no means the masterpiece that some here have described it as. Visually, the recreation of Stalingrad is impressive. The battle scenes are well executed, but lack the impact and realism of Private Ryan. It is the overly romantic script and wooden acting by Jude Law and the smaller supporting roles that really let this movie down. Vassili's cheerful attitude after a good days shooting really negates any gritty realism that may have been achieved on the battle field. Ed Harris's Major König is a far more believable character.As a WWII epic this pales in comparison to Private Ryan, Thin Red Line and Band of Brothers. The sniper scenes are poorly done when compared with `Sniper' starring Tom Berenger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene of "Enemy at the Gates" left me in utter shock! It shows Russian troops being brought in by train to the Stalingrad frontline and literally shoved into battle with a rifle and a handful of bullets (those who weren't issued a rifle were also sent in with instructions to pick one up from the dead comrade beside them once he's mowed down by German fire). And while I don't know if any of these details are historically accurate, it was stunning filmmaking indeed. Fear, confusion, hopelessness, death... it's all there in that one sequence. This is, I imagine, what war really looks and feels like. Unless your name is Rambo.Unfortunately, after a promising start, this film, to use soccer terminology, starts scoring own-goals. It introduces a needless love story that eventually turns into a love triangle. Sure! It's bitter cold, Germans are inches away, hundreds of thousands rotting corpses laying around and what do these character engage in? Why, of course - a LOVE TRIANGLE. There's even time for a sex scene in which our lovebirds Vassili (Jude Law) and Tanja (Rachel Weisz) are doing the nasty surrounded by dozens of sleeping soldiers.Since this is the European answer to American blockbusters, I guess one is to expect a good amount of schlock, but in doing so they managed to crap up what would have, could have and should have been a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an opportunity missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I needed to see this film twice before I felt that I could comment. In my view this was definitely an opportunity missed. Setting aside the historical inaccuracies thrust upon us by the film industry and the strange need for the story to have a love-interest, I still enjoyed the presentation. Uniforms and equipment were excellent, even a purist like myself would excuse the T34/85's used. The action sequences were, for the most part, excellent if not foreshortened. Having built that superb set and with all the necessary in place, I find it so hard to believe that action sequences properly reflecting the harshness and bestial nature of Stalingrad could not have been on view. I must confess to being less than impressed with the digital effects used to show the bombing raids. On my first viewing I felt the film had been greatly miscast. Of all the main actors on view only the german major seemed right. Second and subsequent viewings mellowed my views but I still feel that there were others out there better suited to the characters portrayed. Certainly Bob Hoskins seemed to be out of place. The thing that , in my view, confines this film to the also-ran pile rather than placed it as one of the all-time great action films was the final showdown between the snipers. During the actual battle a political officer did indeed expose himself to draw the snipers fire [a finger, no more] and the thought that Danilov would do so without any warning to Zaitsev, to allow him to profit properly from teh revelation of position, was stupid to say the least. That the German Major would conduct himself with total professionalism throughout and then finally walk through an open area, failing to spot a man stood exposed at the front of a railway engine beggared belief. In short, the ingredients for one of the greatest war films ever made were undoubtedly available. The opportunity to do so was lost for avoidable reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not nearly as good as it should be. If the intent was to mirror William Craig's book of the same name, it doesn't. Zaitsev was a small part of the book. The book dealt with the entire battle, and the movie would have been better if it had been done like THE LONGEST DAY or A BRIDGE TOO FAR, with the real-life people portrayed. The movie was much closer to David Robbins' WAR OF THE RATS, which focuses on Zaitsev and his duel with the German sniper, as well as his relationship with Tanya and friendship with Danilov. Still, any movie that features a 1,000 yard head shot of a running, jumping man, as well as a shot of Rachel Weisz's very attractive butt, can't be all bad. Call it 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accuracy questionable, but overall well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy of the Gates" was, I thought, fairly well done. Special effects were acceptable but didn't play that large of a role in this movie. A definite must see if you enjoy historic films and aren't so picky with accuracy. I thought the story was enjoyable and threw in some surprising twists that kept you interested.*spoiler*I thought that the love story was a little to dramatic at times and was a poor theme to "separate" the two men's relationship. The ending probably needed some tweaking, and I thought that some of the acting (Ed Harris) wasn't as convincing.*end of spoiler*If you enjoy the type of film which is action packed and somewhat historically accurate, like Saving Private Ryan, then pick up this one and enjoy. Some scenes are fairly graphic but I think that's what to expect from a film such as this one.Overall it was entertaining to watch but, of course, does not compare to Bridge on the River Kwai, A Bridge too Far, or Platoon.Rating = 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film should be a fresh one for Americans, for they are so much isolated to Communism. However, 'fresh' doesn't mean that it's 'good'. What should I say? The film is not bad, and it is too far away from perfection. The story itself already leaves a lot to be desired. I don't think a Tania is necessary, and she is in fact so redundant that it makes the film stupid: why should there be a girl between Jude and Joseph? I would rather had the film concentrated on the war. That love story is so cheesy! Also, I am not so happy with the historical inaccuracy, which is in my opinion an important element of a war-film. However, on the whole, the film is still quite okay. I like the cinematographic work particularly. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good...some flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought of this as being 'Saving Private Ryan East', and in a way, it sure is-esp the first scenes and some of the later combat footage. I also didn't have a problem with it mostly being a 'Cat and Mouse' game of sniper vs Sniper. That was good. Some spoilers!You hadda like the 'crawling outta the pipes and blinding Person X with the glass shine', scene, albeit a basic Bug Bunny trick. Documentary? I don't think so guys.I doubt you had that many Russian soldiers who looked like Rachel 'Mummy' Weisz either, she stands out as a jewel-box amongst the drudgery and chaos. She was fine, their love-scene tacked on-though I think 'love scene' and 'Rachel Weisz' is something well worth seeing myself.I liked Ed Harris though he had a smallish role, very few lines.I thought that the hanging scene was forced.I thought that Joseph Fiennes role was not well written either, he went from grunt to bigwig to pal to foe to martyr like that.And the final scenes-where Harris comes out and allows himself to be a sitting duck-HUH? I didn't buy it. I have read the actual accounts of their fatal encounter-it was the Russian shooting at a slight twinkling in the woodwork, ala most of the earlier scenes. The last one was too 'Gunsmoke' for me.But the positives-look, scenery, the uniforms, the opening stuff, the bombing, etc. put this up into the quality end of things. I was not sure how good it would be, it was if anything better than I expected.I also will plug Bob Hoskins and Ron 'Beast' Perlman too, always good to seem them in a flick, though Hoskins did seem to chew da scenery somewhat.*** outta ****, not a classic but certainly a decent try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is nothing worse than good material gone to waste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been one of the great war movies of the new millennium. The pacing was uneven in that as soon as there is some tension building during the sniper or love triangle sequences, the ball is dropped and we're running off to a different scene. You got the feeling the director felt that there was too much material to cover too little time so let's not stay in one place too long. There didn't seem to be enough time for any character development to keep me interested. There was absolutely no tension in the love triangle. It was just flat. The Blue Max comes to mind as a film that accomplished this successfully and also in two other areas! You felt all the tension of a war between two armies, two sexes, and two social classes. It can be done. Turning to Koenig which could have been a much more interesting character study, Ed Harris never pushed the envelope to peek into Koenig's personality. I was turned off by the action of him hanging the boy which I felt would have been beneath the character. I felt I was being preached to by the producers in a "politically correct" way so they made sure I knew who the bad guys were. Duh. The film score borrowed a little too much from Shindlers List. The only great thing about this movie is that it had the "look". I mean you are there, especially on the big screen. There's nothing worse than a WWII movie of a winter battle, looking like it was shot in southern California. The final cat and mouse scene was lukewarm at best tension wise. The director should have looked at the sniper scene in the film Anzio which was one of the best I've ever seen even if the rest of the movie was horrible. Enemy at the Gates tried to cater to the Saturday night date crowd by being a great war movie and a great love story. It was neither.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My tout court review:1.) The opening scenes are fantastic.2.) Ed Harris' character is woefully underdeveloped and misses the mark.3.) The expertise of the snipers is too exagerated. They were good but they were not demigods. A huge expanse of city rubble is a lot to cover and even the best sniper doesn't see every slight movement in the mists of it all and shoot a direct hit in less than a second. Ridiculous.4.) It's too much to beleive that the entire war would stop as these two engage in their sniper duel. It seems that they are the only ones on the battlefield at times.5.) If Ed Harris can locate his nemisis so easily he wouldn't need to snipe him. Just bring a bazooka along and once you find him, blast him. If chivilarly existed between the two it was not exemplfied by the director.6.) The ending was poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a great opening, but it gets pretty lackluster after Law becomes a sniper hero. Problems: (1) Too many notes. One of the most over-scored movies I've ever seen. Shostakovich's heirs should complain about plagiarism. And if I never hear a crooning Russian chorus again... (2) Ed Harris plays John Glenn, not a Bavarian noblemen. I don't think Americans are good at playing nobility; they just don't get it. And Harris doesn't give the proper sense of menace. (3) It drags. One cat and mouse scene after another, not building on each other. (4) The crowd and battle scenes are too obviously choreographed, with a well positioned rock here, a body falling in the middle of the frame there. It's as if the director watched the burning of Atlanta in GWtW and moved it to Stalingrad. The art direction is just too artistic and doesn't get the horror of Stalingrad right. (5) It's yakky and intellectually pretentious (if not shallow), as only a French-conceived movie can be. (6) I thought the love scene was inventive, but the grimaces they were making, I was wondering what the problem was under those blankets. I hope if there's ever a director's cut, that he does cut it (and 3/4 of the music).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really wanted to like this,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this movie when it came out in the theaters, but did not get a chance to. While wating for it to come out on home video, I read "War of the Rats" (I don't rememeber the author's name) and found it was basically the same story that I had heard "Enemy at the Gates" followed. When I saw the movie last night, I was dissappointed. It is a really good war movie, and I didn't mind the love story ("War of the Rats" had one too, which I thought was better done,) but some things really nagged at me about the movie. For one, Zaitsev's early days are non-existent. He goes from raw rectuit foot-soldier, to 30+ kill sniper in about one minute. Where were the scenes that would show us how he developed as a sniper? In "War of the Rats," (which I know the movie was not based on,) it goes into great length about how Zaitsev trained raw rectuits to become snipers in the basement of the tractor factory, and shows how the snipers went out each day to strike fear into the german rear areas. All of this was absent in the film. Also, the portrayal of Keonig as the sterotypical Nazi kind've bored me. In the book, he was portrayed as an aristriocratic wimp who hated every minute that he was in Stalingrad. I think that would be a more interesting angle. And as for historical accuracy, the duel at the end was not true to history at all. The commisar who was shot didn't sacrifice himself, he stood up, rather stupidly, and pointed, shouting, "He's right there," and after he was shot, Zaitsev immeadtly put a bullet through Keonig's eye. And why was Keonig in a Wermact uniform? He was SS! I could go on, but I do have positive aspects about the film. The city was very well done. It is the best scenery I have seen in a war film. And the FX were very well done. I liked this film, but I feel it could have been done better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching this film, having heard very favourable reviews on its release.I was impressed by the cinematography and action sequences, but they were never enough to hold my attention, because the story was WEAK. Placing so much emphasis on the love triangle between Law, Fiennes and Weisz was a big mistake - I didn't believe it.I also felt that the actors could have at least attempted to speak with a German or Russian accent (like in the old movies). Some of the Cockney and American accents just sounded ridiculous in that situation. The dialogue was cheesy, and some of the acting was amateur. I only hope they put the snipers to good use and bump off the scriptwriters before they write any more of this tripe!</fullReview>

He looked like a child at a theme park, rather than someone in the middle of a bloody war . Rachel Weisz was useless as usual. The dialogue was poor and so was the music.What it boils down to is that the idea behind the story could not sustain a film. Two men hiding and waiting for the other to make a mistake does not make for entertaining viewing. It was hardly a cat a mouse game as expected.Other than that, everything was okay. Whatever you do, don't watch it expecting it to be a classic war film, because you'll be hugely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were rating this film on a scale of one to ten, I would give it a seven for one reason only, that being the soppy love story that was thrown in for some unknown reason. Otherwise, I would rate it at least nine, if not ten. This is a gripping story that, but for the "love breaks" would give it an edge-of-the-seat quality seldom seen in recent movies.Jude Law and Ed Harris are simply outstanding as the protagonists, as is Bob Hoskins as Kruschev. The movie shows the gut-wrenching reality of war as none other since "Saving Private Ryan". From the opening shots of the siege of Stalingrad, to the bleak ending in a bombed out shell of a once beautiful city, the story is compelling and suspenseful. For war buffs, this movie is a must. But be prepared for a starkness seldom seen, and one that draws the viewer into the true horror of war.Take out the love interest, and this movie will stand with the very best of its genre. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*This film's a laugh. Love the voice over and dodgy graphics showing a spinning earth and red pouring over the globe until we hit Stalingrad with a DAN-DAN! Over the soundtrack. The first thing that grabs you by the Niagra's is the English accents. It's 'Eastender's' with more guns and less blood.The film begins at the dock and a figure emerges from a submarine. Blimey, it's Bob Hoskins *giggle*. How are you, me old Cockney SPARRAH? Diamond geezer and all that, but what's he going to say? "I've put Vodka in all your pockets. I've treated you reds well even when you was out of order. Now, there's been an ERUPTION!" The ruck in question is between two heavy firms fighting for their Eastend Stalingrad turf and Bob is here to give his firm a good kick up the Aris. Stalingrad is Gypsy Nell at the moment, what with the red army cream crackered and the bombing making them all Mutt and Jeff. Everyone is in dire need of a Chas and Dave and a nice warm Steffi. Commisar Danilov, in a poncy public school accent straight out of 'Another Country', suggests Bob uses a China plate of his called Vassili Zaitsev for propaganda purposes. Vassili, whose in Stalingrad via sarf London, is a crack shot and when he's around everyone has to hit the Posh and Becks. His nemesis is a rainbow trout called Erwin Konig whose a bit of a roll and butter, although tasty with a custard and trifle himself. I've seen some performers in my time, but he enjoys his work. For the duration of the film, Zaitsev and Konig crawl around the ruined city on their biscuits and cheese trying to off each other. But Zaitsev has lost his bottle and is getting cold plates of meat over his mythical status. He tells his mate Commisar Danilov that he's not so lemon dash and asks him to ship his Khyber Pass to another firm altogether. But Danilov is under pressure himself. Bob Hoskins has been sent by uncle Joe 'the tache' himself and tells Danilov they cannot lose Chevy Chase over this. If Zaitsev doesn't deliver the goods he hints they'll both get a bullet in their pants and vest. In a splendid bit of over-acting Danilov tells Zaitsev that he has total "FAIIIITH!" In him.Just when things are complicated enough along comes this posh bird called Tania Chernova who likes a bit of rough. Her plummy accent is a scream. Quickly, Zaitsev falls head over heels in turtle dove with her and they soon get down to a bit of rumpy pumpy in the ruins amongst a row of sleeping soldiers. Her mince pies bulge so much it's hilarious. Is a large uncle Bob causing her problems or are Zaitsev's feet a bit potatoes in the mould? But Danilov has had his eyes on Tania's Gregory Peck in a previous scene, and seeing her as more his class, decides she should be his Richard the Third instead. So out of sheer read and write, Danilov grasses his mate up to the firm accusing him of disloyalty. Now, you may think these porkies makes him a bit of a strawberry split, but he redeems himself in the end.Meanwhile, stuck in the ruins of Stalingrad, Zaitsev gets some news which makes him go a bit radio rental. He's Schindler's list over the whole sorry situation and decides it's time to put his money where his north and south is. He can't leave it any Christian Slater so he goes to face that three card trick Konig all Jack Jones. Whose run out of Frair Tuck and ends up brown bread?This film is quite the biggest load of pony and trap I've seen in quite a while. It is excrutiating to sit through. The acting pen and inks and the script belongs in the biscuit tin. The director should have got the hammer and tack after the first day. Howlers abound, like the appearance of Kruschev and the endless music with bits of 'Schindler's List' floating in and out. Ron Perlman plays a soldier who slags off the communist system in a way that would have had him shot in the real war. I bet Russians are having a real laugh over this picture and the war was no laughing matter for them. If you haven't seen it then spend your money on something useful like guide dogs for the blind. I know who should be first in line for one.</fullReview>

Mostly post-cold-war movies show crime and terrorism and poverty in Russian settings, and i think it is good to recognize the effort of these unsung and uncounted hereos, albeit, in all the wrong and dangerous places. These men didn't have a choice.Soundtrack was DolbyDigital5.1, but the rear speakers hardly said a thing during the whole movie. War movies can create a sense of area, depth and realism with distant and close-in sounds. More effort was lavished on the brief, but brave portrayal of intimacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than average-Yet So Much Wasted Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It made headlines. It made bucks. (The real measure of success, I suppose for Hollywood poobahs). ENEMY AT THE GATES made for an interesting story, but only so long as the film stayed running. It could have been memorable, but it just turned out to be another night at the movies. What a shame.The six month siege of Stalingrad was historically such a horrendous conflagration, one could understand the producers wanting to keep the scope small in perspective. Yet, the many aspects of suffering by its citizenry was overlooked. One never got the feel or sense of suffering, of the inhabitants. The thousands who perished, not from German bullets or bombs, but simply starvation. This is never explored. The refugees or people who tried to leave the city, en masse. From this film's very limited point of view, Stalingrad is empty, except for Ed and Jude, and company.The performances were earnest and above average, except for Bob Hoskin' s Nikita Kruschev. The normally superb Hoskins played Kruschev poorly, i.e. an utter boob. It was hard to stifle a laugh. "...Lose yourself!" indeed. Ed Harris steals the show, as the aristocratic Major Konig, just by the subtlety of his performance. Three quarters through the movie, unfortunately, he jumps into hyper-nasty German mode (a characterization seen in zillions of movies) and the cliche plays out. I'm surprised he didn't stop into a bomb shelter to mow down a thousand babushkas, before meeting up for his final showdown with Vassili. Any personal sense of honor the character possessed went out the window, to prop up a cliche.If one is looking for a serious sense of a historical event, skip this one. Try STALINGRAD, a German movie about this event (see prior review), which might bring the overall horror of Stalingrad into view. ENEMY AT THE GATE, while above average and recommended, came off more like HIGH NOON without the horses.</fullReview>

I know that there have been so many movies made in this genre that it's almost impossible to be completely original, but I'm sure that the writers of this could have come up with something slightly different.

		<fullReview>Gripping realism. The magic of cinema is it's ability to transport you to the story's setting, to the point where you believe you are there. "Enemy at the Gates" did that. The living hell of war is mercilessly thrown upon you, and you can no more escape it than the characters in the film. Great story; well, of course, because it's based on a true story. Great historical accuracy, great acting, great cinematography. A great testament to this film is that the most memorable, gripping moments are not the ones featuring mass destruction, humongous explosions and bodies flying hither &amp; yon. No, it's the waiting. It's experiencing what sharpshooters endure to execute their missions. Endless hours remaining motionless; playing dead among the actual dead. The chess game played with human pieces. If you see this movie, note also the beautiful symbolism of Ed Harris as the wolf from childhood. (Crystal blue eyes, silent patience before pouncing, etc.) This is what I found riveting.BUT THEN...LIKE THE ENOLA GAY BEFORE IT, Hollywood had to drop this pointless, intrusive, formulaic, prerequisite love story BOMB right in the middle of a fantastic war story. I didn't know lipstick was so readily available in war-torn Stalingrad. And Rachel somehow managed to find the cleanest sewer pipes &amp; trenches to crawl through. COME ON, HOLLYWOOD! Remember "Kelly's Heroes"? There weren't even any women IN it. See also "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Dirty Dozen, The" &amp; "Magnificent Seven, The".Thank God these classics were made before this drivel was required in every American made film. Can you just imagine "Kelly's Heroes" being remade today? I couldn't conceive the horror of seeing Freddie Prinze Jr. as Kelly, finding the gold and then leaving it behind as he realizes that the love of the beautiful Italian maiden (played by Kirsten Dunst in a black wig) is worth more than 60 million dollars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like war movies, and I liked this war movie. It seems that WWII movies are making a bit of a comeback (I'm really looking forward to "Pearl Harbor"), and I'm glad to see it. Starting with Saving Private Ryan, it's good to see that war movies are starting to become more historically and graphically correct. Old war movies were a joke, showing hundreds of deaths in battles, but not a single drop of blood. This new crop of war movies really gets in your face, shows you the hell that the soldiers endured, and shows what really happens when a bullet finds human flesh. It's not for the squeamish, but it's the truth.This is what I expected to see in Enemy at the Gates, and It's what I did see. Sort-of.---Minor Spoilers Ahead---Though there were great battle scenes, the movie didn't really center on the battle itself, it centered on the duel between the crackerjack Russian sniper and propaganda hero, Zaitsev, and the German sniper sent to silence him, Konings. The cat-and-mouse (or maybe cat-and-cat, they both had rifles after all) battles of cunning between Zaitsev and Konings were fascinating, but they started to become tiresome after a while, the movie started to drag on a bit, and the ending was disappointing, it was what I called a "Star Trek ending". Why? Because in the series "Star Trek" (the newer one with Patrick Stewart, that is), the episodes always spent most of the time building up this big problem, making a huge deal about it, and then the problem is solved in like, two minutes. One of the crew pushes a button and it's all over, problem solved. Basically this movie ends in a similar manner, with the abruptness of a switch being thrown into the "off" position.And finally, I was so disappointed that they had to throw the obligatory love story in there. It's so cliche, and this one was poorly done. It was really pointless, and I think that it really detracted from the film. That's one thing I really liked about "Saving Private Ryan", they didn't taint a serious war story with a two-bit soap opera.All in all, I did like it, but it fell a little short of my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Enemy at the Gates follows very realistic plot with a number of actual events and only add a couple of there own for effect. The movie starts out showing the main sniper, Sgt. Vassili Zaitsev, as a little kid hunting with his grandfather. The movie then jumps into the war where Vassili and all the other Russian soldiers are heading into Leningrad to fight off the advancing Germans. This is where he encounters his first dilemma. When he arrives they get slaughtered at every turn and from both sides. He has to choose whether to advance and be killed by German bullets, or to retreat and be shot by his own people. Vassili ends up being found by a reporter who discovers how good of a shot he is when he takes out a group of enemies in there temporary base.The movie takes off from there, Vassili is promoted to the sniper division and the reporter, Danilov, uses him as an encouragement to the Russian army by printing of Vassili's kills. The Germans catch on to Vassili's tactics and they send out their best sniper, Major Erwin Konings, to stop the problem.The fighting goes back and forth with close calls on either side but the plot takes a quick turn to a "love story" between Vassili and Tania. Here on in, Vassili changes and fights for Tania, not the army.The suspense comes to a climax when Vassili and Danilov finally meet and Vassili has to decide whether or not to shoot him. There is the long climactic pause and then, BANG, Vassili pulls the trigger and kills Danilov. After that he goes out to find Tania at the hospital and even though the hospital doesn't have any record of her there, he manages to beat all odds and he sees her across the room.The ending of this movie is definitely a classic example of a "happy ending". It follows all of the guidelines, such as: the protagonist solves his problem by defeating the villain and getting the girl then living happily ever after. In my opinion it was a very good movie until the end where the plot took a dive into the classic cheesy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the story, check out the sniping!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well ok, the plot's not too bad - it is after all based on a true story (with an added love interest to keep the punters happy). But this is not what set it apart from any other war/romance films for me - what did that was those sniping scenes! The tension is unbelievable - I honestly felt like I was there, right in the thick of the action! After I left the cinema I caught a shape skulking in the shadows under a road bridge, and honestly thought twice (before discovering it was a discarded bin bag!). This film should also be praised for its dramatic imagery in general - the ruins of Stalingrad, littered with broken statues, miles of rubble and corpses, made a powerful image, not soon to be forgotten. A wonderful film in most respects. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, Why, Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that any type of big-budget film with any type of story has to have some type of a romantic notion to it regardless of the type of story itself, involving a hearthrob actor/ress? Well this was the question I was asking myself in the end of ENEMY AT THE GATES. What was the point of the romantic notion in a World War II film involving snipers? For dramatic effect? I suppose... but it was overly predictable, stupid, and out of place. Well that's enough bashing for the film, so on with the praises.The film was a fun one to watch, the battle sequences were well done, sometimes too confusing though. I suppose I was supposed to be confused, but I was rather confused on the point of the sequence sometimes, rather than in context. The film itself seems to be confused as well many of the times. The central theme of the film seems out of focus many of the times. The film told a good story, with exciting sequences, but nevertheless I was confused when the film ended as to why some of the things in the film were necessary. The film almost seems to just be a collection of well-done scenes about snipers in World War II, rather than a corrolated film. Damn Shame. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie, but the usual political incomprehension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie on the whole, it's a lot better than most war flicks. However, there was the usual western conflation of Stalinism with Marxism. For decades we had two superpowers telling us that Soviet Stalinists were the true Marxists, and in the west, we all too happily believed it (needing to believe as we do, that all anti-capitalist politics must inevitably lead to tyranny.) I didn't find the anti-Soviet portrayal at all unrealistic, but what I think would have been a REAL challenge for the filmmakers would have been to have a staunchly Marxist Russian character who was therefore also staunchly anti-stalinist. How about some guy who hated the Nazis, but also what Stalin and his apparatchiks had made of Marx? Instead, we have the character who makes the obligatory statement that "no new man is possible" (a direct shot at Marx) and that there "will always be envy" etc. or words to that effect -- the usual cosmic fatalism of the west. Had this little speech gone on a little longer, I think we could have expected to hear the usual capitalist conclusion: since man is a selfish bastard, let him live in a selfish system: i.e. capitalism. People who dream of a better world only give birth to Stalins, and yadda yadda yadda. The political message of the film is clear: the only good Russian is one with no politics incompatible with the capitalist western status quo.</fullReview>

Very nice, but instead of the soldiers, Annaud was filming the sets! I liked the script, although the *****_SPOILER_******* dramatic death of Feines was just an easy way of handling the relationship of three people.***end of spoiler*** The direction of the people was nice, but the filming sucked, i don't care (although the sets were pretty nice) about what happens to a building, i care what happens to the character.

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, but there were few surprises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" was certainly worth seeing, but I was disappointed to find that with a couple of exceptions, it was mostly a pretty standard war movie. Like another reviewer here, the opening scene on the banks of the Volga nearly had me in tears questioning what could possibly motivate human beings to hurl so much misery at one another. After the opening, though, the movie isn't particularly gut-wrenching. The appearance of Hoskins' character was a surprise to me. I had previously seen that Hoskins would be in the movie, but I didn't know who he'd be playing or that Nikita Khruschev would be a part of this story. I must say that the use of English didn't bother me in the least, nor was I concerned that the actors used their own accents. I very much prefer that to having them try to sound like a Russian speaking English, as a friend of mine put it. Someone commented that Jude Law's accent sounded upper-crust, but it struck me as sounding more like a common or rural British accent, slightly different than what he normally employs. I also agree with some other reviewers that it was a nice change to see a World War II movie told from a non-American perspective. The only other examples that I can think of off the top of my head are "Das Boot" and "Grave of the Fireflies." I enjoyed "Enemy" overall and I'm glad I saw it, but if you don't get around to catching it, don't lose sleep over it.</fullReview>

It also featured a gratuitous(and badly choreographed) sex scene, which I have yet to be able to figure out as having any purpose besides getting an actress to drop her pants. I left the theatre with friends and promptly made fun of the movie for longer than it took to see it.

		<shortDescription>The annals of mediocrity awaits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment Jude Law utters his first words, in a distinctly upper class English accent, the illusion of a Russian setting is destroyed. With the notable exceptions of Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins, none of the 'major characters' attempted the relevant accent, and Hoskins slipped from Russian to 'cockney' with alarming frequency. Jude Law neither looked nor sounded Uralic. I know this shouldn't matter, black actors have played Henry V and Olivier played Othello, but somehow it does. The irritating young boy, irritating by his very omnipresence, sounded and looked like a Dickensian urchin transported into mid 20th century Russia. Please Directors take note, we really do not mind subtitles! The film evidently bears the scars of serious 'cutting'. The connection between the opening opening battle scene, probably the highlight of the film, and the following scene is never fully explained. Fiennes' character, and infact the entire pseudo political slant, is never fully developed.Ed Harris' performance saved the film, restricted to only a handful of memorable lines, the depth and dignity he was able to bring out of his character manage to spare the blushes of director, if not managing to spare the film from the indignity of it's place in the annals of mediocrity.***/*****</fullReview>

The action sequences are quite good, and Ed Harris is adequate as the Jerry sharpshooter (but he doesn't get to say a great deal) but that's about all...could have done with two top notch actors in the lead roles to be honest. Completely daft love triangle sub plot, and too much modern dialogue in a poor script ('I'm going to take him out' etc) so I'm afraid it only gets a 5 out of ten from me. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is the rest of this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Enemy at the Gates last night, and though I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, I stuck it out until the end. I do not believe that my bladder had any affect on my oppinion.I have no knowledge of the history of this story, so I will remain silent on those details. People complaining about the historical accuracy of this film have obviously never seen a movie, ever.My impression of this film was that it was cut in half somewhere between the writing of the screenplay and the editing of the completed film. There are so many underdeveloped plots in this film, it's incredible. I believe that Jean-Jacques Annaud had a definate message in his film that is no longer there. It seems to me that he was making a statement about Communism and propaganda, but decided to make a genre picture halfway through.The credits in this film, particularly the end credits are reminiscent of Communist propaganda. The slanted latters and the Pseudo-Russian Font are what I am talking about. Then we have Joseph Fiennes character. His first appearance is with the propaganda newspaper. This theme is mostly ignored the rest of the film, until Fiennes last words where Annaud's opinion on the failure of Communism is clearly voiced. This is much more interesting than the sniper duels, though maybe not quite as action-packed.What happened to the accents in this film? For a film that takes place in Russia, the soundtrack has few russian accents.Two good things. Ed Harris is always good. Something about his face communicates such intense pain and complexity. His is the only believable accent.Also, the reason I know that Annaud is a better director than this film suggests is his direction of the love seen between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz. What a strange and entirely convincing sex act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that I do not have many new things to add to the great number of reviews that have been posted, however I do feel that there are two things in the film that do not receive enough attention. These are the music score and the love scene.I am surprised that no one has mentioned James Horner's score which was borrowed from John Williams's "Schindler's List". The melody is essentially the same with the exception of the few notes in the end. Is it the composer's intention to evoke images of Spielberg's film?As for the love scene, I do believe that if it was really meant to happen (amidst the lice infected clothes and the stink and sweat of the bodies not having been washed for weeks), it was conveyed in a fairly realistic way. Certainly, we would not expect the players to get fully undressed, and roll around passionately, groaning and screaming in the middle of the war devistated Stalingrad. I think the role of the hand (while typical in life), does not get due credit in the movies, and its use here brings to the scene the proper tenderness and authenticity. The execution of the scene is very proper, in that it reaches an end, and thus brings to the viewer a sense of completeness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Enemy at the Gates today and i wholeheartedly recommend it. Going in, I really didn't have much more than general background knowledge of the Battle of Stalingrad and its significance in World War II. I had also never heard of the sniper duel that took place there, so I can't comment on historical accuracy. One scene I found particularly enlightening is the scene where Bob Hoskins "explains" why the Nazis must never take Stalingrad.This movie offers an exciting and intense struggle without the flag-waving and speech-making that usually accompany war movies. The ongoing duel between the two snipers, Jude Law and Ed Harris, is absolutely riveting. Even though he didn't have a German accent, I thought Ed Harris was excellent as the Nazi sharpshooter. The love story has been criticized by some, but I actually thought it was well done and the love scene between Law and Weisz was actually very appropriate given the circumstances. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the critical invocations of "Saving Pvt. Ryan" did a disservice to this film. I totally bought the first ten minutes, which was pretty powerful stuff, captured well the confusion and terror of raw recruits used as cannon fodder, and drove home the appalling cruelty of both sides on the Eastern front. But I felt the film went downhill fast from there. I couldn't accept a basic hook for the story: that the entire battle for Stalingrad--maybe the war itself--hinged on a mano-a-mano duel between two snipers. The acting seemed spotty to me. Ed Harris is always worth seeing, and was here, capturing a steely relentlesness under a polished facade. Bob Hoskins was good as well. But others fell short of that mark, however hard they worked at their roles. Maybe the writing failed them. Jude Law was earnest but there was a hollowness about the characterization, and the same could be said for Fiennes and Weisz, I felt. I did like Ron Perlman and SPOILER AHEAD FOR YOU WHO HAVEN;T SEEN THE FILM) regretted his quick demise--he was one of the more intriguing characters. (SPOILER ENDS) Annaud seems to work hard at giving his films a quality of depth that I usually don't find. This one, too, uses a slow pace and terminally ugly backdrops to create a feeling of meaningfulness that, in the absence of character depth and satisfying plot, is, finally. spurious. In comparison to great war movies like "Paths of Glory," "Grand Illusion," and, in large part, "Saving Private Ryan," this one is not anywhere near that class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armchair Expert (Spoilers and Facts inside)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, so to start off, I went in to the movie having already seen the History Channel show about the Zaitzev - Thorvald duel. To be honest, until the last 10 minutes, I really enjoyed the movie. I think it is one of the best, most historically accurate war movies I have ever seen(especially compared to the last one, the deplorable yet guiltily entertaining U-571). The real beauty of the film is that, where other movies set a hackneyed hollywood story in a historical setting (Titanic, U-571), and others take alter a true story to make it more accessible (SPR among many others), Enemy at the Gates stays largely true to a generally accepted version of the story. Part of the problem is that the source material and history of the events portayed is often disputed. Because of the way snipers operate, records of their movements are not kept, doing so would severely compromise their effectiveness. Therefore, arguing that there are no specific records of the sniper duel. All of the major players in the movie, with the exception of Koenig, existed (as far as russian records show). Koenig/Thorvald may have been a name invented by the propaganda machine, but that does not discount the existence of a Nazi sniper involved in such a duel. It is impossible to be sure of the historical accuracy of a movie based off such material, but it is consistent with an accepted version of the story. Of course the Russians had Tanks and heavy equipment in the battle. But most of the sniper action occurs in the city proper, where mechanised conflict happened in the outskirts. Russian troops were thrown into battle as depicted in the movie. This was a military that through entire divisions into combat with melee weapons, and used unarmed chain gangs to clear minefields. Neither side is meant to be the bad guys(thought the russians are ostensibly the good guys), and Ed Harris is portraying a veteran soldier, not a nazi politico. Anecdotal evidence supports relationships such as Vasily and Tania's, though I'm not sure if Zaitsev corroborated that story. The scope of battle is kept intentionally small, this was urban combat, with small limited engagements happening everywhere, as opposed to huge offensives. Also, this is a story of how one of the greatest battles in recorded history became, for a short time, a battle between 2 men. Attempting to capture a broader scope would have detracted from the main point of the story.&lt;Spoilers&gt; # DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIEI found few faults with the movie compare to history as I recall it. The young kid I believe was actually older, and I don't recall his fate, so I'm not sure about that one. Danilov did in fact die in that way, raising his head to point out Koenigs position, but not in the place portrayed in the movie. The climactic battle occured later, as shown in the movie, except Vasily's spotter was only wounded, in much the same way. It then took several hours before Konigs position was found. Vasily caught a glint of reflection out of the corner of his eye, but could not place it. After examining the battlefield for some time, he concluded that the best place for Koenig to be was under that metal sheet. His spotter lifted his helmet, which Koenig shot, revealing his position, at which point Vasily returns fire, killing Koenig. Tania was indeed wounded buy shrapnel during an evacuation, and survived in a hospital for about three weeks, before succumbing to her wounds. So basically, as far as I can tell, the movie is mostly accurate until Joseph Fiennes starts spouting about the failings of communism. It does gloss over a bit, but the facts it presents are mostly accurate. I thought climax, while innacurrate, worked from a dramatic perspective, as in real live it was pretty anti-climactic. &lt;/Spoilers&gt; A little disclaimer: I presented the facts as I remember them. As with any history, the facts are only as good as the sources. Most of what I know comes from the History channel show on the duel, and several, books on the battle, as well as details I have had corroborated by several sources. In no way do I intend my statements to be taken as absolute fact. I highly reccomend this movie, but if you are a jaded moviegoer, the (completly innofensive) accents and love story may p**s you off. All in all though, it is one of the better war movies I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine addition to a recent trend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really engaging film. It grips you from the start and doesn't let go - although sometimes the grip slackens. There were one or two quite shocking elements to it, such as (SPOILER) when the kid was hung by Konig, and when Tanya was hit by shrapnel.The first part of the film takes quite a lot from the pages of Saving Private Ryan, i.e. blood guts etc. and very Janusz Kamisnki style of camerawork. Thus, Annaud ensures that it is a memorable scene, so vivid and realistic that it is quite scary.Blistering performances eminate from the three main leads - Law, Weisz and Fiennes - and Ed Harris puts in an especially whole-hearted show, putting real character into the steely-eyed German sniper. Bob Hoskins was also very good, even if he was only in the film for a short spell. I have to say, however, that we could have done without the love triangle. It did slow the pace of things down a bit. And I think Ron Perlman's voice was dubbed.Otherwise, this is a fully gripping tale, wrought with tension and realism. The story of these two snipers, coming from completely contrasting backgrounds, is so attractive and well-executed that gets you rooting for the good guy. It's about time someone took a good look at an often overlooked time during WWII.As for the music, I think James Horner's score was fantastic. However, as some Horner fans may (or may not) have heard, the vast majority of the score is based on a theme was is an exact excerpt from his score from Apollo 13. That said, he uses and expands it very well.All in all, great stuff. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For spending a reported 85 million dollars on the set, this movie looked like a Hollywood back lot with imported Italian mud. Kind sirs, this was supposed to be a war movie, emphasizing the perils and camaraderie of soldiers cast into the meat grinder W.W.II. NOT A LOVE STORY!!! 10 to 1 the upcoming Pearl Harbor movie will live in infamy with a plot revolving around the same standard love affair hack script for the girls in the audience, with 30 minutes of computer generated explosions at the end to satisfy their boyfriends. Anyone ever seen Tora! Tora! Tora!? Saving Private Ryan? Hamburger Hill? These movies are about war, the military, and all the killing that ensues when diplomacy fails. How about Soldaat van Oranje, or Das Boot? Camaraderie and sacrifice! Who's ever heard of their granddad's war stories going like this: "...well, yeah, there were a lot of bullets and things, but my mind was focused on my brother's fiancée, who incidentally was a Parisian hooker." Honor issues aside, Enemy at the Gates was just plain boring and anti climatic to boot. I'm sure subtitles are not a viable option for American audiences, obviously, but the Russians could have at least spoken with accents to match! Come on. Everyone in the movie had either British or American accents. I'll bet in Pearl Harbor, the Jap admirals talk like they're from Brooklyn. Bottom line: If you're bored to death with nothing to do, go see the movie. It's not the worst I've ever seen, but don't expect to come out of the theater the least bit changed.</fullReview>

Feines tells the typist to send a message to HQ and to propoganda producers that Zaitsev is slacking off yet nothing more is mentioned about it? That was the major plot hole of the movie I saw coming due to this love triangle. If it weren't for that, this movie would have been EXCELLENT.

		<shortDescription>Good, but too narrow for its subject (Spoilers, of course.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I first heard about it, but I also suspected that this story of Vasilly Zaitsev (Jude Law) the sniper was too small for the backdrop of Stalingrad. I found that in my eyes my suspicions were correct, however "Enemy at the Gates" is still a good production, and worth seeing for fans of history and war films, and probably almost anyone else. The main problem with the film is that its main story is too trivial for the enormous subject it is about. Stalingrad was probably the most important battle of World War II, and also might have been the largest battle ever fought. The Nazi invasion of Russia would eventually leave over 20 million Russians dead. Stalingrad ended with the loss of an entire German army, a disaster of such enormous magnitude that even Goebbels' Nazi press didn't try to hide it. However, `Enemy at the Gates' uses Stalingrad as a backdrop for a story about snipers. The intro is really powerful, but since these Russian soldiers are being `introduced' to the battle, we don't get the feeling as much as we should that this is a war being fought on their own land. The film also doesn't present to us how many civilians fought for Stalingrad. At times it even seems to claim that snipers should be given the most credit for the Russian victory! It also sometimes seems like the war is very far away, almost as if it was a sporadic inconvenience for the Russians, not the ongoing inferno that Stalingrad was--the battle scenes are very good, but there aren't enough of them, and I would like to have seen more of the fighting that took place in the sewer, and the bombing raids that killed 40,000 civilians in one week. `Enemy at the Gates' is also flawed by peachiness, and what seems like Annaud's determination to present ambiguity in his material. An awkward and contrived speech by sniper Koulikov (Ron Perlman), discussing the similarities between Nazism and Communism in a "Catch-22' sort of way comes off pretty hokey, given the fact that the Red Army was facing an enemy that had been murdering millions of Russian civilians in cold blood. I also couldn't buy a Russian mother being more satisfied that her son was a traitor over being killed in battle--I think it very unlikely that a political officer would relay such information to a woman to comfort her sorrows. This solution makes it easier for American audiences to swallow, but doesn't come off very authentic. Also, heroes like Zaitsev were useful for propaganda purposes, but they were not the sole deciding factor in uplifting morale. By mid 1942, the Russians proved to be an enormously determined people who were totally at war. It is true that Red officers would shoot their own men who retreated and those who were trying to surrender, but it is wrong to say that this battle was won simply because soldiers were forced to fight fearing death from both directions.I guess I must keep in mind that an epic that would explore all of the aspects of Stalingrad, on a sort of "GETTYSBURG" type scale is highly unlikely, and I should probably be happy with what has been presented. I must say that what is focused on is very well done. The battle scenes are powerful, and filled with carnage and realism. It was thrilling and horrifying as Zaitsev waited among his comrades in a boat, while Stuka dive-bombers strafed, destroyed, and killed the unfortunate people and boats beneath them. Every bombing scene is in fact, pretty intense. The production designers must be commended in their terrific presentation of the embattled city. The best scene in my opinion is probably Zaitsev's introduction to Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) in the fountain. Here, Zaitsev first displays to us his talent as a sniper, cooly and calmly picking off high ranking officers, and soldiers a few ranks beneath them--it is filled with suspense and gives us a guilty respect for his excellent marksmanship. Many people are criticizing the love story, involving Tania (Rachel Weisz), but I didn't mind it. I actually found the sex scene between the two lovers to be surprisingly passionate and realistic given the situation. The main plot, the battle between the snipers is very engaging, although it isn't perfect. Zaitsev often worries about his abilities, but history has not described him in this way. Antony Beevor's excellent book, `Stalingrad' (which I would highly recommend to anyone interested in the Ostfront or WWII) describes him as somewhat arrogant, and says that he claimed he would reach 150 kills before the war ended (he reached 149). Beevor also states that since the very complete Soviet records never mentioned anything about Zaitsev's duel with a German sharpshooter, this story is probably false. SPOILER WARNING; DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!The original `legend' describes Heinz Thorvald (`Konig' in the movie) being tricked into thinking he has killed Zaitsev. This does happen in the film. However, instead of emerging to find his supposed slain enemy, like Ed Harris did in the movie, it was believed that Thorvald peeped his head up from his scope, exposing himself to Zaitsev, who seized the opportunity and shot Thorvald in the head. I prefer what happened in the legend as opposed to what happened in the film, and I'm not sure why Annaud chose to depict the climax this way.Overall, `Enemy at the Gates' is a good, engaging movie. Jude law is excellent as the lead, and most of the supporting cast do well with their roles. The production values and realistic battle sequences are jarring and memorable. I just wish that it had explored the Battle of Stalingrad in a much broader scope. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other side of WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy At The Gates gives us the view of WWII from the Russian point of view. The story takes place entirely during the German siege of Stalingrad. In first few scenes, we see just how badly Hitler wanted this city. What we are subjected to is a nightmarish scenario. Russian infantrymen are herded from train cars into boats and ferryed across the Volga river. While taking the dangerously slow trip, they are subject to fire from attacking German fighters. If they survive, they still have to fight on land, or be shot as cowards. There is little dialouge in these opening scenes and for once, I'm glad that there was no decision to put dialogue here. You can almost compare the opening to a silent film, with the images flashing across the screen and expressions of the actors faces conveying all the information you need. Once the opening chaos has died down, we begin to get to know Jude Law's Vassily, the famed sharpshooter. Law plays him well. A young man from the Urals who just happens to be a world class shot, but not to knowledgeable of the politics surrounding him. Joseph Finnes is the political officer that begins to extol the virtues of this young man and begins to make him a larger than life hero. Because of the damage inflicted by Vassily, the Germans send in their own sharpshooter. Ed Harris plays Major Konig with steely eyed reserve. His actions are carefully metered out and his silence shows his strength. What starts out as a battle between the Russians and the Germans becomes a struggle between two men who are both the best at what they do. What follows is a film that showcases great performances from Law and Harris and scenes of tension that will make you hold your breath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is not a film about the Battle of Stalingrad, an action film about snipers nor a romance. These are elements of a very deceptive screenplay, but underlying all, "Enemy at the Gates" is a historical political indictment against Nazism and Communism. It is a story of the lesser of two evils.Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and written by Annaud and Alain Godard, "Enemy at the Gates" is a story of two snipers (very loosely based on a true incident), up and coming Russian Private Vassily Zaitsev (Jude Law) and the professional German Major Koenig (Ed Harris) sent from instructing at a German sniper training school to kill him. Along the way we meet Red Army political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and Red Army Private Tania (Rachel Weisz). Before the last shot is fired, a love triangle will develop between Zaitsev, Danilov, and Tania.The romance is superficial. The love triangle leaves one feeling that it is underdeveloped, that more could have been explored between these characters. In fact it could have been a film onto itself, and I had the feeling the entire romance angle could have been left out of the screenplay without lessening the true themes of the story. (Mr. Annaud, please re-edit the film and at least drop the unnecessary lovemaking scene!)The sniper contest is very well developed, and one feels real tension as each, the novice and the professional, hunt each other through the destruction and rubble of Stalingrad. It is saved from the depths of the traditional action genre as Zaitsev is genuinely afraid of the professional sent to kill him and questions his ability to defend himself, much like being stalked by a "hitman". Because of his fear, Zaitsev questions the wisdom of letting political officer Danilov propagandize him into a "Soviet Hero". But the film really works in the small moments when demonstrating the true ugliness of Nazism and Communism, and it's for this reason I recommend "Enemy at the Gates". Moments such as the Wehrmacht's invasion and utter destruction of civilian homes. Moments such as the ultimate fate of a boy at the hands of a Nazi. Moments such as Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins in a terrific performance) ordered to take over the defense of Stalingrad and offering the relieved Red general a pistol as "another way out" (behind a closed door, it is accepted). Moments such as a Soviet High Command banquet to which Pvt. Zaitsev (now a hero) has been invited and while the general staff lovingly gaze at a huge portrait of Stalin, a hungry Russian frontline soldier greedily stuffs his satchel with food reserved for political friends and high ranking officers while nobody is looking. The production values of "Enemy at the Gates" is very high. From the set design (it looks like they really destroyed a city to make this film) to the historical accuracy (PZKW IV tanks) to the uniforms (wool, not permanent press), a lot of care was given to details. And the music by James Horner is effective and raises the tension of the sniper duels.I've heard criticism that it occasionally appears too quiet in Stalingrad when the snipers move around. This is unfair. A prolonged urban battle has a way of being quiet in one area while a raging firefight is going on three blocks away, especially in a city as large as Stalingrad. Director Annaud effectively captures the fluidity of battle. Make no mistake-"Enemy at the Gates" is not a simple action film or wartime romance. This film has something to say.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much needed correction to the American view of the war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They are very few western-made films about the Second World War's Eastern Front. After all, although the casualty toll ? around 20M dead overall, including up to a million at Stalingrad alone - far exceeded that on the West, it was not American or British but Soviet lives which were lost. The two such works that I have seen are `Cross Of Iron' (1977) and `Stalingrad' (1992).Now French director Jean-Jacques Annaud (`The Name Of The Rose') offers us `Enemy At The Gates' which is also about the ferocious 1942 Battle of Stalingrad, but ? a novel angle for a war film ? this is set around a personal duel between crack snipers. The movie has provoked some controversy since, while the Soviet marksman Vasily Zaitsev (played by Jude Law) did exist, the German shooter Major Konig (Ed Harris) was almost certainly an invention of Communist propaganda. However, such minor tampering with history is certainly not on a par with the travesties in `U-571' or `The Patriot'.The sets and special effects ? it was filmed in Berlin ? are stunning in their verisimilitude and some of the action sequences, especially at the beginning, approach those in `Saving Private Ryan' in the brutality of their impact. Bob Hoskins impresses in a cameo role as the young Nikita Krushchev. Nevertheless the rivalry for the affections of woman soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz) is too sentimental and the script far too weak for this to be as good a film as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually like this movie more than Saving Private Ryan. Some of the criticisms leveled at it are just unfair. Sure, the actors have British accents. So what? If they were speaking with Russian accents, someone would complain that Russian troopers don't speak English. If they were really speaking Russian, someone would complain about the subtitles... History buffs can always find faults but Saving Private Ryan has as many if not more historical inaccuracies. The atmosphere here seems right. The dark, grey battlefield is very well rendered and more importantly, the character of Ed Harris, the enemy, has dignity and humanity despite his final act. The almost animal sex scene is remarkable in its symbolism of war: love mingled with death, tenderness mingled with brutality. Some of the scenes, especially the field of corpses at the beginning has a surreal quality to them. Sadly, though, the ending seems to have been an afterthought. But thanks God, there is no flag-waving and cemetery scenes to manipulate our emotions. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had alot of hype before it came to theaters, so I was kind of wary about it. When it took off slow, I became even more wary of it. I was, however, very happy with how the movie started developing later on. The movie got you more and more enveloped in it as it went on.After watching the ending, you realize that the movie was actually better because of the slow beginning. This movie was way different from movies like "Saving Private Ryan", in the sense that it was more of a love story (for girl and country). Even though saving private ryan was a love of country movie, it was more about being a team. This movie focused on one hero, who made everyone want to be a team.Without this movie taking off slowly, I don't believe that they could have pulled off much of a love story, involving the girl. I loved this movie and think it is a must see, for everyone who likes watching era related true stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge movie that will leave you impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Others have made the proper comparisons (big background and sets a la Titanic and Saving Private Ryan - SPR) and pointed out some inconsistencies such as German and Russian sung in the background and in writing on walls but all speech in English. But the word is HUGE and here is why. The sets, augmented by matte paintings and CG graphics, are enormous. The Tractor Factory set alone will make you forget the French village in SPR. I've seen trashed factories in Kuwait during Desert Storm and all the sets had that same feel. Also, older war movies used real footage spliced in (12 O'Clock High) and it looked it (clear vs. grainy) whereas now the CG creates Stuka strafings and Heinkel bombings that could not be done today by real aircraft - thus whetting our taste for "Pearl Harbor". Part of what you will see is the atmosphere and recreation of war - and it is ever bit as big as the Titanic's hull or SPR's French village. ****Spoilers to Follow ***** Spoilers to Follow****** 1. The kid (Sachsa) was perfect as the innocent who was employed by the Germans as a cobbler and bootblack for food but used as a double agent. All soldiers, including Americans, have employed kids (one was in the MASH TV series) for all wars. Usually the currency is food, as it was here. Think of Dov from "Exodus" (the book). Ed Harris, feeling the loss of his son, does not want to kill Sachsa for his double-spying, so he warns him not to return, and only when Sachsa does return, does Harris use him as the bait to draw out Vassily. Harris has his orders and he does what he must. The scene where the kid is mending boot soles and Germans are marching by and the kid's nose is running either from the cold or crying is classic. 2. Some decry the love affair between Weiscz and Law, but, hey, it happens. Did they decry the beach love scene with Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr? In war, you feel that each day might be your last and you don't want to die a virgin or with clogged pipes and the animalistic rutting is what I would expect between a shepard and a first timer. Her face switches between pain and pleasure, however Jude Law is the master of the Silent Orgasm. Don't minimize women's involvement in Soviet Army actions. Soviet women served in many areas such as sniper and fighter pilot. Even today the Israeli army uses only women to teach rifle marksmanship. 3. This could have been a mini-series and covered all aspects of Stalingrad (freezing, logistics, wood fires to thaw engines, color bands on snow suits, Paulus' promotion to Field Marshal, etc., etc.) but who has time for that? Urban rubble is a snipers best friend (Abbey of Monte Cassino and SPR) and the marksmanship, fieldcraft and soldier skills needed to be the best sniper are exemplified here. 4. Heroes do make a war effort roll. FDR wanted something to take our minds off of Pearl Harbor and got The Doolittle Raiders. Hitler would not allow Rommel to be besmirched (after Rommel's involvement in the plot to kill Hitler) and let him to commit suicide but publicised it as "died from a strafing". The sole Ranger that won the Silver Star in Grenada was Reagan's guest at a State of the Union speech. And finally... 5. This movie was funny. There were some real "if you have ever been in the military..." scenes like where only the fat general gets a shower, where the guy in the front rank rolls his eyes back towards Fiennes, etc. This movie actually had some good laughs. See it, see it, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great spectacle/special effects; weak script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways this movie was like "Titanic" -- the great production values (special effects, sets, spectacle, etc.) are alone worth the price of admission and offset the poor script, resulting in an average overall average-plus rating.I was not bothered by the lack of authentic accents. Nor did the introductory history lesson with the war zone map of Europe bother me (remember "Casablanca"?).I may have missed a few things, but here is a list of criticisms/suggestions:¶ the warfare scenes were effective --even wondrous-- but unlike "Saving Private Ryan," they were more antiseptic. In "Ryan" you had more of a feeling for those maimed. Many were not killed outright; they were wounded, were left in pain and disfigured. Not in "Enemy at the Gates."¶ the sniper scenes all (except the last one) ended abruptly after a missed shot. It was like a work whistle blew, and everyone called off the fight and went home.¶ maybe I missed a lot, but I was confused about whose side the little kid was on and what he was about.¶ I don't mind the film focusing on the sniping duel and the love triangle, with the Battle of Stalingrad as a backdrop, but I wished more time was spent on explaining the strengths and weakness of the two sides, the supply lines, the tactics, the importance of perhaps the most critical battle of World War II, certainly the most destructive.¶ apropos of the above point, I would have expected to see more about the sub-freezing temperature and the deprivation and misery on both sides. The Germans, for example, were forced to eat killed horses, and eventually had to dig up the carcasses of dead horses to eat the bones.¶ the picture actually bored me some. The sniping duels were repetitious. How long do you want to watch motionless snipers buried in dirt and newspapers? The constant darkness of the scenes turned me off. The characters (except Harris) weren't particularly engaging or endearing (blame the script). I kept looking at my watch. ¶ ***SLIGHT SPOILER*** I didn't mind the nighttime public love scene, but it would have been nice if some romantic buildup was given to it. The shy girl practically suddenly raped the guy. She seemed to spend more time panting there than the total time in all their previous exchanges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>even though there was some added Hollywood fluff. That's the only explanation for the love triangle that develops in the midst of the battle at Stalingrad. However, like I said, I liked the movie anyway.First, I want to take a lot of other reviewers to task for picking on the fact that most of the actors had English accents. I find it ludicrous that some would point to that as an issue of realism that the characters didn't sound Russian, but they would ignore the fact that they were speaking english in the first place. I would think for the level of realism that these folks would seem to expect, that the film would have been made entirely in Russian and shown with english subtitles. And I certainly don't remember anyone pointing out the same problem when Sean Connery portrayed the Russian submarine commander in Hunt For Red October.Personally, I found a way to forgive the film makers for going for a little star power with Hoskins, Weisz, and Ed Harris. And I would have found it much more annoying had they gone for the accents and one of them was simply terrible at it.Moving on, this film is well acted and well shot. Never, for one second, do you get the idea that you are not looking at the ruins of Stalingrad in the midst of this battle. You see the up-close horrors of war with a few ideas thrown in that I've not seen anywhere else. The drama of Russian sniper Vassily Zaitsev pitted against the Nazi sniper Major Koenig was riveting. The romance was tolerable, even though not really believable under those circumstances. But that is not to say that it wasn't well portrayed. But it would seem that it was just something added to the story to speak to a certain audience to give the film a little more mainstream appeal.All in all, well worth the time and money. 4 of 5 stars...</fullReview>

The script, though, left a lot to be desired. I won't reiterate what other viewers have said but I would like to add two comments on the script. In one scene, Joseph Fiennes says "Whatever " which wasn't even used as a stand alone sentence even ten years ago, much less in WWII. In that same scene, Fiennes or Law one calls the Germans "Krauts." How absurd! Russians never called them that. Nor did any soldiers of Allied nations except the United States. Russians eat sauerkraut and cabbage with equal gusto to the German people. Why then would a Russian call a German a "Kraut?" I'm glad I saw the movie but the special effects were pitiful. I don't know what the hoopla is about computer imagery. The Stuka dive-bombers don't look any more realistic than does Godzilla in Japanese films of the 1960s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is one of the best movies I have seen, even if it does follow a tried and tested Hollywood formula. The formula made it predictable, but the atmosphere, setting, and overall realism made it all work for me. The accents weren't accurate, but instead British and American. Get over it. This isn't the first time that's been done.The love scene was definitely not out of place, but instead necessary to the movie. It was something beautiful, something so human, that was warped by the death surrounding them. If you can't put a human face on the brutality of what was happening around them, then I'm afraid you missed the point, because that is what EatG is all about. Realizing the impact of war on the human condition, and even experiencing it a little bit for yourself.The desperation of the Soviets is made clear in the beginning of the movie, but I can't speak for how accurate it really is. The carnage that follows however was most accurately portrayed, at least to the best of the film's ability. The majority of casualties in WWII were not the result of the fighting, but instead of the slaughter of millions soldiers and innocents alike. This movie drives that point home early, and it does it well. The final few scenes were also formulaic but somehow satisfying. Ed Harris stole this movie and was so good at being the bad guy, it was hard not to enjoy his fate, no matter how absurd it was. This movie has a definite emotional impact on anyone that watches, and that alone makes it a worthwhile viewing.</fullReview>

To those who had problems with said scene: the human sex drive does not switch off due to the proximity of war or the non-proximity of a bathtub. I've heard of plenty of people in wartime catching as catch can in the manner of Weisz and Law. But what bothered me was the way everyone with the exception of the principals seemed to disappear at times from the face of Stalingrad! Stalingrad was a massive battle involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers within an urban area. Every yard of open space at the front was guarded by numerous rifles and machine guns from both sides, not to mention artillery, mines and booby traps. There is no way on earth anyone could have moved from side to side in the manner of Sasha, no way anyone would dare expose themselves -ever - in daylight without considerable covering fire. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but the HUMAN ELEMENT IS WEAK and unconvincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw "Enemy at the Gates". Huge production and realistic, and it's well worth seeing. But there are some flaws, and a Khruschev who looks way too old for 1942 isn't a major one (Bob Hoskins is great in the role, though).This very good film has two significant flaws, and the intrusive cockney English accents, especially of Jude Law, is one. It is most distracting. It was very foolish of the director to permit this, or maybe it was his dumb idea. Russians speaking with cockney accents! Jeez. Maybe it'll go over well in the East End of London.The other flaw is that one cannot get emotionally involved with any character, or at least I did not. I didn't care about the love story either. Also, the winner of the sniper duel used trickery courtesy of the suicide of his cohort, and I didn't care much for that either. (No names! No spoilers!).Having read the book long ago I know the denouement of that duel, but even those who didn't know may not get emotionally involved in the human element of the film. Perhaps it had something to do with both sides being despicable totalitarian regimes. I'm supposed to really care that one minor cog of a murderous despotism run by a madman killed a minor cog of a different murderous despotism run by a second madman? Also, somehow the acting didn't do the job nor transmit the right emotion, vulnerability, and desperation. The attempts to humanize, and then demonize, Major Koenig towards the end of the film seemed forced and didn't work for me. Ed Harris is a fine actor, but even his character was not fully realized and somewhat two-dimensional.But nonetheless, a very good film, but it won't be entering my DVD collection unless I see it in the "under $14" bin. Go see it, but you may not come away really empathetic with the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore reviews-- Excellent film says Stalingrad Vet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is message I forward from Great Uncle visiting US from Stalengrad:I would like to say I am disappointed with many reviews of this fine film about my motherland. As cousin of Vassily I fought with resistance to Nazi barbarian invaders so I know what I talk about. What the hell does LA guy know about Battle of Stalingrad? This film was more realistic than Titanic. So what if Russian's speak with English accent it is an English film, not Russian. I glad that filmmakers don't stoop to hockey Russian goose step accents. Music was excellent better than Titanic and at right moments. Communism is also big part of symbolism at time as well and fit excellently into picture. Also, love scene in tunnel very realistic. Me and wife Irina who also fought in army make love in bunker with hundred others many times. In war, you make best with what you have and like in film make love when you have chance. Chance may not be after next day. So, this is good and historical film about Battle of Stalingrad from one who was there. This film is getting bad rap like Mel Gibson classic Braveheart.Vassily would be proud of film the way it was done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One town stands between the enemy and total victory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** An evil aggressor swarms over Europe, only one town stands between them and total victory. A hero is needed, someone to inspire the defending army to superhuman efforts. But the aggressor has other ideas and sends in a crack shot to take out the hero. Well, that describes the first film I saw this weekend - The Messenger (the story of Jean d'Arc) and could equally be applied to Stalingrad.Both The Messenger and Stalingrad have been heavily criticized. They don't stick to the historical facts, the goodies (the Russians) don't have American accents, the baddies (the Germans) don't have English accents.Well lets start with those accents. It seems that American audiences have major difficulties understanding anything non-American so allow me to elaborate a bit. Krushchev and Zaitsev, being from the proletariat, have working class English accents. Danilov and Tania, being educated, have middle class accents. Simple. Seeing as the film is an English language movie this is at least consistent.As with SPR the first 20 minutes is a horrific battle scene where young Russians are pulled off a train, shipped across the Volga under heavy artillery and Stukka attacks and thrust straight into battle with 1 gun between 2. But it is the later scenes that are more horrific. You get to study the faces of the victims before they are cruelly dispatched by the sniper.There are a number of stories in this movie, each of which is engaging. There is the love triangle between Danilov, Tania and Zaitsev. Rachel Weiss natural beauty shines through the dirt plastered to her face and body - she obviously got a taste for dirt after Land Girls. The duel between Zaitsev and Koenig lasts the whole movie in a number of nail bighting set-pieces. Zaitsev is initially the hunted wolf but curbs his impatience to become the hunter.&lt;SPOILER&gt; The Danilov story is important. Despite a pleasant exterior this character is never really likeable. In the denouement he explains that he wanted to build a just and equal society but discovered that there is always something to be coveted in others. &lt;/SPOILER&gt;The ending is a bit schmaltzy and could have been dropped, but it is still infinitely better than the vomit inducing SPR. The battle scenes are frightening realistic although the cinematography is not on the same 'verity' level as The Messenger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just another mediocre war movie... I felt I had to register with IMDB just to comment on this very sad motion picture. Bad script and cardboard characters made for a long and arduous movie-going experience. The actors did their best with the material given them, but could not do much to help the confused storyline. With no real rising conflict, and forced emotion, this film lacked any real direction and feeling. From the list of the writer/director's previous work, it should come as no surprise that the movie had little impact on the audience.With a great historical turning point to serve as a backdrop, this movie should have centered on the momentous sacrifice that was made by the Russian people. Instead it comes off as a melodramatic dud, leaving you feeling empty and $8.00 poorer...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy at the Gates is a really powerful war movie, despite its flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seemed to come out of nowhere. I first saw the trailer for it only a few weeks before it came out. It looked pretty good, and I love war movies (especially WWII movies), so I thought I might check it out.The movie has learned a few things from its Spielburg cousin. Enemy shares the same gritty realism in the picture and in the events that happen.I like the idea of this movie about a Soviet sniper. It's a nice change from the British and American movies. Though all of the Soviets have British accents, they pull it off very well.Okay, let me get the bad stuff done and over with. The movie really has two plots. The first plot is what the trailer tells you: a German sniper is hunting a Soviet sniper during the battle of Stalingrad. The second plot is a love triangle: the Soviet sniper Vassily Zaitsev falls in love with a beautiful infantry woman, and so does his best friend, a Soviet propaganda/political officer Danilov. The first plot is the stronger plot. The second is pretty weak. The movie would have been better had it only been a war movie. The sappy love story gets a little stupid at times, especially when Danilov's jealousy brings himself to take extreme measures to Zaitsev. The movie is fine with the love story. It adds depth to the film, but the movie would have been better off without it.Another bad thing would be the movie has a large amount of war movie clichés. There is not a whole lot of new material in the movie's events. The movie's ending seems to be a little too good to be true if you ask me.The last bad thing is the movie doesn't take itself too serious. It should have.Okay, how would you like some good stuff? The movie is deeply involving, filled with great characters and greater acting. They have some of the best in the business here: Joseph Fiennes, Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins, and (one of my favorites) Ed Harris.The movie is also filled with tense, well-designed action sequences. The opening battle scene is so good and original that you felt for these communists.The cinematography is very reminiscent of SPR. The film has that same dirty, musky look that Saving Private Ryan invented so long ago. That is not to say that it is bad or anything. The look of the film is great. The directing is also very topnotch. The cat and mouse game between the snipers is complex and intense. Both men are professionals, and they don't take it personal. I love a line that Zaitsev says about snipers. He says that they have the hardest and most horrible job of any soldier because snipers can see the warm and friendly look in the face of his unsuspecting-enemy before he kills him. Unlike other soldiers, he must look his enemy directly in the face and he almost gets to know each man he kills. He says that the face of every man he has ever killed haunts his dreams.Over all, this is a very cool movie. It may not be SPR material, but it will hold you over till Pearl Harbor hits shores. I can't help feel that the movie could have achieved much more had several things been cut out or added in. Despite its flaws, I think most people will enjoy this movie. Enemy at the Gates is a bit different from most war movies I've seen, but I think it is a welcomed change.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book "War of the Rats"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David L. Robbins wrote an account of the sniper duel which took place during the Battle of Stalingrad. It is a gripping tale. The book diverges factually from the film Enemy at the Gates. For example, in the book, Zaitsev starts his military career as a naval clerk pressed into infantry service. Also, the book's German sniper is SS Colonel Thorvald, rather than Wehrmacht Major Konig. The book also presents much of the fieldcraft used by the snipers on both sides. Crucially, the book's plot is much more credible than the film's.The film is beautifully photographed and the actors are skilled but the story is not nearly as good as the book's.Some of the other reviewers mention the film "Stalingrad", the Wehrmacht's view of the battle. That is an excellent film and I highly recommend it. It's the German infantryman's "Das Boot".</fullReview>

Alas, it couldn't buy the plot, which is ridden by cliches.Not that the story doesn't have its bright points: The duel betweenthe snipers is compelling and filled with suspense. Ed Harris isthe best, and scariest, Nazi villain I've seen since Ralph Fienes inSchindler's List. Even the hokey, and mostly unnecessary, lovetriangle in the movie has its bright moments. Some scenes areunforgettable. My favorites are the first time we see the Sovietsoldiers entering the city, the bombing of Stalingrad (too bad thewar plays in the background for most of the time) and thecat-and-mouse game between the rivaling main characters. Notas realistic as the lower budget German Stalingrad movie ofseveral years ago, but if we forgive the cliches, the movie is akeeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but boring and drawn out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To help offset the obvious problems with making a two hour movie about two legendary snipers spending untold amounts of time just waiting to surprise the other, the film tries tie it together with a love story, which actually ends up weakening the whole sniper vs sniper, "my muzzle is bigger than your muzzle" macho plot. I also found the film confusing in certain areas where it wasn't clear whether friends of the Russian sniper were stabbing him in the back or actually helping him.While the idea seemed catchy: two skilled WWII snipers, trying to hunt each other down, I quickly discovered that I cared more about what was happening in the background, and around these two snipers than which one would nail the other first. Ed Harris looked miscast as the Nazi sniper; he just came off looking out of place. His acting was fine but he just did't bring a menacing enough presence to the character. All in all a worthy effort with some cool sfx, especially the scene with the german fighter planes strafing the boats, and a simple scene where the map of europe is shown (in a cartoon format) to indicate the breadth of the nazi power - I love when they use that old school stuff. It just could have been shortened, with somebody a little meaner to play Ed Harris' role, and less of the love affair sub plot.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soap Opera in Stalingrad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Enemy at the Gates is a film with a lot of potential. The production design is spectacular. The sets and costumes are terrific. While watching it, I really felt like I was seeing the hell-on-earth that Stalingrad must have been during the epic siege of 1942-3. Mr. Annaud definitely got his 80 million dollars worth. I was particularly impressed that they bought some actual Mk III panzer tanks and Soviet t-34s--a nice touch. However, no amount of money or production artistry can save a movie with a lame story, and Enemy at the Gates suffers in this regard.As I sat in the theater, I was struck with puzzlement. How could anyone take an event as inherently dramatic as the epic struggle for Stalingrad and make it boring? It's simple: for starters, shoot your battle scenes from the sidelines as confused jumbles that don't evoke much emotion or add much to the plot. There are individual shots that work well, but they just seem thrown together, and only end up hammering home that war is brutal with a capital B and tragic with a capital T without gelling the film together into something more meaningful.Another thing that should of worked, but didn't, was the duel between the snipers. The filmmakers meant to show their personal fight as a kind of battle in microcosm. An epic duel happening in tandem with the duel of nations in the city. But there's no suspense! They telegraph *every* dueling scene before it happens. It would have been cool to have Jude Law walk into a ruined factory and get shot at. Then, along with him, we could try to find out where the evil Ed Harris is hiding along with Jude Law. Never once do they do this in the movie! We always see where Ed Harris is hiding before Jude Law steps into a trap...and vice versa. Always-always-always! Boring boring boring!!!Half the time, we know where the snipers are going to be because they tell someone that there's going to be a trap 10 minutes before the scene even happens! "I'll surprise Vasily at the perfect spot in the train station," Ed Harris tells his way-too-cute Russian boy informant. And then he does. The only thing suprising here is that in a Sniper movie, they give all the surprises away.Even worse, the characters aren't well developed, and poor Ed Harris is forced to sit around looking cold and sinister, drinking champagne and smoking evil gold tipped cigarettes, which he leaves as his "calling card" for Jude Law to find. Harris' Major Konig is just another cold calculating movie villain, without much real depth. He's like sho kosugi the ninja in "The Octagon" or something. For a better "clash of the titans" see the duel at the end of "Predator". At least Awnold emotes in that one.WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD Finally, You'd think two people falling in love in a place like Stalingrad would be gripping and tragic, because sooner or later one of them is going to get killed. There is no better example of finding love at the wrong place and the wrong time. So how does this movie screw up it's love story? By making it a phony soap opera love triangle between the lovers (the handsome farmboy Vasily and lovely tough intellectual Tanya), and the standard jealous intellectual (Danilov). This has been done a million times before in a million pretentious art films, and it's been done better. It's phony and contrived when it didn't have to be. Not even James Horner's relentlessly "You-are-watching-something-tragically-Russian-kind-of-like-Dr-Zhivago-but-n ot-as-good" love theme could rescue this sappy love story from it's contrived, manipulative trappings.The plot is riddled with lots more holes because the script here is just poorly written. Usually this plays out by having battles or explosions occur just in time to let characters escape being killed, or by having characters stuck in a huge ruined city just happen to bump into each other to convieniently overhear each other talking, or other such lame manipulative tricks. Enough said. This could have been a good movie, but too bad about the lame plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again we see that all the money in the world thrown into a movie can't make up for one good screenwriter. This is the biggest problem with "Enemy at the Gates", the screenplay is poor and in no way memorable. Full of stock characters, dialogue and situations, it plays more like a high-budget school pageant then a truly gritty war drama. As much as I admire Jude Law, he is very miscast in the role. He has the face for the role, but he needs to dispense of his British accent and refined ways if we are to really beleive he is a Russian peasant. Joseph Fiennes' character is underdeveloped. The love story is merely an annoying distraction, tho that may just be my bias. I would prefer to see this as a "buddy" picture or even more. The electricity generated between Fiennes and Law often suggest as much, and I would love to have seen the emotion between them developed more.The battle scenes are entertaining and impressive, but more surreal than real. That could be great, but I don't think that was that the artistic intent here. Then there's the "soul stirring" musical score. "Sounds like Titanic." I thought. Sure enough, music is by James Horner.Anyone who thinks this is a great war epic, hasn't seen many, but at least it wasn't dull. Indeed, the main reason I enjoyed Enemy at the Gates was for the mesmerizing beauty of the two male leads. But it waste of their acting talents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from the get go Enemy had a few flaws...First and fore most is the way the cast speaks. Pure and proper British. Sure the two leads are British (Law and Fiennes) but, um, they play Russians...Fighting Germans...Very distracting. Compounded by the fact the Russian uniforms (though I am certainly no scholar on war fashions) were this kucka brown/green similar to the Brits. So quite often you were put in a mind twist when they suddenly showed newspapers, graffiti etc. in Russian.." Your mind would quickly check its self-"Oh, yeah, it's Stalingrad, not London, right."What the actors couldn't manage a few lessons with an accent specialist? Can you even imagine Schindler's List with proper British accents? No. Of course not.EATG's story goes...It's WW2. The Russian moral is low. They are losing thousands to the Germans daily. What they need is an all-Ruskie-common-man hero.Soviet yuppie, and journalist, Danilov (Joe " Please leave Ralph out of this!" Fiennes) thinks his friend sniper Vassili (Jude " Cherub faced" Law) would be just the comrade for the troupes and people of the Soviet to adore.They begin a campaign. Real propaganda filled pro-Russian hype. The Germans get quite annoyed as this hero-sniper offs more and more Germans to the glee of the Russian people. They decide to send in their top sniper to wipe out their top sniper. A real hard ball game of Risk.The Nazi they send is Mjr. Koenig (Ed - looking quite sharp all nazied up- Harris).Meanwhile, love's sniper, mythical Cupid hits both Danilov and Vassili's heart with a sharp arrow pointed straight at local peasant turned soldier, Tania ( Rachel Weisz). Will this be the ruin of the two? Can their friendship sustain the interference of penis envy? Will Mjr. Koening get his man?EATG tries so hard to pull at your heartstrings.The acting is absolutely the draw here. Rock solid. But the story, while entertaining at times, is long and just not intriguing enough to keep you enthralled.The Fiennes family is a talented lot. You've got ultra handsome tenderloin of manbeef Ralph, sister Martha a film director, another brother a musician, yet another a gamekeeper, etc...And the matriarch was (as she's sadly passed) a free spirited soul and author, Jini. Then there's little Joey. He's not as swell on the retina as Bro. Ralphie but he's holding his own. He's as intense as his grossly thespian sibling, granted, and proving he too can titillate with theatrical orations worthy of your movie ticket fee.His costar, Jude Law, is such a manfest powerhouse it only strengthens Fiennes' performance. Even in a light hearted casually elegant little role like The Talented Mr. Ripley, or as a trashy and quickly disposed of manboytoy, as in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Law manages to steal a bit of his better known costars glimmer and momentarily take some of the glow for himself. His flawless job as lead here in Enemy at the Gates may just catch him his own well-deserved little shooting star.If your a fan of any the cast, see this just for the stellar performances they cast onto celluloid with albeit moronic accent that repeatedly throws your suspension of disbelief. But don't expect another wartime epic worthy of multiple viewing...Say an English Patient or Saving Private Ryan period piece with soul and girth. It's the two handsome leads alone that even makes this watchable, once.Girly Note: You may want to pack your MPK (movie puke bag) if you decide to see this...the "love" scene is filthy-literally. You are less interested in their lovemaking techniques, than you are worried about the kind of infections those dirty exploring fingers could cause. Yech. Hardly erotic.Snack recommendation: sturgeon, caviar and vodka-natchStarring: Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz and a sore infested Bob Hoskins.</fullReview>

There is a contrived romance and a plot with more holes than any of Vasillys victims. eg Vasilly is cornered by the enemy sniper but brave girlfreind saves him by blinding the enemy sniper with a piece of broken glass. Absurd.I am very disappointed. To see how good the film could have been see the German language film of 1993, "Stalingrad". This film is more realistic and powerful. The cold, the starvation and the terror of Stalingrad tear you apart. The civilians in 1993 Stalingrad are starving hungry, desperate people, just as they would have been in 1942, not the well groomed, well fed, posh English accented toffs in 'Enemy at the Gates'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love story destroyed the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*spoiler warning, don't read unless you've seen the movie*This movie could be good, but the love story destroyed it. The scene where Jude Law and the girlfriend were making out in the barrack was TOTALLY unnecessary. And why did they have to make it that long? Not to mention it's so impossible to have actually happened in that situation and place. Some people in the theater actually chuckled during that scene. I was groaning and couldn't wait for it to be finished.Of course, the accent was also unrealistic, and the ending was disappointing. Why did Ed Harris come out from his hiding, he should have known better. Jude Law wouldn't be so stupid to show his head so Ed could shoot him, so Jude had to still be hiding. They could have made this better. I won't even go into the part where Jude and Rachel met at the end, even after she got hit by a bomb.On the other hand, I really liked the beginning of this movie where they portray the battle on the river. This movie would be much much much better if they cut all the love stories and put in more battle scenes.Some people actually compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. In my opinion, SPR is 100X better than this movie. SPR is a true war movie and the characters stay with it, unlike this one. I knew I should have gone for the bargain matinee show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bravo war scenes!The war scenes of Enemy at the Gates and the battle of Stalingrad are the best war scenes ever made. (Except Saving Private Ryan, of course?). I challenge one to name better war scenes. Though, the movie would have been better if they took out the story altogether and made a film about the battle, and not a Hollywood fabrication of a previous Soviet one. Overall?a good film. Notice how I did not say `great' as it did not break any new ground. A lasting advantage this movie gives is that films about the Soviet side of the war (the most important, by a long-shot) are few and far between and almost never shown on American screens. Hopefully this will provide a booster for future movies. The film suffered from the story that included, shall I mention, a completely pointless sex scenes involving a quite a bit of massaging?if you catch my drift?Both Zaitsev (Law) and Tania (Weisz) speak in their native British accents?quite strange for Red Army troopers. The film would have been a lot better if they left out the mush between Zaitsev and Weisz and told a story about two soldiers trying to kill each other. I hear this talk about how the opening scene was trying to copy Spielberg and ?Saving Private Ryan'. Well good for them because director Annaud did a great job. The opening battle was easily on the level?though the movie was not. On a four star basis, Enemy at the Gates gets a three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, a 2 1/2 hour giant of a motion picture contains no lack of blood, violence and depression but it can give a sense of questioning to the audience. What does the film show in the story? Why are we watching more people die? In the end although there is a climax the questions are still there. It is a prime example of hollywood walking through the "gates" that were so forcefully blasted open by Steven Spielburgs gore epic, Saving Private Ryan. The romantic war epic genre was dead and it gave way to more personal War pictures such as " Full Metal Jacket" or "Platoon". But Spielburg yet again renaming a genre for his own has started a new breed. This film "Enemy at the Gates" contains solid solid acting by a cast that is not afraid to show its stardom. Ed Harris plays the German "Enemy" Sniper who is brought in special from Berlin. But this German sounds to be just out of Hollywood right down to the accent. Thats what this film has on it a sticky grey and green filter of hollywood. A true american classic, no inspiration or thought provoking ideas, just eye candy and our emotions on a platter. After walking out of the theater I felt more like a puppet just released from the strings by the credits, than a member of an audience who just enjoyed a piece of art. Thanks for the memmories though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Movie at the Gates (Ya like that huh?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers within, continue at your own risk.I was looking forward to a war movie set in a battle that is not often portrayed in films. And in the beginning it appeared as if it would deliver... but then that pesky thing called plot and characters caught up with it.My problems with the movie set in a nice labeled manner.1) Everyone is Russian and German, yet they sound either very English or very American, at least TRY to sound like your character.2) The movie degenerates into basically this for a plot 1) Ed Harris talks to kid who tells him stuff 2) Harris and Jude Law have a sniper standoff 3) Repeat steps 1 and 2, 4) Ed Harris is killed, 5) throw in a horribly forced love story (See Point #3 coming up)3) Ahhh, the most annoying point, the tacked on, and totally extraneous love story. This is a WAR movie, if you want a love story see a romance. I could have cared less about whether or not she was alive. (that sounds horrible but meh)4) Entirely too much bad dialogue, enough already, shoot each other! Onward to point 5.5) Ed Harris... he is supposed to be super evil nazi sniper, we want Jude Law to get him! But, we don't, or at least I didn't, he seemed like a rather nice fellow until he hanged Sasha. Ed Harris needed to be thoroughly evil because he is the entire point of the movie.6) Anti-Climactic Climax. Fiennes sticking his head out was so melodromatic, and when Jude Law finally kills Ed Harris I thought "well, he got him, time for credits"So thats my gripe about this movie, I do not recommend it, (unless you like war movies with tacked on love interest, and lots of talking) in which case, run to your movie theater right now! Stop reading this and go!</fullReview>

Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the raw power of the actors' performances, especially Jude Law, to the dreary cinematography, visual effects and stirring musical score (Even though parts of it seem to oddly resemble Schindler's List) Look for this movie to land a slew of Oscar nominations next year, if the Academy remembers it.

		<shortDescription>A powerful film worth watching...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen a screening, this film is a riveting dramatic adaptation about a respected cat and mouse sniper confrontation. Its engaging, realistically brutal, visually beautiful and very impressive. Being billed as the most expensive pan-European film so far, you can be sure that you won't get the usual gun-ho patriotism that you expect from the Hollywood studios.The film is set during the most bloodiest of the Russian-German confontation during World War II, the battle for Stalingrad. Seen as a major propaganda coup for the Nazis, the Russians attempt to fight the same battle by finding a heroic figure for inspiration. This idea is brought forward by Danilov (Fiennes) who suggests the person who has just saved him, Vassily Zaitsev (Law), a maverick sniper who must now live up to the expectations that the Russian propaganda has created. The Nazis counteract by bringing in their crack-shot sniper, what follows is a cat and mouse pursuit.The performances from the lead actors are great, Jude Law, Joseph Finnes and Rachel Weisz hit the mark. Ed Harris' portrayal of the respected Nazi marksman is exceptional, and even Bobby Hoskins' role as the Russian morale-driven general minus the cockney accent is feasible.The production itself is constructed well; the attention to detail in the production design is awesome, the cinematography and editing is stunning and on par with that of Saving Private Ryan - sometimes surpassing it, the fx are remarkable, James Horner's score is emotionally influential, Jean-Jacques Annaud's directoral is commendable. The only flaw is the narrative structure seems a tad formulated and rushed.There have been criticism about the English accents, but I really couldn't see Russell Crowe with a Godfather-style accent in Gladiator either.This is a film that is well worth watching. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assuming that the sniper battle ever happened...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this comment from this authorative source while looking into a new game title Operation FlashpointAddendum by Martin Pegler Curator of Weapons, The Royal Armouries, Leeds, UKWhile researching for a book on sniping, I used some contacts at Russian museums to look into the veracity of the much reported fight between Zeitsev and Koenig [Thorvald]. Despite the fact that Russian company and regimental records were faithfully kept even throughout the worst days of the Stalingrad seige, nowhere is this duel reported in war diaries. This would seem to be an odd omission, particularly in the face of the cult of 'Sniperism' that the Soviet press were so keen to extoll. I tend to agree with Anthony Beevor's opinion that the shooting match never actually happened and was the result of propaganda reporting by the press who were always keen to promote new 'Heroes of the Soviet Union'. Apparently Zeitsev himself never confirmed or denied the event, an odd attitude in view of its apparent historical importance.Enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another happy ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is a visually striking WW2 film, nothing more. The setting is Stalingrad, but every Russian and German sounds like they were deported from the UK. Every single character is ugly except for our wonderful leads (Law, Fiennes, Harris and Weisz) who seems to have fallen from heaven onto the battle field. The story starts out strong, but as usual, it falls short of accomplishing anything. The feeling that you get when you leave the theater is that they reeled you in with a breathtaking first half and the only thing that keeps you in your seat until the end is taking bets as to which of the characters will get a bullet through the eye and which ones will walk into the sunset to live happily ever after. It really is a shame that such talented actors were given such a typical script... but I may be wrong in my assessment because I don't know the true life story of the characters. Maybe the film is exactly what happened, in which case bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great but Still a Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the Battle of Stalingrad like? Probably nobody knows exactly, even if they survived it. We can guess -- house to house, floor-to-floor, and room-to-room killing in the bombed remnants of stone and concrete shells of buildings, basements, sewers, and wreckage, throughout a large, destroyed city, hundreds of thousands of men intent on killing each other, all this going on month after month for how long -- it had to be a hellish pandemonium that defies imagination.This film tries to bring us into that pandemonium. To an amazing degree, it succeeds. Maybe not everything shown is accurate. But many scenes ring true enough. More than one source has claimed that Russian Army punishment was severe for retreating soldiers, and that families were threatened if their son got captured, or surrendered. We know some of the Volga crossings were bloodbaths, as were clashes throughout the ruined downtown. The bombings, the shelling, the snipers, the civilian and military life driven into and under the rubble, we know these things happened. This movie brings us there, in so much detail, you can't get it all in one viewing. The sets are simply amazing.Along with all that great stuff, Jude Law is cute, and same for Rachel Weisz (somehow she defied the odds and grew even more beautiful 11 years later in the Bourne Legacy).So what's missing? Well, the writing could be better. Jean-Jacques Annaud made his first (and apparently only) try at feature screen writing in this film. Why they let him do that, who knows. What couldn't a real writer do with this material? Stalingrad was the the mother of hell on earth! The Nazis were in a mortal drive to the Caspian oil fields. And the legendary Russian snipers! The film brings us Vassily Zaitsev, a real life legendary shooter. Why stop with him? Some of the best Russian WWII snipers were beautiful young women! The lovely, 19-year-old Ludmilla Pavilchenko (over 300 kills) was honored -- while the war was raging -- in London and Washington, even receiving gifts of a 1911 Colt and a Winchester rifle at the White House, before she returned to the war. Another sweet young killer, Roza Shanina, had 54 confirmed kills. It gets even more perfect: Vassily perfected a system of snipers working in threes. You want a story, maybe with a love triangle? The drama practically writes itself. Annaud does put one young woman sniper in the action (played by the lovely Austrian Sophie Rois), but her role is horrible, and short -- she knows how to work her trade in a bombed-out rubble of a department store, but when a wave of German bombers flies over, she panics and runs out into the Nazi shooting gallery.The story: a love triangle. Smart guy makes a good try, but loses pretty brilliant girl to honest farm boy. But it doesn't hold interest, with the exception of a great love scene. Subplot 11-year old becomes a double agent, somehow passing from the German-occupied rubble mounds to the Russian-held sewers and basements pretty much every day, never even getting very dirty! The final shootout seems tacked on without much thought. Back to those incredible sets. If you get pay per view, make sure there's a rewind option for this one.</fullReview>

He, Tania (Rachel Weisz) and countless other untrained recruits are brought up to the front at Stalingrad. He and Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) survive a suicidal charge. Vassili kills 5 Germans in the aftermath and Danilov writes about him. Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) seizes the opportunity to make him a star. Opposing him is the aristocratic German sniper Major König (Ed Harris).The opening is an amazing opera of mass destruction. Then it's a matter of a chess game. It's a fascinating cat and mouse game in the ruins of the city. I'm glad that nobody decided to talk in a fake Russian accent. That would be too distracting.

		<shortDescription>Woeful but basically watchable (the first time)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time of writing, this film has a score of 7.5, which is surprising. Perhaps there are a lot of stupid people in the world, or a lot of people who have a high regard for utter trash. Personally, I was able to sit through it and found it basically watchable, but I spent a lot of time feeling that it lacked quality and accuracy. It is entertaining in a mindless and trashy sort of way. It isn't challenging or educational. The film really does let the subject down; this was a truly tragic period in world history. It deserved the sort of treatment Hitler's last days received in "Downfall". Instead, it got this Hollywood garbage.My main objections are as follows: a) The accents. Ideally, the characters would have spoken in their native languages and those of us who don't speak Russian or German would be given sub titles. This would be the most realistic option. Failing that, the characters could speak in English but with believable accents. This wouldn't be ideal, but would make it easier for the audience to suspend belief. The third option is to speak in English with laughably unbelievable German/Russian accents. This is never good, but there is worse still. The worst option of all, which the producers of this movie opted for: having the Russian characters speak with plummy, English accents so they sound like a gang of lardy-dah, latte-sipping toffs who got lost on their way to Notting Hill and ended up in war torn Stalingrad, circa 1942. This laziness is pathetic and cringe worthy. It ruins the film. But hey, what do you expect from Hollywood? b) The young boy who is apparently able to speak fluent German and Russian (in a plummy English accent, of course)... or is it that the German officer is able to speak fluent Russian? Not sure. Neither seems believable. Nor is it plausible that a young boy would've survived in shorts during a winter that was so cold it killed off the German army.c) The romance element was so unnecessary and frankly preposterous. We get a very brief peak at the bird's rather delicious arse - thanks. But really? "Love making" in a squalid tunnel, in the freezing cold, surrounded by sleeping soldiers, and covered in grime. It must've stank down there! And yet, the ridiculous acting would suggest she had multiple orgasms. More pathetic, Hollywood nonsense for a low IQ, pleb audience.I say many more negative things about it, and yet, I'd still suggest people watch it and make their own minds up. It is watchable and basically entertaining - it's just that you will need to suspend belief more than you should have to, and you won't learn a great deal about what actually happened at Stalingrad. If your objective is to slob out and watch some mindless garbage with decent special effects and some good action sequences then go ahead. But perhaps, like me, you will come away wishing it had been made in Europe or Russia, rather than in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cat-and-mouse duel between two snipers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest, I watched this film mainly because Jude Law stars in it, he's very talented and one of my favorite actors to watch so I decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did, because Enemy at the Gates is not only a great film but one of the best war films I have seen. The story takes place during World War II and is based on real events: Germans and Russians are fighting over every block of Stalingrad and the city is in ruins. Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev, (Jude Law) stalks the Germans, taking them out one by one, thus hurting the morale of the German troops. The political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) leads him on, publishing his efforts to give his countrymen some hope. But Vassili eventually starts to feel that he can not live up to the expectations on him. On top of that he and Danilov fall in love with the same girl, a female soldier called Tanya(Rachel Weisz). From Germany comes the master sniper König (Ed Harris) to put an end to the extraordinary skilled Russian sniper... The film's visual style is grand, the battle scenes are chaotic and extremely well made and so were the sequences that show a devastated Stalingrad. Art directors, editors and cinematographers, all did a terrific job. But the main storyline is the cat-and-mouse duel between the brave and heroic Vassili and the cold and driven König as each sniper tries to stay one step ahead of the other. Jude Law's performance was subtle but very efficient, but his British accent will probably bother the purists. The supporting cast made the most of their roles. A special mention to Ed Harris who was very convincing and menacing as the German Sniper König. Many have commented that the love triangle feels out of place but for me, it's just another side to a great story. Overall, Enemy at the Gates is a very nice film, technically superb, and a must see for those interested in the war.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1942, and the Russians are brutalized by the Nazi Army at Stalingrad. Still, the Russian resisters proclaim, "Never will the enemy put his foot on the soil of Stalingrad!" Sharp-shooting soldier Jude Law (as Vassili Zaitsev) meets, and bonds with, commissar comrade Joseph Fiennes (as Danilov). Mr. Fiennes, who survives massacre by playing possum, is very impressed with Mr. Law's sniper fire. Law had been firing between the eyes since his days as a shepherd boy. After losing several Germans to Law's bullets, the Nazis send their own Major sharpshooter, Ed Harris (as König), out to bag Law. Meanwhile, Law and Fiennes form the obligatory "love triangle" with fetching Rachel Weisz (as Tania).Jean-Jacques Annaud directs big production values well enough, and the story's setting is a refreshing change from the usual western-fronted World War II epics. But, the whole thing collapses under its unnecessary, and startlingly ordinary "love triangle". Law and Ms. Weisz are the main lovey-dovey duo. Their love-making scene may remind you about... well, not waking up the roommate. Duplicitous chocolate-loving young Gabriel Thomson (as Sasha) and Mr. Harris portray somewhat more interesting supporting characters.****** Enemy at the Gates (2001) ~ Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film reminds me of John Mackenzie's "The Fourth Protocol" where we have good English actors who are portraying Russian people, speaking with a British accent (In scenes that are allegedly taking place in Russia).Not that it matters that much, especially in this film: But I do think that an actor like Bob Hoskins would have been able to pull off a Nikita Krushev, especially after all of the characters he has made us believe in the last 25 years.I have the same problems with Ed Harris, not that he was not the perfect actor to portray the German Sniper: He is just so... American.Nevertheless, if you ignore these little irritants, this is a great film, apparently a true story pulled out of a huge book about Russia in WW II: but expanded and dramatized.Jude Law looks as good as any other character part he has taken, whether it is Lemony Snicket, Sky Captain, Joe from AI, or, my favourite, Errol Flynn in The Aviator. This role just adds more to his already huge repertoire of characterizations.The cast of this film is just marvelous, a part for just about all of my favourite character actors. Add to that the set that was built for this little drama to be enacted out on.I like films where details are believable, aka, honest films. Well, the details that Jean-Jacques Annaud decided to show us are in fact the details that are important. It would just have been my personal taste to have the accents done according to country at least, but in retrospect, it did not take away from my enjoyment of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the finest World War Two film of recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is something of a rarity in twenty-first century cinema- a large-scale war film made on this side of the Atlantic. (It is officially described as an Anglo-Irish-German-American co-production). It is, moreover, a war film which deals with the concepts of patriotism, honour and heroism in a straightforward, not a satirical or cynical, manner. The twist is that the hero is not American or British, but Russian. The film is set during the battle of Stalingrad in 1942/43, and is based upon the story of Vassili Zaitsev, a Russian soldier who distinguished himself as a sniper, killing around 250 enemy combatants. Zaitsev was a real individual, although the film does not always accurately follow the facts of his life. There are two major strands to the plot. One (presumably fictitious) deals with a love-triangle involving Zaitsev, a political commissar named Danilov and a female soldier named Tania. The other deals with a duel between Zaitsev and a top German sniper, Major Koenig. This duels was widely reported as fact in the Soviet media at the time, but modern historians have doubted whether it took place and even whether Koenig actually existed. It may simply have been invented by Soviet propagandists to boost morale at a time when the war was going badly. In the nineties there was a tendency in Hollywood films to cast British actors as the villains, which caused some adverse comment in the British media. When, therefore, Ed Harris (the only big-name American star in the film) was cast as Koenig, some thought that this was a case of the British getting revenge by having an American play the Nazi villain. (All the main Russian parts went to British actors). Koenig, however, is not the only villain in this film. Certainly, he is cold, cynical and cruel, but the Russian political boss Nikita Khrushchev, sent by Stalin to oversee the defence of the city, can be equally ruthless. Khrushchev, of course, was another real-life character, a leading Communist Party official who was eventually to succeed Stalin as Soviet dictator. If Koenig and Khrushchev are the villains, and Zaitsev and his sweetheart Tania are the heroes, Danilov is a morally ambiguous figure. At first he seems to possess a humanity and idealism which set him apart from the other Communist political officers who are distinguished only by fanaticism and brutality. It is he who suggests to Khrushchev that they should inspire the men by providing them with real-life examples of heroism. Khrushchev agrees, largely because his own preferred method of shooting any Red Army soldiers, up to and including the rank of General, who show insufficient stomach for the fight, has proved disastrously counterproductive. (The Germans are broadcasting to the Russian soldiers that it is the Communist Party hierarchy, and not they, who are the true enemies of the Russian people, and the behaviour of the NKVD men under Khrushchev's command makes even this outrageous claim seem more credible). Danilov suggests his friend Zaitsev, who has already distinguished himself as a sniper, as a true Russian hero.Later, however, Danilov seems less sympathetic. The Soviet propaganda machine has built Zaitsev into a near-mythical figure, and when the Germans send Koenig to the front from Berlin with the specific purpose of killing him, Danilov has to stage-manage the duel between them. Propaganda demands that Zaitsev, the working-class peasant lad from the Urals, who learnt to shoot on hunting trips with his grandfather, should take on the arrogant, decadent German aristocrat and beat him at his own game. At times Danilov seems deliberately to be sending Zaitsev into harm's way, and he may have mixed motives for doing so. He needs to engineer this confrontation to avoid falling foul of Khrushchev, but there is also a suggestion that, consciously or unconsciously, he would welcome the death of a man who is loved by the woman he himself loves. The climax of the film comes with the duel between Koenig and Zaitsev. The two men are very different. Harris's Koenig, considerably the older of the two, is cool, detached and confident; Zaitsev, as played by Jude Law is more nervous, fearful and doubtful of his own abilities. Harris and Law receive excellent support from Bob Hoskins as the Machiavellian, bullying Khrushchev and the lovely Rachel Weisz as Tania. The sombre nature of the plot is emphasised by an equally sombre look given by low-level lighting and a dull colour scheme dominated by the greys and browns of the ruined buildings and the grey-green and khaki of the uniforms. The only vivid colour we see is red- the red of blood, of flames, of the officers' collar flashes and of the Nazi and Soviet flags. Other bright colours are almost totally absent. This film may have been influenced by Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" made three years earlier. Although the battle scenes do not perhaps have quite the same brutal power as those in the earlier film, they are nevertheless very well done. (Particularly memorable was the early one in which Russian soldiers crossing the Volga are strafed by German aircraft; those who stay put are killed by the enemy and those who try to escape are shot as cowards by their own officers). In fact, I rate this film higher than "Saving Private Ryan" and considerably higher than another big American wartime epic, "Pearl Harbour", which also came out in 2001. Of the three, "Enemy of the Gates" is the only one which succeeds in successfully integrating military action with its human themes. It may well be the finest World War Two film of recent years. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..it didn't matter to me that everyone spoke English - after all, it WAS directed at an English-speaking audience ! Thank heavens I didn't need to strain to understand what folk were saying - if you want realism in speech, then get a version that is in the native tongues.I do feel empathy for the several reviews I read which were written by people who were native Russians. I'm sure they saw it through different eyes than Americans did. My response to their anger is just be glad you're in the USA - just think of how many films you may have seen "at home" that painted Americans as devils, yet we're not writing to tell you you're wrong. Welcome to the USA, but would you please send your "Mafia" home - we have enough of our own.Again, so many reviews written by very young "users", who have only the movies to show them what war is. It was 2001, folk: pre-Iraq. Although we got all torn-up about 9/11 and our leaders made the wrong decision about invading Iraq, just imagine a major, American city all busted-up like Stalingrad was. We had the comfort of grand theaters and our homes to watch safely. Those people were fighting the people right next door, not really knowing who was whom - some "users" said how ridiculous it was to film enemy-snipers shooting one another in the department-store scene, but that was reality. Whatever space you were in, you had to keep yourself alive and keep the space, and KILL to get someone else's space. Made sense to me.....Jean-Jacques Annaud and Alain Godard got it all going right from the first scene. No one else noticed that once the train-doors were opened and the Russian soldiers saw the wreckage of Stalingrad, they were trying to get back on it? That's the first thing I noticed - I also got the message when the barges were crossing the river full of soldiers and the German planes came, overboard! with the Russian officers shooting them. That was not fiction - it happened wherever Russia sent its troops - die fighting, or die because you didn't fight. Stalin sent 2-mil soldiers just to fight at Stalingrad - many without weapons - Jude Law (Zaitsev) left the train without a rifle. Being an expert shot, I suspect he was looking right-hard to get one in his hands. When he did, it set the plot of the entire movie - Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) was soooooo lucky ! Knowing the Russian troops needed some propaganda to be "pepped-up" from all the gore, he used what he saw firsthand.I thought the cinematography was brilliant and was repelled at the way the Russian soldiers were sent to the slaughter, but that's facts, folk. Bob Hoskins looked like Krushshev to me ! I also thought it was ironic that he did the big "toast" to Stalin - although they were antagonists.......he had to do what it took to get the troops fighting. Yeah, I saw the reporter stuffing his bags with stolen food. Those "users" who criticized the "party-scene" between battles weren't thinking right - it was an escape, just like in "Jarhead". The same for the sex-scene (didn't enjoy it); get that many people together under great stress and sex is going to happen. I thought the Russian troops were lucky to have female fighters to have sex with......I also could have done without the intrusive score; sounded a lot like "Gone with the Wind" to me.Yeah, I DID think Ed Harris (Konig) could've spiced-up his role with a touch of German accent - he truly looked the part. His calm demeanor throughout the movie was excellent - Prussian aristocrat, you could say. Yes, the view through both snipers' lenses were the best, but that's what the movie was about - huh? Eva Mattes was stellar in her under-playing of her role - hopeless, but ready to get-it-on again. The kid - Gabriel Thompson (Sacha) - TRULY needed some warmer clothes ! Russia had two great advantages for the 2nd WW - sub-zero weather, which greatly weakened the Germans during the battle for Moscow - and lots of male peasants to throw away. Without those, the war would have been much longer and more American soldiers would have died.After all these criticisms, I immensely enjoyed this film, because I briefly laughed at what I felt was a bit unbelievable, but got right back into the story. It's always "the story" for me - accurate or not. The blood-and-guts totally convinced me the battle for this city was a nightmare I hopefully pray never happens again - but, it continues.....see the daily news about Baghdad, as "Bergy from Baghdad" (March 2003) attests. War movies glorify bravery from one side, but there is much death for the other. Not one thing glamorous or entertaining about that. I recently wrote if I wanted to see explosions, I'd watch a film about war. I did - horrific as it was, "Enemy at the Gates" is a winner that more people should see or watch again, just to catch-them-up on history. In this case, it wasn't just a movie - it was telling it like it was........and is. That makes it a 15-out-of-10 for me......I'm still wondering why Sacha had to die. Best actor in the whole thing.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More educational than entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pluses of "Enemy at the Gates" much outweigh the minuses. In all, the movie was an effective display of brutality in war, and of some of the nonsense that goes on not only in war, but in the world, that leads to bloodshed. Often what makes a film is great acting from all the minor characters. In this movie, the minor characters outshine the stars in every instance. I think of it more a warning than a spoiler to state that Perlman, whose character the viewer knows will die, is killed almost as soon as he is introduced. People expecting to see more from him should expect to see what amounts to a large cameo instead. However, he does dominate while on screen, and does have the major line of the movie, about the sickle and the hammer. The three Russian leads are drawn with some compassion and humanity, but they don't stir a lot of interest, and the actors playing these roles are the worst at enunciating and expressing their words. You basically have to guess at what they are saying, and that is unforgivable. It is more important to convey the message and characters than to simply speak with thick accents. Indeed, it is Sacha and his mother who dominate the story, although they don't appear that much. And it is the quest of the mother in the end that draws the viewer instead of the quest of the lead character. Gabriel Thomson gives an incredible performance as the tyke, Sacha, and Eva Mattes is downplayed as the mother, but does admirably in her small screen time. The plot is probably one of the weak points here. Its hard to make excitement out of "cat and mouse", and the story takes heavy theatrical license. The director makes the mistake of showing whole scale carnage that can't be escaped early in the film, yet tries to persuade the viewer to believe the lead character and the German sniper can only be killed by each other. Of course, younger viewers will appreciate the larger than life characters and accept this, but mature viewers will be puzzled by the directing, which means they're paying more attention to the method than the story, a bad sign for an entertainer. Still, there are more truths than fallacies to the story, and it is enlightening. The directing and film editing look splotched. Sacha, for example, just magically appears in the presence of the German sniper. There are other examples. But the director redeems himself overall. The last sequence involving Ed Harris and Gabriel Thomson is extremely effective. Looks more like a classroom educational film with marginal entertainment value than a blockbuster, but overall a film with more pluses than minuses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had a strange combination of realism and artificiality. The set designers did their job very well. Even a quick scribbled note would be in Cyrillics and subtitles would explain what it said. Yet, the lead characters all looked like they were in rosy good health (except for the occasional carefully placed scratch) and spoke clear English. The exception was Ed Harris; he spoke clear English, but I found him more credible in his role. Beyond that, the movie seemed determined to telegraph where it was going. If something bad were going to happen to a character, there would be a scene 20 minutes earlier in which the character would be warned: "What you're doing is dangerous!" I enjoyed the movie as a depiction of the Battle of Stalingrad, but I was never able to immerse myself in the story and believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult movie to rate, especially because it is so full of contradictions.The film has a powerful story, great, incredibly realistic cinematography and excellent special effects. On the other hand, while trying to be realistic in the cinematic sense, it completely fails to be that with regard to the story, and above all, attention to details: First and foremost, the shooting accuracy shown in the film is simply impossible, it cannot be done. Secondly, the depiction of life in the city outside of the 'shooting duel' is totally unbelievable, it has a semblance of normality, as if the war in that city didn't exist, as if only the duel seems to be happening... Furthermore, the characters... the depicting of Nikita Khruschov is so cartoonesque, it isn't even funny any more... no, no, no! The sharpshooter Maj. Koenig, his character would have been depicted in a more believable manner in any average comic book!Nevertheless, the sheer potential of the story, the camera and the special effects make this film worth watching and elevate it to slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good war film set in a battle not familiar with many people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the of winter 1942 inside a Russian city called Stalingrad the biggest land battle of history was taking place,This is the setting for the film "Enamy at the gates"."Enemy at the gates"tells the story of a young freshly enlisted red army solider called Vasili Zaitsev played by Jude Law. From the start we follow the young Russian's journey across southern Russia to the burned out city of Stalingrad,now partly occuiped by the advancing German army wanting to take over Russia.There awaiting him and his fellow comrades are red army officers eager to get him killed on one side and the German army on the other lying in wait to kill him,(These poor lad's didn't stand a chance!).As it turns out Vasili is a crack shot with a rifle and with the help of his new found friend Danilov who is a army political officer Vasili is transfered to snipper division and his name and how many German officers he pick's off day by day is printed then expanded throughout Russia for propaganda purposes.Danilov play's Zaitsev up as a national hero bringing some much needed hope into the heart's of the Russian people.Understandably the German high command are a bit p*s*ed off with this young talented Russian and his snipper division picking off their officers so they decided to send in their own crack shot a man by the name of major Konig to hunt and kill Vasili and his snipper platoon. So what we get is a cat and mouse chase through a devastated Stalingrad.In this nightmare setting Vasili falls in love and vis-versa with a young female solider callled Tania played by Rachel Weisz,concurrently so does Danilov which cause's tension between the boy's,Danilov wanting Vasili out of the way sends him on more and more suicide mission's ,All this lead to a grand finale between Zaitsev and Konig. The battle scene's are very gritty and authentic plus they are shown true to the battle as a no win situation's for both side's.The director use's lots of close up shots in the duals between the snippers capturing the tension and nerve that is with them as they lie in wait for the next kill,Theirs an excellent scene in the film were the snippers are trapped in a building under target from each other and at the same trying to survive a aerial bombardment from the German bombers. The cast which unglued Ed Harris as Major Konig,Josegh Fiennes as Danilov and a very resembling with the help of make-up Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushev.All of them including Jude,Rachel and the support cast give applauseable poformance's in their role's and bring the characters to life.This is a well made picture and a breath of fresh air to audience's in the west used to seeing WW2 movie from an American or British point of view,Although it doesn't totally capture the true horror of what the Germans and Russians went through in the east(no film could)it does a pretty decent job never the less and credit must go to the film makers and film company for being brave enough to make and finance a war movie(including a love story as well)that doesn't involve the US marine's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame Version Of A Well Known Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zaitsev and Chernova are historical figures: both became Heroes of the Soviet Union. The duel between Zaitsev and the German übersniper is a well known part of the Stalingrad story, even though its authenticity is strongly disputed. David Robbins's 1999 novel War of the Rats is a much better fictional telling of the tale, and much truer to the details of the sniper's craft.The producers of Enemy at the Gates either couldn't or wouldn't buy the rights to Robbins's novel, and much of the script appears to have been written to avoid infringing the novel's characterizations and incidents. The German's death at the climax of the story suffers in particular -- it reminds me of nothing so much as the "clever girl" scene from Jurassic Park.As written, Enemy of the Gates follows pretty closely the standard boxing movie of the 1930s and 40s. Think of Zaitsev as the Fighter, Commisar Danilov as the Scrappy Manager, Chernova as The Girl Who Comes Between Them, Khruschev as the Sinister Promoter, and the German as the Brutal Adversary In The Big Fight, and it all fits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really did an excellent job of displaying the struggle of war on the Russian front. War is hell, and it was worse on the Russian front. Stalingrad is regarded as the most brutal battle of World War 2 and I believe it. I believe this movie is effective in proving it. Ed Harris did a great job of playing his role of the German sniper, Major Koenig. I think they could have found someone else to play the role of the Russian sniper, Vassily Zaitsev, but he did fine. I just think someone with a stronger personality like Matt Damon would have fit the role better. You can't find anybody better than Bob Hoskins to fit the role of Nikita Kruschev. He was perfect. The artwork was excellent. This movie showed the brutality of both sides, but I am sure it could have gone farther which I am glad it didn't. There is only a certain amount of brutality necessary to get the point across. It was not 100% accuraate which is why the movie is basically banned in Volgagrad, but why does anybody expect 100% from Hollywood. It is just a great movie</fullReview>

The ending could have ended the same but with more thought put into it ( crawling at night).In the battle of Stalingrad there were hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting. rough numbers of dead equal a million Russians and 300 000 Germans.

But, the movie is brilliant. Jude Law is amazing in it. I couldn't wish for a better movie to show World War II for what it really was. It's historical, but I will admit it plays some things up.

		<fullReview>Like many others before me, when this film came out I thought, "Oh great. Another film to piggyback on the success of 'Saving Private Ryan'." So I was not very interested in seeing it then, though I was intrigued by Jude Law and Rachel Weisz. After finally viewing it after a few years, I was pleasantly surprised, not only by the human elements in the harsh urban combat environment, but also by the strong supporting cast. Law and Weisz led me to watch it initially, but then seeing that Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, and Ron Perlman played roles made me determined to see this film. None of these fine actors chooses his roles lightly. (I admit that some of their films have been sub-par, but not through the fault of the actors themselves.) I tend to like ensemble films with several strong supporting roles, however brief. This one did not disappoint me--fine acting all around.My compliments go also to the director for his attempt to bring the vast scale of the Battle of Stalingrad down to two men hunting each other. His research into the combat tactics of snipers and urban warfare seemed very thorough. Possibly among the books used was a 1999 novel by David L. Robbins called "War of the Rats," a title I highly recommend here to any fan of the film. The book also tracks Zaitsev and a top German sniper (named Thorvald in the novel rather than Konig) through the wastes of the city. To those of you who believe that books are often better than films, I offer one more title for you to browse.I wonder now why I waited so long to see this film. It was an enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stalingrad. The largest single battle in recorded history, or maybe in the history of the universe. Two huge armies fighting over control of a huge industrial city with factory complexes one-mile long located in one of the most inaccessible parts of western Russia. The outcome of World War Two hinges on the outcome of this stupendous battle. The battle itself should have been more than sufficient to render this movie great, or at least nearly great. But, alas, that does not happen. Instead, this movie attempts to give us an "up close and personal" account of the battle of Stalingrad in the form of some kind of contest between one German soldier and one Russian soldier to prove who's the best sniper. Well, who cares? At least a million soldiers and civilians died in this battle, so what's the fuss about two individual soldiers? The beginning of the movie is most compelling, but when the story evolves, or devolves, into some kind of personal struggle, then, if you take this movie at face value, maybe the Battle of Stalingrad was nothing but a big soap opera, the outcome of which just happened to change the course of history. Oh, by the way, there's also a love scene in this movie. (Imagine having a love scene in Guadalcanal Diary.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That the director of this movie knows how to handle his craft is visible from the very first scene, where the soldiers arrive in Stalingrad and all of the explosions &amp; grand vistas are perfectly choreographed. There are many other such scenes in the movie as well, personal as well as grand.The trouble with this movie, for me at least, is that none of it feels very real; it feels exactly like a Hollywood war movie, a film for people who love action movies. This isn't simply because all of the "Russians" speak in English (I have to give them props for at least not attempting to do a bad Russian accent), but because none of the characters really seem "real". All of them are, in true Hollywood fashion, larger-than-life; they say and do things that you don't think actual people would do in those situations. Frankly, I think that the best acting is when you do not realize that the characters are acting. In this film, I definitely realized it; this film's purpose is primarily to entertain, not to show the truth. This is fine for some types of movies but not, I think, for a war movie; this film glamorizes the war, makes every person a hero, and shows us more of an aristocrat's view of the war than a soldier's. And of course, there is a love story as well. ;) This movie has practically nothing in common with the philosophy of Russian war movies (which are generally much more honest); it's really a Hollywood interpretation of the war in Stalingrad by people who were not there, and there are times when they really misinterpret the situation. Khruchev, the future Soviet leader who oversaw the defence of Stalingrad, is portrayed in this film as a dangerous drunk; in one scene he actually gives somebody a gun; "perhaps you'd like to avoid the red tape"! Somehow, this doesn't seem very likely from the leader who later revealed Stalin's crimes in front of the whole country after his death, freed thousands of political prisoners, and took steps towards more openness and freedom of speech. This portrayal of Khruchev is a relic of American Cold War propaganda, and it reminded me that I have to watch this film with a grain of salt.It's certainly an exciting movie, but for an authentic view of Russia's side of WW2, you'd have to look elsewhere. I HEAVILY recommend Elem Klimov's masterpiece "Come and See", which is perhaps one of the most honest and brutal war films you'll ever see. As likely as not, you'll never want to watch another Hollywood war film again! Another good choice is Tarkovsky's "My Name is Ivan". (seriously, check those films out, they're both amazing!)Overall: 7/10</fullReview>

War itself is ugly but there are the passion and fears of the people involved. This film has it all, and because it focused on a personal battle between two men, it draws you in. The cinemaphotography, music score, tremendous acting keeps the film moving without reflections of why we are all here as with Tom Hanks and his crew. Some criticism of this film is because it tries to be an epic and it falls short. Enjoy the film for what is NOT what you think the film is trying to be.

		<fullReview>No, I'm not referring to anything in the storyline, or the cast, characters or the acting - all of these were really quite superb (I thought) and have been very well covered in the other comments I've read, although I did have a tiny little bit of trouble with Bob Hoskins for a while...I'm referring to the technicalities: historical detail, settings, scenery, props, sounds, colour, lighting, camera work, costumes, make-up, weapons and machinery handling - all the things that, if done right, go to make a truly believable and watchable war movie which this most definitely is.I reckon 'modern' war movies have to be the very hardest genre to get right, especially when they refer (as they almost always do) to real events and double especially when survivors of those events are still alive today. Other than, say, real-life biopics, almost any other genre can get away with minor inaccuracies or fudging the details, but with a war movie - make just one little mistake and you're dead. Get it wrong and the whole effort is reduced to farce or parody. A shot of a modern Coke bottle might make a big, effective and intriguing point in a sci-fi film - a similar anachronism in a WW2 film and the whole thing's straight out of the window, in my book.Discounting some dodgy CGI (Stukas), EATG was a visual and audible feast of truly epic proportions which you will not begrudge the time taken to watch it. The story, based on real events, is very well done and is set in a phenomenal landscape, littered with a wholly believable destruction and debris of war on the Eastern Front - well up there with Saving Private Ryan for my money. All in all, a tribute to JJ Annaud's continuing production of superior and highly recommendable films. (Watch this one twice - there's plenty more to see, second time around!)An easy (but rare for me) 9 out of 10 - perhaps not quite perfect, but it don't come *much* better than this.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In other words, Brits on skids...Jokes aside, this one is a good if not flawless war movie. The producers call it mystery-thriller. I still call it war movie, since there is no mystery in who is who in this one.But what in Heavens, has this movie to do with the Battle at Stalingrad? Stalingrad is just a poor excuse to rehash the war genre. Even though the story bases itself on historic figures, it is rather superficial in scope.What really bothered me though, was this very pronounced British accent in Russian uniforms! And Hoskins as Kruschchev is simply ridiculous! Especially when he tries to emulate a Russian accent with Cockney undertones. What is London? A suburb of Stalingrad? I appreciate his immense effort, but still he does not possess the stamina to play the, much younger then, and more energetic Nikita Kruschchev (I can see him as Beria anytime...).Acting in general, is good but could be far more greater.The only one who really stands out this time is Ed Harris. He does a magnificent job as a German expert sniper with a casual fatality about the job he has to accomplish (those who are about to die, salute you...).Annaud is not really at his best in this one. Although Stalingrad has been reproduced quite well, Annaud simply makes it an action shooting movie, adding here and there some pathos to help the actors involved getting along with the plot...If you want to watch truly impressive movies about the battle of Stalingrad, then rent or buy the 1992 released "Stalingrad" or even better, the 1949 Russian movie "The battle at Stalingrad". Both will tell you a lot more about the horrors of war and the mistakes of the Wehrmacht in misjudging its own capabilities, than this wimpy and seemingly intellectual film...Sorry, Jean-Jacques, try harder next time. In the meanwhile, try to enjoy other movies, especially those mentioned before, as well as a German movie on the same subject, called "Hunde, wollt Ihr Ewig leben?" (Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?), or the story of the battle, viewed from the German side, with no frills, nor love story. Just the crude reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated film about Stalingrad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had only heard bad things about this movie until I rented it a few days ago. I had heard it was slow, dull, stiffly acted and unrealistic. And also I had heard people being critical to fact that the cast speaks flawless Oxford English throughout the film.I was very positively surprised by this film. I too would have preferred an all-Russian/German cast (see Stalingrad (1992)), but that's my only real critique of the film. The production values are great, you really get the sense of being in Stalingrad during the war with all it's horrors and not in a movie set. Jude Law is terrific as the Russian sniper along with rest of the cast. I liked the pace of the film also.I watch this film just after having seen Saving Private Ryan for the first time since it came out, so I really can compare them. Enemy at the gates isn't as great as the Spielberg film, but it certainly holds it's own when you compare them.I was also surprised not to hate the love scene. I usually hate misplaced and redundant love scenes you often encounter (see Matrix: Reloaded and you will know what I mean). But I think this one makes perfect sense. In the face of imminent death the two characters takes an opportunity to make love that might not present itself again.If you liked Saving Private Ryan you're probably gonna like this one too. I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite Ed Harris' American accent as the German sniper, there are no American characters to be found anywhere. Similarly, Jude Law and his fellow Russians have British accents but there are no official British characters to be found anywhere.Jude Law is the Russian sniper who is turned into a folk hero by his newspaper printing pal and fellow soldier Joe Fiennes and later ends up competing with him for the affections of "The Mummy" babe Rachael Weisz. Naturally, Rachael favors the gun toting Jude over man of the written word Joe, which leads to jealousy on both fronts before Joe ultimately sacrifices himself to help Jude in his cat and mouse game against German sniper Ed Harris.The acting is fine and the film looks and feels rightly gritty, but is marred by the tired scenario of the two soldier buds in love with the same woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalingrad the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw parts of this film a couple of years back, and I thought it wasn't too bad. I just finished reading the great book called Stalingrad. Now I want to watch the film again, to see whether the historical facts are true to some extent. There was an actual sniper hero called Zaitsev, and Paulus was the commander of the 6th army. There also were other facts. Why weren't the allied countries more aware of the Stalingrad victory? I never thought of it as great as it actually was, because this was the first major setback for Nazi Germany. I didn't think of the movie as that great, I gave it a 7/10. But.. I found it fascinating and it was filled with action, so I really want to watch it again now after having read the book, which also is very recommendable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-SPOILERS-Having read the earlier comments I was not expecting an accurate portrayal of the Eastern Front. I did however expect to see a reasonably realistic portrayal of hand-to-hand fighting. However I was not prepared for the abysmal effort that I saw.I don't believe that this could be said to be unusual for showing the Eastern Front from the Soviet perspective. There are few enough films from this theatre at all. This travesty was more from the American perspective than the Soviet.This film was fundamentally flawed at almost every level. Unlike some reviewers, I don't believe that it is in the least bit realistic. True, it does show severed limbs, and lots of blood. But real bullets don't travel at the speed of light, nor are battles so quite and smoke-free. The tactics referred to by a previous commentator were non-existent. The battle consisted of a few set-piece infantry charges, and low-flying planes. No artillery barrages, anti-tank guns, minefields, barbed wire, or even hand-to-hand fighting. German tanks were invariably seen peacefully parked on parade.Apparently untrained, though well-dressed, Red Army recruits arrive by train and are immediately launched into human wave attacks against Germans. They are totally unsupported, with only one rifle for two men. No artillery, no machine-guns, and no officers. They are not even supported by machine-guns: these were kept in reserve for use against the inevitably-retreating Russians. The officers led from the safety of the rear. Even the most desperate forces would have shown better tactics. The Red Army of 1942 may have been short of good leaders (due to Stalin's purges more than the war), but it was more intelligent, and better prepared, than that. In fact artillery barrages supported combined arms assaults by armies that had trained in Siberia. A much more professional affair altogether.A Political Commissar would not have driven a car right through the front line. It was not unexpected that he became a target. The pamphlets he carried were a joke (perhaps they were meant to be?)- `No German will set foot on the soil of Stalingrad' [sic]. This was a battle right in the middle of the city! Actually the debris would have made road traffic impossible for a wheeled vehicle. Lying against a parapet, and aiming his rifle at the enemy, the Commissar then asks a soldier lying nearby if he knows how to fire a gun- not if he is uninjured and able to fire a gun. It isn't clear whether his reluctance to himself fire stems from his arm injury, or some other cause. But it was certainly an odd question to ask an infantryman.The softest of targets had presented itself. Not just one but several corpulent and semi-clothed Germans intent on taking a shower and generally relaxing. Such behaviour in the middle of a battle, and right on the front-line, is odd, not to say certifiableFor what was supposed to be the most vicious battle on the Eastern Front to date, the battle had an odd way of petering out. Tanks were generally static, apparently wanting to be hit by anti-tank weapons. The front itself was also relatively static. The battle seemed to rage over a couple of factories. Yet despite this, there was barely any barbed wire, and few enough soldiers to be seen most of the time. A boy wanders around the frontline, passing the non-existent mines, barbed wire, and sentries with ease.It is unlikely that a German major would have his boots shined by a Russian boy, who crosses the front daily without papers and without questions ostensibly for that purpose. He would certainly have been stopped on the Russian side if he had been carrying German chocolate. That was not an area for civilians, particularly children.The German Army had- and has- a proper appreciation of the role, selection and training of officers. No General would ever commission 25 sergeants in a single day. They would rather go without officers. The producer apparently doesn't know the difference between officers and men in the Wehrmacht. It is not simply a matter of the latter being promoted to fill vacancies amongst the former.Women were not integrated into Russian army units. There were some all-women units, created more for propaganda that practical use. Red Army interpreters on radio interception would not be involved with deciphering, as was suggested. Nor would they be allowed to join infantry, particularly if a woman.The iron-hard discipline seen at the start was apparently abandoned on the front, with people wandering in and out, and no sign or any leadership or organisation. Soldiers were apparently living where they wished. It was very quite and relaxed for the centre of a major battle.Snipers would be organised under their own leaders. They wouldn't simply wander in and out, to be reinforced from time to time by women interpreters! And no sniper facing his greatest foe would emerge from cover and saunter across a railway-line; unless he wanted to be killed. But perhaps he did.A Political Commissar's job is to make soldiers die for the Party, not to do it themselves. I can understand why Danilov might have wanted to die, but standing up was suicide unless the sniper was ready to spot the fire. Zaitsev was distracted by the gesture and its inevitable outcome and inevitably failed to see where the shot came from. Stupid.A patient would not be left in hospital some weeks or months after surgery. There would be many more with more pressing need.I could go on. Enemy at the Gates is not a good war film. It isn't a good drama, either. The characters were two dimensional. The efforts to show the German as the nasty enemy was too forced. I must say that my sympathy was with Major Konig. He was the reluctant professional, forced to do his duty though he knew he was likely to die. I liked the way he carefully put his gloves on before going out to do battle. The Russian simply enjoyed killing. He didn't even profess patriotic or Communist reasons for doing so.If the producers thought they had captured a monumental battle between an evil Nazi and a heroic Soviet they were quite wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching such films as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Patton;" I have come to appreciate war films. For this reason, I decided to see the latest war film, "Enemy At The Gates.""Enemy At The Gates" is one of the best war films I have seen since "Saving Private Ryan" because it is executed perfectly. With incredible performances, script and the impact I felt; "Enemy At The Gates" sets the tone as the first great war film of the 22nd century. This film can be served as the appetizer to the main course coming out soon, "Pearl Harbor."Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins come together to re-visit the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The best thing about seeing each one of the actors perform was they all gave 100 percent effort to make the film as real as possible; they did an excellent job. Fiennes, Weisz and Hoskins were the icing to a cake that was delicious from the start.The highlights of "Enemy At The Gates" always came when Law and Harris were on screen because they played excellent psychological mind games with one another to win; furthermore, it was like watching master chess players playing for the grand prize. It was also enjoyable to see the strategies and tactics each would use to out-maneuver the other."Enemy At The Gates" drew me with its many action sequences similar to those in "Saving Priate Ryan." Also, the love triangle between the three main leads was interesting to watch and see how it would unfold. I felt like I was in the movie because the writer did an excellent job at making me feel exactly what they felt and experience what they were going through.There is no rule that states dialogue is needed for a successful film. While "Enemy At The Gates" has dialogue, the scenes that have none stand out in my mind the most because we see close-ups of both snipers and the expressions on their faces. This is incredible to me because the intensity shown on their faces speaks volumes about what the movie is really about.This is not be the best war film ever made but with two of the brightest young stars on the rise, an actress that is here to stay and a veteran that continues to turn in knock-out performances, "Enemy At The Gates" will be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not usually into war films, and i have to say that the battle of Stalingrad never particuarly interested me. However, this film was really good and i found it really compelling.Jude Law is good as the heroic sniper, who becomes very well known for his expert shooting. Ed Harris I think stole the show as the 'bad guy' German Sniper who plays a game of cat and mouse with Jude Law.Even though the film was really good, and kept with the facts, i felt that the love triangle involving Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz was a bit pointless. I find it weird that every film - no matter what its genre HAS to have a love story somewhere. Never mind though. I'd recommend it if not for the fact that it is a compelling film, which gives a good picture of what the battle of Stalingrad was like.MY RATING: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might seem ok, if you're not familiar with real history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only plausible reason for this movie's existence is the director's ego.Why do I say this? I find it remarkable that he would find the actual events surrounding the battle of Stalingrad so un-compelling that he would choose to invent his own reality. The movie is called enemy at the gates suggesting the enormous epic battle of Stalingrad, but this is not to be. It would have been better to name it the duel, as that is the real focus of the movie. By showing the battle in the very beginning, the movie is trying to have it both ways, but it can't. By the middle you might forget that there are millions of people involved on both sides, tanks on the ground, planes in the air, boats in the river. Instead you might think the red army did not have a single tank or plane after watching this movie.Going into the battle Annaud aims for a sense of dread, but misunderstands the motivations of the characters. Among the main things is that Russian soldiers actually WANTED to go to the front lines. Something Annaud apparently can't fathom. Kids would run away from home and lie about their age. Teens that finished school went off for military training. Men left their families to do their duty. Few doubted that the war would be won, it was simply a matter of when. When the troops arrive at the shore of the broken city, Annaud again misfires. The soldiers did not have a shortage of weapons. This was already the middle of the war, factories were working day and night, with even tractor factories making tanks. Nor were the men turning back. It was not an option, there was nowhere to fall back. They knew that if they didn't hold on the war could be lost. When you are fighting for the survival of your home you don't need any more motivation then that. Let's not forget that the soldiers are fighting for their own soil. What Annaud was probably thinking of was a "ShtrafBat" a battalion made of soldiers accused or cowardice or other often false accusations. These were literally used to clear minefields by marching through them! These did have NKVD machine gunners shooting anyone that turned back. This is something more gruesome then anything Annaud imagined, but this was usually not the case for regular troops. Moving on, there's absolutely nothing wrong with focusing on the sniper battle, it's extremely compelling. However Annaud would almost have you believe it had a key importance to the battle itself, which it couldn't have. It's merely a vignette, though a really fascinating one. Nor was Zaitsev alone. The newspapers would take ANY event they considered significant and spread the news all over the country. The idea that Zaitsev was used as some sort of motivation for not losing the war is therefore ludicrous.What it boils down to is that the movie might have been good had Annaud not delved into the bigger picture and became mired in things he didn't understand. The sniper battle itself is at times captivating. Had the movie narrowed the focus to the two opposing snipers themselves it might have been great. Adding on the love story and trying to comment on everything from politics to tactics bogged it down. Annaud would have done better to simply bring a handful of old Russian war movies to western screens, for they have covered this all before, and covered it better. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers present: At the start, I liked this movie very much, but it badly suffers from what from a directorial cramp. Why directors try to marry war and sex I guess I never will understand other than to sell tickets! Also, I did not like the ending; It was not historically accurate!This movie has a great start with the Nazis invading Stalingrad. The acting and special effects were good. Everything motored along flawlessly until the sex scene. WHY cant directors leave it to just a sweet subtle kiss instead of flat out getting it on! This has become SO cliche' with many war movies! The movies Patton and Saving Private Ryan were war from start to finish. Now most people regard these movies as classics, I dont recall anybody making woopie in those films. The effect it had on this movie is like throwing an anchor off a boat thats doing 100 miles an hour!  The other beef I have is historical accuracy. True is the notion that if you make a movie based on a true story, the historical element may be tweaked a bit here and there, I dont have a problem with that. But nowhere in my readings of snipers was he, Vasily Zaitsev, trapped behind a stove in a wharehouse by Maj. Konig. According to my readings the only confrontation they had was when they were at gunpoint with each other. Nevertheless this movie still portrayed this encounter, according to history, WRONG! This film took off like a rocket, yet it crashed and burned shortly thereafter. I was very gung ho about buying the DVD but after seeing it, I think not! The cast was great, effects were good but the script walked through a rose garden and came out a stinker! I give it a generous 5.0 out of 10!</fullReview>

Give Wolfgang Petersen 20 actors, and permission to film in some godforsaken industrial wasteland in present day eastern Europe with a host of cheap extras and you would get the goods, i.e something intense, realistic and tightly edited. Instead we are treated to film by commity as boring, ineptly handled and inappropiate romance is injected into this film which drags the whole thing down, featuring the worst sex scene I have seen in a long time. What should have been a tight 80-90mins ends up over the 2 hour mark. As well as this the humour is dire, characters shallow and action scenes have no real tension. If you want an example of war films at their best check out "Beast of war", "Das boot" &amp; "Stalingrad".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot, essential in a movie of this nature, lacks enough credibility that the whole mess resembles only a beefed-up version of "Combat". It is simply another CGI-enhanced war flick trying to cash in on the success of Saving Private Ryan, end of debate.The cinematography is horrendous and the music is even worse. Due to modern technology, not only are today's directors able to recreate such garish details as severed limbs and WW2 vintage bombers, but they also can eliminate any shred of intelligence in the script and hire a terrible cast. Vassili's rise to fame resembles Jerry Maguire more than Platoon. Even Bob Hoskins, the most talented of the cast, is wasted in his role as Nikita Khruschev.The first half-hour alone has no redeeming quality that makes this movie stand out as anything significant. The remaining 90 minutes only emphasizes that point. If the Soviets had as many morons in their military as this movie would suggest, it's a miracle that they survived World War II.Overall, skip this movie altogether. There is nothing else I can say. There are better quality works out there. 1 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In World War II during the winter of 1942, the German and Russian Armies meet in the great Battle of the Stalingrad. The fall of Stalingrad will mean the collapse of the whole of Russia. The Germans and Russians are fighting over every block, leaving only ruins behind. The Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) - a peasant young man with an extraordinary sharpshooting ability - stalks the Germans. He takes out one German officer after another and in doing so hurts the morale of the German troops. The political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) encourages him, publishing his efforts to give his poor countrymen some hope. But Vassili start to feel that he can not live up to these great expectations. He and Danilov fall in love with the same female soldier, Tanya (Rachel Weisz). Eventualy the Germans bring in their own snipper: the war veteran Major Konig (Ed Harris) who comes to accomplishes his mission no matter what the cost. With the Battle of Stalingrad raging around them, these two men must now fight each other to the death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I definitely recommend Enemy at the Gates. It is an epic (my favorite type of movie) with the Battle of Stalingrad as the backdrop. Its focus is on the battle between two snipers, the Russian played by Jude Law and the German played by Ed Harris. Two supporting characters are a Soviet political officer played by Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz as the love interest. Bob Hoskins is also very good as Nikita Khrushchev. Although it is shown mostly from the Russian perspective, it shows the flaws and cruelty of both the Soviets and Nazis. As a person who is a history buff, I appreciate the large-scale portrayal on the big screen of a historical event that did not involve Americans.Regarding the controversy over the accents used, I personally agree with the decision to not have the actors use Russian and German accents. The most authentic way to present this event is to have the movie done in Russian and German. If you think about it, having these historical dramas done in the English language is not completely "realistic". Obviously, they are done so to make them accessible to the American audience (and the increasingly English speaking international community) and hence more profitable. If there are no English speaking characters in the event being shown, forcing actors to speak English with accents does not make it more real.Back to the movie, kudos to the producers for making a tense, gripping, war drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had everything you could possibly want in a film and has a little bit from every film genre. It has violence, drama, suspense, romance, and is based on a true story. It takes place in Stalingrad, U.S.S.R. during World War II, and Jude Law plays a Russian sniper who has killed so many German officers during the siege of the city that he is making the front pages of Russian newspapers and is boosting the morale among many Russians. Law eventually finds out about a German sniper (Ed Harris) who is even better than him and feels that he doesnt stand a chance against Harris. After being the "hunter" for so long, Law is like a mouse and Harris is a cat, and Law finds himself pinned down to a point where he is near helpless. He has help from Joseph Fiennes, who is a fellow Russian soldier and a good sniper as well, but Fiennes deserts Law by committing suicide and putting himself in the way of a bullet fired from Harris's rifle, making Law face Harris all alone. This movie is truly great, it has great scenery comparable to that of Saving Private Ryan, and the action scenes are incredible and realistic. But the greatest parts are of course the views through the crosshairs of the two rivals' sniper rifles, where you feel like you are a sniper inside the film. This is a great movie, no question about it. Feel free to email me if you have any questions or comments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unsatisfactory war film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****Based on surface look alone, Enemy at the Gates is an impressive production with excellent visuals and a high-caliber cast and crew. Unfortunately, despite the hefty pricetag and technical merit, the film is mostly a mediocre accomplishment, and really, almost all the main cast and crew are at fault.Gates does begin in a very promising fashion. After the flashback pre-credits opening scene, we're thrust into the mayhem of the battle of Stalingrad, and in this seven-minute setpiece, director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures the chaos, the terror, and the outright horror of the fighting, stumbling only when he decides to let James Horner's score drown out every other sound (why is it directors these days feel the need to employ this method?) (worse yet, Horner's score in this scene sounds far too similar to John Williams' work in Schindler's List). From there, the film narrows its focus to two central characters, the sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and his opponent, Major Konig (Ed Harris). The rest of the film is a game of cat-and-mouse, as well as a tacked on love story that occasionally plays in between the sniper sequences. As far as war films go, Enemy at the Gates fails to deliver. Once again, another film that seems to promise to show the graphic horrors and epic scale of the battle of Stalingrad merely uses it as a backdrop (the other film would be Stalingrad). True, the sniper hunts are fairly riveting in a visceral manner, but never truly engaging because you don't feel for the protagonist. This is mostly the script's fault, which doesn't give Jude Law the opportunity to develop into a full-fledged, three-dimensional character. All we really learn about this guy is his lack of self-confidence, and even though he might be scared, the suspense is confined to a minimum because the outcome of the situation is never in doubt.Ed Harris, unsurprisingly, fares much better as the villain of the picture. Actually, despite playing the obvious bad guy, he creates a rather complex character who isn't as unfeeling and inhumane as he may initially seem. Unfortunately, director Annaud must have been afraid we would have sympathized with him too much so he turns him into a typical monster by the end, definitely the worst move the film makes.The love story honestly isn't of much interest. Law and Rachel Weisz have zero romantic chemistry and every scene that focuses on these two is a complete bore. Joseph Fiennes is on hand to be the third wheel of this supposed love triangle, but nobody else in the film seems to want him around, so why bother? Gates is marred by all sorts of little problems. The editing and pacing is off; for instance, one scene features a Russian sniper briefly leaving his post, then the next, he's suddenly in German hands. We never see him get caught, we're just told so. The sudden move from one place to another occurs often among the characters; it's rather jarring and not necessarily believable considering the snipers that are lying in wait to pick off trespassers.The film never works as an anti-war stance, in spite of the grim tone and the bloody violence, it fails as a romance, and as a game of cat-and-mouse, you never feel the stakes to be as high as they should and you find yourself rooting for the villain because he feels more human and believable (for the majority of the running time, at least) than our so-called hero. For all the elements I listed above, you can find more effective films that employ them with more precision and entertainment value. Enemy at the Gates is really just a forgettable war film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you, I varey rarely enjoy and get into war-time movies - but this movie is incredible!!! The storyline is riveting and takes you for a ride. The cinematography is truly amazing - from the huge, crumbling buildings, to the dozens of dead soldiers with twisted faces, to the gray and hazy skies - you get pulled in. Jude Law does his job well, but he doesn't have very much stage presence or conviction. Ed Harris steals the movie, IMO, as Konig, a deadly German sniper sent to kill Jude. His famous intensity and role morphing is here. Strong support from Rachel Weisz and Joseph Fiennes. Great acting, great story, amazing elements. This movie is worthy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This is not a good movie, which is so unfortunate, because the first few scenes were so promising. In the first 20 minutes they showed us how the russian soldiers were shoved into the train to Stalingrad just like cattle being herded into a slaughterhouse. The battle scenes in Stalingrad were so real. But then it went downhill, this movie is just filled with flaws.*SPOILERS*. The first one was when Vassili shot the fat german captain who was taking a shower. After the german captain fell down, the other 2 germans just stood around lighting their cigarettes just like sitting ducks. I've seen a lot of war movies and read war stories, if this were a real story, those 2 germans would've thrown themselves to the ground with lightning speed. Then there was the accent problem. How can you be convinced that you are in Stalingrad when the russians speak english with british accents. They should've at least tried to speak with Russian accents. That is why I really appreciate movies such as Das Boot and Stalingrad, where the germans speak germans and the russians speak russians (in Stalingrad). The sex scene was so fake and unnecessary. And of course they had to ruin the ending by bringing the heroine back to life. *end of SPOILERS*My advice..save your time and money, don't rent or buy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, but nothing to do with history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the gates. Good movie. I liked it. Sad, but true - never could be even close to "Iron cross"(Cross of iron). Actually the film is very well made, but there are some mistakes. First of all when WWII starts Vasilij Zaicev is a sergeant in the Red army and not just a private. He was not a nature talent. He was first in a sniper school. Actually he is known as one of the best snipers in the world's history with an impressive list of 242 (two hundre fourty two) shot german officers. Wow. Of course his duel with the german sniper is a fiction. So is his love with Tania. It's just a story. How ends Vasilii's sniper career? Few months before the end of the war he gets shot in the head. The wound is very bad. Once the doctors save him, they find out, that there is a danger for him losing his left eye - the bullet almost had cut off the nerves. He gets lucky - he survives the wound, and even his eye recovers. Not like before, regretfully. His sniper days are over and he receivs a place in a sniper school, training young soldiers how to be killing mashines, like he was before. This i's V. Zaicev' story, his real story I mean and since you have probably seen the film, you already know that it's just Hollywood crap, especially the ending - (there is no any dry eye in the cinema). Despite that, the movie was good. The war scenes - briliant. An officer shooting the soldiers tring to scape by jumping in the ice-cold Moscau river. The polit-officers shooting the soldiers trying to retreat. The german aviation on a raid over the river or the city. Stalingrad was a city of industry without any fortifications. Sometimes the distance between german and soviet troops was less then 20 meters (about 7 feet). There were no any war manoevers in the movie and Stalingrad is actually the point break for the germans. That's where they actually start losing the war. No one really thought that the winter invasion would bo so prolonged. Anyway the movie is not about the siege, it's about the two snipers. The acting - Feins, Law, Harris - briliant as usual. Hm, by the way - major Kionig says to a german soldier about a POW: "I hope he is still able to talk!"- nice, compassion to the courageous enemy. He suffers also his son, died in battle. But in the end he doesn't have any remorse when he decides to hang a little kid, when the information he got from the same kid served him very well. Strange, right? Anyway. Briliant camera work, great acting, good story (although nothing to do with reality and history) - so enjoy it:)) I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful war drama, but not always believable, and with horrible music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have rather mixed feelings about this film. First the good - the central performances range from solid to excellent, and the evocation of the terrible reality of the wartime situation is powerfully and compellingly done. So, for these reasons, I'd probably recommend the movie to most people. Also it has an effective narrative drive, and the story and characters keep the viewer engaged to the end. But... there are some major problems. For me, the most significant was the score - the music is truly terrible, and does a great deal to ruin the film. If there were an option to simply turn off all the music this would improve the film immeasurably. The constant, intrusive, overbearing, syrupy, pseudo-symphonic accompaniment is utterly at odds with the visual and dramatic content. It's hard to comprehend how a director who could make so many good decisions could make such an awful one - perhaps he simply has a tin ear. There are other problems also... one's suspension of disbelief is frequently challenged. The script seems to have got carried away by a desire to tell a heroic story, and yet it consistently contains within it enough reality to persistently remind the viewer of the unlikeliness of that story. It's like a propagandist who wavers between believing his own output and dealing with the truth around him. And perhaps that post-modern wavering is intended (but I rather doubt it... on the evidence of the film itself, and on the evidence of the accompanying DVD material, which gives no hint of such deliberate sophistication). There are also more mundane problems - the technical portrayal of the performance of snipers is ludicrous (they can hit pinpoint targets, sometimes moving, hundreds of yards away, 100% of the time, sometimes whilst scanning a wide area with only a split-second revelation of the actual target). And the "Hollywood ending" is clearly totally out of place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Brehznev, you are reading the Olympic Rings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie all in all is good, but too claustrophobic. They must have blown the entire budget on the opening scenes which are quite amazing, but then the remainder is all backlot, soundstage monotony. It got real old for me. The story, interesting though it was, didn't need to be this long in the telling. Performances are good; Hoskins is great as Khrushchev, and Jude Law excellent as the silent hero. Rachel Weisz, Hey Now! Ed Harris, he's not so good. Gives an uncharacteristically doped performance. He was probably paid by the word. The one thing I do commend is the treatment of the Soviets as protagonist. Just who was a bigger maniac Stalin or Hitler, isn't a question worth contemplating. The film was more than fair in its treatment of the average Red Army soldier. Showing the brutality of the Stalin regime towards its own citizens, especially its military personnel, as the average Vlad lived the Orwellian nightmare firsthand. Stalin sent 2 million of his men to their deaths, yes 2 million, to ensure the city that bore his name did not fall to the Nazis. Huge price, but probably as much as anything, the battle of Stalingrad ended Hitler's aspirations, and made Eastern Europe safe for the subsequent Soviet Cold War occupation. Lousy Commies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What enemy?! What gates?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the book "Enemy at the Gates" I was expecting a detailed account of the German siege of Stalingrad during WWII. The book provides a detailed account of the successful Soviet strategic manouvers and the logistical nightmares faced by the surrounded Germans trying to supply an army from the air. The successful Soviet stand against Paulus' attacking 6th Army proved to be a turning point in the war resulting in the death or capture of hundreds of thousands of soldiers from both sides. It is a dramatic account of actual events. No need to preface with "Based on a true story," the real events are dramatic enough for anyone. It is the material that most filmmakers drool over. With all this in mind I bought my ticket and sat down, waiting to be engulfed in one of the greatest and most over-looked events of WWII. An action-packed, bloody, war movie. Made by guys for guys. What I sat through instead was three hours of contrived romance sprinkled with painfully predictable macho military cliches. This film is just another in a growing list that are misrepresenting in their trailers. They are marketed to men but made for women. Like Gladiator--another could-have-been-great movie--this film is half romance (for the women) and half action (for men). Instead of being a film that appeals to both men and women, what results is a film that appeals to neither men nor women. So, instead of a great epic war film, "Enemy at the Gates" is a narrative that forces a love triangle into a war story like a square peg into a round hole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a lot of explosive action look else where. If you are looking for a great historical story this is great. The point of this movie is to show how basic a war can be on a personal level. Any war veteran can tell you how slow and drawn out personal conflicts can be. This is just the sort of movie that points that fact out. If you were looking for a "Rambo" type movie you will be very disappointed. I was not disappointed.

		<fullReview>One of the better more underrated war movies of our time. This one was better than alot of movies made. It was robbed of the number one spot by Exit Wounds which i thought was a very lousy movie. I like Jude Law. He is an awesome actor. He has a lot of potential to be great one day. Rachel Weisz is beautiful in this movie. I totally fell in love with her in this movie. Bob Hoskins plays a general. He does great! You cant even tell its really him underneath his big beard. Ed Harris plays the most outstanding role as a cold hearted, patient yet sadistic sniper. I have never seen anyone get the sniper role down like he does. The smirk and craftiness he carries shows a slight arrogance. His focus is great and his skills with the rifle are unhuman. I believe never to see anyone convince me the way Harris did as a sniper. If youre into the whole sniper bit i recommend this movie to you. The war sequence isnt bad either but it mainly focuses on the two snipers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>praise long overdue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is good to see a motion picture depicting the tremendous fortitude and sacrifice of the Russian people. I think the Eastern Front should be explored more in history and the arts. In some ways the fighting on the Eastern Front was strangely similar to the utter bloodbath scenarios of WWI. Most Germans knew an assignment there was a death sentence with the odd reprieve for the lucky few. Although the world will never know how many Russian Jews were executed by the Germans and how many Russians really died in battle, we do know this-the Russian people took the German army to Hell and back. This film is certainly not an epic portrayal of the Russian military. It is a focused study of a small group of characters in battle. And the love scene? FANTASTIC! Yes, this film could have been more "realistic" and grotesque. Do we need that? Not really. This film is praise long overdue for the contribution made by the Russian people in the struggle against Nazi Germany. I saw a documentary about the Eastern Front in which Russians talked about fighting with shovels and rocks while their opponents had rifles. I think that kind of unsophisticated grit demoralized the Germans and on some level simply freaked them out! This film is a tribute to that spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this won't be my favorite movie. I wasn't stunned by it; it didn't make me think too hard (aside from asking my military historian husband for some background about the battle involved). But it's a pretty good film. The sniper scenes are tense without feeling dragged-out. There were some elements that kept me guessing throughout the movie, and I have to confess that some of my cocky assumptions (regarding who would die, mostly) were completely wrong. There were a few less-than-believable moments (how exactly DID those three or four pieces of glass all manage to line up exactly so that Konig could see Vassili's reflection in all of them?) but nothing to ruin the movie.Overall, this is a good one to watch if you like war movies. It has no doubt irritated thousands of pacifists who dislike the glorification of the skills it depicts, so don't watch it if you're inclined to gripe about movies that have too much violence or make war look too heroic. Otherwise, give it a try; I doubt you'll be disappointed.Note: I checked to confirm my suspicion that the music was done by James Horner. If you listen carefully you'll hear a few of his themes from previous movies re-done for this score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest love scene I've seen so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Not the greatest movie, but... For the first time, I saw 'The Enemy...' at the cinema; it was dark (as cinemas used to be...), cosy, and quiet. I did not bite my nails all the time, yet there were some moments in which I was quite uneasy. Uneasy and uncertain of what will happen next, surprisingly finding myself entangled in the characters' lives. And there was that love scene...First things first, however, let's face the facts. The main reason for me seeing the movie was Jude Law. I may be mistaken, but he did not look better in any other movie I have seen. The scenes in which his eyes play the main part - makes me shiver. And I like the feeling.Apart from being a handsome man, Law is a suberb actor. He has the ability to take most of the character, however one-sided the role may be. Joseph Finnes boldly tries to keep his pace; Ed Harris does so with grace and Rachel Weisz accompanies the men as the leading lady with style. After seeing her in both Mumies, I had doubts... The Enemy made me go 'hmmmm... Good.'As far as the history is concerned... The American point of view of Russians is... Well... For many people out there, Poland equals Russia. It does not, these are two seperate worlds, but I guess we here, in cold climates, undrestand each other better. The primitive, drinking, bestial men shown in the movie... It was that way; it used to be like that. But throwing all Russians to one bag and all Germans to the other? I know it's easier this way. Yet 'easier' does not necessarly mean 'better'.And now for the previously mentioned love scene... Those of You who has seen it, know what I mean; those of You who still hestitate wheather to see the movie - do it, for the sake of this scene. Imagine a love scene among a crowd of sleeping, tired, dirty people, a love scene without a word spoken, without sweet music in the background, without tearing off the clothes and rolling on the floor... (Yes, yes, I know. I'm exaggerating now.)Or better don't imagine. Just go and see it.Really worth while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Stalingrad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The photography reveals a Stalingrad that hardly anyone would want either to conquer or defend. Ominous, gloomy, wrecked, under gray snow-laden clouds, like the city in Kubrik's Full Metal Jacket. Everything is, or looks, gray in one or another tone. In the chemical factory, even a pile of sulfur, than which nothing is yellower, turns into a bright but sickly chlorine green. No wonder Brighton Beach and Elizabeth, New Jersey, are now filled up with Russians; they left home because of the weather.The sounds come down to us from Saving Private Ryan. I don't think war movies will ever be the same. The German MG42s sputter and the bullets clunk and spatter. As in SPR or Band of Brothers the bullets hit iron with serial clanks. It's imitative but there have been improvements too. We can be grateful that we no longer have to listen to every other shot resulting in one of those long wobbling ricochets, PtewEWewEW.... as the bullet whines into the infinite vastness of space. The sound departments used to be so fond of that particular noise that I've heard it when bullets glance off, not only hard surfaces like rocks, but wooden planks, sod, everything but flesh. The musical score is appropriate to the setting, with occasional echoes of Prokoviev. The acting is adequate. The most interesting character -- and they are all kind of interesting -- is not Zaitsev, the nominal hero, but the Commisar, spurned by his beloved who has fallen for the pop idol sniper, and who turns spiteful and destructive before sacrificing himself. The direction too is adequate. Tania has a scene in which she relates the sad story of how her parents were bundled out of town with other prisoners and then executed by the Nazis. As she goes through this monologue, a plaintive sad tune wanders into the sound track (a hint to the audience that this is a sad story). Meanwhile the camera very slowly dollies up from a medium shot to a close up (an even broader hint to the audience that this story is not only sad but important). In a later scene, Zaitsev is told that his lover has been killed and the camera moves in to a close up of a gigantic eyeball in which a tear seems to be forming. I kept wondering how Ozu would have handled this in something like "Tokyo Story", which was full of sad tales. His camera wouldn't have moved an inch. And I think I believed it the first time a reflection momentarily blinded the sniper in "The African Queen" but I sure can't swallow this instance, which takes place in a darkened factory. I wish more directors had enough faith in their audiences' ability to recognize tragedy when they see it. You know, when you think about it, there were very few movies made about the conflict between the USSR and Nazi Germany until fairly recently. The post-war political environment in the USA wasn't such as to encourage heroic portraits of the Commies, and yet we couldn't go with the Nazis either for obvious reasons. Nobody making American movies would have known which side they wanted the audience to root for. This one is pretty even handed as far as that goes. It's mostly seen from the Russian's point of view, and, with the exception of Ed Harris's character, they are the only ones we get to know. (There is a very nice scene of Zsaitsev and Tania making furtive frightened love amid a horde of snoring bodies in a shelter; we briefly see her ivory, smooth, generous butt and it's not at all erotic.) Harris is cool, professional, has lost a son on the Eastern front, and is prepared to die. And, man, does Harris have the body language of the European aristocrat down pat. He sits with crossed legs and polished boots, serenely puffing a cigarette, his face placid. But he definitely revolts the audience when he takes a young boy whom he has gotten to like out into the ruins and hangs him as bait. Zaitsev is positively embarrassed by his notoriety in the media. Khrushchev is bullying and brutal, and the Commisar mouths socialist clichés. (We had to give them a kick in the pants somehow, I guess.) As for the sniping, it's the best part of the picture. I mean, it's hard to make movies about people whose main job is to lie there without moving for long periods. But these guys are sharp. They never miss. Every kill is a head shot. And they can cut a telephone line at 155 meters with one bullet. If they were any better they'd be superhuman. And, again, the audio is not embellished during the few shots we see. POP, and that's it. No clichés. It's a rather nicely done movie, kind of an easy one to get into, and, tense if not gripping, it carries a viewer along.War is a funny thing though. I can't think of another business in which you become a hero by killing more human beings than anybody else. The film avoids the whole issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie about the war with great performances from Rachel Weisz &amp; Jude Law.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is a movie about World War II. Most movies about this part in the history are full of violence and murders. And in this film it isn't different. But it is always fine to see how each director sees it. The best war movie so far is "Saving Private Ryan". This movie is quite interesting because you have a great cast again;1.Jude Law: Vasseli (lead actor) 2.Joseph Fiennes 3.Rachel Weisz 4.Ed HarrisThis movie is About the fight around "Stalingrad" in Russia. Vasseli is a Russian too but he is well known because he is so good at shooting. The Germans send Major Köning (Ed Harris) to Russia, with the intention to kill Vasseli. A commander (Joseph Fiennes) and his good girlfriend (Rachel Weisz) support Vasseli. For me every movie has something special also in this movie there are some interesting things to see:-How children play an important part in the war and how they become victims. This movie has given a wonderful part to a child, Sacha. He did it amazingly .-You could say that the movie has a slogan: "Love don't declear war".-There is also place for a twist about the love of someone.-You see how crazy war is. The performances were really strong especially those from Rachel Weisz and Jude Law. They were perfect.Joseph Fiennes was good too, but I like the acting of his brother (Ralph Fiennes) more.Ed Harris is great too. Also the supporting parts were wonderful. I can't see a lot of bad things in this movie, maybe that the love in the war was idealised and the end was too romantic... but life has to go on...Rating: 8/10  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have not much to snipe about (groan) in this enjoyable WWII flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on truth (I wonder how much) this tall recounts the story of a Russian sniper, Zaitsev (Jude Law) defending Stalingrad against the German incursion. His exploits are promoted by his good friend Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), making him a hero for all people. But now he faces his greatest challenge against the superb German sniper Konig (Ed Harris). Can he outwit him? Ta-dum!One of the complaints levelled at this movie was the casting of Jude Law. Jude Law has very aristocratic features - high chiselled features and so on. Here we were meant to believe he was a simple peasant. Well he actually does this fairly well through a judicious use of grime and ragged garments. Ed Harris is always decent playing quiet, stoic characters - which is exactly what's required here. Fiennes does. enough here. His character isn't up to much, beyond trying to be jealous that Law's character gets the boring romantic interest that he cannot (played in an unmemorable fashion by Rachel Weisz).Script? Pah. There's no real one liners. The characters are generally thinly drawn and one line throwaways (we learn nothing about Konig for example, beyond the hardened killer patriot role). There's a certain predictability in that, seeing as it's based on real events, you know some characters will not make it unto the end and one, in particular, surprise moment (although not a twist - the movie has no need of those). Only Law's character generates any real sympathy with the audience, but that's okay because..The directing and cinematography here are very good and that's essential in a war movie. There isn't the grittiness of say `Saving Private Ryan' or the beautiful photography of `The Thin Red Line' (or some of the Vietnam movies). However it doesn't have the blandness that was `We Were Soldiers'. The initial battle scenes are quite striking - bombs, and so forth. No, they're not original but they do have enough scope and epic visceral qualities that I was sufficiently dragged into the old `horror of war' cliché. The later sniping scenes are also done very well. By the nature of the stillness of the sniper - shown from the very opening - we have a claustrophobic tense scene. A bullet can come out of nowhere, a single signature of death. This is quite different from the usual hail of lead we get in movies and definitely adds to the atmosphere. One of the latter scenes, where Law and Harris battle it out, has extra value because every move is a calculation a game, and not just a random race against hope. This dance between the two foes is well handled and never feels too protracted, interspersed as it is with events and sense of momentum. It's what adds to the movie being able to distinguish itself from the plethora of other war movies, and that's important.I did have one problem with the movie - a very pointless romantic subplot. Perhaps the producers felt it needed one to balance out the `boys own' feel. They did by introducing an underdeveloped love triangle that feels tacked on, and only necessary to try and force some movement between Law and Fiennes' characters. Boring. Even worse than being boring it detracts from the otherwise enjoyable story of Law as a sniper and reluctant hero. Oh I guess they must appeal their demographics then.`Enemy at the Gates' doesn't have the power of some of the great movies but it does have a nice streak of individuality, via the concept of focusing on the sniper. There's enough good work done in the technical aspects to make up for the weak characters and script and it's a good one to view on a decent screen and sound system. Not a must but certainly catch it if it's on. 7.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Saving Private Ryan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>but it is still a fairly good film. The war scenes, especially the beginning, were well done and even scary. The Russian soldiers were forced to run to their death. It was basically suicide. The acting was good, but I had a problem with Jude Law because he just looked to hot to be some starving soldier living in filth. Even with dirt on his face, he still looked like he stepped off a GQ cover. Ed Harris was my favorite character in this. I liked how his character was always calm and cool although he did something stupid at the end.I had a problem with the newspaper and signs being written in Russian. They speak English throughout the film. And Joseph Fiennes' character dictates his stories in English and spells in English, so why on earth was the newspaper shown written in Russian. Also, you have to overlook the fact that the main characters have a British accent.I also felt the love story thrown in weakened the main plot of the film. This movie was about 2 snipers in a cat and mouse game. That is one reason SPR was better because it didn't have some sappy love story in the middle of the film.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better war movies, but it does have some flaws. Worth a viewing if you are into war movies or Jude Law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sniper duel stumbles at the gate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. The cast and director are accomplished, and the World War II setting is a powerful backdrop to explore poignant themes and flex some technical muscle. After a schlocky flashback showing Vassili (Law) learning to use a rifle under his grandfather's tutelage, we learn of Fascism's spreading blight over Europe in a fantastic newsreel-style animation, then are thrown into a horrific battle sequence. Red Army troops are sent headlong onto the frontline of the German siege of Stalingrad. The Soviet troops are dispatched by Nazi infantry, artillery, and air strikes. Those trying to flee the onslaught are sickeningly mowed down by their own officers. The city lies in ruin, and in these early sequences Annaud captures the sweeping scale of the siege impressively.Then the movie stumbles. Vassili meets Danilov (Fiennes), and the duo gain renown and become a touchstone of hope for the Soviets: the former for his heroic sniping skill, the latter for his bleating about it. Enter the girl, Tanja (Wiesz); both men immediately begin vying for her once they meet in a palatial 'hovel' maintained by Filipov. The ensuing love triangle continually distracts us from the heart of the movie: a sniper duel between a Ural peasant and a German aristocrat, Koenig. The duel is a metaphor for the war raging between Stalin and Hitler, and also one of class struggle. I had not appreciated the startling skills of snipers until I saw Barry Pepper's portrayal in Saving Private Ryan. Enemy at the Gates does well to display their extraordinary abilities too. However, their duel is played out over months against the backdrop of an implausible romance, inconspicuous siege, and imperceptible winter.In the end, the technical merit of the production was spotty, with flashes of brilliance as vivid as the sprays of blood it depicts. I must credit Harris' Koenig for being immediately despicable (it only takes seconds for you to hate him), and Hoskins' ruthless and engaging Khrushchev. Law, who had just played Dickie Greenleaf in The Talented Mr Ripley prior to this film, demonstrates unexpected range and intensity in this role.6 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent movie with so much more potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is an intriguing film, as much for its conceptas for the product that has been turned out. It's a look at World WarII that tries to be purely Russian, looking at the European conflictwithout any participation by or even any mention of Americaninvolvement. However, I don't think the film went as far with this uniqueperspective as it could have. It tries to represent the Russian pointof view, but its view of Russian culture is so blatantly non-Russianthat it fails to be truly convincing. The story of the Russianresistance is unique to World War II, and the reasons for it arecomplex. The reasons for the communist struggle, the desire for atruly classless society, the magnitude of change that had to beimplemented for Stalin's government to exist at all could havebeen effectively portrayed by a couple conversations between JudeLaw's shepherd boy-turned sniper and Joseph Fienne's intellectual propaganda minister. Their friendship is an unlikelyone created by war, and a couple of conversations on the insanitythey're involved in could have been really illuminating andcontributed to the atmosphere of the film. I'm not asking for atreatise on Marxism, but most non-Russian audiences are aboutas ignorant of the workings of WWII-era Russian society as JudeLaw's character probably was. A little bit of politicalchitchat/argument would've been interesting.A lot of people have argued against the integration of the romanticsubplot into the story. Again, I feel it's something that could havebeen more effective if it had been depicted more completely. TheRussian army was the only one (as far as I know) to routinely havefemale soldiers working alongside men within the ranks. Thisagain was reflective of the Communist government's posturings ofequality, and could have been addressed. An environment wherewomen worked, fought, and were killed on equal terms with menwould have had a strong effect on male/female relationships, andwould have been fascinating to explore a little more deeply. Thefact that Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Wiecz's characters were bothJewish, while Jude Law's was not, could also have added anextra, interesting dimension to the love triangle portrayed, but thiselement is ignored. Law is better looking, more simplistic in hisapproach to the war, and is easier to understand. ThereforeWiecz's character falls for him. He's the guy most of the femaleaudience will root for anyway, he's the hero, so it's kinda ano-brainer that he'll get the girl, at least for a while. But the journeytowards this event could've been a lot more interesting.On the whole it's the performances that end up making this moviework for me. Jude Law is a phenomenal, incredibly natural actor,and the rest of the cast backs him up quite well. I can sit back andenjoy the movie for what it is, decent escapist warfare drama, but Ican't help but be constantly aware of how much better it could havebeen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confessions from a Jude Law fan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have a confession to make: I don´t watch war movies. I am just your average movie-loving 18 year-old female who only rented this film because Jude Law was in it. I did not watch Saving Private Ryan mainly because I don´t like war movies, and it looked overly violent for my taste. I have no doubts that it´s one of the best war movies ever made and that this one doesn´t even come close, blah, blah, blah (as the 200 or so comments before me so clearly state), so if you choose not to take this humble review into account because I am just a young girl who was probably too busy drooling all over the main actor to pay attention to the plot, then it´s your choice. But personally, I like to think that both my distaste for war movies and my love for Jude Law are a good thing when it comes to this movie, as it helped me watch it without being constantly comparing it to other similar films (and in the case of Jude Law, well, it helped me watch it in the first place, and for that I am grateful!).The thing I loved the most was the "feel" of the movie. Some say the pacing was slow; I say it wasn´t. Come on, spending hours and hours paying cat and mouse with your enemy can´t be like a day at the circus, and I like the fact that it was more than just pointless action - which is what Hollywood loves doing. - The cinematography was GREAT, as was the direction... I am not familiar with the director of this movie, but something tells me I should be. It´s actually refreshing after so many dreadful Hollywood movies to find a director who actually understands that there is more to the task that just following the actors around. The images are incredibly powerful - and not just because of the cinematography and the work of the director, but also because of the acting.I knew Law, Fiennes and Harris could act. And yes, I even knew Weisz could act as well (her small role in Sunshine opossite the older Fiennes, Ralph, was certainly memorable). So I can´t claim that the actors were a surprise. I had no problems at all with the lack of accents... as another reviewer said, if they wanted realism, they wouldn´t have Russian characters speaking in English, accented or not. My only problem with the casting was that Jude Law was simply too handsome for the role. I doubt men could look that good in the middle of a war! (same must be said for Weisz sadly... Yes, she was hardly glamorous in this film, but still I refuse to believe that female soldiers looked like that)Law and Harris´ game of cat and mouse dominates the film... the suspense is very well done, and it´s indeed amazing how some of the movie´s most memorable scenes are achieved without a single line of dialogue. Harris´ role is not that of your typical Nazi... it´s quite refreshing to see that he is actually human, and not just a two dimensional villain (see standard Hollywood filmmaking).Fiennes´role as Vassili´s friend, the intellectual Danilov - who certainly knew how to play dirty for an idealist if you ask me - was not as important as Law´s, but it was certainly equally (or even more) interesting. Sadly,the main weakness of the script lies in that his motivations are never quite clear. If Danilov works, it´s because of Joseph Fiennes - who already showed audiences he was an excelent actor in his memorable Lord Robert from Elizabeth and the title character from Shakespeare in Love -. Fiennes role goes from best friend to traitor to hero... and sadly the transition does not run smoothly. The ending just screams "plot hole!" and it´s not quite satisfing, although Law and Fiennes acting is flawless in their last scene together.So all in all? No, it´s not perfect, and no, it´s not the best movie ever, but does that mean it´s bad? Hell, no! On the contrary, it´s a very good movie, beautifully filmed, very well acted and a breath of fresh air if you ask me. And if anybody says "oh, Pearl Harbor was better" I´ll have to shot myself (or shot them, I have yet to decide it).Oh yes, and if you were wondering: yes, I still think Jude Law is hot (although Joseph Fiennes is not half bad himself!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>German invasion of Russia in 1942/43, snipers and lovers via for screen time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS - "Enemy At The Gates" is a good movie, I rate it "8" of 10. Like "Titanic" and "Pearl Harbor", it is a historically significant time and place, with a couple of very interesting human stories for the movie. Jude Law is a farm boy who is naturally talented with a rifle. In an early invasion scene, he quickly picks off 7 German officers, each bullet through the head. In fact, every sniper in this film shot every victim through the head. They used "head seeking" bullets. He gets so good, and is demoralizing the Germans who have to quickly promote more officers each day, they send their best sniper, played by Ed Harris, specifically to get Law. Meanwhile, Law and the Rachel Weitz character develop an attraction which develops into a love affair. Sex among the other soldiers at night. Well done, I might add, almost had me in a sweat too. Each day, Law and Harris try to figure where the other will be to get the jump. They both use a boy as an informant, but his loyalty is with the Russians. He pays for it.Weitz gets wounded with schrapnel, is taken to a hospital for possible recovery. Law and Harris face down a final time, Harris gets his bullet through the head in the middle of a rail yard, in broad daylight, after he had been so stealthy for so long. That part didn't seem consistent. I would have preferred both of them in hiding, scanning through their respective scopes, suddenly each sees the other for a split second, then Harris getting shot through his own scope, like we saw in Saving Private Ryan.And lastly, Law finds Weitz in the hospital, she will be ok, and we know Germany did not capture Stalingrad. The DVD was very good, both in picture and the Dolby 5.1 sound track. There are some extras but I did not watch any of them. Good movie, interesting historical perspective, good acting by all, a little slow in some middle spots, but better than the average movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I partially saw this movie on DVD. The first 10 minutes seemed to be an attempt to overthrow Spielberg's 'Saving private Ryan''s impressive start. English and American actors trying to play Russian officers and sniper's what a laugh; they don't evven speak russian. The movie could actually have been good, if they hired russian actors that actually speak Russian, to do the job.After 50 minutes I pushed the stop button, since the whole movie is a total farce and gives you a cheap TV serie feel. Even Jude Law couldn't bring me to see the ending.The battle ove Stalin(Lenin-) Grad needs a Russian remake. I am sure they know how portray this 2nd WW historical event, but this attempt was and still is a joke.Tip: try to get 'ballad of a soldier' (1958?) by Grigori Chukhraj. One of the best 'war-movies' made in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is a very interesting film about World War 2 from a Russians point of view where your only choice is whether you want to be shot by german bullets or russian bullets. It's an interesting perspective where Law and Fiennes come to realize the faults of their world and how the way out is far and blurry. Fiennes and Law give equally strong performances and work well together on screen creating a friendship that is soon to be doomed. While Ed Harris could be stereotyped as this films conventional bad guy, the true villain exists in the forces that put them in that situation to begin with. And while the film tries to end on a positive note we are aware that suffering for the Russians would definetly last through years far beyond that of WWII.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ENEMY AT THE GATES kept me interested, don't get me wrong. But there is one thing about movies, especially war movies, especially war movies based on a true event, that just gets to me, and it starts drilling into my brain, making me shift uncomfortably in my seat as I watch. The lack of realism. This movie contains plenty of that.The opening sequence... magnificent. I was expecting a brilliant movie to follow. And what's sad is that it could have been. The story that "Enemy at the Gates" is based on is intriguing, a great aspect of a war that recently has only been told about from the American point of view. Vassili (Jude Law) grew up hunting, thus explaining his remarkable ability to handle a sniper rifle in the war. He becomes a valuable weapon to the Red Army, which has been suffering from overwhelming defeats and from low morale. Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a soldier who is also in charge of a Russian newspaper, begins spreading the word of Vassili's talent throughout the army, making him a superhero to the depressed soldiers. Major Konig (Ed Harris) of the German Army, also an accomplished sniper, is sent to eliminate Vasilli.The sniper scenes between the two are very well-done, but my question is, where are the rest of the people? I have a very hard time believing that Vassili and Konig were the only two people in the entire city of Stalingrad at this time. Where is the rest of the Red Army stationed there? Where is the rest of the German Army? It is not only one street that is silent... it is the whole city. Vassili and Konig are basically wandering throughout the entire city just looking for each other. Here and there someone will pop up, but it's not believable. Just that lowers my opinion of the film.I also don't understand the position of Danilov. In the beginning, when Vassili first finds him, he is a young, terrified soldier hiding amongst dead bodies, afraid to shoot a weapon, and then later he is a powerful officer running his own newspaper. The transition was too sudden, too unrealistic. One minute he's just an average guy and the next he's this bigshot with much influence. Didn't like it.And the accents... oh man, the accents. I understand that director Jean-Jacques Annaud was possibly trying to make it easier for the audience to understand, but this was just ridiculous. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes, both portraying Russian soldiers, didn't even attempt to change their British accents to adapt to their roles. And Ed Harris... well that is the most American-sounding German soldier I have ever seen. I would rather not be able to understand a few lines in the movie because of realistic accents than have no accents at all.The scenes... they ended too abruptly. One scene Vassili is in a building carefully being watched by Konig and a few others... the very next scene he's safe in someone's home. One scene two Russian soldiers are in a building where a German sniper is waiting... one dies, and in the next scene the other is safely at home. No. Didn't like.And Konig's relationship with the boy. Horrible. "Don't leave home or I'll have to kill you." Boy leaves home, Konig simply kills him with no resistance from the boy. But Konig just doesn't shoot him... he hangs him off a high pole in the middle of the city. Again, where are the rest of the people as this happens? The boy is hanged so high up... surely someone would see him and Konig as it was happening.And, like someone else here said, if Konig could find Vassili so easily, why did he need a sniper rifle? Why couldn't he just take a grenade or a bazooka or a mine or some other explosive and just get it over with? All the tension? Sure, I understand that in real life it really was a sniper fight, not a bazooka fight, but it just gets ridiculous after a while.And the sex scene! It was entirely unnecessary, and entirely too long! It just went on and on and on... and on! I thought it would never end. I had to ask myself if the movie had taken on a new focus. I wasn't sure. No... no... no...As an entertaining film, it's alright. As a realistic historical film, which it is supposed to be, it's not alright.ENEMY AT THE GATES - 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't too impressed with this film overall, but what was really good was the acting. The film drags on ruthlessly between the duels of the Russian hero sharpshooter, played by Jude Law, and his enemy, the German sharpshooter, brilliantly played by Ed Harris. The Ralph Fiennes role was interesting as well as we see him go from friend to traitor. The dark mood of the film can't help to put a drab mood on the viewer as well, as it tries to be a "Saving Private Ryan" look-alike. Unfortunately, the cinemotography used which tried to copy that modern war masterpiece didn't work in the context within this story. Good acting, but otherwise just a run-of-the-mill war film that left much to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the scene where Zaitsev meets Khrushchev, the Soviet National Anthem plays. Unfortunatly this is the wrong anthem! At the time of the Stalingrad siege (1942-43), the national anthem of the USSR was "The Internationale", a left wing song written during the 70-day Paris Commune of 1848. The Bolshevik party adopted this song during the Russian Civil War (1918-21), mainly because Karl Marx had felt that the Paris Commune was the first attempt at communist society, and thus validated this theories, and V. I. Lenin felt that his Bolshevik government was the second coming of the Paris Commune. The song which plays in the scene is the 1944 anthem, which is far more nationalistic, and has recently been re-written and re-adopted as the anthem of the Russian Federation.</fullReview>

Two British snipers fall in love, but a love triangle develops between them and a British NKVD agent. Then one of the British snipers is used as propaganda to boost Soviet morale by trying to kill an American sniper that the Germans bring in. Well, I could go on, but what's the point?

The ferrying of the soldiers across the Volga was visually stunning. Only when the dialogue started did i realize that the movie, despite its attempts to be true to actual events, was less than convincing. Everytime the actors spoke, I winced with anguish. Vassili Zaitsev, Nikita Kruschev, etc. with accents as British as British can be. Fine, the actors would probably have been less convincing (if that is possible) having fake accents, but then don't have the German army speak German! Again, I must state that certain parts of the film are quite beautiful to watch (not to be confused with 'war being beautiful to watch'), but the accents nearly drove me mad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Jacques Annaud's `Enemy at the Gates' opens with an extended sequence depicting the 1942 Siege of Stalingrad that is almost as impressive, in its size, scope and battleground realism, as the Normandy Invasion scene in `Saving Private Ryan.' Although `Enemy at the Gates' never again returns to this level of greatness, it does emerge as a pretty decent war movie, nonetheless. The film is based on the true story of a Soviet marksman, Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev, who finds himself - as much through fate and the efforts of an officer friend of his as through any act of bravery on his own part - suddenly thrust to the forefront as a national hero, a position created to bolster the fading morale of the Russian troops who are, at that moment, being mercilessly pounded by the Nazi war machine. So famous ? and, thus, so much a threat to Nazi security - has Vassili become, that the Germans have even sent their greatest sniper, Major Konig, to find and dispatch him.Thus, the film becomes at times a fascinating depiction of a cat-and-mouse duel of wits between two evenly matched antagonists both bent on the same outcome. Ed Harris plays Konig with all the steely-eyed intensity of a bloodthirsty killer, as much driven by his need for personal triumph as his love of the greater cause. In contrast, Vassili is portrayed as an almost reluctant hero, a man who would gladly relinquish the burden placed on him if circumstances could be different. Part of the fascination of his character rests in the struggle Vassili undergoes as he tries to reconcile the heroic image of himself as portrayed in the newspapers with the all-too-human man of flesh and blood he knows himself to be. Jude Law, despite his grating and wholly anachronistic English accent, underplays his role nicely, as does Joseph Fiennes, as Commissar Danilov, the Marxist idealist who comes up with the plan of turning Vassili's acts into the stuff of legend. In addition to covering an aspect of World War II that has long gone untouched by moviemakers until now, `Enemy at the Gates' provides us with an interesting plot - even though, at 130 minutes, it does tend to fall into a dramatic monotony every now and then. Furthermore, the film is saddled with a romantic triangle of such surpassing banality that it threatens to reduce the movie in the final scenes to as great a pile of rubble as those we see so skillfully created by the set designer. Speaking of which, the single greatest element of this film is clearly its meticulously mounted imagery of both chaotic battle scenes and the burned out remains of a devastated war torn city. Kudos go out to all the film's technical people, its production designer, art directors, set decorator, editors, cinematographer, special effects technicians etc. They have done a truly monumental job on this film. Only James Horner's score turns out to be a bit problematic, since the first ten or so notes of the recurring main theme sound exactly like John Williams' work from `Schindler's List.' Yet, `Enemy at the Gates,' though not a perfect film, has much to offer in terms of its plot, its performances and, above all, its grand visual style. For that last aspect alone, the film should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the end for Nazi Germany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the allies landed at Normandy (June 1944) Nazi Germany was already defeated. On an almost constant retreat after the Battle of Stalingrad (Feb 1943)Germany's manpower losses at the Eastern Front were horrific. This movie gives a small example of what happened in the East. Good acting, great special effects (Stuka dive bombers that look like Stukas), and an interesting story make for a winner. Fortunately, I am well versed in the Eastern Front battles so the movie made sense to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Target</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can't see why this film didn't do better in the theaters - it was a great war movie. Here's the basics: set in 1942 - 1943 in the battle of Stalingrad, Jude Law plays a beloved sniper who always hits his mark. Rachel Weisz plays his love interest (oooh, whatta hottie) and Ed Harris completes this trio as the ultimate target (didn't much care for Joseph Fiennes's character). It was easy to follow and the suspense rates a 10 on my scale. For all the people out there that say this was just a movie to "cash in" on all the success from "Saving Private Ryan" - it's just a war movie! There's lots of em! It's not even the same war! Another cool point - I give credit to my cousin who I saw this movie with - the actor who played Nikita Krushchev seemed strikingly familiar throughout the whole movie - and after about an hour, he finally figured out just who the hell the old man was --- Eddie Valiant from frickin Roger Rabbit! Did this guy get old fast, let me tell you. Anyway - overall a very cool war movie - rates right up there with "U-571".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I saw Saving private Ryan, I thought that was the greatest war movie of all time. It had everything, starting from great story to great special effects and realization of war. To prove that-I was in war too. When Enemy at the gates came out, I wanted to see it, but not as bad as I wanted to see Saving Private Ryan. After few weeks, I even lost interest in seeing this movie at all. Yesterday I went out with my friends and we happened to end up in theater watching that movie. It was a surprise! I was surprised how well they showed war and everything that is going on during a war. Yes it did have few faults but they were not major. It was based on a true story and I am not sure how many western people are familiar with it. It is truly worthy of seeing and if you wont to know few things about war, go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a shameful mess this film turned out to be. I don't think I have ever laughed through a war film as much as I did in this one. What annoys me most about this film is that they ruined a great concept. A film about the battle of Stalingrad could have turned out to be a masterpiece.The initial battle is good. Nowhere near SPR but still satisfactory. A few too many close ups of Jude Law's angelic face for my liking. You already know that he will survive this battle and most probably the whole film. When he is on the train at the start, he stares intently at a beautiful woman. What are the odds that they'll meet up again later in the film?I must admit that at this point it still had a claim to being a good war film. Within 20 minutes this claim had been all but dashed to pieces. I don't think this was a good performance by Jude Law. He tried his hardest to look haunted but determined, but his struggle was there for all to see. He didn't convince me for a second. Joseph Fiennes just overacted to the point of foolishness. Rachel Weisz did not really belong in this film and I could have found a more convincing Russian leader than Bob Hoskins. That's right BOB "Super Mario" HOSKINS??!! The casting director should be sacked.The only person who emerged with any credit was Ed Harris. He put in an excellent performance as it was obvious he was stuck with a 2-dimensional character.Now I'll get on to the plot. The duel between poor Russian boy and rich German aristocrat was made to be much more important than it ever would be. I am not so stupid as to think that the death of Vassili Zaitsev would have any noticeable effect on the war. The Russians must have had countless snipers that were used for propaganda. The portrayal of Zaitsev as some sort of Russian hero was very unrealistic.The love triangle was needless. This is not what war is about. Please to not deceive innocent moviegoers into thinking they are going to see a realistic war film and then present some nonsensical fantasy that has no correlation with war.The sex scene was funny. Unintentionally funny.I would like some idea that this battle is actually taking place in Russia. Accents, subtitles? The director made no effort to create a true sense of atmosphere. People reading Russian in English with an English accent? I'm sorry but no matter how hard I tried, all I saw were British people who seem to have stumbled onto one of the most important battles in WW2.Ed Harris character did not have to hang that little boy. As if him being a Nazi isn't enough, he murders children as well! In case you weren't sure who the baddie was, this idiotic scene brings everyone up to speed. Thanks Director!Oh, and in the space of a few minutes Commissar Danilov denounces communism. If Rachel Weisz doesn't love him, communism must be wrong. Who can argue with such expert reasoning?Major Erwin Konings can shoot people in mid air. Zaitsev falls asleep at the crucial moment when his enemy passes. It is well known for soldiers to have made love to beautiful women while their comrades were asleep. Idiocy was piled upon idiocy unitl my head could take it no longer.If you insist on seeing this film. Watch simply to admire Ed Harris' performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot was interesting and special effects were excellent. But it succumbed to the same problems that afflict nearly all Hollywood movies -- lack of focus and lack of editing, poor dialog and predictable situations.It was frustrating to watch because it could have been such a better movie. All they had to do was to remove several scenes completely to shorten the movie and tighten the grip, and fix the dialog which was frequently laughably bad. But these problems were so bad they seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the movie.If Citizen Kane is a 10 and Casablanca is a 9, then this movie could not be rated any higher than 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will please both the entertainment crowd and the arty guys like me. There is always tension, there is good acting, some sex, great special effects (the air strikes are, well ... striking). But there is also accurate historical reconstruction: this is a film to be seen by those who enjoyed the book "Stalingrad" by Antony Bevor, and the lesser known "The Betrayed Army" (a book of memoirs by one of the few survivors. In it you will find the story of father and son both soldiering in Stalingrad, which briefly appears in the film also). And yes, Nikita Kruschof did serve as a commanding political commissar during the battle of Stalingrad (to answer a previous review). I like to find hidden references to other films, and in this case the titles which came to my mind were "Stalker" by Tarkosky (the setting, the un-sentimental respect for human suffering), "Blade Runner" (the setting, again), maybe Sam Pekinpah's films (the depiction of death), American Westerns (the ending of the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some are missing important aspects of the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have come across those who do not like the sex scene between Vasilli and Tania. It fits in very nicely with the flow of the movie. To begin, we have to contrast how poorly the ordinary soldiers were armed, compared with those behind them. After all, Soviet soldiers died because they were purposely shot by those who thought better. In my observation, this is a misplacing of priority. The instinct not to lose was more important than the instinct to win. To say there is no difference is misguided. Then what about the concern Danilov had towards Tania. He wanted to make sure that she survived, but he made sure that Vasilli was placed in the most precarious position ever since he arrived. He knew it, Tania knew it, and Vasilli knew it. So, if a man is sent to what could be his death, it doesn't take much to celebrate life in any form. However at the end, the movie does take a hopeful turn. Not the reuniting of Vasilli and Tania, but the realization by Danilov just before he died that regardless of the rules; there is always something that causes one to envy another. That in itself only goes so far, and I would say in the end, Danilov learned the lesson that it is not enough to know the difference between good and evil; one needs to do what is good, and not do what is evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last war movie I saw was `Saving Private Ryan' and although it was an excellent movie I wasn't sure if I wanted to see another one. For anyone who has seen a war movie, you have to admit that they can be a bit depressing, especially the more real they are. Enemy at the Gates is based on a real person, which means that a certain amount of the events are real or based on similar events. And knowing this, some of the things I saw definitely fell within the emotional category of depressing.Enemy at the Gates is based on the life of Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a young Russian soldier in the sniper division. The movie focuses on Vassili's time in the war and his rise to heroism as Russian papers detail his heroic feats as a special divisions sniper. As the war progresses and as Vassili gains notoriety, he begins to draw the attention of the German high command. To put a stop to this, the Germans send in their top sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris) to deal with Vassili. I'm not usually a stickler about movie consistencies but there were some that were quite noticeable. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie but the story was about the Germans trying to overtake Stalingrad so the characters are all either German or Russian. Hence it reasons to believe that there should be German and Russian accents. I don't really mind if the accents are off as long as the attempt was made to be somewhat authentic but instead, most of the characters either had British or American accents and when watching the movie, I had a hard time getting really into it. In addition to this, there was one point where we see Vassili writing a letter to some of his supporters, which in itself is fine but we see him being told how to spell a word by Joseph Fiennes character, Commander Danilov and he spells out the word in English. Maybe I'm getting picky but this seemed quite obvious and odd to me in the context of the scene and the overall movie. Little things like these took away from the authenticity of the movie and overall enjoyment level. On another note, some of the dialogue was a bit cliché ridden and in some situations seemed to be added for drama and Hollywood sake.The acting was quite well done, especially Ed Harris's character. The one knock I have (not against him but the direction of his character) is that the end scene with Commander Koenig and the little boy, Sasha, seemed completely out of line with the character we're given up to that point. But maybe that was the point the director was trying to make. I quite enjoyed Jude Law's performance. I haven't seen many of his films but I enjoyed this one. I really enjoyed the sniper scenes. Unlike many war movies where directors feel that it's necessary to have lots of movement and action (which is a natural part of war), I really did like the sniper scenes where there was little movement. We're still able to feel the tension that these men feel and the subtleties of being a sniper.Overall, I did like the movie but it could have been better if they paid a bit more attention to the things I mentioned above. But, like I said, maybe I'm just being picky. I'm just a guy who watches a lot of movies so what do I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie about one of the most epic battles in history this one comes across a bit shallow. In fact you'd never guess this was an epic battle just from watching this movie. You could say this is just a small episode of this battle, but not when you have dialogue like "you can win the war for us" thrown in there. It makes the duel sound far more important then it was and makes it seem as if the whole battle was decided by the duel (like in the middle ages). Also the director probably thought he was being clever by throwing in some elements of politics, but that just detracts from the movie by leaving threads which lead nowhere. For example the sniper that says all his teeth were knocked out by his own people (the NKVD). This is an interesting topic in and of itself but adds nothing to the movie since it barely scratches the surface (and it's wrong at that, he would have been sent to a forced labor camp, and how he made it out to fight is a mystery). Then there is this obvious fear of showing the red army as the good guys. Why that should even be an issue is beyond me. And yet we are forced to listen to people having doubts about the system. Not only was this uncommon among those who weren't aware of the purges, but you wouldn't dare say such things out loud. And it does a great deal of disservice to the people who gave their lives for their motherland without thinking twice about it. This isn't even apparent during the charging attack scenes. Those soldiers didn't need much motivation, it is in fact their insane bravery which gave them the edge in the first place. This is something that the movie fails to show. The director also tries hard to make the opening scenes more dramatic by making the soldiers very poorly armed. But while very true in the beginning of the war, it wasn't quite the same by the Battle of Stalingrad. Also we are talking about more then a million people involved in very bitter fighting for every street, every house, every room! This could have made for very dramatic scenes but it's totally missing. And then there is that tacked on, borrowed from Hollywood love triangle. It doesn't exactly add anything to the plot either. I mean at least stick to the facts, make Zaitsev give her sniping lessons for instance. This way we learn more about snipers, and see a bond develop between them, but this? Also there are little annoying details which might not be too important but are very distracting. The accents that everyone keeps mentioning are a real issue. When those actors speak in those British accents you instantly identify them as just that, British! It's not just English, it's a very specific dialect from a very specific place. Really, subtitles would have worked better, and even Russian actors for that matter, as unlike Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes doesn't look even remotely Russian! There are so many more things to go into but I can best sum it up this way : the Russian movie on Zaitsev (part of a big "liberation" series), is superior, though it was done on a mere fraction of the budget and no stars to speak of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is better than what you see in the trailers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie the first week it opened because nothing else was worth paying the $8.50 it costs these days to watch a movie. Anyhow, this movie totally took me by surprise. I was kept on my toes throughout the entire movie. I must say that the trailers did not do this movie any justice. When you see the trailers on television, you know immediately that it is a war movie involving two soldiers on opposite lines trying to gun the other one down. However, you are not informed that it is about the war between the Russians and Germans during WWII.For those who do not remember what they learned in their high school world history class, the Russians are fending off the more powerful and well-equipped Germans who are having difficulty taking over Stalingrad, the heart of Russia. The Russians are desperate because they do not have enough weaponry to fight their German counterparts. When it seems that the Russians are doomed, Commander Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) develops a strategy to bring hope and honor to his people.The propaganda starts when Danilov makes a hero out of Vassili (Jude Law), Russia's best sniper. Danilov puts Vassili in the front page of every Russian newspaper painting a picture of a courageous and gifted soldier who intimidates the German military. When the Germans send major Koenig (Ed Harris), their version of the best in the world, to kill Jude Law, the Russians realize that their tactics are working. The duel between Major Koenig and Vassili gives Danilov the ammunition he needs to write about his hero and provide his country with the hope that they need to survive. Oh but that's not all, Danilov and Vassili both fall in love with the same woman and. You'll have to watch this movie to find out the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movie experiences of my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Already from the promos, one could see how different, unique and original this movie is among the usual "goo" coming out of Hollywood in the last few years. There is much to be said on this movie. But briefly - it is a wondrous experience, with a superb movie making skills - from the captivating screenplay and direction of Jean-Jacques Annaud to the memorable acting of Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. Jude Law conveys a truly one of a kind hero/Human character, and manages to color every scene with the most extreme emotions - from fear to desire, from love to hatred. Joseph Fiennes, who already proved his acting skills in "Shakespeare in love", pours the content of the the script into action. Ed Harris, who already proved to be true to his acting and not to his "Hollywood standards", makes one doubt the villain/human conflict as one finds it more than difficult to despise this character. The movie has some unforgettable scenes. From the very beginning the movie brings us into the war from the perspective of the soldiers, who were literally thrown in and are stunned by the sights as we are. One of the most admirable features of this film is how non presumptuous it is. The film deals with sensitive issues like the Communism ideology in an authentic matter. It depicts the Russians in a human way, and criticizes the Communism idea, not per se, but its "mutation" to Stalin's Soviet Union. Several scenes in the movie are truly magnificent, from the entrance of Nikita Krushchev, played by talented Bob Hoskins, to one of the best scenes in Film history - the love making of Vassili and Tanya. This scene can in itself characterize how different this film is from the rest of Hollywood films. In impossible environment and without actually showing anything, Annaud manages to convey passion, love and desire among the opposite feelings of probably the worst period in Human history. I can only hope that this movie will deserve its respect among next year's Oscars, as even though it is such a dark film taking place in WWII, it is truly a colorful film which conveys emotions in an authentic way - love, revenge, regret, envy, passion and hatred. If you love cinema or not, if you prefer war movies, if you prefer romantic movies... if you are human - go see this movie. You won't regret it!</fullReview>

While the movie follows the war and the one battle as Nazi Germany charge into Russia it follows the story of 1 soldier and his own personal struggles. (sounding Feminine ) Don't worry, there is plenty of gore as the battle rages on between the two snipers, Harris and Law.

		<fullReview>I will start by briefly stating that I enjoyed this movie. Maybe it wasn't all 100% correct according to historians, but what do they know! (yes, that was a joke).But what got me annoyed was reading other comments here on imdb. People seem to be bothered with the fact that the actors did not speak German/Russian. Why? I think that it's better to have actors who I respect speak a language that seem comfortable for them to speak, and which they speak fluently. Rather than have actors speak a language that just sound false (ever really listened to the terrorists in Die Hard?). I looked up Gladiator and even though that movie has received more than it's fair share of complaints, nobody ever complained that the actors weren't speaking latin.</fullReview>

I disagree. "Stalingrad," the town and the battle, has always been a mere name to me. And a drab one at that. This movie is rich in vibes, rich in humanity. Maybe it would have been strange to portray Stalingrad as a corny love story if wee knew anything about the place or the times. As it is, this movie, love twists and all, is the first and only human slant on the Russians and the history that I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>Hello all,Having read the book "War of the Rats" I was excited to see the trailer on TV which was obviously a theatrical version of the same story.However, the film's depiction of the sniper encounters had none of the tension or intrigue of the book. And the heavy propaganda plot line was tedious and tiresome. Granted, the sniper showdown was likely a Soviet propaganda ploy, but it carried too much weight here in my opinion.Many have complained here about the British accents, so I won't belabor that point. Except to say it cheapened the experience for me somewhat.Ed Harris was a bright spot. But for me this ranks toward the bottom of the list in the WWII genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings about the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I like it. About time credit is given the tenacity and sacrifices of the USSR for defeating Fascism. Production is good: sets, costumes, FX, soundtrack. For the most part, combat carnage is presented with historical, visceral authenticity. But characterizations hurt this character-driven film.British accents are distracting to the American audience which hears them as "exotic" (similarly if Russians had been played by Americans with Brooklyn or Dixie accents). This is probably less distracting for the European audience. I would prefer subtitles. The letter-writing scene with spelled-out -- in English! -- vocabulary was particularly jarring. Likewise, interjection of modern slanguage ("Whatever." "take him out") and use of the term "Krauts" (Russians said "Fritzes"). But the problem lies less with language or accents, than with how the characters relate to eachother. They don't interact in any way remotely Russian. They don't communicate like Russians. Difficult to put a finger on it, exactly, but obvious to one who has spoken with many veterans, and read hundreds of wartime journals and post-war memoirs (even translated to English).Then there's the romance. There actually was a relationship between Zaitsev and Chernova, his sniper protege and eventually lover. She was not the shy intellectual, though, but a hardened Partisan obsessed with killing Germans. The fully-clothed sex scene in the tunnel/bunker is realistic, if one discounts Weisz's over-emoted multiple orgasms. The brevity and griminess are certainly realistic. Reviewers complain about the surrounding soldiers slumbering through, but combatants were chronically sleep-deprived and fatigued, to the point where they could drop-off standing, despite the constant barrage of shelling. Handled well, "Enemy's" romance might have succeeded. Instead it brings to the film the most nauseatingly insipid dialogue since the blitherings of Jack and Rose in "Titanic". The love-triangle is plain boring.Sasha: "Enemy's" adorable kid was actually a 15-year-old, German-speaking master-cobbler. At least he is accurately portrayed as a "double-agent" and his fate true to life.I would have preferred enactment of the overall Battle: street-to-street, house-to-house, constant advancement and retreat, desperate defenses of tenuous territory. Even so, the sniper duel as microcosm does give the film focus, not a bad thing. There is doubt about the actual occurrance of the legendary hunt, but that's ok, too. Soviet propaganda extolled the feats of many heroic role-models like Zaitsev. (Another was Lilya Litvyak, a Jewish female ACE fighter-pilot. Prominently featured in front-line newspapers, her fame attracted the Luftwaffe's attention. Litvyak had her own legendary duel, defeating ACE Graf von Einsiedel in aerial combat. Her lionizing by the Red Army press led to her demise: she was ultimately shot down by eight Messerschmitts drawn to her distinctively painted Yak. Since feats of Soviet heroes were always embellished by the propaganda-mill, the question of Zaitsev's duel's authenticity is moot.My biggest gripe with "Enemy" is the propagandic agenda. Not Danilov's -- the filmmakers! The producers go overboard to prove they are not in any way "commie sympathizers". There is way too much anti-communist baggage in this film! Yes, the Stalinist regime was evil, and the ruthless NKVD and blocking troops, and true, the Soviet command unadverse to throwing poorly-trained, poorly-armed human waves as cannon-fodder at the enemy. But too much focus is placed on these cruelties of the Soviet system for the average western audience to empathize with the protagonists. History buffs, Eastern Front enthusiasts and Russophiles will get past the anti-Red rhetoric. But too many westerners will continue to misunderstand the fervor of the Soviet people to defend and die for their Motherland. In Russia today, the Great Patriotic War is still everpresent, with monuments everywhere to the fallen millions. It is traditional for newlyweds to visit them and donate their wedding flowers before departing on honeymoon. In its zeal for "political-correctness", the film does a disservice to the Soviet *people*, the true heroes of the Eastern Front.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Forgot, Who Won this war--The English or the Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>_Enemy at the Gates_ is another in what will be a long line of movies wanting to get to the screen before the upcoming blockbuster multi-million dollar destined hit _Pearl Harbor_. This one is a little different from the others, as it is a historical piece about the bloodiest battle history has recorded. And of course the film makers spent a pretty penny on blood in their filming.The sets are wonderful, the story is touching and entertaining, and the acting is passable. The problem I had with the film is a common one, I had a really hard time with the dialogue. This is a story based on the German invasion of Russia in 1942; specifically the long-fought defense of Stalingrad by the Russians.Mandalay Entertainment, the production company behind some great hits in the past has put together so many great historical and foreign films that I was very excited to see this historical film. Why they decided that the Russians should all be portrayed by English actors (complete with English accents and phraseology) and the evil Germans should be embodied by very American Ed Harris is beyond me.Is it an anti-American statement? Is it an anti-Russian statement? Or is it something much simpler? I believe that this film was made for an American audience who simply do not understand anything other than English, and can't read (subtitles in a film tend to mark it for video in this country, after the art house crowd get done with it). Will this film play in Russia? Yes. Will the Russians like it? No. And they should, this is a famous story from Russian history which paints the right people in a positive light and the others in a negative light. It's a hero story about a famous historical Russian hero. This film should be a love letter to Russia from the producers, but the language thing is a really bummer. Will they over-dub it in Russian for the release? Maybe. But, why? Why not over-dub it in English for the dumb Americans? Oh yeah, the Americans have all the money, and they love spending it on entertainment. Oh, and they love films who spend a lot of money on fake blood. --Basil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy At The Gates shines in its brilliant sniper scenes, but they are very brief. These scenes doesn't hide the fact that the rest of the movie is a complete waste of time. The director doesn't seem to be able to agree with himself wether it's a war movie or a love story. He should have went with the war movie, bacause the love story is embarrassingly bad and clumsily told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So far this year I have managed to see several good movies such as Billy Elliot, Crouching Tiger, Chocolat, etc., but they all came out last year. Enemy at the Gates has to be the best movie coming out this year so far. The opening battle scenes are so brutal that they moved me to tears. The tension generated by the duel of two snipers is unbelievable. The love story is subtle and touching. I have no problems whatsoever with the accents in this movie, in fact, it is pleasant to hear Russians and Germans speaking perfect English. The acting all around is excellent. Jude Law, an actor whom I had greatly resented for his many roles as spoiled playboys including that nasty Dickie Greenleaf in Talented Mr. Ripley, proves here that he is capable of roles that are humble, vulnerable, and likable. Ed Harris is amazing (I have to see Pollock soon). Other actors are great as well. Overall this movie is better than Saving Private Ryan in my opinion. It has more hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I say that, I mean that it's core being the war scenes, and of course, every scene between the two confronters, Jude Law and Ed Harris.In 1942 Russia, the Germans are closing in and only one person can help in keeping the nazis back, a sniperman Vassili (Law) by killing the Germans by the dozens from a hiding place. But, another expert comes in named Koening (Harris, in fine form as always) who will fight to the death. The film has un-needed side plots (a love triangle doesn't sound as real in a non-fiction story) and has the British actors and actresses keeping they're accents when playing Russians (that got annoying after a while). But when you take every single moment on the screen where we see the duo of Harris and Law against each other in a cat and mouse game, you have a great war movie. If only the pesky side things weren't in the way. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you screw up a movie about Stalingrad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalingrad is the Eastern Front in a nutshell. Hundreds of thousands of men doomed by their leaders' mistakes. Vicious street fighting. Sniper duels. Fertile ground for a war movie... so how do you screw it up?Add a love story and use British actors to give it that "Oh, John", "Oh, Mary" feel.The British accents really wreck the tone of the movie. Bob Hoskins is an excellent actor, and probably has a decent handle on Kruschev, his speech patterns, and his mannerisms, but delivered in that accent, it was a mood killer. With luck, after this the Brits will be back where they belong: playing Nazis.The love triangle is implausible. It all seems rather contrived, and ironically enough, is underdeveloped, and is based entirely on coincidence, but then again, so is much of the plot.The titles and subtitles use the extremely annoying conceit of the faux-Cyrillic character set; you know the one, where all the Es are replaced with Sigmas.On the plus side, this movie does depict the way the Soviets fought the Great Patriotic War rather well. The chaotic command structure, the deification of Comrade Stalin, and the extreme penalties for failure are all present.The movie tries to walk the line between romance and war. There's too much of each for the other to succeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the Gates of a great Movie Through the Gates for a great Through the Gates for a great Through the Gates for a great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates was AWESOME!!!! This weekend after my long over due shave, I ran to the 9:45 showing of Enemy at the Gate and, from the credits on I was blown away. I'm convinced that this movie was made by someone who not only is a very sensitive artist but a gifted filmmaker, no hack could ever pull this film off, is impossible. This film not only has a very specific opinion about war, but about the ties made and responsibilities taken. My first impression of the movie, and those of you who saw it I'm talking about the boat scene, it was going to be a plain testosterone ride but, I was way wrong. This movie hates war, hates war just as much as the Nazis, the Russians and just the whole thing, that's why is great and remarkable. All the characters have a sense off responsibilities but at the same time an even bigger sense of doom, after all they are in the middle of a war, and as stated it's the worst place to be. The fact that is by all means a "sniper movie" the characters were not what you would see through the view finder of a rifle, the are well crafted individuals who want to not only help the Motherland but get themselves out of this situation. Every character has it's remorse and dreams even if they are not stated they are there, not underwritten, just written by the acting, which is to say the least, superb. Every single shot fired was frightening to me, not only because of the moral consequences but because of the toll it was taken on the characters, for every Nazi a Russian will die. And now to the part I loved the most, in the middle of the awful war of guns, a love story brews. The great thing about the love story is that him and her were in love with the situation not the person. She was in love with the legend that he was and he was just in love with the pretty girl who likes the man everyone thinks he is, perfection. During the sex scene everyone in the theater was laughing. I know why, when you watch that scene without thinking about what i just stated the sex may seem impossible, why would they fall in love with each other you just met 30 minutes ago, well is simple escapism. They are escaping the war by running into each other. And off course the twist that makes the love story complete is that the man who truly knows her and the way she is, his love is not returned. Sad but the base for a great story, where the biggest conflict is surviving this war. Without a doubt, in my top list of greatest war films ever, also in the list Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory, Bridge on the River Kwai.I saw other movies this week end but fact is I don't remember them. Not only is it one of the best of the years but one of the best crafted films since Eyes Wide Shut. It was a great way to start the weekend.Lo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was stationed in the military not many years after WWII; I had the chance to visit the major cities of the then Soviet Union, and this film is a very accurate portrayal of what I've been told by the survivors. We so easily dismiss the Russians, but more (by far) died at Stalingrad than all Yank soldiers in the whole of WWII. This films easily portrays the scope of the major battles moreso than any predecessor including "Saving Private Ryan". It should not be missed by anyone with any feeling for history and why we've survived until this day.</fullReview>

I liked the setting of the battle scenes, such as the Crossing of the Volga River. I liked the story line, a sniper duel between the Russian Vasily Zaitsev and the German Major Koenig. I didn't like the love triangle part, it slowed down the film. From actual history, Vasily did fall in love with Tania, but there was no love triangle. All in all, it was a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the reviews I've read for this movie refer to the misplaced love story that dilutes the otherwise strong plot and minimalizes the omnipresent tragedy and horror that is war.Quite honestly, I feel that the love story is what truly solidified this film and took it from the ranks of the great war movies to the category of great cinema.The film is technically engrossing, and dramatically enthralling. All of the performances are solid and emotionally involving.This is definitely the finest movie I've seen this year.The sniper battles were very well portrayed and suspenseful. The love triangle, though seemingly out of place, was quite realistic, and added a new element to an already fascinating story. Both sides of the larger battle were portrayed fairly and for the most part accurately (as opposed to, say, Saving Private Ryan). The film succeeded in all the ways a wonderful film should, in my opinion.I simply cannot say how much I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with Ed Deeth's comments about the film except for the part about the accents. Willing suspension of disbelief -- I think it would have been more distracting to have the actors attempt Russian and German accents possibly unsuccessfully, and perhaps the attempt would have distracted them away from their portrayals. The only English accent I was really aware of was Sasha's. This was a wonderful and moving motion picture, and I was especially impressed with the acting of Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes. I didn't realize who the actors were, though they looked familiar. They really became the characters, not themselves. It's nice to see a new generation of young actors who can take on a variety of roles believably and not just be one type. After the movie, when I realized who played Vasily and Danilov and thought about The Amazing Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I was really impressed. These two can be compared to Rod Steiger, Olivier, and a few others could play more than just one type of character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film, telling the tale of a sniper in the conflict at Stalingrad during the Second World War. Many interesting and breathtaking scenes. Similar to Saving Private Ryan, but superior to it, the film takes as its centrepiece the duel between a German sniper (Ed Harris) and his Russian counterpart (Jude Law). The actors are all english-speaking, and use their natural accents instead of sounding like the villains from James Bond films. Some remarkable directing makes the whole much more than the sum of its parts. Should win at least 10 Oscars!</fullReview>

The sound track is also very appropriate and haunting which goes nicely with the hunter hunted atmosphere. The ending was a little disappointing and unrealistic, but otherwise, the movie is very believable (I could actually feel my blood turn cold during some of the more suspenseful scenes). For some reason, my favorite character is actually Major Konig (Ed Harris), there's a certain nobility about him that just isn't present in the other characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few hours ago I saw this film at a special advanced screening at which the director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, was present. The film was unlike any war film I've ever seen -- it was aesthetically done, especially the beginning, and the story was easy to follow. There were many suspenseful moments in the film, truly ingenious so as to make them unpredictable. The cast turned in spectacular performances. Jude Law was truly the star, and he should have gotten first billing. He expressed a range of emotions that will truly grant him more challenging roles in the future. The role of Ralph Fiennes was slightly exasperating, but his performance was commendable, much like in Shakespeare in Love. Rachel Weisz, who was very funny in The Mummy, proved here that she can handle serious dramatic roles as well as comedic-adventures. Ed Harris did a great job as the general, completely believable and sinister without being a ham. This is a highly recommended film. The plot was engaging, the scenes captivating, and the direction spectacular. Annaud said he was interested in historical fiction because there are always great stories to tell. That is undoubtedly true here.</fullReview>

And also time-line is fiction. Jean Jaques Annaud should read a book, which was written by Vasiliy Zaitsev (yeah, that sniper): "&#x410;fter the Volga there was not a land for us. Notes of the sniper."Here comes some facts from that book:- Zaitsev was on navy before Stalingrad. He never was huntsman. - He was taken across the Volga at night and w/o any resistance from Germans. - He was armed with a gun, machine-gun and grenades. Other soldiers were armed too. - He became a sniper couple months later after his regiment starts fighting in Stalingrad. etc.Read a review of Russian people on this movie: http://www.battlefield.ru/index.php ? option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=206 &amp; Itemid=108</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hollywood! Not history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates has been slammed over and over again for its distortion of truth, cinematic liberties it took with history, and the wrongful portrayal of Russian heroes. Here is what people have to understand when they go to watch this movie. It has not a history lesson, it is entertainment. That is what everyone must say to themselves before they start watching this.Enemy at the Gates follows the story Vassili Vaitsez, an elite Russian sniper who has been drafted and is serving the Battle of Stalingrad. After Vassili kills so many German soldiers, the Germans send in their own elite in Major Konig. What ensues is a heart pounding stand off between the two elite snipers in the ruins of the train yard and other places in the once bustling city of Stalingrad.The actors due a phenomenal job of acting in this film. Jude Law, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz and Joseph Fiennes all deliver top notch performances in their respective roles. Jude Law as a lead I'm usually not a big fan of but his performance as Vassili, a man caught in the middle of the bloodiest battle in human history, changed my mind about the English actor. Ed Harris shows how good he can act as villain when he is lurking around the ruins with his trusted sniper rifle.The film is loaded with violence done Saving Private Ryan style. The action is in your face, blood and gore everywhere. The opening 20 minutes is some of the most intense action I have ever seen. The director gives you a sense of as if you are actually in the battle, the confusion of soldiers, the explosions, everything. You feel as if you are actually in the middle of it.The story isn't great, it isn't terrible but it is not the greatest screen play ever to be written. The romance between Vassili and Tania, though I saw it be unneeded, still turned out to work very well. Enemy at the Gates is one of the few war films that actually takes the time to give a sense of the soldier and what they may be going through in the war, not just battle after battle. It is no history lesson, many liberties are taken with how the battle of Stalingrad and its commanders are portrayed. However, if you can look past these flaws, you'll be confronted with a very well made war film.Enemy at the Gates. 3.5/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mistake was in reading so much history before seeing "Enemy At The Gates". To me it's just one more piece of Hollywood garbage dressed up as history. The movie would have you believe that the war hinged on the outcome of the duel between the snipers. It did NOT. Nor was there a Major Konig. There is no mention of such a person in any records of the German armed services, including Waffen SS. It was pure myth. And Hollywood, bumbling liar that it is, simply took the myth to new levels of absurdity.Real German and Russian actors might have helped but I doubt it.I give this "film" a 4 for paying some attention to smaller details. But subtract 6 for getting the basic history wrong.Note that the movie totally ignores what was happening militarily outside of Stalingrad... the plans being drawn up for the encirclement of the 6th Army (operations Uranus, Saturn, Mars).Snipers helped in the defeat of the Nazis but the word is *helped*. They were not the deciding factor.To all Hollywood directors-- stay the h*ll out of the history genre. You stink at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Downward Spiral To Utter Narrative Tedium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many bad war movies in my time, but rarely have I seen a perfect bad war movie. Picture an inverted pyramid, balanced on a pinpoint. The movie begins with enormous excitement and gripping realism, as Soviet Russia reels under impact of the German juggernaut. The time, summer of 1942. The opening five minutes of the film combine bombing, infantry assault, armored columns, to create a relentless sense of superior German firepower. The end is near, and yet the Russians are still desperately fighting back. Jude Law first makes his entrance as a conscript who has only five bullets, and who must kill five German soldiers in a matter of seconds to survive. BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! And that's about it. Once the young sniper has been "discovered" and equipped properly, each battle scene has less and less power. The movie starts at a run, dwindles to a walk, and finishes at a crawl. It is a perfect reverse pyramid -- starting breathless and ending lifeless.Unlike other reviewers,however, I do not feel that what killed this movie was the forced romantic situations. Rachel Weisz was both stunning and effectively torn as a Russian girl who goes from bedraggled front line fighter to crisp and polished headquarters clerk. Her obvious courage and devotion to the sniper hero is balanced by a quite human need to survive. With just a slump of her shoulders or a half-conscious glance at a cot in a quiet corner, Rachel Weisz shows the aching weariness and exhaustion of a young woman forced into the most wracking labor. Always expressive as an actress, she uses her large dark eyes and full, expressive mouth to depict weariness and despair as well as determination. Her transfer to the rear comes as a shock, and she tries to protest, but after weeks of hunger, sleeplessness and dirt she is almost hypnotically drawn to the promise of a hot bath and a good night's sleep. Her love for the hero is always convincing, but it does not uproot her more basic survival needs, and this is a poignant note of realism in a rather unrealistic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard about this movie when I first saw it on television, so I really had no idea what to expect. If the movie hadn't captured my interest, I'm sure I would have changed the channel after just a few minutes. However, the sheer intensity of the opening segment where hundreds of Russian soldiers were literally thrown into the German lines practically unarmed (and with "political officers" behind them threatening to shoot them if they slowed at all in their advance) fascinated me. In fact, I remember barely breathing and feeling VERY tense during this segment--now that's great film making! The scene slows after nearly all these Russian troops are needlessly wasted. Remaining alive in a bunker is a political officer (Joseph Fiennes--the KGB man who enforces Stalin's mad directives and insures proper communist thinking among the soldiers) and a common soldier (Jude Law). They are pinned down and seemingly about to die. Fiennes is about to take a chance at attacking a group of five Germans--hoping to take them by surprise. He's obviously nervous and, as a political officer, probably useless when it comes to actual fighting. He asks Law if he can shot. "A little" is his reply--and he takes the gun. Then, like a shadow, he methodically kills all five Germans--timing his shots with incoming artillery rounds to cover the gunshots. Fiennes is absolutely amazed with the marksmanship and from then on, makes Law's character a hero of the Great Patriotic Struggle.All this occurs in the first half hour of the film. Where it goes from there and the showdown with Law and Ed Harris is something not to be missed. This is probably the most tension-filled and realistic war film I have ever seen. Great job done by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently this film was shown on BBC3 I agree with the comments made earlier.This film in quality surpasses Private Ryan in showing the horror of war. Two evil dictators, in this case Hitler and Stalin move their armies in hopeless hideous combat. The earl scenes capturing the horror of Red Army soldiers urged to charge impossibly most being unarmed those who were having little ammunition and then shot at by NKVD for retreating. Ghastly, evil on both sides. The drama and suspense is excellent, the imagery very good. One point though, the leading female actress seemed on occasion too neat for the scenes.Here we see a cruel Kruschev the Stalinist before his dramatic conversion in 1956. The scenes concerning Major König and Zaitsev were excellent.This has to be one of the best war films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though, this movie is being appreciated by most people, IMHO I found it to be an average war film and nothing much stand out in the movie. It is more like In Love And War (1996) combine with Shot Through The Heart (1999) of HBO After many German officers being gun down by the Russian sniper (whom the Russian consider him as the hero), the German bring their own sniper veteran to kill that one Russian sniper. Don't get me wrong; the movie is good and very enthusiastic. The backdrop is great and Jude Law and the other actors are great. But overall the movie is not able to capture the feeling very well. Reason To Watch: · Good Acting, Good Backdrop, Reason Not To: · Very average film,Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another fine movie ruined by a love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" really looked like a promising movie when it came out in 2001. The end result didn't disappointed me but it's still a shame when you think about it how much better the movie could had been.Loose the love story for starters! A love story on the background of a heavy historical battle simply is out of place and takes away the pace and make the movie less believable. The whole love triangle thing really gets even annoying after a while and the weak 'Hollywood' ending also didn't do much good to the movie.The best scene's were most certainly the sniper scene's. Also the battle's were filmed with lot's of profession and visual style. The sets and costumes also added to the historical feeling of the movie and still make this movie a good one to watch.Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes did a good acting job as the two main characters. Ron Perlman also shows up in a (too) small role. I really got interest in him after seeing this movie back in 2001 and I'm glad to see his career is doing well at the moment.Certainly not the best war movie ever made but still enough stuff to excite the WW II buffs. Don't believe everything in the movie though, it is BASED on true events but nothing more than that...7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilersThe opening Private-Ryan-type carnage signals a sweeping war epic. The focus however is soon narrowed to a head-to-head personal duel that is almost Kirk Douglas' 'A gunfight' just set to a different arena. Then, thrown in for good measure is a love triangle that carries even a faint flavor of Cyrano de Bergerac!Anyone interested in the history of WWII would have some idea of the Siege of Stalingrad, which some Russians claim to be the real turning point of the war, rather than the Normandy landings. A sniper duel however, I suspect, would be a bit of a novelty. Built on this interesting premise, the several encounters between talented Russian farm-boy-turned-sharp-shooter Vassili (Jude Law) and German veteran sniper-instructor Konig (Ed Harris) follow one after another very well in mounting up the tension. An apparently somewhat out-classed underdog, Vassili losses a couple of comrades in the earlier encounters, without getting even as much as a glimpse of his deadly opponent. Then, completely nailed down as a sitting duck, he miraculously turns things around with his quick wits and a little help from sweetheart Tania (Rachel Weisz), drawing a little blood from the formidable opponent. A sniper duel is much more difficult to sell because the character, unlike in a fast draw showdown where he stands up front with 'hero' written all over his face, hides behind cover. What excites the audience, and this takes a little bit of doing, is the realization from earlier depictions that if the character gets just as much as a small part of his face exposed, he is as good as dead. In the final duel, therefore, when one of the adversaries walks into the open thinking that he has already shot his opponent, we know that it's all over. With this handicap, i.e. the lack of a clear visual impact of a fast-draw gunfight, the final duel in Enemy at the Gates is still very well made. Although the focus of the movie zeroes in quickly onto the sniper duel, the backdrop of the war at (and also behind) the Russian front is always there. Khrushchev as depicted in the movie in more along the line of a caricature. The theme of manufacturing a war hero that ultimately is too big for the incumbent to carry does give most fruit for thought. The love story is run-of-the-mill but the sex scene that takes place right in the middle of a crowded war camp covered with sleeping soldiers is quite ingenious, deserving an honorable mention. The acting is good all around. Law two years before Cold Mountain is in fine shape, even better than in Cold Mountain in some ways. Versatile Harris's Captain Konig is not the most challenging role in the some half-dozen films he made in 2001/2 (which included The Hours for which he got an Oscar 'supporting' nomination). Harris' acting caliber however makes the character less one-dimensional than what it otherwise would be. Shedding his Elizabethan persona, Joseph Fiennes becomes a Russian war officer developing towards ruthlessness as the heat intensifies. Sandwiched between her two 'Mummy' appearances, Weisz has a role of a standard war heroine, not a particularly inspiring role but one she handles well, and a good step in the development of her career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>incredible performances and great writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching such films as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Patton;" I have come to appreciate war films. For this reason, I decided to see the latest war film, "Enemy At The Gates.""Enemy At The Gates" is one of the best war films I have seen since "Saving Private Ryan" because it is executed perfectly. With incredible performances, script and the impact I felt; "Enemy At The Gates" sets the tone as the first great war film of the 22nd century. This film can be served as the appetizer to the main course coming out soon, "Pearl Harbor."Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins come together to re-visit the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The best thing about seeing each one of the actors perform was they all gave 100 percent effort to make the film as real as possible; they did an excellent job. Fiennes, Weisz and Hoskins were the icing to a cake that was delicious from the start.The highlights of "Enemy At The Gates" always came when Law and Harris were on screen because they played excellent psychological mind games with one another to win; furthermore, it was like watching master chess players playing for the grand prize. It was also enjoyable to see the strategies and tactics each would use to out-maneuver the other."Enemy At The Gates" drew me with its many action sequences similar to those in "Saving Priate Ryan." Also, the love triangle between the three main leads was interesting to watch and see how it would unfold. I felt like I was in the movie because the writer did an excellent job at making me feel exactly what they felt and experience what they were going through.There is no rule that states dialogue is needed for a successful film. While "Enemy At The Gates" has dialogue, the scenes that have none stand out in my mind the most because we see close-ups of both snipers and the expressions on their faces. This is incredible to me because the intensity shown on their faces speaks volumes about what the movie is really about.This is not be the best war film ever made but with two of the brightest young stars on the rise, an actress that is here to stay and a veteran that continues to turn in knock-out performances, "Enemy At The Gates" will be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it is true that Soviet leaders fought WWII by mindlessly sacrificing their own unarmed soldiers by the thousands, and that the few high caliber Soviet machine guns at the front lines were reserved for the sole use of killing their own troops... well, ENEMY AT THE GATES does not make the case very convincingly.ENEMY AT THE GATES lacks the credibility needed to introduce such exceptional ideas. Missing is the art, passion and intellect of Oliver Stone. Missing is the poetry, pacing and over-the-top action of John Woo.A smaller problem comes from there being three love scenes while at the same time the lovers have no access to basic hygiene. There is such filth all around. The characters are so dirty and cruddy, they would obviously smell too bad to want to go so close to each other. All the dead and rotting bodies were OK, but the two unclean lovers were unintentionally revolting to watch because all that comes to mind is how stench-ridden they both must smell. Gross-a-rama.

		<fullReview>This is not a pleasant film to watch but it's excellent. It shows the Battle of Stalingrad exactly as it was. Reading Anthony Beevor's book on Stalingrad prompted me to watch this film plus the fact that I have always been interested in Russia. Bob Hoskins must have studied films of Khrushchev from the time he was Soviet premier. The scene where Khrushchev embraces Vasili Zaitsev looks remarkably like the newsreel of the real Khrushchev embracing Yuri Gagarin after his space flight. Enemy at the Gates contrasts with Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan is about democracy fighting totalitarianism. Enemy at the Gates is about the clash between two merciless totalitarian systems. Rachel Weisz is spot on casting as Tanya. She's a very talented actress and she's got the right kind of slavic appearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy At The Gates is a welcome breath of fresh air.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy At The Gates: THEATER SEE RATING!This movie, unlike Saving Private Ryan, is a movie for the thinking movie goer. Not that Saving Private Ryan is at all a bad movie, because my review of it is nothing but nice, but everything in that movie is S-P-E-L-L-E-D out for you. Some of the critiques I have read on `Enemy' actually say that they should have built(S-P-E-L-L-E-D) the characters more in this movie for it to be compared to and as good as S.P.R. WHAT?! They're people with `class' differences in a war! Pretty Easy! I don't want the movie to deal with character building that I can figure out on my own.(also it makes an already long movie, too long) So actually Enemy At The Gates is a welcome breath of fresh air. Not only do I like it for the symbolisms and messages (possibly hidden to the layman movie goer) , but it has lots of action and twists(both physical and mental.),and finally because it has a `real Feeling' to it. First lets cover the messages and/or symbolism, hidden or maybe not so hidden as long as you can... think. I don't want to give it away but one of the `hidden' features has to do with the fact that some people that saw this movie and then see my review will say `What does he mean, he likes the `real feeling' of the movie? They don't even have German or Russian accents!!' BINGO For those of you who say this, you are a `As long as its entertaining' moviegoer(layman) and although you will also think this is an excellent movie, guess what ? You didn't get it!! Or maybe you didn't understand the use of, or think it was right to use women and children in this movie, well all I can say is `strike two. Do you want to go for strike three?' This is just 1 example of a hidden message that is present throughout the movie.( not even the major one) So anyone reading this, like a friend said to me `Al, You don't go to a movie just to watch it, do you?' I will say to you, `neither should you!! And if you do, shame on you.' Now as I stated before the action and twists will have the layman moviegoer enjoying this movie as much as I did. You know how you turn to someone your with and say this is going to happen and that is going to happen and then boast `how do I know? because I wrote the script. Ha Ha' well you'll end up with egg on your face like I did! Even the part with the boy, which becomes semi-predictable, is at first hard to figure out.(At first I thought he was going to do what they tell the mother he does at the end) Yes that's right, just when you think the movie will end one way or another, it doesn't. There is also lots of shooting and shells blowing up and bodies everywhere (in fact the beginning is very similar and comparable to `Ryan' , which is of course important in a war movie. But remember girls this is not just a `war' movie so please don't miss it. But truthfully ladies this also is NOT A ROMANCE as I have sometimes seen it wrongly billed. I am not a critic that likes to tell you the movie while critiquing it(DON'T READ this next line if you don't want to know one part of the movie) but the relationship between Jude, Fiennes and Weisz is another symbol of the class struggle going on throughout the movie(oops gave up 1 of those `thinking' aspects of the movie) and is NOT A ROMANTIC ONE, ie, the part where Jude is writing letters back to his `fans' and is being corrected his misspellings by Fiennes as we find out Weisz is an ex university student and owns hundreds of books.(where will she fall? On the side of the proletariat/fascist(Fiennes,Harris,Hoskins) or with the bourgeois(Law). It is a great war movie that has symbolism and meaning which happens to put you through a lot of emotions, and therefore, is for one and all. And as for the part earlier where I said this movie has a `real feeling' to it, due to not wanting to give away any more of the symbolisms of this excellent movie, I wont elaborate on the reality of war.(hint, hint)In fact the only criticism I have for this movie is that there could have been a better script(only for dialogue sake) written. But if you want dialogue go rent `The English Patient.' This is a `Theater see' rated movie.Theater See: good enough to spend the extra Matinee See: Good enough to see on a rainy afternoonVideo See: Don't `set yourself up for disappointment' at the TheaterMaybe see: Don't waste your time, it'll be on T.V. someday....or not.Don't see: Don't even think about it!</fullReview>

You've got Jude Law, with British accent, playing a Russian sniper. Ed Harris playing a German sniper. And in between is Joseph Fiennes playing a Russian propaganda officer. This film was based on a true story and it would've been a great film if they just would've stuck to the history. But, No...We've gotta go trotting off into romance land (teen territory). That's where it gets boring. I don't know how the Russians won with Jude Law. He's such a wussy character. He leads no one. Ed Harris plays his role as the REAL sniper to a tee. A little bit too aristocratic perhaps but he still overshadows Law.This film is forgettable. **And IMDB people are saying this is a subpar film and still giving it an 8?

		<shortDescription>simply awesome war movie - one trying to capture the human emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have watched this movie more than 10 times and every time I have started liking it even more. First half hour of the movie is as stunning (or horrifying) as can be for a war movie, with young soldiers just out of their teens, moving towards an unknown destination, unaware of their fate/destiny, most of the times even unaware of the cause they are fighting for, forced to fight an enemy with superior arms. The way the human emotion has been portrayed is simply amazing - Danilov's liking (or lust) for Tania, for the same reason his envy and jealousy towards Vassili who was once his best friend, Sacha's believe in Vassili's victory, König's one eyed focus to get rid of Vassili.Generally, war movies lack in the thing that they show just story of one side. This movie prominently deals with the story of Russians, but there is a genuine effort to tell about Germans too. Definitely, this is a story of real people (and heroes) in a real war. An amazing performance by all the actors - Jude Law, Ed Harris, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and young Gabriel Thomson - and above all by director Jean-Jacques Annaud. Kudos to all of them.</fullReview>

But the nitty-gritty cat and mouse duel does leave you at the edge of your seat at times .There's love , there's suffering and there's Vassili . What's missing is some Vodka , Caviar and Emotion ! Blood and gore portrayed in this movie just make a vain effort to jut out an emotional bullet aimed at depicting the realities of war . However , this concoction does produce fine performances out of Vassili err.......Jude Law( He was that good ) , Ed Harris and Rachel Wiesz .

		<shortDescription>Americans crack me up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love hearing comments about things the average American knows next to nothing about.A) The movie was loosely based on a short segment of the novel "Enemy at the Gates" (which referred to the Wermacht approaching the city) by William Craig, in which the duel between Vaili Zaitsev and the German Uber sniper is played out in the course of a page and a half.B) The truly epic proportions and consequences of The Battle for Stalingrad are under-appreciated by most non-Europeans. At one point, the Wermacht had the Red army backed up to the Volga in a stretch of land a mere 100 meters wide and less than a mile long. Had the Wermacht been able to drive the Russians from their beach head (the boat landing)and into the river, that would have been it. The Volga had always been the final objective of Hitler's war machine in the East. When Bob Hoskins said "If this city falls the whole country will collapse", he was not exaggerating. Therefore, due to the 'heroic' example of Vasili Zaitsez, which agruably could have been an inspiriation point for the embattled Soviets and their Red army, it could have caused them to take pride in their country and Army and defeat the battle-hardened 6th army (the line between fact and Party propaganda has always been blurry, so it is possible Vasili Zaitsev could have never existed). If the Red army had not launched Operation Uranus, which slashed through the less-than-reliable German allies guarding the city's flanks (the Italins, Rumanians and other axis lesser powers) and cut off the the 6th, Stalingrad would have fallen and at that point, the Wermacht would have been able to regroup its forces and smash the Red army and we would be living in an entirely different world. Until the fall of Communism, the exact death count in Stalingrad was a forbiden subject and it has since been estimated to be over a million KIA russians. The average survival time for a fresh Russian private in Stalingrad was less than 24 hours.C) In response to the statement that the scope of the Battle for Stalingrad was not evident in the movie, you have to consider that by the time Zaitsev had been elevated to master sniper, the worst of the battle had already occured and it had devolved into small-unit level street fighting. The prescence of snipers on both sides was a constant concern and your life could have been snuffed out in an instant. The scope of the battle was constantly demonstrated throughout the movie by the level of devestation inflicted on the once beautiful and modern city. Keep in mind that prior to the 6th army's advance INTO the city, it had undergone the largest artillery and air bombardment of the war to date.C) I want Americans to understand 1 thing. In WW2, the approximate loss of American fightng men was 500,000. A half a million. Sounds like alot. About the population of a medium sized US city(Mesa, Arizona boasts a population of 330,000 in season). On the Russian side, losses numbered closer to 16,000,000 civilian and military. Think about that. For every GI, marine, airman or sailor the US lost in WW2, the soviets lost approximatley 32 men, women, or children. 16 million, thats about the combined total of both NYC and LA. Incredible, huh?? Also, the Red army, which came back from what would be intolerable losses to Americans, at the outset of the war, was able to turn its fortunes around and push the finest army of it's day from the Volga to Berlin...back over 1,000 miles!!! So, next time an American says "We won the war" think to yourself that all we did was take enough heat off the russians to help THEM win the war. Chew on that.D) The love triangle portrayed between Zaitsev and Tatiyana was an obvious attempt to draw women into the theatre. However, it is a well known fact that women fought in the Red Army alongside their male counter-parts and ANYWHERE you put men and women into extraordinary situations such as this, love/sex/romance is gonna happenOverall, I felt that Enemy at the Gates was an excellent movie despite its oversights in editing, (on more than one occasion the same 'extra' was seen falling from the same wound). I also belive that it would have been more appropriatley entitled "War of the Rats" (Rattenkrieg in german)a novel released in '99 (or '97 not sure) which was exclusively about the sniper duel in question. I went to see this movie expecting an epic story about Stalingrad. Initially, I was disapointed to see a movie about a small number of people in the most epic battle in modern history. However, upon buying the VHS and watching it again, I appreciated the movie for what it was. An excellent story of an epic struggle between 2 marksman.</fullReview>

The film tells of a Soviet war hero and sniper (Law) who squares off against a dogged adversary and top German sniper (Harris) providing the suspense and intrigue. The love story is played out like a clumsy after-thought and the use of big name stars for box office bucks when many good European actors could have added realism to the film was a typically self-serving Hollywood decision. Hoskins playing Khrushchev with his limey accent was laughable not to mention Harris as a German or Law as a Soviet and no attempt to fake an accent by anyone. A typical could-have-been-better flick which will entertain the masses and make the money mongers of filmdom happy while movie purists grumble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I took the road lessed traveled and actually liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the abundance of people who've commented on this movie, I loved it. Yes, it did have historical inaccuracies but what movie doesn't? It's called HISTORICAL FICTION not a historical documentary. The movie was very entertaining. From the beginning, I was sucked into the plot and seemed to feel every emotion every character was feeling. Joseph Fiennes once again does a great job in playing a very complicated, confused character. I thought Jude Law did an excellent job playing Vassili especially since he's usually seen portraying spoiled little rich boys. It was a great move for him by expanding his horizons and not being a one-role man (such as Michael Douglas or Richard Gere). I loved being able to see a different aspect in the war. It was cool being able to see a war movie without America being involved in it at all. It was also interesting to see Russia's war tactics at the beginning of the movie and how'd they kill their own men if they retreated at all. Working fear into fear i guess. I also liked looking through the eyes of a sniper in WWII. Seeing how they work was very interesting to me. Once again, this movie made me realize how stupid and unnecessary war is in the world. Yes, I must admit, it's entertaining with the gore and special effects, but in real life it's ten times worse than in the movies and they're REAL people being killed. I liked how they added in Bob Hoskins (one of the most underrated actors of all time) into the cast. He added a little comedic relief and it was a pleasure to see him again. Anyways, I fell in love with this movie from the getgo and although most of the commentators hate this movie, it's still rated high (7.5 out of 10) on the users' rating which means most of the people liked it anyway so I'm not alone I guess. I've been recommending this to all my family friends and will continue to see all the movies made with Law and Fiennes in them since they are the biggest up and coming actors of our time and it's fun to see them grow in experience. So overall I liked this movie although the love scene could have been omitted but the love triangle furthered the plot and made it more interesting to me. 9 out of 10 *'s</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this was a very bad movie. However, enough has been written about that. What is really stupid, though, is the complaints I'm reading about the accents. The Brit accent is fine, as long as everyone in the movie sticks to it. When a Russian speaks to a Russian in real life, they don't speak with a Russian accent. The accent would be regional, and the star of the movie would probably have a 'lower class' accent.The director chose to use a British accent to convey the class differences.To have given everyone a false Russian accent would have stunted the actors' performances and made the dialogue much more robotic, as well as difficult to follow.This is a complete red herring, which distracts from the awfulness of the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutality Versus Lies: Lies Always Wins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is what theatrical people think war is like: every day is interesting, the conflict centers on certain people, guile is everywhere, love always penetrates, and the sets are lush. Those sets deserve mention. They are deep, multitiered confused jumbles of life. The pieces are big enough to recognize and consist more of objects rather than unrecognizable rubble. I was charmed. This was more a model of an unconscious than a ruin.I was also impressed with how this film began, how it swept you into the center of a story so seamlessly. This is where `Private Ryan' failed so miserably, and few films have been as adept at transporting us (literally here) into another world. Then they larded it up with a bunch of Hollywood plot machinery. But the first part is good.Here's a problem: these actors are competent, but the director tolerated so many different visions of projection, the ensembles never coalesce. Weisz (here made up to look alarmingly like Kate Winslet) acts with her breath. Fiennes gears every line to an emphatic pause, as if the text itself had character. Law emotes.The titles (which also appear during the action) are in a Soviet heroic industrial font. It is accurate (actually from the 30's) but doesn't mesh well with the style of the film proper, which seems to have little to do with Russia itself. British accents? I spent the day with a Russian, here on a short visit, to remind myself how different they really are. These characters adopt no eastern European mannerisms.There didn't seem to be any hunger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another historical misconception from Hollywood to demonize Communism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may say, for those who just want to get entertainment and see a war movie, this will do fine, it is good enough for a nice evening.For those seeking the historical truth, this movie is an outrageous shame, constantly trying to divert the attentions to facts that really didn't matter at all, if we do a transparent analysis.The Director spent all his time worried about demonizing the Russians and Stalinism, rather than demonizing the true villains (germans) and emphasizing the glorious role of the red army at world war II. If the Germans had passed Stalingrad, they would hit the Caucasus petroleum fields paralyzing the Russians, and the result would probably be the victory of Nazism, and we wouldn't probably be here today. Besides, not a single fact about Stalingrad's importance was shown. Do you know that 2 million Russians died on this battle alone, Mr Director? (That number is, by itself, 4 times bigger than the number of American casualties in the whole Western front). And let's just not refer that 25 million Russians were killed, close to 80% of the total WWII casualties!But hell no Mr Director, it doesn't matter that the invaders were the Germans, it doesn't matter the brutal massacre of the Soviet people by the Nazis, it doesn't matter the heroic role at Stalingrad that probably saved the whole world. Those facts don't matter! Yeah, let's just show instead how the Russians were brutal and how the Russians forced and killed their own soldiers, because Communism is bad! Such an effort was made to highlight "the Communist assassins", "forcing and killing their own soldiers", that it becomes a ridiculous shame:1) First of all, this turns out to be historically FALSE. All records show that all Russians showed a tremendous will to fight, and they were not forced. Women, elders, crippled, everybody wanted to fight! There are German diary's telling how they were impressed by the Russian resistance, and numerous reports of heroic civilians. But NO, NO, NO. The Russians just won the war by throwing people in like meat.2) Second, Killing deserters? Where is the surprise of this Mr Director? Americans did it. Canadians did it. Frenchmen did it... Everybody did it, you know why? IT'S WAR! And we are talking about the most ferocious battle in the history of mankind! Oh, but I guess it is so easy to criticize acts like this when we are sited in a big comfortable Hollywood chair smoking a Cuban cigar ...And not only giving this false image about the Russians turned to be a big lie in this movie, but also the description of the battle. Let me explain this to you, Mr. Director ... This was the most atrocious, merciless human fighting ever. Still, you found time for a romance between a pretty boy and a pretty girl, for a hot shot Hollywood stardom for the main character, and in between some lovely chats with lovely families, inside some lovely Russian houses. In true Stalingrad, this just didn't happened. We are talking about a city in constant street to street fighting, both sides desperately trying to control every possible inch. We are talking about hunger, about sleeping half awake fearing a stab, about temperatures decreasing to -50 degrees, about constant ambushes, constant shooting. This movie doesn't show 20% of the true image of the battle.In conclusion: Mr Director: you may hate communism, you may hate Russians, OK, everybody has its own ideology. But you know what? Histoy is history. Distorting the truth is very, very serious, especially to the people of Russia, that have reasons to feel outraged by this. But hey, how am I surprised? After all,this is an American movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Moscow is sunshine in L.A. ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this old Chris de Burgh song, an ironic one ? I would just say, quite a sweet and a nice one ? those meaningful words are solemnly spoken by an American spy on night out in a bar in Moscow; this one realises like nobody's business a truism as old as the hills: thou wouldn't grasp Russia with mind, but thou fool, no living man may hinder Russia as it is able to ruin anyone with its love? No way, a Westerner would not grasp 'mystifying Russian soul', but since Russia, like it or not, as fate of history had willed it and at the price of several tens of millions of lives, assured the undisputed runners-up title in the world order, subjects of pragmatic and liberal Western world have nothing to do but to have little liking for and, rather, a dread of, that second-place echelon which breathes down their necks. That is about par for the course, so humanly: disliking one's rivals, grudging neighbours their success? And if it came to pass, competitive neighbours lead their lives not exactly what one understand by 'civilised development' ? the Lord himself, however culpable it would sound, has commanded to detest them!But hey, all the aforesaid is indeed a truism as old as the hills! Why then folks in Russia are jumping on a Western film about them?! Where have all those faultfinders not gone over: from Red Army insignia discrepancy to error of fact regarding Khrushchev; from ethnic dissimilarity causing Western actors' inability to play Russians ? to scriptwriters' unawareness of Stalingrad Tractor Plant layout plan? I could have defeated each point completely; could have given such a rebuke to each one, that each one would realise one's criticism would not stand up to criticism itself (to make a clean breast of it ? their criticism isn't worth a tinker's curse!), but I would rather dwell on just two moments of truth. Just those very things (again, that is about par for the course) arouse indignation of those who get indignant at the film's dubious scenes and forget the saying 'if the cap fits, wear it'. That is: barrier troops in operation and bawdiness as between the male and female protagonists?Now listen to this, misters, if you got enraged when Western film-makers had shown too literal sense of war, moreover ? of the most awful war of all times (this sense is: if you have been called up for fighting for your land, but chicken out, then you would better have both hands run over by a tram, otherwise you will have to hurl yourself at the enemy and not to retreat in confusion), that means not only that you have never been to war, but have not been interested in it. Or have always taken a rose-coloured view of war ? as if it were something like an amusing shooting game. Like Wolfenstein, the extravagant plot of which ? an American superhero overwhelms Hitler the robot ? BTW, was so popular that just that very action game got rise to one of computer game main genres altogether, a 3D action. Well, I understand those who prefer living blissfully unaware of what the world order really is: witnesses are to be rubbed out! The present writer has never been to war but belongs to currently combatant nation, Russia. As Donbass War is in fact a moment of truth in its own manner: slyboots are being unmasked, righteous indignation is being reasoned, hackneyed existential fear tends to well up within; and finally, it is now turn of cynical and odious propaganda masterminds, who sooner or later, put a question with an edge to everyone: Who are you with, daredevil? He that is not with his nation is against it, thus a public enemy, thus subject to repressions.And as for casual sex among the bodies of soldiers sleeping side by side ? it is 'elementary, my dear Watson' (as Sherlock Holmes would say) at all. I hold in high respect centuries-old culture of Christianity, where one must love none but god and, a fortiori, even the idea of desecrating the battlefield with sexual behaviour is impermissible! But isn't it high time for the fig-leaf to to go out of fashion?! You whom it sickens, turn aside. But you would neither deny that there was still sex at the Eastern Front! And indeed, many women cohabited with rear staff officers and took sulphapyridine (they believed ability to cause unwanted child's misbirth of that remedy for infection) on the sly while their husbands were dying on active service.However, I am going to bat for the film I used to watch more than once and still honour, not to vex those who, seemingly, treat it as untouchable. I just want to thank the West in these latter days of extraordinarily dramatic events for it, notwithstanding the unremitting animosity towards us, pays a tribute to us as to the potential adversary No 1 and shoots (attention! ? first and foremost, for domestic market, thus for forming public opinion in their own countries!) high-budget films, where it is not an American flag that is waved, but a Soviet one. And thus a film-goer supports not Rambo, who kills thugs, who weari Soviet uniform, outright and on the spot, but the high-minded Soviet sniper Vasily Zaytsev who, notwithstanding all the totalitarian atrocities of his Motherland, loves it and shoots his coarse rifle accurately killing the invading aliens, who wear full-dress uniform and declaim with bombast that they came to 'exempt Russia from Jewish political instructors and that bloody Stalin, the arsonist and the murderer'?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jude Law at the Gates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates (2001): Dir: Jean-Jacquacs Annaud / Cast: Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz, Ron Perlman: Skillful opening sequence features an experience sniper killing three German officers just by timing the shots perfectly. Title regards competitive minds of two individuals who are skilled at what they do. It is about knowing your opponent's next move. The sniper is celebrated thanks to a journalist who makes him a printed hero. An enemy sniper is sent to counter every move and his methods of retrieving information are sneaky. Great setup reduced to repetition and a violent climax that seems poised to happen. Director Jean-Jacquacs Annaud tenses everything thus creating a much better film than his dimwitted Seven Years in Tibet. Jude Law is fantastic as a sniper whose job is horrible and his mere survival is everyone's hope. Joseph Fiennes as the journalist hopes to encourage people with his articles on this individual although one wonders whether one fatal decision is necessary. Ed Harris is terrific as the rival sniper determined to destroy Law. Rachel Weisz plays a woman torn between two males but unlike the dreadful Pearl Harbor, this broadens as oppose to distract the plot. Ron Pearlman is assigned to accompany Law but the sniper proves to intelligent and skilled thus spelling the end for Perlman. Theme of talents and abilities given perfect aim here.

		<shortDescription>Pointless Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing that 'Enemy at the Gates' features the rarely shown WWII Red Army, I was hoping that it would take a really interesting and thought-provoking look on the war by overcoming the usual Soviet stereotypes and revealing Soviet soldiers and people's beliefs at the time. However, it failed to do any of those things and instead provided us with a cheesy and cliché portrait of war.Right from the beginning, despite the overwhelming battle scenes, you can already feel that there's something not right: the main characters played by Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, and Joseph Fiennes look too clean and too beautiful compared to their supporting cast and surroundings. Jude Law, with his perfectly gelled hair and his blue eyes, looks more like a boy-band member than a soldier. And this image indeed foretells the rest of the movie: it wastes too much time on the cheesy love triangle between the main characters, which feels pointless, and greatly ruins the tension of the movie. All that time should have been spent on actually exploring the war and the Red Army, which is portrayed in a very cliché and over-the-top way. Then there is the battle between Jude Law and Ed Harris' characters. Though it does seems gripping at times, mainly because there have not been a lot of movies focusing on snipers, it is damaged by bad editing and the undermining of Ed Harris' talent. Sequences are usually cut short with details skipped over, making things seem much less dangerous and leaving characters' emotions not fully explored. And Ed Harris' character is just far too bland as he always remains calm throughout the movie.Finally, the biggest problem in my opinion is that characters often seem ridiculously oblivious. For example, there's a scene where Rachel Weisz's character crawls through a vent and finds herself directly above the German base, but somehow, none of the Russians ever decide to use that to their advantages. Or like how the Russians have a spy that has direct contact with Ed Harris's character but only decide to use him after some of their men have been killed. In conclusion, 'Enemy at the Gates' never feels like it's really going anywhere, and is a total waste of its interesting setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War II is a subject that is many times used for movies. Enemy at the Gates is one of the best war films whose story set in World War II. The story takes place during the Battle of Stalingrad. Young Russian soldier Vassili Zaitsev who is a very good sniper, became known throughout the country, thanks to the large number of Germans who were killed and his friend Danilov. His reputation attracted a German sniper Major König, who wants to find out who is better. Vassili before the arrival of Major König had lack of confidence, but after a few clashes with the German sniper, he gets the impression that playing a game where he can not win. The action in the film is good, music too. The acting is good. The choice of actors was really great. The film was very well done, is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my top ten war movies; it shares the experience of Stalingrad without being letter-perfect historically. The depiction is horrifying, the reality was much worse. Yes, Krushchev was there, was handing out rifles, and was a commander/party aparatchik in the city. His likeness on Bob Hoskins blew me away. Tanks rolled out of the factory, unpainted and with no sights and entered the battle only blocks away. The carnage was unmatched in the history of warfare, perhaps exceeded only by Verdun which was actually shorter. Only about 5000 Germans survived from the 6th German Army when they were sent back to Germany in 1955. This was a turning point in the Eastern front, the War and the History of the World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War of the rats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're in the mood for a really good war flick you can't go wrong with 2001's "Enemy at the Gates." Most WWII films take place on the Western Front whereas "Enemy" is one of only two films I can think of that address the Eastern front, the other being Sam Peckinpah's underrated "Cross of Iron" (1977).THE PLOT: The entire story takes place during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad. Russian troops are carted in by the literal trainloads as the Germans attack/bomb the city. Once the dust clears the situation settles into a more personal battle of sharpshooting wills. A lowly young Russian soldier named Vassili (Jude Law) distinguishes himself for his shooting skills and is promoted as a national hero to motivate the Russian cause. After numerous German officers are assassinated Major König (Ed Harris), the top German sniper, is assigned to seek out and eliminate Vassili.I saw this film back when it was first released to video and three things stuck in my mind over the years: (1.) The opening sequence where the Russian troops are boated across the Volga River to join the fight. This sequence is just extremely harrowing, even more so than Saving Private Ryan's opening D-Day invasion. This is definitely one of the most realistic, well-done scenes in war film history. The film's worth viewing for this incredible sequence alone! (2.) The city-in-rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurrying-like-rats-through-the-rubble warfare. (3.) Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet love-making scene while the soldiers laid in the rubble trying to sleep. I'm not sure why this left an impression, maybe because it struck me as so real -- men &amp; women would be drawn to one another and mate even in the worst possible scenarios.I just saw the film a second time recently and, again, the warfare reminded me of human rats scurrying through the debris. What's interesting is that I later discovered that the film was based on the book "War of the Rats" by David L. Robbins. Guess the movie was supposed to provoke the imagery of rats, huh? The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as the political officer who elevates Vassili to hero status via his pamphlets and articles, while Rachel Weisz plays the romantic interest between the two. Ron Perlman is also on hand in a limited role as Vassili's sharpshooting comrade.As with any film based on historical events there are facts-obsessed critics who decry the lack of authenticity in this or that detail (e.g. "The zippers on the trousers aren't right -- blasphemy!!", but "Enemy" gets the gist right and, besides, it motivates the viewer to research the actual Battle of Stalingrad, at least this is what it did for me. What more can you ask for? The fact is Vassili played a key role in motivating the Russians to victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, one of the major turning points of World War II; from then on it was all downhill for Germany.FINAL WORD: "Enemy at the Gates" is a truly unforgettable war film about an oft-ignored important aspect of WWII, the Eastern front. It has numerous memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass. In my humble opinion the film's far better than the contemporaneous "Saving Private Ryan" (I'm sure I'll get a handful of 'non-helpful' votes for that sacrilegious' statement).GRADE: B+ or A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still remember the first time I saw this movie in my pre-teenhood, and I remember how important of a piece of film it became. From the intense intro going into the creation of Jude Law's character into a hero, I loved it all the way through. It ushered into me a small fascination with things related to WWII and Russian themed music. I still remember the soundtrack of this movie though I haven't seen it in a couple years. I wasn't too big of a fan of the forced love story between Jude Law's character and Rachel Weisz's character. I also felt the way that Jude Law's character is thought dead wasn't that important to the way the story played out. Other than that, I felt the climactic final battle between Jude Law and Ed Harris' characters was also appropriate. It was one of the most selfless acts when Joseph Fiennes took the bullet to reveal Ed Harris in the final duel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your jaw drops as you see Russian recruits charging German lines in Stalingrad, and then being shot by their own when they try to retreat. You know this film is going to show a carnage of the greatest magnitude. Amidst the carnage, Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) meets Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a man with deadly aim. When Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) visits, Danilov proposes that they use all means to promote Vassili's skill to increase the morale of the people. Soon, like Sergeant York, his legend grows throughout Stalingrad, and the people are temporarily happy. As Khrushchev says, "Vodka is a luxury we have, caviar is a luxury we have, time we do not have." The problem is that the German bring in Major König (Ed Harris) to find Vasilli. Konig is just as good as Vasilli, maybe better, and a cat and mouse game begins. The always lovely Rachel Weisz is there, and Danilov is pursuing her aggressively, while Vasilli looks on longingly. Another contest? Danilov and König prove they are above nothing in their quest for glory, even setting up one for a kill, or killing a child. One hopes for the end of both of them. A very satisfying story about a Hero of the Soviet Union.</fullReview>

If you're looking for something that would give you a good idea of Stalingrad, this movie is not it. As a piece of entertainment, it is average, although the dialog was, as previously mentioned, below satisfactory. Intellectual statements are present as well, which gives the impression that the movie was more meant as a mockery, although that's not its intention. The names given to characters are nothing but names, the characters do not represent the real people. False myths are persistent in the movie, such as the myth that there was 1 rifle per 2 people, although that's not true. I must stress the fact that this movie is not meant as a biographical piece.

		<fullReview>Being a bit of a history buff I had high hopes for this movie but it let me down, it was just average on almost every level.The first 15 minutes or so is actually fairly eye opening, but the film doesn't kick on from there and slowly gets more dull as it progresses.The set is spectacular, but that's the end of the good news. The script felt like it was written in a day, it's completely void of wit and is barely insightful, I could've been watching a bad TV movie. The acting suffers as a result and none of the main cast shines, Ed Harris especially was wasted his character is badly developed and despite being the main bad guy we know almost nothing about him.The soundtrack is disappointingly dull and forgettable, the only up side is it is numbingly sappy so it fits in with the rest of the movie.So that's it, a blown opportunity to tell a great story about Stalingrad, Enemy At The Gates is ordinary from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film with some great set piece battle scenes involving hundreds of extras; it does look quite epic in places. I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen, I'm sure it was quite impressive. The music was pretty good; mainly relying on great sweeping themes throughout it did put me in mind of another epic war film set in Russia. All the performances were very good with Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris standing out for me. It was one of those films that was good, with ambitions of being great but never quite getting there. Sadly I felt that the love triangle got in the way, a bit, of a decent war film. I say 'sadly' because I thought Rachel Weisz was particularly good in this one. Over all though, I found it a bit too long but still quit a decent watch.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.3/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth comes knocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Jean-Jacques Annaud's "Enemy at the Gates" is an exciting and visually stunning film, you have to wonder how much of it was based on fact.Particularly those scenes of the Russian reinforcements heading towards Stalingrad under withering fire from the Germans, driven forward by maniacal commissars and an intense James Horner score. They make a hopeless attack on the Germans although many are unarmed. When the survivors fall back, they are cut down by their own machine guns because they failed to obey Stalin's order of no retreat. You might be forgiven for thinking that those machine guns would have been more useful further forward facing the Germans instead.It seems that the Russians embraced "Enemy at the Gates" in 2001 about as warmly as the French embraced Kubrick's "Paths of Glory" in 1958.It doesn't take much Googling to discover that the film received a deluge of complaints from men and women who had fought at Stalingrad. The veterans were upset that Soviet soldiers were portrayed as unthinking executors of the orders of their officers and viewed simply as cannon fodder; one group wanted it banned in Russia.Recent histories by Anthony Beevor and Max Hastings acknowledge that the Red Army did not shrink from executing its own men, but they also chronicled that many Russian soldiers displayed great courage, skill, and esprit de corps. Most records of the battle of Stalingrad make the point that, formidable as the Germans were, the Russians eventually outperformed them in the street fighting ? only well-led and self-reliant soldiers could have achieved that.Over-emphasising certain elements at the expense of others left Annaud open to the charge that he had pandered to stereotypical views as to what motivated Russian soldiers to fight in WW2. But to be fair, Annaud didn't make a blow-by-blow account of the Battle of Stalingrad, he made an interesting, technically brilliant movie, which has an absorbing duel at its centre, and although a number of the characters are based on fact others are fictional.The film tells the story of Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who becomes a famous sniper during the battle. A political officer, Commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), recognises his potential as a propaganda tool. As his fame grows, the Germans send their own super-sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to eliminate him. They play out their duel in the ruins of Stalingrad.Among other characters, is Tania Chernova a female soldier played by Rachel Weisz who brightens her drab military look with beautifully applied eyebrow liner and glossy red lipstick ? running the risk of drawing too much attention in the trenches, and not just from the Germans.Sacha Filipov is a boy who befriends not only Zaitsev but also Major Konig. Of all the characters, Sacha is the most difficult to accept. He exists in the film like the boy next door ? to both sides. He is involved in plans and actions that stretch credulity. He also has a perfect English accent, as do many of the actors who play Russians. I found this aspect took some getting used to with my ears finely attuned to at least six decades of Hollywood Russian accents along the lines of Boris and Natasha from the "Rocky and Bullwinkle Show". Bob Hoskins, who plays Nikita Khrushchev, adopts an accent that seems more seamless and Ed Harris's American accent is altogether less jarring.For those who appreciate the influence movies can have on people's perception of history, the film does pose a few awkward questions. However, one Russian observer, aware of the dissatisfaction of his country's veterans, nonetheless thought the movie shouldn't be banned because it still showed that they had won in the end, and that was the most important thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does it seem like there are few WWII films like "Enemy at the Gates" that look at what Russia experienced during that war?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how most movies revolving around World War II usually focus on the battles taking place in either Germany or Japan? With Jean-Jacques Annaud's 2001 war drama "Enemy at the Gates", we get to look at battles taking place in a country that surprisingly seems to be glanced over in the crowded genre of WWII films, Russia. For all the territory that Russia claims now and considering how much that country was affected by the war, you would think that more WWII movies would be made about Russia than there actually are. I guess it sounds like there isn't much to see, but let's take a look at what we've got. Our main character is a Russian sniper (Jude Law) who is sent to the front lines of the Battle of Stalingrad to battle against the invading Germans. We learn from the first scene that this particular sniper was taught by his grandfather to shoot a rifle when he was a kid. Naturally because of his practice when he was young, he is able to save the lives of both himself and a political officer (Joseph Fiennes) due in large part to his rifle skills. As a result of the sniper's actions, the political officer decides to make the sniper a heroic icon for the nation to look up to during the war and raise the army's confidence. Between the propaganda for him going well, the other Soviet snipers wiping out the Germans, and his relationship with a fellow Russian women (Rachel Weisz), everything seems to be going well for the sniper. That is until the head (Ed Harris) of a German Army sniper school is sent into Russia to take him out. The rest of the film in a way becomes a game of cat-and-mouse between these two snipers from opposing forces as they try to take each other out. It's refreshing to see a war film in which the focus of the story isn't on many people from one side battling other people from another side. It's instead on one person from each side trying to take each other out, especially when it deals with snipers. There's a well-directed scene in which the German sniper has the Russian sniper trapped behind a refrigerator. If the Russian sniper tries to run to either side, he'll pretty much be dead. But his love interest just happens to come in to notice that he's completely screwed and they need to come up with a plan to outsmart the sniper. All I'll say about that scene is see it for yourself since it's a great example of suspense in a war picture. I also liked the musical score by James Horner and how it made everything feel epic and very important. Ed Harris does a good job with his performance as the German sniper and having convincing sniping skills. In my opinion, he plays the best character in the entire flick. However, I can't say that the other characters are boring by any means since they're all okay at best. It would have been nice if the film showed more regarding how this sniper became more famous through the press and showed us at least some of the other sniping missions he allegedly went on. Besides the main antagonist, the characters seem pretty basic personality wise. There isn't a whole lot to these characters in terms of their depth. Then there's some war movie clichés that this film is guilty of having. Chief among them, the characters having no Russian accents so much as English accents and practically speaking the English language more so than Russian. There's also some tired plot clichés like someone appearing to be dead even though they later come back to life that take away from the experience a bit. "Enemy at the Gates" isn't a classic war flick, but I think it's pretty good for what it is. It looks at a part of World War II that is otherwise inexplicably glossed over in Hollywood, it has plenty of thrilling scenes like the one I was describing earlier, it has a good score, and the villain isn't bad either. That's enough for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action-Packed War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In late 1941 the German Army was crushing everything in sight and was moving deep into Russian territory. Then they came to Stalingrad, and despite the fact that they continued to inflict heavy casualties upon the Russian Army (and Russian civilians), they couldn't break through to the other side of the Volga River. So, with both sides dug in behind every rock and crevice, the snipers took over. On the Russian side was a young soldier named "Vassili Zaitzev" (Jude Law) who became legendary due to the efforts of a comrade by the name of "Commisar Danilov" (Joseph Fiennes) who happened to work for the propaganda department of the Communist Party. On the German side was "Major Konig" (Fred Harris) who was perhaps the best sniper in all of Germany. But this story goes much deeper than that as it is filled with intrigue, drama and tragedy. Now, being an American it is difficult for me to really cheer for either side as they were both led by evil murderous tyrants. But this is a story more about human courage and sacrifice than it is about any specific evil person or ideology. And that is what makes this film so compelling. The action was plentiful but unlike so many other "action films" this one had good acting as well. I especially liked the performances of Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes. But in any case, this is a movie that should definitely appeal to those who enjoy an action-packed war film. Definitely above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opening to understanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies in America about World War 2 focus on the American struggles and battles which includes heart-breaking, gut-wrenching films such as Pearl Harbor, Saving Private Ryan, and Flags of Our Fathers that all do a great job of showing parts of the war that the U.S. troops went through. These films cover history from the start of the war (Pearl Harbor), up to the turning points in Europe (Saving Private Ryan) and the Pacific (Flags of Our Fathers). Those who are old enough to see these movies also have been taught in school about the horrors and struggles that American soldiers went through in this time, but not many know what happened for the Russians. If you are curious to see what it was like for the Russians in WW2, or just simply enjoy war movies, then I strongly recommend that you see Enemy at the Gates.The film takes place at the Battle for Stalingrad where the German army is met by the citizens of Stahlingrad who mount a final resistance against the invaders. In the opening scenes, a political officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), hides among the dead in a fountain at the square after scrambling for his life. To his surprise, he finds Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) hiding amongst the bodies as well. Vassili quickly makes waste of several Germans as the two of them escape and become best friends. Danilov depicts Vassili to being a war hero through the newspaper as they print stories about Vassili's triumphs as a Russian sniper to inspire their comrades. In turn, the Germans send out their best sharpshooter, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to hunt down Vassili in order to crush the Russian hope. It turns into a showdown between the snipers throughout the movie as the two try to kill each other. Vassili and Danilov both fall in love with the beautiful soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz), but when Danilov becomes jealous of Vassili and Tania; he abandons Vassili in the struggle to defeat Major Konig. The film does a great job of showing how inhumane the Russians were at times along with how terrible the living conditions were for them. In the beginning of the movie, the Russian army launches an all-out attack on the awaiting Germans. It only turns into a massacre as Russian soldiers are shot by the Germans and by their own officers if they attempted to retreat. The special effects and gore in the scene do a great job of showing how awful it was for the soldiers as blood splattered from bullet holes and limbs flew through the air from bombs. Some Russian officers were forced to commit suicide after being out matched by the Germans. It's just so interesting to see what those men and women had to go through just within their own army, not to mention the fact that the Germans were trying to kill as well. In the movie, everyone speaks English in their normal voice and there are no Russian accents. At first people might say that it causes the movie to not be as effective because it's sort of far-fetched that everyone speaks English in Russia. This isn't the case. People don't feel alienated when they watch the movie because everyone in it speaks English and it makes the audience feel like they are a part of the movie which is what the point of the film is. This wouldn't be the same if all the characters had Russian accents. In the end, what you get is a high quality, heart-wrenching film that leaves the viewer feeling all sorts of emotions throughout the movie. It really makes you understand and feel for the sacrifice that those men and women made to counteract German tyranny and it's a good counterpart to the other World War 2 movies because it helps us understand our allies in the war. I believe this movie is comparable to Saving Private Ryan and I would definitely rank it in the Top 5 war movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Film About Human Understanding Of Inhuman Conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is a war film starring Joseph Fiennes, Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins and Ed Harris.The story is set during the Battle of Stalingrad in World War II.The film's title is taken from William Craig's 1973 nonfiction book Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad, which describes the events surrounding the Battle of Stalingrad from 1942?1943.The film is based on a duel mentioned in the book that developed between Soviet sniper Vasily Zaitsev,a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig, an expert German sniper who is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary.Meanwhile, Vasily has joined forces with Danilov, a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by his skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both become involved with Tanya, whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition.Then Koenig and Vassily begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together.It generally succeeds at telling a truly heroic story, providing yet another vehicle to showcase the talents of Law and Harris, and of their supporting cast.Atmospheric and thrilling, it gets the look and feel of war right. However, the love story seems out of place as it the love triangle happens to be a poor subplot in this war film.But nevertheless,its theme of human understanding of an inhuman conflict that gives it so much power despite its flaws and defects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard so many great things about this movie up until last year. So when I saw that it was upcoming on my TV guide, I had to set a recording for it. A few nights after that, I watched it and was blown away! I hadn't seen really good war movie in awhile so it really surprised me.One of the best parts of the movie if not the best part is the plot. It definitely has a cat-and-mouse type of feel to it. To me, the sniper part of it makes the movie that much more exciting. Multiple times I found myself with my mouth wide open due to the suspense. Another thing I really liked was the countinuous amount of tricks each sniper pulls on the other. Whoever thought them up was very clever.If I could complain about anything, it would be the inaccuracy of the character's accents. The main characters are supposed to be Russian, but they all speak with an accent that is clearly British. It just felt like the actors weren't smart enough to realize they were playing Russians and not Brits. Oh well, it's not that important but it took away the Russian culture.Overall, it's a great movie to watch, it even has a fictional love story that incorporates more characters and of course a girl... what kind of movie has a cast that consists 100% of male actors right? I would definitely recommend this to anybody that likes war movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Enemy At The Gates' (2001)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Enemy At The Gates' is one of those rare movies where the film sort of tricks the audience into believing that it is better than it actually is. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the film, or that I wasn't entertained, because that is not the case. 'Enemy At The Gates' somehow works, in part because of the cat and mouse game that Jude Law and Ed Harris are involved in, is not typical World War II movie fare. The opening sequence is blatantly ripping off 'Saving Private Ryan' in such a way that one shot might almost be identical, and then Joseph Fiennes and Jude Law are conveniently thrown together and their friendship, like their characters, are left mostly undeveloped. The very beginning gives us a very vague glimpse at Jude Law's character as a child, but that is it. Everything else, the dialogue, the "love triangle" if you could even call it that because Joseph Fiennes is pretty much left out of it, and the little boy with connecting ties to both Soviets and Nazis, all just feel like plot devices to get the movie done and over with, and on to the third act.However, none of this is to say that I'm not entertaining by this, and I have definitely seen 'Enemy At The Gates' more than a couple times. I enjoy Ron Perlman's small role a little bit, and Bob Hoskins is always a pleasure to watch no matter what the hell is going on, and Jude Law and Ed Harris play off one another well; they do not actually see each other until the very ending. Overall, an enjoyable film, but I am disappointed that it feels very half-baked and that some characters were cheated out of some real character development.ENEMY AT THE GATES -----7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hard and gritty and grisly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the film is based on true events, the reality of the film is not in question, I consider the first 20 minutes of the film to be the equivalent of the opening scenes of "Saving Private Ryan" or the battle scenes in "We Were Soldiers". They are hard and gritty and grisly and not for the faint of heart. The pace of the film is quick and steady, and the action builds perfectly, like a well crafted symphony. Fiennes and Law are the perfect halves of the whole, the sniper with the deadly aim and the propagandist with the leader's ear. Hoskins portrayal of Khrushchev gives us an insight to the man he would become, the man who stood in the United Nations pounding his shoe on the podium screaming "We Will Bury You". Rachel is a fine actress and performs well in this film, for a part that is totally unnecessary. But without a love story, we would never get the women into a war film. Anyway, violence alone will keep the kids away, or should, and there is a small and very discretely performed sex scene, but it doesn't last long and doesn't show much. Collectible if you enjoy great war films, as this one certainly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good film, disregard the historical inaccuracies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the film should be viewed as a war drama instead of a historical documentary. The acting is quite good, the plot is nice and the battles shown now and then are not bad. The game series "Call Of Duty" has borrowed a lot of the battle scenes actually, like the one at the beginning of the film is played out in "Call of Duty I" and the scene where Zaitshev takes his first sniping kill is played out in "Call of Duty: World At War". The film has basically two plots: one is the love triangle evolving between the sniper, the commissar and the girl, the other is the competition between Zhaitsev and the German sniper. I very much enjoyed watching the film several times. It's a good and enjoyable drama. A lot of people will say that it is historically inaccurate, and it is, but if you disregard these, you have in your hands a pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and gritty war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates (2001) was co-written and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. The movie takes place during the Battle of Stalingrad, and is based on true historical events. Jude Law plays the soldier Vassili Zaitsev, a Russian peasant who has the skills and the bravery to become the chief sniper for the beleaguered Russian army in Stalingrad. Ed Harris is Major König, the German sniper who was sent to Stalingrad to eliminate Vassili. Both actors are excellent in their roles--Law as the intelligent, but unsophisticated, hunter, and Harris as the worldly, arrogant officer who is also an amazing marksman.All Russian military units were accompanied by political commissars. Joseph Fiennes stars as Commisar Danilov, who befriends Vassili, and who is clever enough to recognize the propaganda value of a heroic Russian sniper. Both he and Vassili are in love with soldier Tania Chernova, played by Rachel Weisz. Bob Hoskins does a brilliant job portraying Nikita Khrushchev, whose career was already on the rise during the battle for the city.The Battle of Stalingrad may have been the most important battle in World War II. However, movies about battles belong on the History Channel. As in "Saving Private Ryan," a war movie must involve us in the lives of the men and women who fought it. Vassili's story does, indeed, involve us. We are involved even more than in other war films, because the story is true. The German army, which at one point controlled 90% of Stalingrad, had totally disintegrated by the time the battle was over. Determined Russian resistance and the Russian winter broke Hitler's army the way they broke Napolean's army. In Napolean's case, a tattered remnant of his army struggled back towards France. When the Battle of Stalingrad was over, there wasn't any German army left to return home. Hitler refused to consider retreat, when retreat was still an option. He told the German soldiers to fight to the last man and the last bullet, and that's what they did.I saw this movie on DVD. It worked well enough, although it would surely have been better on a large screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy at the Gates: Can equality be achieved?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Autumn 1942, under the command of Adolf Hitler, the 3rd Reich is at the height of its power rolling through Europe like a mighty wave of death and destruction. The German offensive has pushed deep into Russia with only the city of Stalingrad left standing in resistance. As Enemy at the Gates begins we are thrown into the chaotic battlefield at Stalingrad on the Volga where the fate of the world is being decided. German air bombings have pummeled Stalingrad to an unrecognizable heap of ruins but the Russians refuse to surrender, their commanding officers are driven by a manic devotion (shooting their own men for deserting) to protecting the motherland and the cause of communism. With morale and hope nearing complete extinction; the Russian army is in desperate need of a catalyst to resurrect nationalistic fervor and pride. Enter Vasilli Zaitsev, (Jude Law) a common foot soldier from rural Russia, who arrives at Stalingrad and unleashes merciless, pin-point precision with the sniper rifle. Witnessing Zaitsev eliminate five German officers in rapid procession, military journalist Danilov has found the hero that will provide hope to a despondent, beleaguered nation. Danilov, proclaims, "Here, the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours. But there's another way. The way of courage. The way of love of the Motherland. We must publish the army newspaper again. We must tell magnificent stories, stories that extol sacrifice, bravery. We must make them believe in the victory. We must give them hope, pride, a desire to fight. Yes... we need to make examples. But examples to follow, like Vasilli Zaitsev". Over-night Zaitsev is transformed into a national hero, his face on every newspaper, with every kill his legend grows. Despite his success, Zaitsev is uncomfortable in the spotlight and begs that Danilov tones down the hyperbolic articles he writes. In response to Zaitsev's rising success, the Germans call in their most prolific sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to eliminate Zaitsev. An elaborate, tactful game of cat and mouse ensues between the two snipers which is highly suspenseful and entertaining. I'm not going to divulge the outcome, I will leave it up to you to discover on your own, but in my opinion the movie is definitely worth watching! Communist ideology, namely equality lies subversively and furtively at the core of Enemy at that Gates. Zaitsev epitomizes the strive for equality throughout the film, at one point he tells Daniliov, "I'm not the only one fighting" , to which Danilov replies, "You're right the worker in the coal mine is just as important to the cause as you". Communism strives for complete equality throughout society no individual is greater than the other; everyone must serve the greater good of society. As the communist adage goes, "Each according to his abilities, each according to his needs", everyone plays a major role in achieving equality. By eliminating private property, and personal wealth, communism purports that it's possible to create a utopia on Earth. Most would agree that pursuit of communism seems relatively pure and worthy, but under closer scrutiny, a major fault is revealed that inhibits perfect equality. There is a fundamental flaw in the human condition that is the antithesis of equality, that defect can be summarized as sin. No matter how earnest man strives, man is tied down by an anchor of sin which drags and halts the pursuit of equality. At the zenith of the film, Danilov has an epiphany and realizes the futility of communist ideology, "I've been such a fool, Vassili. Man will always be a man. There is no new man. We tried so hard to create a society that was equal, where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor. But there's always something to envy. A smile, a friendship, something you don't have and want to appropriate. In this world, even a Soviet one, there will always be rich and poor. Rich in gifts, poor in gifts. Rich in love, poor in love. Man will always have a universal longing for something more that this world cannot offer. To Danilov I would say I agree with your assessment about the human condition, but I would offer him an alternative option. The only way man can transcend his depraved condition, and break the power of sin, is to begin a personal relationship with the creator of the Universe. By throwing God out of the equation, communism eliminated the supreme standard of perfection and equality. God made the ultimate sacrifice by sending His son Jesus, as a sacrifice and remedy to our sins. You might shriek at the mention of religion, but I'm not talking about formalized religion, I'm talking about entering into a relationship with Jesus. Every man-made philosophy on life is faulty; we can never try hard enough or be good enough sin will always get in the way. When accept that we are sinners and believe that Christ's sacrifice cleansed us of our depraved conditions we become new creations. A follower of Christ is not perfect but they are changed and are on a journey to be more like Christ. In this life, utopia will never occur, but true followers of Christ become lights in a dark world spreading the good news and hope of eternal life that lies within them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great watch!! A very well made movie that depicts the story of a great hero and outlines the true events during WW2, when the third-Reich was pressing against a meeker red army at Stalingrad. An excellent example of semi-fiction, the movie's central theme being a battle of human-emotions and the love-for-the-country. Lays out the idea of a true socialistic existence; where the needs of the many outweighs that of one or few. And alternately shows a love triangle between soldiers of the motherland. "Vaslli Zaitsev (Jude Law)"- a simple Russian soldier who is an excellent marksman, becomes a major hurdle for the Germans and a ray of hope for Russia. His abilities as a sniper lead him to finding love in a comrade, jealousy in a friend and a true-adversary in a time when a soldier was just a means to an end.Excellent performances by Jude Law, Ed Harris and others. Great direction, of an unbelievable story of heroism. Overall a marvelous piece of work.movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book, nor did I know much about the real story before watching this. As I understand, however, it is more interesting than this. This actually does start to go for the tension-filled world that is sniping(and may I add, they move excessively in this, Zaitsev in actuality remained still for *days*, ready to fire), with excellent details, but it seems they were afraid to take the full step. Ah, to think of what could have been. There are a couple of impeccable battle sequences, highly intense and engaging. We get a ton of Hollywood crap, including an argument against socialism(because, you know, the masses are not unhappy and living in fear and risk under capitalism; it's the least negative system, not a perfect one), a schmaltzy love triangle, and some "this time, it's personal!"-style conflict. The acting is great. Law, Harris, Weisz and Fiennes all do marvelous in the leads, Perlman is always fun to watch and Hoskins completely *nails* Khrushchev. Production values leave little to be desired; however, the design utterly fails to convey the extreme weather conditions, as well as, for the majority of it, the threat of life near the front lines. Impartiality would have made this a far superior film. Repeating a point of view that the American audience already agrees with isn't impressive. Is the US still that terrified of Communism? A skilled director can put forth the idea that something is right or wrong without bluntly having characters state it. The DVD comes with "additional scenes", varying in length, a theatrical trailer, and two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages. There is a little sexuality, disturbing content and brief brutal violence in this. I recommend this to fans of those involved, and/or war flicks. There are considerably smarter ones out there, though. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works more as fictionalized history than as historical fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vasilli Zaitsiev(Jude Law,rugged features and green eyes a-blazing)becomes a folk hero in be-sieged Stalingrad,1942-43. And it seems perfectly reasonable:the de-moralized and starving locals and Soviet army dispatch is facing the brutal,relentless pressure of the advancing NAzi armies,so a deadly effective sniper who has the German's guessing their ground strategy is naturally gonna be greatly needed. Of course,this walking hero/legend is also all flesh and blood,as he is both being lionized by a local patrician/officer(Joseph Fieenes,looking more and more like Ralph all the time)and carrying a growing torch for a local girl(RAchel Weisz,still radiant through mud,muck and blood)who happens to work the infantry and is fluent in German.That happens to be exactly what an ace marksman and officer in the SS named KOnig(ED HArris,fantastic as the coldly determined,not altogether inhuman German menace)is hoping for,as he scans and scours the streets of the war-torn central Russian town to finish off.HAving just read(More like scanned)a review that had a very dim view of the re-telling of actual historical fact,I think I can say that this movie is(without being nearly as EAgle-eyed as that reviewer)probably more intended to be sheer entertainment rather than a particularly close examination or documentation of the very pivotal and important battle that has by many been thought to be one of the key turning points in WWII. That will leave people who want to see more studious retelling in the cold,and even as pure entertainment will seem a little flat. Still,the characters and situations are just fleshed-out and kept compelling enough that a lesser invested viewer(like myself,for instance) will come away feeling reasonably satisfied,if not "wowed". Director JEan-Jacques Arnaud seems to be content making a much larger pieced of World history a much more intimate and human struggle,and it doesn't make for TOO uncomfortable of a film experience. If one feels much desire to see this at all,it would probably fall pretty safely in the category of "Renter".</fullReview>

The sex scene left a lot to be desired 2. The hanging of the little boy provided a lot of emotional drama 3. The Soundtrack was plain and was over the top of most of the voices 4.

In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated.

		<fullReview>I personally do not know much about the Russian Theatre of war in WWII, or about the Rusian Communist party at the time. So while watching this film, issues that have been raised on boards on IMDb (such as inaccuracies, etc.) really didn't affect me that much. So keep in mind, my opinion of this film is of the film's artistic merits, not historical accuracy.Having said this, I loved this film. Ed Harris, Josph Fiennes, Ron Perlman, Racheal Weisz, and especially Jude Law did great acting jobs. The best thing however, is the cinematography and direction of the film. The visuals of the film were beautiful, and the film never looked like a typical Holllywood film. For instance, when a tank enters an area we see it in a wide shot, then a close up, back again, seamlessly. Never: wide shot of town with no tank, close up of tank entering , etc. Everything looks like it is thoroughly rehearsed, then shot (almost like Children of Men, but obviously not quite like that films genius and originality), rather than : OK, well take a shot of this, then this, then edit it together and bang we got a film.I enjoyed this movie, and would highly recommend it. 8.5 out of ten.(I really wish IMDb would let people give a film a .5 value, rather than just going up b 1's.)</fullReview>

I've come to notice that the use of sub-titles only occurs when there is one foreign language to be used. Though I appreciate this movie sometimes I wonder if it would have been better served to use sub-titles to show the extreme differences between Russia and Germany at the time. A lot of the accents from both sides seem similar so it almost has that civil war type feel to it. But, overall an enjoyable movie that really keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

And Rachel Weisz's face during the big sex scene looked like she was in horrible pain.

		<fullReview>Ordinarily I don't watch war movies because they are usually dank, dirty, depressing, bloody, full of casualties, and sometimes hopeless. I see and read enough about war to want to watch it as entertainment. I am, however, a fan of historical films and the historical nature (however inaccurate) of "Enemy at the Gates" intrigued me. Although the movie didn't go into the entire history of WWII it took two individuals that had pivotal roles in that war in the battle of Stalingrad. I liked the performances of Ed Woods and Jude Law as two snipers on opposite sides. Watching the two trying to outsmart the other was like watching a chess match except with shooting. Their individual battle within the overall war had enough appeal to keep me entirely engrossed in the movie waiting to see the next move. And the ending did not disappoint. In fact, the ending could not have been any better. This was truly an excellent movie.</fullReview>

I rank it as one of the 3 best movies about World War II--the other 2 being 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' War isn't really the Audie Murphy or John Wayne kind of brave charges into enemy lines, killing 50 enemy with one machine gun and a hand grenade. War is about surviving incredible situations, and 'Enemy' shows war at its most grueling. I recommend that everyone listen carefully to the repeated orders by the man handing out rifles after the Soviet soldiers land in Stalingrad. And ask yourselves how you would have felt in that situation. This is a powerful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is based on true facts that occurred during the siege of Stalingrad by the Germans during World War II. It shows the death duel between Russian top sniper Vassili Zaitsev and German top sniper Major Konig a most interesting confrontation indeed through the city in ruins.But what really amazed me in this picture is the incredible atmosphere obtained by the not so prolific director Jean-Jacques Annaud as he did before in "the Name of the Rose" with that unforgettable sordid and remote medieval monastery somewhere in the Italian mountains. I don't remember a film that shows so perfectly -if this could be possible- the horror, miseries, nonsense and heroism at war than "Enemy at the Gates" (perhaps "Saving Private Ryan" action sequences were close).If you like war films you can't miss it and if you don't its worth a watch too.Just for the record: in Argentina "Enemy at the Gates" was renamed as "Enemigo al Acecho" (something like "The Stalking Enemy").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To answer to dannykip, maybe the officers did not shoot their retreating men as is shown in the film but it has happened more than one time. Please read the book of Rodric BRAITHWAITE "Moscou, 1941, a city and its people at war". he talks about this at length. And the fact that they did not have a rifle for each man is also documented in this book. Maybe it was true of 1941 and not of 1942-1943 (the events shown in the film), but what was important to do was to show the spirit of what happened on the Russian front and in the ranks of the Red Army. Art (here, movies) has the right to not be totally accurate in its performances. It is not a documentary. If you wish to see a documentary, there are plenty ! I am quite astonished to see the narrow-minded viewpoints (not talking about you dannykip) shown by amateur critics sometimes. By the way, I think there are too many critics and not enough viewers ! Enjoy a movie or do not enjoy it, but please do not try to become an expert in movies critics. Say what you like and what you did not like and that's already good.As far as I am concerned, I appreciated the movie fairly well and I would recommend it to my friends.Joseph Fiennes is much more convincing than in Shakespeare in love and Ed Harris looks quite German with his icy blue eyes. Question: why did they change Jude Laws' hair ? Didn't they had blond-haired people in the bloody Red Army ?I also liked the battle scenes over the river. One of them is a real Turner.</fullReview>

Of all the war films I have ever seen, I think this one captures the horror, the misery, the dangers, the surreal gravity and the relentlessness of war better than any other. The basic feeling is that no-one will get out of it alive, and if some of them do, it is not for cinematic but rather historical reasons.If I really force myself, I can probably come up with one or two criticisms of this film, but they would be minor in nature. The sets, the cinematography, the script, the performances are all so perfectly executed that I cannot think of anything that jars... it all seems totally inevitable and perfect.

		<fullReview>(There are some Spoilers) True story of a Russian shepherd boy who's biggest ambition in life was to become a foreman, in a Soviet industrial factory, instead ending up becoming a Hero of the Soviet Union by picking off almost 150 German troops with his trusty snipers rifle in the battle scared factory district during the battle of Stalingrad.With the German advance steamrolling into the USSR in the spring and summer of 1942 by early September the only obstacle that stood in the way of a Nazi victory in Russia, and eventually winning the Second World War altogether, was the highly industrial city on the River Volga ironically named after the then dictator, Joseph Stalin, of the Soviet Union Stalingrad.The German superiority in armor and air-power was counterbalanced not only by the Red Army's brutal tactics against their own troops killing many Russian soldiers, by rearguard NKVD execution squads, who tried to surrender to the German forces or retreat from the front-lines. Also the street fighting skills of Gen. Chikov's 62nd Army that did the brunt of the fighting and dying in the defense of the city.Early in the fighting young Red Army private Vassili Zaitsev, Jude Law, trapped in no-mans land picked off five German soldiers in ten minutes to the admiration of his fellow, and disabled, Red Army comrade Danilov, Joseph Flennes. Danilov get's this idea of lifting the Red Army's sagging moral in the fighting by making Vassili a national hero in publishing his sniping exploits in the Red Army's newspaper. Keeping a daily score of his kills on the front page.The Soviet political commissar of Stalingrad Nikita Krushchev, Bob Hoskins, is more then delighted with both Danilov idea and Vassili's exploits promoting both of them. Danilov to a commissar post and Vassili to the head of an elite Soviet sniper company. As Vassili's daily kills raise the Red Army's hopes and moral in Stalingrad the German's get their ace sniper Major Konig, Ed Harris, to get into a killing contest with Vassili. With the eventual winner being the one who knocks off the opposing champion, Vassili or Konig, first. The great battle scenes in the movie are offset by a fictitious and schmaltzy love triangle between the two friends Vassili and Danilov with pretty Jewish Red Army woman soldier Tani Chernova, Rachel Weisz. There's also a underlying racial element in this tri-love affair with Danilov who's himself Jewish resenting that his good friend and army comrade Vassili, who saved his life, having an affair with a Jewish woman.Konig getting to Stalingrad for the big showdown starts to pick off Red Army soldiers with the same ease and skill as Vassili does against the Germans. It's only a matter of time before the two square off against each other but the fact that now Tani is the mix things get a lot more complicated. Danilov want's to have Tani transfered away from the front not only to keep her from getting killed but away from her lover Vassili. This underhanded action on Danilov's part leads the former Ural shepherd boy to lose his concentration and almost get picked off by the far less worried, about his love life, Major Konig.There's also little 8 year old Sacha Filipov, Gabriel Thomson, who's spying for the Red Army in order to get important information on Major Konigs whereabouts so that his hero Vassili can get the drop on him. Major Konig who pays off little Sacha with bars of chocolates and hunks of bacon, what a weird combination, for his services knows what he's really up to, a double-agent for the Russians. Major Konig gives Sacha a chance to escape but thinking that the German Major is being fooled by his charade Sacha tragically ends up being captured and hanged by a very reluctant but iron-Prussian willed Konig.With the city looking like it's on the verge of falling to the Germans the remaining population is evacuated across the Volga which includes Sacha's mother, and Tina good friend, Mrs. Filipou ,Eva Matters. Mrs. Filipou is told by Danilov that her son deserted to the other side to keep her from knowing the truth that he was executed by the Nazis. During the evacuation Tina gets hit by a German artillery shell and, being so badly wounded, is then thought to have been killed. This leads Danilov ,in a last gesture of friendship, towards Vassili,to exposed himself getting hit right between the eyes by Konig which leads him to come out in the open and into the gun-sight of Vassili Zaitsev's snipers rifle. it's later revealed that Tina survived her wounds making Danilov act of self-sacrifice even more telling that it already was.P.S Vassili Zaitsev's career as a Red Army sniper came to a sudden end in early 1943 when he was badly injured by a German land mine. Vassili lost what's the most important attribute that a sniper needs to do his deadly work his sight. Being awarded Hero of the Soviet Union by Comrade Stalin Vassili is looked upon today some 60 years after WWII as one of the greatest fighting men in Russian, Soviet or otherwise, history. Vassili's snipers rifle is on display in the Stalingrad War Museum in Volgagrad named after the river that it's on not the WWII Soviet dictator who was responsible, in safe and far off Moscow, for it's heroic defense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good but not great war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best war movies in my humble opinion are those that endeavour to show it exactly as it is, i.e. that however much Gung Ho or patriotism or brainwashing or propaganda is involved and no matter how it is glorified and even how it does indeed sometimes make heroes of otherwise average and relatively insignificant men, war is hell, plain and simple! For anyone even vaguely familiar with the history of the Second World War the name Stalingrad towers head and shoulders above even Normandy, Iwo Jima and The Battle of The Bulge in sheer carnage. The movie "Enemy at the Gates", directed by Frenchman Jean Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet, The Bear), sets out to tell the personal tales of some individuals, both Russian and German in a much more focused account than the last movie of note to address the subject, the sweeping German production "Stalingrad" from 1993.In "Enemy at the Gates", Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is a young peasant from The Urals who is befriended shortly after his arrival into the horror of front line 1943 Stalingrad, by a Soviet propaganda officer, Commander Danilov, played by Joseph Fiennes, who, after witnessing first hand his prowess as a sniper in assassinating five German officers, sets out to elevate him to the status of hero in a bid to raise the spirits of a demoralised Red Army, who are battling to hold the last tenth of their ruined city against the German onslaught. To witness the graphic horror of how these two are thrown together at all, it is easy to see why 20 million Russians died in The Second World War. Arriving by train at the rail head across the Volga from the city proper, Zaitsev is fed into the mincing machine that was the Second World War's Verdun, along with his "comrades", where the instructions from the commanding officers, since there aren't enough rifles to go around is, "follow the man in front of you until he is killed and then take his rifle". This, along with those retreating being machine gunned down by their own officers as cowards and traitors to The Motherland is, it seems, what goes for motivation in besieged Stalingrad.It is upon this opportunity, therefore, that Commander Danilov seizes, to sell his motivational hero idea to the field commander, one Nikita Krushchev, played quite excellently by Bob Hoskins. The plan is wholly embraced by Khrushchev and before long Zaitev has become a legend, receiving fan mail from Factory Workers and Coal Miners all over the Motherland as his ever increasing German officer kill tally is daily reported. Indeed so successful does the legend of Zaitev become, and so counter demoralising for the Germans, that they dispatch an ace sniper of their own, one Major Koenig (played by Ed Harris), to Stalingrad to hunt down and kill Zaitsev.This is the main preoccupation of the rest of the movie, apart from a parallel subplot, the female love interest, of a female sniper Tania Chernova, played by a strikingly pretty Rachel Weizs, whom both friends fall in love with, which understandably leads to major jealousy, particularly on the part of Danilov and puts a major strain in their friendship, as they fight their own little battle for her affection within the claustrophobic ruins of the city.The battle of wills and wits of the opposing snipers is gripping, particularly in the way they track each other and try to anticipate each others thoughts, and other methods (In Koenig's Case, the enlisting of a young Russian boy, Vasha (Gabriel Thompson), by chocolate and food bribes, who though he worships and idolizes Danilov, yet feeds Koenig information about him, perhaps in a bid to entrap the German, as he also relays information back to Danilov and Zaitsev about the German and his whereabouts) In any case, whilst the hunt it is filled with suspense, in the end it does become a bit drawn out and makes the movie perhaps a half an hour longer than it should be.Apart from some of the dramatic failings of this movie, it does manage to portray a horrific and realistic picture of the tragedy of war, and like all great anti war movies, if it achieves nothing else but this, then it can be justifiably deemed a good movie. It is however not a "great" war movie up there with "All Quiet on The Western Front", "The Great Dictator", "The Red Badge of Courage", "The Longest Day", "Platoon" and "Saving Private Ryan".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me just say that saw this film on television so I may have missed some bits that were edited out for whatever reason. I though the film was enjoyable. The story moved along at a nice pace, there were various subplots to bolster the film when the pace starts to lag, and the acting was good. What more is there? I liked this film, it was romantic and I don't mean the romantic love sort, though there enough of that, the characters in the film emoted a sort of romance, a kind of noble what-have-you nonchalance in the bleakest of conditions(and gosh was everything grey and weary, afterward I had to reassure myself that the world actually comes in Technicolour)that I suppose only war films could create. My one complaint is that I find the Joseph Fiennes character rather unbelievable. Here is an educated intelligent man who is brought down by his emotions. His final scene with Jude Law I thought to be unbelievable, his bitterness toward his government comes as a surprise and his suicide can only be described as rash and impulsive. I would have thought that his character is would be ruled less by his heart than by his head.But other than that, it is a movie to just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

This was the first movie in which I could cheer for the ordnance...whichever way a bullet went it was going to hit either a Nazi or a Soviet.But seriously, it showed a tight story between two protagonists, each with very human attributes (unlike their Nazi or Soviet masters) striving against each other. Their personal conflict made the siege of Stalingrad, one of the worst episodes of human conflict in the history of warfare, appear as a "mere" setting. The movie was quite well crafted and kept me interested throughout.I liked the fact that the movie did not portray either ideology as better than the other, but rather two sides of the same coin.The main complaint that I had was the typical Hollywood style love-interest side story. If I were crawling around the streets of Stalingrad, I would be focused on survival, rather than romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS So few talk about the Russians. When we consider the second of the twentieth century's two bloody wars, all too often the main parties are listed as Germany, Britain, France and America. We talk of allies fighting evil, and yet we all too often ignore the sacrifices and efforts of the Russian war machine. Millions dying in huge blood baths, some suggest the war would not have ended how it did had Hitler not attacked the Eastern Front.2001's "Enemy at the Gates" attempted to shed some light on the suffering of the Russian people and tell the story of a real life hero. Recounting the tale of Vassili Zaitslev (Jude Law), the story is full of numerous factual errors, but that doesn't stop it from being at times incredibly powerful and tense stuff. The shame however is that this just does not last and towards the end, the film becomes a bit of a struggle to watch. A shame after such a promising start.Vassili Zaitslev (Law) and Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) are friends who use a talent of Vassili's for shooting Germans to turn him into a Russian hero. Killing Germans at an amazing rate, Vassili is loved by his fellow Soviets. To kill the myth, the Germans have an idea. Despatching their own crack sniper in the form of Major Konig (Ed Harris), Vassili soon finds himself being gradually hunted by a superior marksman.Just like Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan", "Enemy at the Gates" attempts to get you absorbed straight away by throwing you into the heart of a blood soaked battlefield. Attempting to demonstrate the horrors of war, it shows you the Russian attitude to traitors as well as the general conditions and supply standards.All too suddenly, the story changes however. From an intense and gut wrenching opening scene, the story switches to a more subtle, still bloody, tale of two men fighting against each other. Almost as if they felt they needed to shove in a rudimentary war scene to match 'Ryan', the opening scenes are of little similarity to the rest of the film and you have to question their relevance.Once you do bypass the massive slaughter and retreat to the cat and mouse game of Law and Harris, the story takes off in a different direction and for the most part, you do sense that this is going to be a good film. Gritty and realistic, the pure intensity when the two men are stalking each other is genius. Again though, just when it takes off, you find yourself stranded in a pointless love triangle with Law and Fiennes fighting for the affections of Rachel Weisz. One minute you have intensity, the next you find yourself rather bored. It's a weird situation to be in, and ultimately it is a tad disappointing.Eventually events unfold more or less as you'd expect, people die, others live, so on so forth, and constantly the intensity ranges from powerful to not existent. 'Total Film' magazine has this wonderful idea where they show on a graph the excitement levels. Designed to show how a film varies from exciting to tedious, it would be of little surprise if their graph for this film was one long picture of peaks and slumps. The film thrives when Law is fighting Harris, but any other time and you might as well put the kettle on.Another problem, albeit a minor one, is the character of Sacha Filipov (Gabriel Marshall Thomson). Admittedly brave, the character suffers from the simple fact that Thomson infuriates throughout. It's something to do with his voice, but sadly the actor (recognisable as Michael in BBC Comedy Series "My Family") really manages to grate the nerves as you watching him.Thomson aside, the acting is of a relatively average level throughout. Weisz pouts a lot whilst trying to look upset, Law tries to look intelligent, Fiennes just looks angry. In fact, other than the consistently brilliant Harris, only Bob Hoskins (as Khrushchev) makes a lasting mark. It's a shame his appearance is so limited.The impression remains that "Enemy at the Gates" should have been an amazing film. Occasionally powerful, and often brutal, it suffers badly from a complete lack of consistency. With a pointless love triangle and some irrelevant scenes, the film should be considerably shorter and focus more on the rivalry of Law and Harris. When the two men are pitted in a battle of wits, you genuinely feel absorbed and moved, then Harris disappears and Law continues to fall for Rachel Weisz. It's like two halves of a coin. On one hand you have a dirty, powerful, war movie about two men trying to kill each other, and on the other you have an irrelevant romance with little going for it. Perhaps one day someone will construct a version of this film where only one side is visible, but until that day, "Enemy at the Gates" is a huge disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very intense, but typical Hollywood script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really intense and outstanding movie, sadly it has Hollywood written all over it, you are never in doubt of the ending and it all the way through feels sort of predictable, which removes a bit of the intensity, though not all.Vassili Zaitsev is a rookie, raised on the country by his granddad he is send to Stalingrad to fight the most important fight of WW2, there are many soldiers among him, not all are given a rifle, in the first run at the germans Vassili is one of the only survivors from the hit, here he finds a rifle among the dead and snipers 5 german soldiers, watched by a political newspaper guy who turns him into a hero. From Germamy arives the master sniper, König, to put an end to Vasilli's rampage killings of highly placed german officers, the Duell has begun.Enemy At the Gates gives a very good portrait of the war, the evil side too, this has been done many times before, WW2 has and will always be a solid and interesting theme for making movies, the genius lies in picking up a Sub Theme of this that is still interesting, but also original, becuase many things has been seen before, this is a movie that focuses on something that hasn't been made a known movie about before, the Duell between the snipers.This movie is really well done, and you can see that every detail has been gone over and analyzed, this movie is really well put together, sadly the script isn't as well done as the movie itself, from outside the movie sounds very original considering it's a WW2 movie, however once you get going, you can very easily in the movie say that this movie was made in hollywood, the script is predictable, and for some reason it tries to combine the intense WW2 drama, with an intriguing love story. If the love story is true or not, i don't know, but never the less it makes the movie part ways early, intensity moving to one direction, while the romantic side story movies in the opposide direction, the purpose is to cross each others read in the end, and it does, and it's spotted after 30 minutes within the movie, however i must say that the love part of the movie has both it's good sides and bad sides, at first i was annoyed that they had to import a love story into a dramatic and intense war movie. However, it succeeds without destroying the dramatic point of the movie too much, it's more the predictability of the movie that makes for a less intense part here, not saying it's boring, becuase it's so well done that it can only be exhiting, however if i didn't already know that he was bound to survive to safe the happy end, i would have been chewing my nails on every Duell.One of the most amazing parts of this movie is the unbelivable realistic and detailed re-creation of Stalingrad during the war, this is one of the more convincing sides of the movie, and it really makes a good background for a realistic WW2 movie, it's obvious that the scenery has been done down to the very last detail, it looks really outstanding. Also the cinematography of the movie is really great, and the opening scene when they enter Stalingrad from the water is very well done, appears to be a scene inspired by the "boarding the beach" scene in Saving Private Ryan, but never the less it looks great and the parts where the planes are gunning at the boats is terrificly made.The directing of this movie is well done, however i wouldn't characterize the directing perfect, as i think any experienced director could have made this movie as it is made, he had all the necesarry funds to build a great re-creation, the fantastic re-creation is not something we should thank the Diretor for, it's nothing extraordinary, but still a good direction.One thing that surprised me in this movie was Jude Law's great acting, i've always seen him as a bit shallow and without debth of realism, but in this movie he really does a great job and makes the movie more belivable, furthermore it's his stone face in the sniping scenes i think that makes for much of the intensity, he's playing a very serious chracter, and he succeds. The other main actors and actresses also does a great job, however they're not shining as much as Jude Law is, he is the one that makes the other performances fade a little to the background.To sum it all up, this is indeed a good movie, at times breathtaking and intense, other times a little hard to understand and too predictable, but it's still a solid movie, good entertainment, and definetely worth checking out if war dramas is a genre that interests you.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is a good movie. It's about the sniper duelbetween Vasili Zaetzev, (Jude Law), and Major Koenig, (Ed Harris.) During the Battle of Stalingrad, (September 1942 to January 1943,) The German 6th Army, under the command of General Von Paulus, was fighting the Red Army block by block, street by street, for control of the ruined city. Zaetzev, a Red Army private, is the Soviet Union's best sniper. He's responsible for killing over seven hundred German snipers. So the Germans send to Berlin for their best sniper, Koenig, who's an instructor at the Wehrmacht's sniper school in Berlin. The two snipers stalk each other for days. Then Zaetzev kills Koenig. Duel over.</fullReview>

Now yes this war film is also good for its historical matter and documents the real life Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev played very well by Jude Law. Since this is a war movie containing violence and sharp camera angles, it also had good character development. But the love scene in this movie was so real and the good thing about it is that you never expected it. It was innocent and decent. Overall a good film and good performances by Rachel Weisz , Joseph Fiennes, and always Ed Harris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this film is great to watch, it has a marvellous opening sequence (though not as good as 'Ryan's Omaha sequence) that has you enthralled from the first minute.The unusual approach on focusing on snipers made for a refreshing twist, and i think gave more suspense, waiting as each person aimed was nailbiting.The only actor who let the film down I think was probably Rachel Weisz. Far too posh to be a peasant Russian resistance fighter, she simpered her way throughout the film with probably one facial expression all the way.The star of the film was undoubtably Gabriel Thomson, who I believe was 13 at the time. Unlike Daniel Radcliffe in HP, Thomson is never once wooden and steals the show. He displayed some amazingly mature acting and emotions.The action sequences were wonderful, as were the sets.But (and this is a big phobia of mine) they managed to sneak a sex scene in. I don't know how they did it, but it was there, and for me, totally ruined all tension and emotion they had built up so well. Lord knows how sex fits in with the Battle of Stalingrad but it wasn't necessary and spoilt the film.Other than Weisz and the sex scene, this film would be a near perfect war film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent WW2 movie with nice shots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...err, that was a bad pun, I guess. However, I would put this movie in one line with Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers and the excellent german Stalingrad movie.It has plenty of battle scenes (although not quite as elaborate as the outstanding start end end battles in Ryan), a plot based on real characters (although Major König was propably neither a major nor that highly decorated, Zaitsev actually existed) and a nice tweak to conventional WW2 movies.The madness of war is pointed out pretty well, with officers having scores of fleeing soviet infantry MG'ed for cowardry, the constant gun and artillery fire etc.In contrast to one of the other commenters who mourned the lack of european actors on the movie, I'd like to point out that there is actually LOTS of Europeans, especially Germans.Eva Mattes, Matthias Habich and Hans Martin Stier, which are all acclaimed actors here in Germany, take larger or smaller roles, and Ed Harris does actually a quite good portrait of a German Elite officer with an almost royal behavior.And as a side note, all the Nazi extras are actually German, they speak without the slightest accent. Ryan's "Germans" were a bad joke to any native speakers, and the nazis in BoB were no native speakers, either. So that adds MUCH to the credibility of the movie.Overall: 8 of 10.</fullReview>

I hope that these kind of movie will discourage people from actually going into this kind of all out, senseless battle.It was also an eye opener to me so see just how much the Russians suffered during WWII.Although I actually prefer comedies, for a war movie I get it high marks. Perhaps a follow up movie describing how Vassili was trained as a sharp shooter how he grew up and his view point on politics would be interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a martial artist. Being one, I know that a battle is 99 percent psychological. As such, I enjoyed watching the duel between Vasili and Major Koenig, two snipers, portrayed in this movie. The waiting between shots was anxiety-provoking. The snipers used various tactics to attempt to lure the other out and expose weakness. While the ending of the movie is predictable early on, it is nonetheless enjoyable to watch. I think that Vasili's skill might have been a bit exaggerated. He seemed rather super-human. I've read on some websites that his legend may be Russian propaganda. Whether or not this is true is debatable. Until next time.-nguyen1215</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastenders at war. Or so it sounds like during the first half of this movie, where even Bob Hoskins turns up as Nikita Khrushchev. It's really irritating that British movies and series often signpost the working class origin of Russian communists by giving them regional British accents. The problem with that is that regional accents are extremely peculiar to a specific region, and rather than make the actors sound more Russian or authentic, it grates and irritates and disorients. I never knew that Khrushchev was a Cockney. Also, Ron Perlman is dubbed over with what sounds like an Australian accent. G'day to you too, comrade. You can almost hear the producers think - we have to get an American actor in here, or it won't sell in the US. Which is ok, because none of them except a few extras are Russians anyway.I find this really distracting, rather than "authentic". Their accents would have been less distracting if they'd been more neutral. The second half of the film focuses more on sniping and Ed Harris is pretty good as the German aristocrat sniper who is sent to take out Zaitsev. Finally a movie about WWII from the pov of the Russians, who took the brunt of the German assault and without whose resistance, WWII wouldn't have been won and nazism would have triumphed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations of the movie "Enemy at the gates" were big,considering that it was announced as the "biggest war movie since Saving private Ryan"."Saving..." was a good film.And,sorry,but it had no soap-romance.And a barbie-boy like the main role.And Shakespierre-like turning points... I am sorry to say that,"Enemy at the gates" was an experience that I would rather forget.Considering that it was the biggest battle of all time,a manifestation courage that can never fade,and the horror that can never be described,this film was more than a blow-up.Paramount can never catch the beauty of that time,the tragedy,the actual spirit of the time when the battle for Stalingrad took place.Instead,they commercialised this event and vulgarised every value of both sides.Because,although we know that both Hitler and Staljin,Nacis or Bolshevics,had their negative conotation,it is a shame to make a dark parody of their realm over the eastern Europe.I have seen older film from Russian production that reflect this subject,and they were mangificent.No,Bob Hoskins can not play the role of a cruel general with american accent.Although the portrait of brutality is not that bad.The romantic saga is a complete waste,filling time in the movie tape...One of the few trully good segments is the Ed Harris's role of the German major.And the suspence is sometimes on the level. The only excuse for this,I repeat,pathetic blocbuster,is maybe the pressure from the studio.Lets hope that the director Annaund (who made two great films-The name of the Rose and Seven years in Tibet) had something else in mind,but the "ambitios" producers made him "change his mind".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My understanding is that the book takes the reader through sniper training school and describes how this band of sharpshooters came together. The film is really missing this detail; Vassili goes from being nearly the sole survivor of a suicide attack to being a sniper on assignment. We're told little to nothing about how this comes about and that's a pity, because it would be fascinating to see how a sniper is trained. Instead, we're tortured with a tedious love triangle, a gaping plot hole (* MINOR SPOILER*) when a scathing letter written by Danilov is completely forgotten, and a predictable ending. A 6 out of 10 for great production, cinematography, and acting, but poor screenplay and a hodgepodge of accents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a misplaced focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a bit of a disappointment. They try to make a realistic war-movie about one of the turningpoints of WWII, and end up focusing completely on two single snipers. The opening scenes of the film are very well done, its all realistic and horrible, showing how terrible war can be, but its not put into context, and from then on, it all just slipslides away into obscurity.The war more or less disappears, and the conflict is now between Jude Laws and Ed Harris characters. Law does an okay performance, and Harris is stone cold and good, and the scenes when they "hunt" each other are the only real suspense in the film, but all the silly coincidences and escapes they have to make up to make the hunt last through the film gets to stupid.**SPOILER** and when Harris is killed in the end, its just another stupid moment. This guy, who is so smart that he doesnt go for Pearlmans decoy, after shooting a guy who suddenly rises up in his view, thinks he`s gotten his adversary and crosses this huge open space. Yeah right. **SPOILER END**It is to much focus on things that doesnt help the story or ads to the suspense. The love story seems like an add on to attract viewers. There is never any question who gets the girl, the question is only why. The question about socialism and equality is entirely left out, even if that is why Weisz is in the war. The fact that this was the coldest winter in years and years is completely left out. Almost all historics are left out. The film is in part interesting when the two snipers chase each other, but the rest of the film can`t really decide if it is a war-movie or love-story, and there just is to many weak points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So real you can smell it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so refreshing to see a film where the actors and not the special effects are the stars.This is based on an allegedly true story, concerning the duel between Vassily Zaitsev, a Soviet, and Major Koenig, a German sniping expert, Koenig is sometimes referred to in Soviet war documents as Thorwald.The film focusses on Zaitsev, a shepherd, who has been a hunter in the Urals, and his rise to being not only a very sucessful sniper, but a talisman for the Russian people involved in the battle for Stalingrad.When he finds himself, and a Political Officer in a bit of bother, surounded by Germans, he manages to shoot all of them and make good an escape. The Political officer realises the value of such a man, and begins to publish a record of his kills, ( I suppose he would be called a spin doctor today)As Zaitsevs' kill rate and notoriety rises, the Germans dispatch the head of their sniper school to kill him, and the duel ensues.Watch the film to find out what happens.The actors in this film had to act. There is not as much dialogue as there would be in other films, and that is no bad thing, and to me it was an excellent way to work a film because of its realism, I don't think there would be much time for meaningless chatter when you are in a situation like this.The special effects which accompanied the film, rather than overtook it were excellent.This will go down as one of the great war films of all times, gritty, realistic and harrowing, you feel like you were there.This is definitely one for the collection, very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story, But Film Doesn't Capture It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess that I had to watch this movie twice before it finally made a positive impression on me. The first time I could only take about half an hour before I turned it off. Somehow the whole thing seemed muddled and confused and it just didn't capture me. I watched it a second time mainly because it was available and I thought I must have missed something. It is better the second time around.Basically, this is the story of the Battle of Stalingrad, told largely through the eyes of two opposing snipers - Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) fighting for the Soviets, and Major Konig (Ed Harris) for the Germans. Vassili becomes a national hero as the sniper who almost single handedly is wiping out the Nazis, and Konig is sent to Stalingrad by the Germans for the sole purpose of taking him out. The two put on excellent performances in their respective roles. Of the supporting cast I must say that the only significant impression left (and it's interesting that it left a significant impression because it was a relatively minor role) was by Bob Hoskins, playing Nikita Kruschev as a political officer in the Soviet Army.The battle scenes are graphic, so be warned if the sight of blood upsets you. The sets are brilliant, and make you feel as if you have indeed been taken into the middle of a war zone. The psychological aspect of the confrontation between Vassili and Konig is well portrayed by the respective actors. So there's a lot of things going for this movie. Having said that, it still left me a bit dry.There just doesn't seem to be enough here to sustain a movie for two plus hours. How long can you really stay excited about watching two snipers play a cat and mouse game? How long can you really maintain your attention level watching two snipers simply watch for each other, waiting for each other to make the first move? The movie descends into that several times, and - I admit - my attention did wander. I'm quite certain this story was probably better as a novel, where the psychological aspect of the confrontation could be played up more significantly.It's a decent enough war movie, though, and even with that fundamental weakness, it's still worthy of a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Europe does Hollywood - and makes all the same mistakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A European film which aims to crack the American market but ends up making almost all of Hollywood's mistakes. The concept is a great one: a lowly Russian sniper and an intellectual propagandist together inspire the Red Army to repel the Germans from Stalingrad and effectively stop Hitler in his tracks. It begins well enough with a spectacular and bloody crossing of the Volga, and a very efficient introduction of Danilov (Fiennes) and Vassili (Law). But it's all downhill from there. The problem is a wandering screenplay which collapses under the weight of an utterly redundant love story involving the beautiful, talented and horribly miscast Rachel Weisz. With their abrupt changes in lighting and clunky editing, many of the romantic scenes appear to have been shot and inserted later, probably after preview screenings failed to ignite the American female audience. If so, we can blame the producers more that the writers. The whole film might have been better if the rivalry between Danilov and Vassili had centered on their differing social positions, and not their shared love of a woman. In doing so, it could have articulated the internal contradictions of Russia and neatly foreshadowed the social envy which ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. A few scenes and vestigial lines of dialogue suggest this may have been the thrust of the original screenplay, and it's a pity this theme was jettisoned to make way for a soggy, soap-opera romance. Overall, this was a very disappointing film which had me wondering how much better it could have been in the hands of someone like Nikita Mikhalkov (?Burnt by the Sun') and with a Russian and German cast. But there was one thing they did get right: unlike so many recent films, the use of CGI in the battle scenes was thoughtful, controlled and highly effective. Well done, Double Negative and Richard Bain!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a true story, `Enemy at the Gates' has everything you'd want in a good war movie: great action sequences, great sets, great costumes, and an intriguing story. It's about a Russian soldier named Vasily Zaitsev (Jude Law from `The Talented Mr. Ripley') with incredible shooting skills who manages to pick off many German officers and becomes a hero, courtesy of a Russian officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes from `Shakespeare In Love'), who seizes the opportunity to raise morale of the Russian army by printing elaborate stories about Zaitsev's daily conquests. Meanwhile, both soldiers fall for a beautiful Russian girl named Tania (Rachel Weisz from `The Mummy'), which causes a bit of friction between them. The Germans then bring in their best sharpshooter, Major Konig (Ed Harris of `Apollo 13'), which starts a game of cat and mouse through a war-torn city that can only end when one of them dies. Sounds pretty interesting, doesn't it? Director Jean-Jacques Annaud (`Seven Years in Tibet') definitely sat through `Saving Private Ryan' a few times and picked up the right elements of mood, war carnage, and good timing of the action sequences. So what's wrong with it, you ask? Imagine the Russian soldiers had thick British accents and the Nazi sharpshooter had an obviously American accent. Would you still buy it? Probably not. While it seems like a small detail, it really gets in the way of the believability of the characters. While all four of the main characters are fantastic actors, you would think they would be able to pull off an accent that suits their character. Besides a slightly hokey ending and the bad accents, this is a really enjoyable film. So, if you'd just like to sit back, let your eyes glaze over, and watch things blow up like any other action film, you'll like it. But be warned, it can get a little confusing if you can't figure out whose side the characters are on.</fullReview>

The love story between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz distracts from telling the mostly true story of Vassili Zaitsev, Russia's greatest sniper during WWII. The duel between Law and german Major Konig, played by Ed Harris, is long but still manages to be tense. Harris and Law's scenes are the best parts of the movie, everything else is just filler. Bob Hoskins turns in a good performance as the future premier of the USSR, Mikhail Krushchev. I wasn't as impressed by this movie as I thought I would be. While the scope of this movie and the battle scenes are quite impressive, this film ends up being somewhat bogged down by the ponderous love story that was made up by the producers to attract a larger female demographic. Bottom Line: Check this movie out, but rent before you buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fine production and acting, weak love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a great interest in history, and thought it was admirable to see a big budget film depicting the Battle of Stalingrad - Americans are woefully unaware of the suffering on the eastern front of World War II. The production values of the film do get a across the historical scope of the battle and the wanton loss of life, and often the humanity of those involved does shine through (Ron Perlman was very good, I thought).But the dramatic arc of the characters and their love story woefully mismatched the scope of the events surrounding them, despite the fine actors involved. I felt the screenwriters straining to force the love triangle onto a story that really didn't need it. And to me that greatly diminished the movie, because it missed the chance to tell a powerful story about a subject almost ignored in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't like it? Get stuffed, a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bla bla bla. Don't like the accents? after watching plenty of crap american movies where they murder accents (being an Australian, this is a raw wound) I've come to the conclusion that its best not to try. And this movie doesn't. BTW, do the Yanks get criticised for that?? Never. Deal with it. This is a fantastic war film. It pulls no punches. Squibs abound as guys necks explode, brain matter flies, it's dirty, muddy, in parts downright disgusting. Funny that, that's what war is like.This movie has it all. Excellent acting, great action, realism (OK, who gives a toss about the T-34's, its still a lot better than most other war movies.) a handsome lead (who does look Russian in parts, and like a soldier) who had my sister drewling, and a gorgeous female lead who had me doing the same. So people don't like the romance. Rachel Weisz is in the romance!! For that reason, I'm more than willing to forgive them.The thing about the reviews I've read that almost makes me cry is when people call it "boring." Get knotted. Easy to see who's been watching too much American crap. Seems some people can't take genuine suspense.The climax may be a tad implausable, but Ed Harris/ Major Koenig does give a good display of dying like a man. So whatever the complaints, WATCH THIS MOVIE. An excellently made example of how nasty war can be. Brilliant stuff. And remember. Rachel Weisz!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why people have said this isn't that great of a movie. This is possibly my favorite war movie that's come out in the last 10 or 20 years. Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris give very good performances though Harris's stands out. Since I saw this movie I have been absolutely smitten with Rachel Weisz. You can't help wanting to see more of her as the movie goes along because she's just so beautiful. Anybody that can make army fatigues attractive is okay in my book! The overall cinematography is very well done and it gives a great representation of the U.S.S.R during World War 2. However, this is a type of movie that might not win over moviegoers that want to see "Star Wars" type entertainment. This is a very intelligent and well written film that you need to pay close attention to. The only complaint I have of the film, ***(THIS MAY BE A SPOILER FOR SOME)*** is what Ed Harris's character does at the end of the film. I don't want to give away too much but what he does there is totally not what his character would have done at the beginning of the movie. He's cunning and does everything right throughout the whole film but at the end he does the dumbest thing you could in his situation. Other than that and the fact that the music to the movie ripped off Schindler's List a little bit!I give this movie a 9 out of 10. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good dramatic artistic film on a Saturday Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Ed Harris !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spolier? Depends how sensitive you are, but I tried not to write one.)This is one of the better war movies I have seen. What I didn't like too much is the cast for two main characters. Jude Law seems too cute for the role of suffering soldier (he's far better in roles where his baby-face adds up to the role, like his Bosie in `Wilde') and I still haven't seen the role where Rachel Weisz is as convincing as when she's being photographed for fashion magazines. Still, all that cuteness is well worth enduring since Ed Harris's performance is absolutely brilliant.Harris plays an older nazi officer, an excellent sniper shooter on the Russian front who is fighting what actually is his personal battle - revenge for his son's death. On the other side is Jude Law, young Soviet soldier, also precious to his leaders for his shooting skills. Precious also because he is a role model for troubled and demoralised army. I liked the idea of global idea being used for personal goals (Harris) gains one's personal ideals being used to glorify global goal (Law).I'd hate to see Ed Harris being nominated (I don't even consider an option of nomination not being announced) and not winning Oscar once again, or winning it sometimes in the future for what won't be his best performance but Academy's excuse to finally give him the statuette (like they did with Al Pacino for `Scent of a Woman'). It is not very often that we see a performance of such high standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the following might be considered as SPOILER!Well this is exactly one of the movies you see and do not have to see again, even though you were not THAT disappointed. In another words, nice way to spend an evening when you have no better things to do.Now, let's discuss the details a little bit. First, since Saving Private Ryan Hollywood enjoys grossly naturalistic scenes in war movies. I think it is right since war IS like that. Even the most famous war flicks made in 60's focused on production and cast, but were far too nice to the viewing audience in not exposing them too much to the real stuff. Saving Private Ryan did that and so did Enemy At The Gates. But the good ends right there.I am not detail specialist and I cannot tell whether the guns, uniforms and stuff used in the movie is historically right, but there are still some major things that are so screamingly unbelievable even in common sense. First, the boy, I know Russians use the legend of heroic kids acting like spies so much, but in fact most kids are not mentally capable to do this at their age. Second, the major. Acting like cold blooded professional the whole movie through, right? Then WHY THE HECK does he come up to the open area without noticing person standing on his left side also in open area during the final showdown? Could the best Nazi sniper be so foolish?And the love story? I refuse to give any comment on that. Americans just have to have melodramatic crap in every flick recently. So let them be.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, take out love story and would have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself something of a WWII buff, and was excited that a major film would be released about 'Stalingrad'. In the opening scenes after Vasili's initial flashbacks they really build sympathy for the plight of the Russian soldier. With the NKVD with orders to shoot anyone retreating, the common soldier's issued only one rifle for every two troops, while the NKVD has the SMG's and MG's with orders to shoot Russian troops caught running back, you wonder how we backed a regime that would do this to their own men. The film made me feel there was potential for CGI in these films, it was not perfect, but it must have been easier then trying to get the real things when it came to planes and tanks. someone commented on the use of T-34/85's which were not available till around, or just after Kursk in '43, well maybe those were the only T-34's they could get, granted there are companies that specialize in making mock-ups of all sorts of vehicles as well.With the Germans, I thought they could have varied the tanks and armored vehicles a little more, it seemed all the Germans had were Panzer III's and Sdkfz 251 series half tracks. Enough technical crap, I thought the acting was decent, the story alright save for the love triangle. One thing they tried to convey with Koenig was that, despite his aristocratic baring, and almost callous nature to the plight of the common soldier, a common trait of the German Officer Corp, especially the Wehrmacht, I got the notion he did feel he had a score to settle, having lost his son during the first week of the battle, and how he looked out for the kid, giving him warnings and what not. (Warning Spoiler) Having Ed Harris kill the kid was a ploy I think to kill what residual amount of sympathy you might have had for Ed Harris's character. It seems as always Hollywood likes to have situations broken down to purely black and white morality. The film had its problems but was still entertianing, a 6, possibly 7 out of 10. The friendship bewteen Danilov and Vasili was interesting, but relying on a love triangle to build conflict between them was a little cliche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe more beautiful than interesting although the colors are mostly grey of various shades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great directorial command delivers this stunningly visual story of a legendary sniper as if seen through an intrusive telescope which sees beyond the fame. From the fist scene which fuels his legend to the final shot which suggests that his tale is one among many war tales, Jean-Jacques Annaud fully exerts his mastery of cinema. I don't wish to be pretentious and say that my opinion is the right one, but I think I won't be wrong to say the movie grasps some very moving human moments on film, and the fact alone that the fighting factions are both following ideologies which the United States bitterly fought against will likely make the viewer look at the human souls who are fighting. Although I make it sound as if the movie came from an art house, there are a few scenes which fans of sniper movies will appreciate, except unfortunately the last fight. The feeling of the movie, the unassuming ending and the beauty of the film--although its color palette is mostly grey with occasionally the colors of the flags, reminded me of the movie Ame Agaru, made by Kurosawa's crew after the director passed away. Although the tale will not prompt a reaction in all, the well commanded visual story-telling could not be denied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Saving Private Ryan and combine it with Shot Through The Heart and you'll get an idea of what to expect from Enemy at the Gates. A thrilling and suspenseful film set in Russia during World War II. The film opens with a young Russian soldier (played by Jude Law) arriving in the city of Stalingrad at the time of a Nazi attack. People are being shot, planes are dropping bombs, boats are blowing up and by the time it's all over and you've regained your senses, another action sequence comes along and the process repeats itself. The soldier is befriended by a writer (Joseph Fiennes) who finds out that he is an excellent sniper. Before you can say Russian propaganda the writer has turned Law into a hero and he becomes admired by all. In fact so many people like him that the Germans get worried and send in their top marksmen (Ed Harris) to stop him. This is where the elaborate action sequences stop and a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. Enemy at the Gates has everything that you could want in a good movie. Action, drama, romance (but not so much that it disrupts the killing) and plenty of nail biting moments. My only complaint is that director Jean-Jacques Annaud let the actors use their real accents instead of Russian or German. He said this was done to put acting over speech, but it can't help but seem weird when the lead characters all sound either English or American. But you probably won't even notice with all the bullets flying around. Enemy at the Gates is not a thought provoking film and it carries no real message about the horrors of war, however its a fun film packed with action and excitement. Chances are you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, Top Notch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today's citizens of WWII Western Allied countries are relatively unfamiliar with the details of the Russo-German conflict, which warrants the making for major release of a film such as "Enemy at the Gates." But this superb movie, set in the battle of Stalingrad, the war's turning point, is original in more ways than this.I have not yet seen "Saving Private Ryan," but am aware of what it accomplished, and "Enemy at the Gates" certainly brings the viewer into the battle. Great staged action, excellent cinematography and camera positioning, using close-ups and distance as necessary to make things very vivid. Charges, German aerial bombings, the Volga river's transportation pipeline, civilian suffering. After introducing us to the horrific street-to-street, house-to-house, factory-to-factory struggle with the massed armies pitted against each other, and showing German successes demonstrating the awesome task faced by the Russian army, a subplot of the battle becomes the plot of this movie: attacking the Germans with sniper fire, not just massed deployments.The sniper confrontations revolve around the two principals, Vasilli (Jude Kaw) and German Major Konig (Ed Harris). Konig is brought on midstream to provide specialized help, after the sniper successes on the part of the Russians present the Wehrmacht with problems it is not trained to encounter. The psychological drama that develops, with no shortage of excellent acting, is among the most captivating and memorable in the genre.The Germans' performance in the two World Wars is actually quite amazing, even though they lost, considering their few allies and the size and strength of their opponents. Nevertheless, the analysis is that they plan out every detail with a superorganized approach, but make big errors, major errors of judgment Of course, very basic is evaluating their opponents and taking on more than they can deal with. It is unlikely (actually, more like impossible) the Germans would have won WWI even had they occupied Stalingrad (they blew it the year before, by invading Russia too late), although it would have created more difficulties for the Russians (and the U.S. and U.K., heavily supplying them, heavily bombing the Germans, and fighting the Germans in North Africa).But in any event, the character of Major Konig is not in the usual vein of the overorganized, rigid-thinking German. He is steely, in the usual German way, but projects a quiet, more genuine confidence, and is trickier still than his opponents. No particular Nazi party man, he is a professional soldier, not a bad guy (in the evenhanded approach demanded of modern movies, toward at least the common soldier) -- when he is obliged to kill a civilian, it climaxes a vignette, without sadism or graphic display. He projects a feeling of command and invincibility so compelling that the viewer actually feels he will win, although knowing otherwise. This is no spoiler, of course, yet we are left with the aura that Konig was the better man. It would be a spoiler to say how it was done, and that is another gold star for Director Jean-Jacques Annaud. Heroism reigns triumphant.By contrast, Vassili is, yes, more heroic than Konig, but he is a self-doubting hero. He is "developed" more so than Konig, but this is appropriate. Brilliant in his initial successes, he begins to question how he fits into the prodigious circumstances, whether he is up to the challenge to Konig and in general, and whether and how things can be carried on. This is played out in his relationships with fellow Russians and a romance with woman soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz), providing an interesting and unusual, though uneven in intensity, love triangle (the other party is the other main Russian character). Compare "Pearl Harbor"; in fact, compare the triteness of the characters there to the much different depth of the Russian soldiers here, and civilians too--much of the story centers on a Russian publication, on the theme of hero-seeking. Vasilli ultimately gets by, with a little help from his friends.Later-to-be chief of state Nikita Krushchev, more familiar to older viewers, is prominent in this movie, in line with his noteworthy role at Stalingrad. But most of all, "Enemy at the Gates" is about one of filmdom's best and most original confrontations between military protagonist and antagonist, and bringing the viewer into the experiences of World War II's most dynamic battle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Realistic Battle Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is a WWII drama that takes place during the German siege of Stalingrad in 1942. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud stages realistic and convincing battle scenes amid the ruins of a great city. The scenes where the peasant soldiers are forced into a suicidal battle with few arms is particularly gruesome and unforgettable. From the ranks of the peasant soldiers comes a deadly sharpshooter named Vassili,(Jude Law) who through a fateful encounter meets an influential Russian information officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes)who in turn brings his particular talents to the attention of Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins). Vassili is then developed into a national hero for his exploits as a propaganda measure to improve the morale of the Russian people. The Germans counter with their own sharpshooter Major Konig (Ed Harris) who is sent in to take out Vassili. The rest of the movie is essentially a cat and mouse game between Law and Harris. A totally unnecessary love triangle develops between Vasilli, Danilov and Tania (Rachel Weisz). Law and Weisz give us a graphic demonstration of "love among the ruins" along the way. Law conveys too much baby-faced innocence to be convincing as a cold-blooded assassin. Harris, on the other hand, is thoroughly believable in his role. He unfortunately has to perform the requisite evil German act near the end of the story, which I thought was totally unnecessary for his character within the context of the story. Fiennes is good as the ambitious Danilov but Weisz is not believable as a female scholar/sharpshooter. Hoskins does a nice turn as the overbearing Khrushchev. Ron Perlman has a brief bit as Koulikov another Russian sharpshooter. "Enemy at the Gates" is good war movie. The conflict between the Law and Harris characters is riveting. But the movie suffers with the love story and the contrived "happily ever after" Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One aspect of Enemy at the Gates I liked was how a so-called "Hollywood" film (i.e. Mandalay and Paramount) that concerns itself with WWII didn't focus on the American involvement. Refreshing for that. But again, this is what one should expect from a fine film-maker like Annaud and an insightful writer like Alain Godard.

		<shortDescription>Good war story that meanders off point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a war-within-a-war story based on a real WWII Soviet sniper upon whom the Soviets built much of their morale boosting war propaganda. Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is an extraordinary marksman, pressed into service as a sniper in the Soviet army. Through a combination of effective sharpshooting and relentless coverage by propadanda minister Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Vassili becomes a Soviet hero and a German nemesis. In response, the Germans send their best sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to find Vassili and take him out. The result is a deadly game of cat and mouse where the lines between predator and prey blur.Director Jean-Jaques Annaud (`Seven Years in Tibet') also collaborated in writing the screenplay which is mostly riveting, but too often loses focus. The film is generally well directed with an authentic wartime feel to it. While some have criticized it for looking too much like `Saving Private Ryan', I feel such a comparison is a compliment. Using outstanding cinematography as a model, and coming close to duplicating it is a positive, not a negative. There has also been a lot of criticism of the fact that the Russians don't have Russian accents and the Germans don't have German accents and thus it isn't realistic. I find this criticism ironic and without merit. How someone can accept as realistic the fact that all the characters are speaking English and then criticize as unrealistic the fact that they don't speak accented English is beyond me.My main criticism of Annaud is his inability to stay locked on the main storyline, the story of the snipers. He feels compelled to throw in a meaningless love triangle and lots of other fluff that really add nothing to the story. The time would have been better spent delving deeper into the minds of the snipers and creating additional suspense filled confrontations.Jude Law gives a fine follow-up to his outstanding performance in `The Talented Mr. Ripley' showing that he is here to stay. He strikes an excellent balance between Vassili's sense of duty and reluctance to be a hero, showing a character that is compelled to be courageous when he is really scared.Rachel Weisz also turns in a strong performance though her character is totally superfluous to the main story. Bob Hoskins renders a fabulous wartime Khrushchev. Ed Harris is good as the German sharpshooter, but this is not among his better performances. Joseph Fiennes is also very good, although his is another role that is overemphasized needlessly.This is a very good film that lost its opportunity to be great because of Annaud's inexplicable need to wander from a great storyline. I rated it 7/10. It is a good wartime thriller worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stalingrad wasn't the definitive movie about the most terrible and infamous of struggles during WW2, though it is still the best thus far. So many awful and fascinating things happened during the siege of Stalingrad that we never quite get the kind of treatment it deserves on film. A Das Boot or Saving Private Ryan of Stalingrad movies as it were. We are just given mere glimpses of what it must have been like. And here in Enemy at the Gates we are subjected to just more glimpses -- another melodramatic, supposed suspense tale using the war torn city as a canvas. The story holds promise but the method in which it unfolds is too self centred to make it believable. Movies tend to bottle historical events so that every other detail surrounding them seems incidental and detached, like we are seeing them with tunnel-vision. Here is no exception as a single sniper becomes the be all end of all of Soviet survival in a battle they needed desperately to win. To focus on such a small personal duel can only work if there is a conflict behind it. The study in contrast for example of one man who kills for pleasure and the other who kills only for necessity. Here both men are emotionless killers and exert not enough depth of character to generate some kind of hatred or admiration for each other's ability. Harris is the focus of villainy because he's the German invader and Law is cute and cuddly because he's the youthful put upon Russian. Neither character stands for anything beyond that and both then go out and spatter brains all over the rubble in the name of one dimensional entertainment. Ed Harris turns in probably his worst performance here as a superficial and cold nazi with no insight into what makes him tick. We just find that he's capable of a most heinous and cliched act eventually to get his man, a contrived device so as to put no doubt in the audience's mind who's evil and to get them demanding his blood in the end. Which they get in a mostdubious way.Not interesting or educational as a war film, not suspenseful as a thriller (with it's dreadful pacing), and most certainly not even remotely entertaining for its phoney love triangle, Enemy at the Gates amounts to just a flawed and mediocre old fashioned Hollywood yarn incorporating Spielberg's ground-breaking depiction of combat realism. (fake bravado in the Russian charges not withstanding)A waste of a good set and some authentic uniforms. Maybe one day someone will make a real film about Stalingrad.</fullReview>

This is my first post and I am puzzled by the spoiler warning --- personally, I like to go into movies with a blank slate, never read reviews, so that the story can unfold for me as the maker intended. So any discussion is a spoiler per se.)This movie had the makings of something great -- excellent cast and production values, and unique human stories, both the small story of the snipers and the large story of Stalingrad. But the potential is dissipated by ridiculous plot devices that produce a bloated and uninvolving result. The love triangle was pure filler, but worst of all (and I am surprised by the lack of comments on this) was the boy Sacha, who had near-perfect knowledge of the movements of both men, and regular access to give information to both. This removed any sense of reality or suspense from the central sniper battle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the film, special effects at the beginning were good and it was nice to have people speaking in something other other than American accents (although paradoxically they still used American idioms). Not withstanding this comment I agree with others that Russian accents would have been the most appropriate here.Acting was above average and I found the story gripping. Although I might add that I am not the kind of person that has to constantly have car chases and shoot outs to hold my attention.SPOILERWhere I found the film failed was in the credibility of some details in the plot. For example at the end how did the Russian sniper Vasily get around the side of the German Koenig, when the German was watching his position like a hawk? How could Koening make a clumsy mistake, walking out in the open and exposing himself to attack when he had been so clever earlier? Why was he so slow catching on that the boy he knew was a Russian spy?In addition I have been told that the ending was changed from the book so that Vasily's girlfriend Tania lives, to give the typical Hollywood happy ending. True to form the Germans are stereotyped as very bad, as in Schindlers list. But then given the ethnic origins of many in Hollywood it would be hard to expect objectivity in this regard.</fullReview>

The two armies apparently hold a truce while Vassili and the German then begin their private war. Eventually, Vassili prevails and the Russians have won the battle for Stalingrad. Somehow, I have the feeling there was more to it than this.The individual actors, especially Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris are fine but they are sabotaged by the script.

		<shortDescription>An exciting if slightly flawed WWII Thriller. Spoilers Involved.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates proves to be one of the most exciting war films I have ever seen for the fact that it dosen't really focus on the battle of two armies, but of two men who hunt each other down in the bombed out ruins of Stalingrad. The cast throughout is excellent with special mention two the duelists Jude Law, and the great Ed Harris( who was robbed of an award for his performance in Pollock). James Horner provides a rich musical score while William Frassie photographs what I think should be some of the most beautiful images captured on film this year. Also mention should go to Wolf Kroeger who provides a stunning backdrop for the story with his great production design. One of the most amazing things about the movie to me was the fact thats it's focus was centered on the Russians vs. the Germans, something that we rarely see coming from an American film with this caliber of talent involved. But then again its the story of the sniper duel that maintains the focus, and thats where the bulk of the entertainment lies since most other aspects of the battle seem to be a moot point for the filmmakers which also brings the production down a little for major plot point of the film.Director Annaud tightly raps the audiences attention on the duel ingenuiously heightening the suppense at all the right moments. Of note is a point of film where hiding Russian snipers have blindly walked into the first trap set by German sniper Konning. The trap may be escaped, but time is running out for a flight of bombers have just started a bombing run that appears to be headed straight for them. Another good point leaves Russian sniper Zaitsev stranded in open ground hiding behind a stove, all the while his image is reflected on shards of broken glass for the German sniper to see. Its all very exciting for the film and unfortunately very fictional as I found out after reading William Craig's book. Throughout director Annaud and Goddard make use of several historical facts from the book that are used as mere details. Two details in particular hurt the film. One is the afformentioned romantic triangle. There was romance between Vassili and Tania in real life that could have easily been fitted in the film but the inclusion of Danilov whom also falls in love with Tania is a mistake. It drags part of the story down and feels contrived especially since according to the book he was only a witness to the duel.Another problem, which was a major one for me was the execution of the boy, Sascha by Major. Koning. As described in Craig's novel, Sascha was a fifteen year old cobbler who was hanged in front of his parents for spying upon the Germans. This is something I find serious not to be toyed with lightly. In the film however it comes near the end that Koning uses the boy then hangs him to draw Vassili out into the open, when he discovers the boy trying to alert Vassili of the Germans plan. This doesn't seem right to me. It also hurts the character of Major Koning who throughout the film seems a noble assassin sent to a task that must be done. After he kills the boy he becomes a monster. It just dosen't fit in with the whole of the movie. Still it is an exciting thriller that should not be missed by war movie fans or for that matter suspense thriller fans. Just don't count on it as a good record of the history of one of the most bloody battles of WWII.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ok war flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen war movies like Saving Private Ryan, I have high expectations when going to see this in the cinemas. There are both good and bad parts about this film. I would have to say that the best part is in the beginning. Why? Because to me this is the most realistic and exciting part in the whole film. Seeing the Soviet soldiers ferried across the Volga under the watchful eyes of the NKVD and continuous strafes by German Stukas kept me off my seat during the first 30 minutes. This is the highlight of the film and what follows pale in comparison. This movie is largely about a duel between two snipers. While this is interesting at first, it gets boring for me very quickly as we see the same kind of sniper action again and again except in different locations. The only thing that appealed to me during this phase of the film is when the sniper's spotter got hit in the head mid-air while leaping to another building. Other than that, the rest is VERY boring. Also, it would be nice if the film gave more insight as to why the Germans lost the battle, like the poor preparation to General Winter and the atrocities committed against Russian citizens which gave rise to resistance. Only showing the sniper duels in the battle of Stalingrad was not enough for me, and this also gives an awkward resolution to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is a well made film with many tense, exciting and sometimes breathtaking scenes.The problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it is doing. Is it an epic view of a world changing moment? or is it a cat and mouse struggle against an unseen enemy? It could work as either but not as both. The Nazi invasion and the Soviet resistance almost seems redundant and is constantly reiterated with clumsy annoyance. The movie could, I believe, have worked better in an unnamed city, with two unnamed adversaries in an environment of war. The tension would have been the same, the excitement and the horror as nerve tingling and the concept would not have been tarnished by a half hearted attempt at historical representation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crushing reminder of the grotesque potency of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War films, as a genre generally, offer insights into the human conditionwhich other movies do not. Its the threat of death and immediacy of lossthat allow stark and painful ideas to emerge. With the constancy - andinescapable fear - of harm, driving these movies, its easy to be equallycaptivated and mortified. I found Enemy At the Gates one of the mostterrifying, gut wrenching films I have seen. One almost feels a gung hoimmunity after watching other war films but this film breaks throughsuch defences. I felt a creepy paranoia watching scenes such as thosewhere soldiers are gunned down by their comrades to prevent retreat. Itilluminated too vibrantly the horror and waste of war. This is very mucha grunt movie - in the battle zone and without any outside influence barthe haunting and equally terrifying opening. Jude Law's Vasilli Zaitsevis a young boy in this early scene, being taught to shoot at a wolflured by a restrained horse left in the open as bait. The chillingpressure of this early flashback is continued throughout the film whichthen launches into the deadly battleground of Stalingrad. Its World War2 and as the German army advance through Europe and into Russia thelikelihood of German victory seems increasingly certain as the Russianspirits crumble in the face of superior military strength. It comes down(in the film's narrative anyway) to a young writers' propaganda to liftthe pride of the army. Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) finds in the now grownsniper Zaitsev the spirit of victory and uses pamphlets and newspapersto promote the shooting prowess and hiding skills of Zaitsev. As moralebuilds and Zaitsev becomes a hero to the Russian people, a rift growsbetween the two men whose friendship is tested by their conflicting lovefor a young female sniper, Chernova (played by Rachel Weisz). The filmis beautifully made and features a suave, cruel villain in the form ofEd Harris' icy Major Konig. A scene towards the end reveals theunspeakable, hideous depravity of Nazism and left me stunned.Jude Lawcaptures a shattering innocence that is heartbreaking while JosephFiennes offers a restrained and moving vision of a man in thebackground. Weisz is probably the least well served in character termsbut she does well with her limited role. Its not a rousing film but itis instead intensely powerful and extremely unsettling. A film for thebig screen, where the loud gunfire and clouds of smoke can be trulyappreciated. A crushing reminder of the grotesque potency of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has not been made without some research. Snipers, including the girls widely used by the Soviets, the important part of children during the battle, the harsh treatment of the Russian soldiers, the symbolic battle (Hitler's Verdun, turning point of WWII)...I enjoyed watching the caldron of Stalingrad smoldering with the fumes from hell. I enjoyed the duel of the Russian moujik against the calculating German officer. The Moujik does not ask himself unnecessary questions until he meets the guy who tells him about his return from the West and the treatment reserved to him by the Organs ! The political commissar provides most of the answers but the ruthless manipulators stay in the shadow and one follows a chess game, the game of the war, in which each move weighs many lives.Interesting indeed, better than most films on the subject but a movie on Stalingrad remains to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Better than the Average War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The battle of Stalingrad must qualify for any list of the most brutal military confrontations in history. This film has been criticized for 'trivializing' the reality of that time in that place. For an even more grisly depiction of the horrors of war, see the German film Stalingrad, by the same production group that created the excellent Das Boot.Still, Enemy At the Gates hardly trivializes the subject matter. The Volga river-crossing scene is as harrowing, perhaps even more so, than the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan. With respects to Normandy veterans, the casualty toll and the historical significance of the D-Day invasion do not bear comparison to what happened in Stalingrad.For an antiwar message, this film is far more eloquent than Spielberg's homage to the D-day invasion. In Enemy At the Gates, as in Stalingrad, there are ultimately no good guys or bad guys: it is simply a story of people under one flag fighting and killing people under another flag. Nazi, Soviet, good, evil... it doesn't matter. This was Stalingrad. To the extent morality is depicted, it is depicted as a personal matter and not a simple question of which side one is fighting for.For military enthusiasts, the depiction is within acceptable limits of reality. The German tanks are Mk.III Panzers (not 1960's-vintage M-60's with black crosses painted on them), the planes are Ju-87's and He-111's, and so on. A friend who is a trained sniper tells me that issues of range, accuracy, and penetration are depicted somewhat loosely, but still, there are few of the usual glaring Hollywood liberties taken with military history. The worst error I spotted was the use of a late-war model Russian T-34(85) tank, appearing here about 18 months too early on the timeline... a very minor anachronism by movie standards.As far as it is possible to weave a love story into a reasonably believable war story without becoming ridiculous, this film accomplishes that questionable feat; certainly many other war films have attempted the same thing with far worse results. The love triangle between the Red Army sniper (Law), the Soviet Commisar (Fiennes), and the Rachel Weisz character does serve to highlight significant elements of the conflict that is the heart of the story, unlike most war-movie romances that seem 'tacked on' as a kind of afterthought; here, at least, the love story is interleaved with meaningful elements of the larger story. The fact that Russian women really did serve in combat roles allows a more seamless, or at least, less jarring, combination of human-interest with historical events in the narrative.All in all, one of the better war movies I have seen, Enemy At the Gates strikes a credible balance between the horrific reality of the subject matter and creating an engaging, well-made, and eminently watchable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had not heard of the movie before it came to the 2nd Run - $1.50 theatre. It was the only movie my wife and I had not seen on :Free Popcorn night" so we said what the heck (We are risk averse when plopping down $1.50) We were both duely impressed with the captivating story. I found myself riveted to the screen as the characters developed and the story within the story unfolded. I especially liked the realistic slant on the Boy-Girl-Boy's Best Friend triangle. (Not the Hollywood Love triangle that is so overplayed, as in Pearl Harbor) Jude Law was excellent, Rachel Weisz is energizing and stunningly beautiful. Her eyes, in the Love Scene with Law (which was very tastefully filmed, by the way)were absolutely entrancing. I found myself breathing very deeply, and clutching my wife's hand through the entire scene. The supporting cast added the perfect balance of good-acting/believability to the story. Bob Hoskins was a little dynamo as Nikita Kruschev, Joseph Fiennes was the epitome of a "Spin Doctor"- Political Officer, and ED Harris was Ed Harris - calm, cool, calculating. I was really impressed with this film - so much so that this is my first ever IMDB commentary. et:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable series of cinematic set-pieces: unfortunately it lacks the courage of its moral convictions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that `Saving Private Ryan' is casting a long shadow over war films. Once again, audiences are having the dubious pleasure of experiencing the `gross-out' opening battle sequence. In the case of `Enemy at the Gates' it certainly makes the point that the director, writer and cast think that war is a Bad Thing in general. After this, it seems the film would like to raise more complex moral questions about patriotism and propaganda, and most importantly whether we can ever sublimate individual desires to one collective goal. Indeed, Joseph Fiennes' multi-faceted performance as the Political Officer, militarily inept but skilled in creating a dream to motivate the citizens of Stalingrad portrays well the anguish of a small but perceptive cog in a very large system.By contrast, Jude Law's bluff unpolished depiction of Vassily, the proletarian `Hero of the Revolution' who is incapable of really seeing the wider picture presents a remarkably unsophisticated answer to the questions raised by the immorality of the entire Soviet hierarchy (brilliantly portrayed by Bob Hoskins as an archetypally ruthless Nikita Krushchev before he learnt some skills of political diplomacy). This results in confusion for the sort of film-goer (like me) who likes either to clearly sort out in his or her mind who are the `goodies' and the `baddies' or to treat everyone on a level playing field. The problem was compounded by the fact that the crack German marksman (Ed Harris) recruited to duel with Vassily seemed equally charismatic and his superiors appeared equally amoral. But the German aristocrat's one act of appalling cruelty jars with the other hints that are dropped about his character (for example, the fate of his son) and certainly gave the impression that the writer felt that some clear red water was needed to distinguish nice Vassily from the nasty Nazi, with Joseph Fiennes' character acting as an unhappy medium. Yet the `happy ending' seemed forced too; are we really supposed to be pleased that Vassily was decorated for services to Stalin's state and helped indirectly to preserved the web of evil that nourished people like Krushchev?However, if we do not delve too deeply into the moral justifications for the characters, `Enemy at the Gates' can be enjoyed as a directly told, well acted series of exciting set-piece duels in the great tradition of Hector and Achilles, Aeneas and Turnus and quite possibly Tom and Jerry- for I certainly wasn't meditating on the futility of warfare by the end of the film but cheering on Vassily by the end and hoping he would take out the horrible Kraut.A note on the vexed question of accents: although Jude Law's Sarf Lundun twang gave me a surprise (especially as I had watched him play Lord Alfred Douglas in Wilde the previous night!) I don't see why it is alvayz necessary for Germanz to talk like zis in films simply to allow to slow-witted viewers to work out which country each character comes from. And yes, Bob Hoskins' amazing variable Moscow/Walthamstow dialect was a little off-putting. No doubt DVD on the box stood for Dick Van Dyke on this occasion. But isn't it far more important to have acting of good quality per se than to worry about whether an actor can pronounce the letter `v' as `w' and vice versa (or even wice wersa)?Overall: B+++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent World War II movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates is an excellent WW II movie in which I found few weaknesses. Jude Law really makes the movie great with his excellent portrayal (in tone, facial expressions, and other body languages) of the innocent shepherd boy thrust suddenly into manhood through brutal war, and later the uneasy hero of Russia's propaganda machine.We are told this is based on a true story. I am not a huge war buff so I don't know how accurate the events depicted are historically, but I was very impressed with the atmosphere created by director Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) through the use of crumbled concrete landscapes, wonderful music, and earthy tone colors. This movie is full of stark and powerful images. Some of the highlights include the opening war sequence: Only one rifle per 2 men and the Russian commander yelling "When the man with the rifle dies, pick up the rifle and shoot!" Young wide-eyed youths getting herded like cattle to the front lines to die, the Russians turning their guns on the deserters...All very powerful and interesting images! Ed Harris does a nice job as the stoic and seemingly invincible antagonist. I was hoping we would get a more over-the-top performance from Ed (similar to other great performances "The Abyss" &amp; "The Rock") but his quiet, silent, and deadly portrayal as the Nazi top sniper works just as well. I was happy to see Bob Hoskins and Ron Perlman give great supporting performances!Joesph Fiennes also put in another good performance as the political officer running the Russian political machine. Unfortunately, the love triangle felt a bit lackluster and tacked-on. Rachel Weisz's character felt like a silly cliche. The plot could have done without the love interest aspect. The main characters and action were interesting enough without it. The happy "love" ending really disappointed me as I felt it detracted from the strength of the film's otherwise strong messages/images about war and death.FINAL RATING: 8/10 Despite suffering from the Hollywood mainstream "must have love subplot" and "must have happy-ending" syndromes that ruin many good plot ideas, this movie still is excellent with its believable and interesting plot, excellent production values, stark and powerful visuals, and generally excellent cast that give excellent performances. It was also refreshing to see a WW II movie that tackled the great war from a new aspect (i.e. sniper view). Fans of all types of movies should enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice change from other war films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a WW2 buff I wasn't particularly expecting anything great from this film because Hollywood is known for embellishing any historical event they can get their hands on. I went in knowing it would be a good movie but whether it was accurate I was not sure until the movie began. The way Enemy was filmed showed the horrors of war to the extent that we saw in Saving Private Ryan which also was a modern masterpiece. Though parts of the movie are embellished it is still one of the best war films I've seen since U571 and Saving Private Ryan and quite a few others.The movie portrays the battle of Stalingrad, which was Hitler's attempt to conquer Russia and also his undoing. During the conflict, a hero surfaces in the form of young Sniper Vasilli Zaizev who has an evident talent for killing the enemy with deadly accuracy. A political officer makes him a national hero after witnessing young Zaitzev's skill and places him into the Soviet sniper devision. After losing too many men to Zaitzev's deadly aim, Major Konig, a german sniper equal to Zaitzev is sent to search him out and kill him and the conflict begins.Enemy at the Gates shows not only the horrors of war but how sniper combat is in real life and how much patience and disipline is actually required to be a marksman. However there is only one problem with Enemy and that is the love triangle that develops when the political officer and Zaitzev fall in love with the same female sniper. It was completely unnessesary and uncalled for. The love triangle takes away from an otherwise great film. All in all it was as brutal as SPR but not as poorly made as The Thin Red Line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was good, but not as good as the history lesson trying to be taught. Enemy at the Gates to me appeared to be an attempt at showing the Americans watching the film how Russia fought their wars. Soldiers were conscripted not drafted. A minor change in words, I know, but the use of words affects the morale of the "soldier". The whole war of attrition idea of overwhelm the enemy with numbers as opposed to the idea of a war being fought with movements, ambushes, and other strategies. The movie uses Saving Private Ryan realism cinematography to try to depict this. Also, it shows the use of propaganda officers in the Russian army to boost unit moral. The whole sniper vs. sniper part of the movie was interesting, graphic, and kept the audience on the edge of their seat with intense suspense, but I don't think that was the main point of the movie. My congratulations go the actors though. Harris, Law, Fiennes, and Weisz acted well and supported the story well. Weisz and Law did exceptionally well in portraying the citizen soldiers fighting for their homeland.</fullReview>

Once all of the characters had been introduced, everything became heavy handed and predictable. Jude Law does a good job of looking beautiful, but didn't convince me an innocent peasant. Joseph Fiennes was a bit over intense, but fit the role of a stereotyped Jewish shyster surprisingly well. Rachel Weisz's character ends up the typical push-over action movie romantic lead. After appearing tough as nails, she proves completely useless at the films climax.The underlying story actually had some real potential: A peasant who is elevated as a hero at a low point in the war for the Soviets. However, by turning him into a super-hero, adding lots of graphic violence (lots of close-ups of being people shot in the head) and mixing in the love story, they cheapen his story.</fullReview>

The actors all do fair to good work, with the exception of Ed Harris, who is outstanding as the blue-blooded German officer sent to kill Jude Law. His performance proves yet again that you don't have to have to use a lot of dialogue to make an impression or convey the essence of a character.

		<fullReview>I went to see this a couple weeks ago. I sat through the film thinking how it wasn't a "Saving Private Ryan" rip-off. Some of the battle scenes kind of resemble "SPR", but that is only because "SPR" raised the bar for violence in war films. The first scene of Jude Law as a child was interesting. It showed that not everyone is perfect. Plus, I liked that they didn't finish the scene until later in the film, it was something to think about. The acting is very good. Jude Law is an up and coming actor who deserves more attention than he recieves. Joseph Feinz is good as a war propagandist who just wants to win. Rachel Weisz did better than she did in "The Mummy". And Bob Hoskins was great in his role. But my problem with his is everytime I saw him I just thought about him as Mario. I don't want to sound like a pervert or anything but I want to comment on the sex scene. I personally thought it was funny. The fact that they were surrounded by sleaping soldiers and she couldn't make a noice was funny, her facial expressions made me giggle a little too. I'm not a sick-o, but I actually found the sex scene humorous. I would defiantly recommend the film to people.

		<shortDescription>Plot Summary of Enemy at the Gates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie which I have chosen to do this paper on is the suspenseful, `edge of your seat', Enemy at the Gates. The story follows events based on the exploits of a young Russian sniper during the battle of Stalingrad in 1942. Vasilli Zaitsev, is used as a hero and an example for the demoralized Russian people. He becomes as popular as a movie star, which attracts some unwanted attention. The Germans send in their prize elite sniper, Major Koenig, to deal with the situation. The storyline follows the actions of the two skilful snipers and the constant struggle between man vs. man. This story uses heavy conflict, which as a clash of actions, ideals, and side which is heavily physical and morally based. The movie shows its view clearly of who it thinks the protagonist and antagonist are. Depending on our own personal view, we may also have a different preference. The movie tries to really emphasize the struggle of man vs. man by shadowing out all other side events which may hinder the one on one feeling of tension throughout. The movie does have a surprise ending if you do not know the actual story, and if you believe that the protagonist could lose. But it turns out that it has a `happy ending', the hero must solve his problems, defeat the villain and win the girl. Although I thoroughly enjoyed `Enemy at the Gates' for its historical storyline, special effects, and well done acting by the two snipers, it was a bit weak in some areas. The actual plot was quite weak because it happens just like a predictable `bad guy gets his, and good guy gets glory and the girl'. There also were other instances of weaknesses in the plot which added to its almost `staleness'. But I find it makes up for these discrepancies with the rich character portraits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destined to be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stalingrad, reduced to a "Mad Max" landscape, is the background for a film which does far more than simply prove that "War is Hell." Not since "Red Badge of Courage" have we had such sympathy for the plight of the foot soldier, treated as a renewable resource by generals. A Russian country bumpkin (Law, Jude) with talented shooting skills is elevated to hero status (think "Sergeant York") by a publicity producing political officer (Fiennes, Joseph) and thus becomes a target for famed German sharpshooter (Harris, Ed). We see glimpses of a young Krushchev (Hoskins, Bob) and hear about the extermination of Russian Jews. But the real focus of the film is a search for purity of spirit. As in "Casablanca," the love triangle will pivot on which suitor is the most worthy. Self-sacrifice starts with the opening scene, as civilians vacate train cars to make way for soldiers headed to the front, and culminates with amazing clarity in the final scenes. It is destined to be a classic. Our great-grandchildren will know this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had the potential to be a classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Some minor spoilers*The film started very well, the grand opening sequence a very obvious 'look and learn' at Saving Private Ryan, although the excellent cinematography was spoiled somewhat by the needless orchestral score underneath - yes we know it's a very grim war scene thank you. The score served to take away an element of the depressing situation of Stalingrad, which the film should be trying to exploit. Just the noise of bombs, shouting and the like would have been far more powerful.The acting and character development was pretty subtle (a very impressive performance by Joseph Fiennes) and the atmosphere created was genuinely gripping. Even the casting of Bob Hoskins as Nikita Kruschev worked.So during the first half of the film I was convincing myself that this had what it takes to be a classic, a kind of cross between the best pyschological elements in Alien, with the cinematography techniques of Ryan and (gasp) a plot that unlike Ryan, wasn't (quite) patently ridiculous. And also the portrayal of the Russians (and lack of Americans) was quite refreshing.But then unfortunately it all went a bit pear shaped thanks to the uneccessary shoe-horning in of a fairly pointless love interest, Tania Chernova (poorly acted by Rachel Weisz) which extended the film beyond my (and, it appeared, a large amount of the cinema audiences) attention span and served only to irritate. A couple of points:1) Yes, I know it's a British film and the introduction of the 'bird' will give it extra box-office takings, especially in the US.2) Yes, I know that it will draw more people to see the film than would neccessarily be the case (and they would learn something about a historical event, which can't be a bad thing).But what I object to was its 'forced' insertion. During the first half of the film Chernova was a plot element and it was obvious that something would happen, but it was kept as background to the main story and fairly well woven in, without distracting from the point. And then suddenly during the film it's like "Damn, we've got this character and we'd better do something with her, otherwise we'll have the execs on backs" - so cue her subtle (as a sledgehammer) pasting all over the screen, detracting (badly) from what was a fantastic plot and character devlopment.Sad, as I feel that this reduced the film to an above-average MOR war flick, which was a shame really. Yet another lesson that Brit films can't 'do' (and probably shouldn't want to do) vacuous Hollywood love scmaltz techniques (unless it stars Hugh Grant of course).7/10.</fullReview>

For those who think this detracts, might it be that a hero like Vassili might attract the attention of a woman who, it actually turns out in real life was a hard fighter.

		<fullReview>This movie was really close to great. It's hard to say exactly where it missed. The love story part was a tad too cheesy I think. The war scenes were fantastic, very well done. I was horrified when I was supposed to be. The truth of battle being a terrifying, confusing and dirty business was well done. The acting was also quite good. Ed Harris in particular is very good as you might expect. I guess it must be something in the pacing as I looked at my watch twice, both times during the romantic bits. Don't get me wrong, I'm actually a sucker for romance but there was just something not quite right. My wife complained that Russians shouldn't sound British and maybe they shouldn't but at least nobody was trying (badly) to sound Russian which would bother me more.All in all I could recommend this for the fighting/sniper scenes. It's decent but it's not great. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep and meaningful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on one of the most significant historical battles ever, and yes maybe this film does lack some of the historical facts and may also at times takes you away from the true and complex Stalingrad story. I do not claim to be a big historian but to even try and get across a tiny amount of the suffering that occurred in Stalingrad would be impossible and also make for an incredibly sad and deeply heart wrenching film.This film was very entertaining and keeps you focused to it all the way through with both its wonderful attention to detail and its brilliant focus on the human nature, it does not glorify war or portray any super human heroes who will save all. War is not just about fighting as `Saving Private Ryan' helped proved, war is about human nature and people and I feel that this film helps demonstrate this very well.There are so many different pockets of narrative to get involved with, all of which truly draw your full attention. I think that the director has preformed a wonderful job in making a deeply emotional film which at the same time does not drag the viewers deep into the realms of depression, Stalingrad is a dark and sad place which this film clearly shows but at the same time it truly highlights the strength of the human sprit to rise above such turmoil and suffering. The entangling love story that weaves it way though his movie definitely builds this film into to deep and enthralling story of not just death and destruction but of people and feelings, the film helps us understand the nature of war but it also helps us understand the nature of people, it demonstrates courage, valour, jealously, sorrow, desolation and love.A wonderful film and a must see, it will truly move you. A wonderful cinema epic that encapsulates an amazing chapter of Russian history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Depressing film, sure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but that doesn't make it a bad one. I watched this film with my mum, and she came out of the cinemea asking why they had to make films with such depressing content. I had to explain to her that this was based on a real life story, and that the makers couldn't sweep the more shocking subject matters under the carpet simply because it would upset people too much.*****PLOT SPOILERS**** I guess what really got to people was Ed Harris (Sorry, I forget his on-screen name) killing the little boy. It was one of the most shocking scenes in the film when they saw him hanging, and it was one that left a sour taste in the mouth of everybody watching. But that's war is. It's not pretty, it's not heroic, and it's definitely not glamorous. People did die, and there's nothing we can do to change that.But there were moments of genuine warmth. The relationship between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz was very real, and thoroughly watchable. Law was perfectly cast as Vissili, as was Ed Harris in his role. The downbeat ending was good; it didn't seem to be a cop-out like most war films tend to opt for.This film had faults, sure, but there was so many redeeming features that it doesn't matter. I saw the film almost three weeks ago now, and it's still playing in my mind. It's a relevant film, and one that everybody should be made to watch. And for those people complaining about the British accents, count yourself lucky they weren't putting on fake Russian accents!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jean-Jacques Annaud and DP Robert Fraisse come up with a visual style I'm not sure I like, but know I haven't seen before. They've figured out a way to make big effects shots (Stalingrad being bombed by German planes) look cool without looking like they used a lot of CG. For all I know, they did use a lot. I'm just saying. They definitely succeed in giving `Enemy' a murky, dirty, even smelly look.It's a really good war film too. Not that it's the best one ever, but it has all the necessary elements of a great war film: Intricate, well-staged battle scenes; human drama; showing mankind both at its lowest and at its most noble. The war movie brings together the elements of many genres to create a genre of its own.Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins) enforced Stalin's policy of killing on sight any soldier retreating out of fear. Annaud's telling of this tale creates a fascinating paradox. Where does the courage to resist the Germans come from if the alternative is going on living in Stalin's society? Talk about choosing the lesser of two evils.The backbone of the story is how Hope alone may have stopped the advance of Nazi forces in Stalingrad at the end of 1943. A political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) believes the city will fall unless its soldiers are given some sign of hope. He decides they need a hero and finds one in Vassili Zaitsev, a sharp-shooter who may be the finest in all of Russia. No German high-ranking officer is safe with Zaitsev within range of him. Within days, he's a national hero (a true story) and is Germany's number one enemy. They send (or does he come of his own accord?) Major Koenig (Ed Harris), their own champion sniper, to find Zaitsev and kill him.Each man is aware of the other and try and guess the others' next move. Each side uses its champion to inspire its soldiers. The news of either man's death, especially by the other's bullet, could turn the tide of the battle unlike any other event. What a great idea for a film--and executed to near perfection to boot. The love story and other subplots that accompany the two champions' struggle serve their purpose--they give the characters their souls.In a perfect world, this film would have been made with Russian and German-speaking actors with subtitles for the benefit of us Westerners. I know I would have enjoyed it more and taken it much, much more seriously if they'd gone the other way with it. Annaud wasn't of like thinking with Ang Lee, who could easily have made `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in english.Then again why wasn't, say, `Schindler's List' told in its characters' native tongues? The reasons for both films being in english are identical and, valid. In a film in which many language are spoken, sometimes it helps to unify the communication by having everyone speak one language. It's also a matter of knowing who your audience is going to be. Annaud knew he wanted this film to target a Western audience. As long as Russians aren't offended by it being in english, I have no problem with it. But like I said, I'd rather it were in Russian and German.`Enemy at the Gates' is a fascinating, exciting film. It's got everything you could want in a war film, but also goes a step beyond. The Battle of Stalingrad is a key moment not only in the history of Russia, but in the history of the world. Unfortunately, this may be the only education some people receive on the subject. So be it. It's certainly better than nothing.Grade: B</fullReview>

I am a person that had great hopes for the movie 'the patriot', but was sad to see the Americans win the battle of Gilford Court House. A deviation from the historical records is understandable, but many movies destroy the point history.Everyone should know that the historical record of the sniper dual in enemy at the gates is myth (or a legend). That is not to say that it did not happen, no one really knows. Most of what we know about that day is propaganda. I have read the propaganda on the dual, and I do not think that any sniper would behave as stupidly as this top German sniper. At the same time, I do think that the dual happened. Maybe it did have the strange ending that is shown in the movie. Who knows?Historically, the movie is very accurate (from my knowledge). The crossing of the Volga was done during the day in the movie, but most (if not all) river crossings were done at night. But the results were the same. My friend said that he saw a T-34-85 in the movie. If there was one in there, than it was incorrect. I did not see it. As far as I know, this movie was historically on the money. (Note: I do not know much on uniforms or rifles of the red army)It is refreshing to see a movie about something important, that does not pertain to America.</fullReview>

The soldiers can't trust anyone but themselves, and that isn't enough on a city that is only a huge battlefield. The complete movie is as the beginning of Saving Private Ryan - but in this movie all the action and all the war is beliveable! They actually do all this suffering for a reason!I like this movie. Not because it is one of the first European movies to be a big action-packed, high-energy special-effects flick, but because the story is really enjoying, the love-scenes are a perfect match in the film, and FINALLY a film where females and men are equal! Enemy at the Gates is a good movie. And it is probably one of the best war-movies ever made. And it is probably one of the best European movies to hit the silver screen.

		<fullReview>It could have been the Achilles heal of expectation, or the hang over from the sick feeling of seeing Julia Roberts win an academy award, but this movie was simply terrible. Jean-Jacques Annaud had it all before him, a historic individual confrontation, the most epic battle of World War II, and the luxury of having the film released months before the Jerry Bruckheimer tainted "Pearl Harbor" yet he managed to waste it all. Rather than focus on the litany of human and military dramas of the battle for Stalingrad, Annaud gave us a formulaic love triangle complete with story book ending. In today's Hollywood, cinematic convenience is the standard rather than the exception. Yet "Enemy..." asks the audience to not just to suspend their belief, but to shelve it. The battle between Vassili Zaitsev and Major Koenig is littered with so many holes it is insulting. The total lack of creativity is perhaps no more glaring than in the complete waste of Ron Perlman's character Koulikov, whose death arises out of circumstances so lacking in believability I thought I walked into a John Woo film. Insipid dialogue, poor attention to continuity, and plot break downs make Charlie a dull fish. If you must, rent this film, but do not support it at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very entertaining and I would highly recommend it. The opening sequence was effectively, frighteningly intense. I would expect this film to be in the running at next years Academy awards for production and set design, cinematography and art direction. The performances were very good, especially Jude Law, Ed Harris, and Rachel Weisz. Jude Law takes on a role that is essentially an 180 degree departure from the ebullient and confident Dickie Greenleaf (`The Talented Mr. Ripley'). His character in this movie is shy and humble, a simple farmer put into extraordinary circumstances and having to live up to a larger than life image as a hero, given to him by the Soviet political officer who uses him as an example and a morale booster. As the movie progresses you can see the changes in his face showing the cumulative effect of the stresses his character has to endure on a daily basis. By the end of the movie he is exhausted both mentally and physically. The dialogue is rather sparse and simplistic, probably because it was written in English by a Frenchman, but it propels the storyline adequately. The movie's strength is really in the battle and several gripping cat-and-mouse sniper sequences, anyway. Much of the emotion and mood of the scenes was represented by the actor's facial expressions and the director's chosen emphasis on their eyes. Despite many opinions to the contrary I thought the super-slow and super-quiet sex scene was touching, tender and very erotic (even though they were fully covered). *SPOILERS* follow....The director chose to change the way the sniper's duel was resolved, maybe because he felt seeing Vassili pick the German off from a great distance wouldn't be as dramatic as a final, face-to-face confrontation. Also, the final scene seemed almost an afterthought, but I left the theater feeling satisfied with the movie as a whole.</fullReview>

Thefirst ten minutes are engrossing - I thought that the film really hadsome great potential - but then it falters by concentrating for fartoo long on the sniper vs. sniper storyline. This is built up over the2+ hours this film runs, and then stutters in its conclusion. EdHarris comes and goes without notice. Bob Hoskins gives asimilarly forgettable performance.

		<shortDescription>Truly one of the great WW II films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the titanic significance of WW II to the history of our century and because of the true heroism (in the meaningful sense of the word) shown by so many people who gave their all to defeat this century's antichrist, the moral prerequisite of any film about the subject is authenticity. We owe it to all those who gave so much to tell their stories as close to the way it was as far as we can determine(not necessarily about real incidents but about what it was like). Saving Private Ryan earned the accolades of veterans for that reason and Enemy at the Gates follows suit. `Enemy' adds the extra whollup of biography: there was just such a hero in the battle of Stalingrad. The producers and directors also get credit for making the contributions of the Russians to winning the war as their subject matter. As some historians have pointed out, this contribution is often overlooked because of the seedy history of Stalinist communism and the chronic, postwar, anticommunistic hysteria of Americans. With that preparation, Annauld gives us a bone-chilling account of the kinds of horrific sacrifices the Russians made. The battle scenes are equally horrific in their realism to those in `Ryan'. Like `Ryan', it thereby reminds us continuously of the nature of the heroism: that ordinary, peace-loving, sensitive people could apply themselves to this hateful work, contrary to their inclinations and preferences. All the other elements that are required to support this presentation (production values, acting, directing, etc.) are first class in this film. This is one of the all time greats. See it and be sure your kids see it so they understand what all these people did for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Warning, not that there is much to spoil.Oh dear. Well, where to begin really? Firstly lets take the claim that it's based on a true story. Mm? Well unfortunately, even though the central character DID actually exist, the rest of the story was just highly successful red army propaganda. Well at least the russians could write, a skill the author of this woeful nonsense seems to have mislaid. But if the script is bad, and oh yes, it is very, very bad, the acting (or indeed lack thereof) only serves to highlight this. The director in his infinite wisdom, decided that a film depicting russians and germans, should be peopled almost entirely by actors speaking some strange fake cockney accent. Imagine the idiot halfbreed offspring of Damon Albarn and the cast of Spinal Tap, and you have some idea of the cringe inducing sound coming out of Jude "when are you going to take some acting lessons?" Law's mouth. Rachel "I only got this job because the director fancies me" Weisz, perfect as the ditzy airhead librarian in the Mummy, would have been the ideal choice for this film, if only her character was SUPPOSED to be a ditzy airhead sniper. There are, regrettably, numerous scenes of Rachel and Jude simpering over each other before going off to fight battles in the early morning, returning each day to curl up safe and sound in secret bunkers. Heaven only knows what would have happened if the germans had actually attacked outside of office hours. Only Ed Harris, impeccable as always, as the fictional Koenig, is beyond reproach. The rest? Well, you have east-end gangster Kruschev, posh boy from drama school, one of the Fiennes brothers (not the good one), and numerous unknowns grateful for their first (and probably last) chance of appearing on the big screen. Shot ON 35mm? They should have been shot WITH a 9mm. To be fair, it's not all bad. Some scenes, mercifully silent, of the duels between the protagonists are fairly tense, ruined only when someone utters the next line of drivel, but even this one glimmer of creativity is spoilt by director Arnaud's ill-judged tribute to Sergio Leone. A Clint Eastwood ending has no business in a supposed historical drama, I paid to see the battle for Stalingrad, not "A fist full of roubles". This film was 2 hours of my life wasted. 5 out of 10 (only Ed Harris keeps it from being a four.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not miss, it's a pretty good surprise. Unlike Saving Private Ryan the story is very good yet the actions scenes do not suffer. The river scene is incredible and the whole movie is original compared to so many other war movies that get repetitive or are just déj? vu. I loved Ed Harris (you wont forget his Nazi elite sniper role), and everyone else as well. If you want to see another pro american war movie you'll be sorry because there's none :) Also read Troyal G. Brooks' review, he may not consider it the best war movie but I do. By all means give it a try! Great job Annaud!</fullReview>

Like Titanic, the drama of the real life event is more than enough to make a movie good. The love story just isn't needed.

		<shortDescription>Rattenkrieg: See It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are, in fact, ample historical accounts of the actual existence of Vassili Zaitsev, Heinz Thorvald (Ed Harris' Major Koenig in this film) and a female sniper companion to Zaitsev, Tania Chernova, notwithstanding a previous reviewer's criticism. See Beevor, Chuikov, Werth, there are others, including an account from Zaitsev himself ("Za Volgoi zemli dlia nas ne bylo": translated, 'For us, there was no land beyond the Volga'). As for "Enemy At the Gates", this is a smashing film (pardon the adjective). Substantially accurate, it not only tells the story of the individual contributions of reluctant heroes, but also more broadly depicts an epic battle that concluded by demonstrating to the world that the German Wehrmacht was not invincible, that the Red Army and its civilians not only had absorbed Hitler's best punch but countered it with one of their own, culminating in Generalfeldmarshall Friedrich von Paulus' surrender of the German Sixth Army and, two years later, the defeat of the Third Reich itself.The setting for this film takes place during a time when the German Wehrmacht had suffered no significant defeats whatsoever. When von Paulus surrendered his Sixth Army at the end of January, 1943, the price of victory for the Russians, after five months of what the Germans referred to as der kessel, the cauldron, was 750,000 killed. For the Germans? Four hundred thousand killed not including another 300,000 of their allies, the Italians, Hungarians and Rumanians. The civilian population of Stalingrad was reduced from a prewar half million men, women and children to 1500 civilians.The shift of pace and mood between the train ride to the disembarkation site on the east side of the Volga and, following that, the panic of replacements being ferried across the Volga to the charred remains of the city, is comparable to the scenes of the LSTs approaching and landing on Omaha Beach in "Saving Private Ryan". The haplessness of new recruits being cast into the fray, only half of them with rifles, to die either by being cut to pieces by the Germans or, if they fled, cut to pieces by Red Army troops in the rear positions at the direction of the political commissars, sets the mood of dispair and terror difficult to imagine without the sophistication of modern film making. In this sense, special effects are used very effectively to enhance and drive home the chaos and continuous terror of urban warfare.Naturally, the principle point of interest is the "High Noon" contest between Major Koenig (Ed Harris) and Zaitsev (Jude Law) and their dance to terminate one another. This tension, broken only by the love affair between Zaitsev and Tania (Rachel Weisz), should keep anyone who isn't insensate gripped by the developing events leading to Zaitsev's ultimate triumph-that delivered, ultimately, by his "promoter" and rival for Tania's affections, Danilov.Minor beef: The unaccented English throughout was welcome-though, the dialog coaches needed to decide if "Vassily" was "VA-ssily or Va-SSI-ly-First or second syllable stress: "Shto Eta?" (Russian pronunciation favors second stress)The German foot soldiers, by the way, privately responded to Hitler's "Fortress Stalingrad" designation of the Sixth Army's encirclement at Stalingrad with a label of their own: "Rattenkrieg"-"War of the Rats"-a more fitting picture of their lice infested, starving existences . The Russians, of course, faired no better.I enjoyed this film very much, though it is violent and disturbing. It offers those of us who lived close to those WWII years a poignant reminder that it was a time never so good to us as the times we live in now. And a wakeup call for the rest of us who think that our comfortable lives are forever a normal feature of a peaceful existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great WWII Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note to my fellow history buffs: No movie set during an historical event is 100% accurate, no matter how good it is. Not Saving Private Ryan, not Glory, not Apollo 13, not Gettysburg, not Titanic. Stuff gets condensed, stuff gets left out and some stuff is added on in the interests of drama. Once you can deal with this, you'll not only have a much better time at the movies, you'll also be less likely to annoy the people you go to the movies with. That and you get to have the fun of e-mailing all the little goofs in to IMDB.You know a movie has to be good when the biggest gripes people have about it are the accents. Yes, all the major Russians seemed to have studied at Oxford, and an accent coach would have been nice. And yes, in the many scenes when it's sniper vs. sniper, the huge Russian and German armies seemed to have disappeared completely. Other then that, there was very little to groan about in this movie. Ed Harris had a powerful screen presence, and the major Russian characters played by Jude Law, Joeseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz played well off each other, even without the benefit of Russian accents.  The story is an excellent balance of excitement and suspense. There is an explosive, in-your-face action battle scene which the only half armed Red army gets clobbered in turn by German Stukas, tanks, and machine guns, and tense, uptight sequences where the two expert snipers stalk each other. I'll recommend this for any WWII fan, suspense movie fan, Harris/ Law/ J.Fiennes/ Weisz fan and any movie historian who's starting to get the feeling that Hollywood has been giving a just little too much credit to the US contribution in WWII recently (U-571, Saving Private Ryan). Enemy is a welcome movie that gives the sufferings and the heroism of the Soviets their due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Enemy" Doesn't Quite Make It To The "Gates"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In war, during a prolonged battle-- the outcome of which will be pivotal to the efforts of both sides-- death becomes a fact of life and the decline of morale among the troops follows in it's wake. What better way, then, to bolster the spirits of those who must fight and die than by giving them a hero? For once established, even if he is killed, the hero will have served his purpose, for the martyr is just as potent in death as the hero is in life. In `Enemy At the Gates,' directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the Russians and Germans, in September of 1942, have reached an impasse during the siege of Stalingrad. Casualties continue to mount on both sides and the Russians especially are beginning to feel the weight of what seems to be a futile effort, though this is the city that must not fall to the enemy at any cost. When Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives to take charge and solicits ideas from his officers as to how they may turn the tide of the battle, a young political officer in charge of propaganda, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) steps forward and proffers a hero, a soldier from among the ranks he knows to be a marksman of exceptional ability. His name is Vasily Zaitsev (Jude Law), and with Danilov's newspaper touting his exploits, Vasily soon becomes the hero of the Russian people who rallies them to the cause. Quickly aware of the situation, however, the Germans waste no time in bringing in a sharpshooter of their own, Major Konig (Ed Harris), specifically for the purpose of hunting down and eliminating Zaitsev. And so, in the pitch of battle, the duel between the two becomes the focus of attention, the outcome of which will seemingly be viewed as victory or defeat by and for the armies of both sides. Early in the film, Annaud creates a sense of urgency and tension that promises to sweep you along to the climax, and the anticipation of an involving emotional experience at that point is high. Unfortunately, even as the siege reaches an impasse, so does the film. About half way through it all begins to sputter, and you begin to get the feeling that the promises made at the beginning will never be fulfilled. And you're right. Failing to elicit the necessary emotional involvement from the audience, it finally stalls altogether and by the time you get to the end it seems almost anticlimactic. Overall, the film suffers from it's own ambition; it attempts to be of a much larger scale and more profound than it really is. Annaud apparently intended to make a sweeping epic and an intimate, character driven film at the same time, but the formula for any success in the endeavor eluded him. By interjecting and concentrating on too many elements involving the relationships between the characters, he minimizes the importance of the duel itself, and thereby diminishes the impact of it--especially the outcome-- that greatly affects the success of the film. Distracting as well is the fact that all of the Russians have class-distinctive British accents, which makes their credibility a bit hard to swallow. The high point of the film would have to be Jude Law's performance as the sniper, Vasily Zaitsev. He manages enough emotional depth and lends a bearing to the character that make him believable, though there is one lapse near the end when during a particularly emotional scene he briefly slips into a such a `Cockney' dialect that it takes you out of the moment. That one exception aside, it's a solid performance. Ed Harris delivers a notable performance, as well, though far removed from the best work he's ever done. Though he affects a fairly stoic countenance, he never quite achieves the enigmatic quality that would've made a dramatic impact as a counterpoint to Zaitsev's more overt humanness. Rachel Weisz comports herself well as Tania, the woman who impacts the lives of Danilov and Vasily, but the role is far from challenging. There is some chemistry between her and Law, however, and their scenes together create what little emotional apex there is to the film. Surprisingly, the low point of the film is the performance given by Joseph Fiennes, a terrific actor who was so outstanding in `Shakespeare In Love.' Any depth of character he achieves here, as Danilov, seems feigned, and his whole delivery is simply too melodramatic to be entirely effective. As the director, of course, Annaud is the one who must ultimately be held accountable for it. And it illustrates just how much impact the expertise (or lack thereof) of the director can have on a film, for even the best actors must rely on the instincts of their director, as well as their own, to keep them on task. The supporting cast includes Ron Perlman (Koulikov), Gabriel Thomson (Sasha) and Eva Mattes (Mother Filipov). Though based on a true story, and dealing with a significant historical event-- that being the battle of Stalingrad itself-- `Enemy At the Gates,' simply does not deliver what could have been an engrossing cinematic experience. It's not a bad movie, by any means, and it certainly has it's moments; but in the final analysis, it's just another movie, and not a very memorable one at that. I rate this one 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See war from a different perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A darn good war movie, drawing heavily from the "realism" school of battle scene filming that has become the standard in the past several years. Very good performances by Jude Law and Ed Harris anchor the film, while the rest of the solid cast does everything expected of them. I especially liked Bob Hoskins's performance as an overbearing, foul-mouthed, and fully believable Nikita Krushchev.Historically speaking, don't see this film as a replacement for your World War II textbooks. As one historian once wrote: "It is fiction, based on a grain of truth." However if you look hard enough, there are also accurate insights on the nature of the war. The overwhelming manpower of the Red Army versus the mechanical superiority of the German Army is highlighted on several occasions. Also nicely shown were the propaganda battles that were being waged simultaneously to the bloody fighting in the streets. Remember that Vassily Zaitsev was real, almost everything else is fiction or at best a guess.There is a romance in the movie, and it too is surprisingly well done. Normally I find attempts to weave a genuine love story into war movies a useless endeavor. In this case, because the romantic story line remained understated in terms of total screen time, I thought it delivered nicely. It allows us the human side of war and gives us someone to root for.Finally, the problems with the movie. First and foremost, there is a time to wax poetic about the nature of man's choices of governmental theory, and there are times to shut up and hope you don't get shot. Most of the battle for Stalingrad I'd think would fall into the latter category. In short, there are scenes that could have been cut. With a running time of around 2 hours and 15 minutes, this film would have worked just fine at 2 hours. Secondly, I don't mind a disparity in accents, but please don't have the background extra characters singing in Russian or yelling in German when the main characters are speaking English. It only serves to remind me that almost everyone is technically speaking the wrong language, English.All in all though, I recommend this movie. Get inside the head of a sniper for a few hours, and see war from a different perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing But Without A Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I really liked Enemy, I couldn't but wonder why for so much concentration on the main characters we never really found out much about their past and what made them do what they do. Overall the movie wasn't a "Saving Private Ryan" which in itself wasn't a bad thing. I particularly liked the interplay between Law and Harris and the low tech but high minded duel between the two. What would have been even better was a Russian produced film with a Russian script and Russian directed film. I came away from the film wondering if the portrayal in the movie was severely bias against today's America's so called "enemy". The movie was richly lavish, the context, texture, the patience all made the movie a delightful thriller and emotional package. Ed Harris came across real well both as a person and cold-bloodedness. The real debate here is who really was the better sniper? [3/30/08]: This movie really holds up well with repeating viewing and whether or not the past of these characters are revealed seems to be irrelevant to the real here and now, present concern about love, male competition. The fascinating interplay of two plot lines - the eventual sniper duel and the love triangle make for a balanced and intellectually, emotionally satisfying connection. The double-agent spy in the form of a little boy is even intriguing along with the eventual outcome of the boy's mother. There is epic mythology, media propaganda, the infamous Krushchev, inevitable Premier of Russia. This movie remains a strong 8/10 and even improves with age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was very close to a great war epic---right up until Paramount Pictures got to it. The horrific story starts out like Private Ryan, then degrades into your standard Hollywood War Love Triangle picture. All they needed to do was tell the story of the Zaitsev character accurately, and they were guaranteed to be in the league with Apocalypse Now and Platoon. But the marketing interests had their way, and the picture went downhill fast. Too bad---the production values were excellent, and this could have been an epic---And next time, if you are casting Russians and Germans, at least try to cast people with no accents. The English accents detracted quite a bit from the realism this movies initially establishes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oy! Spare me another Hollywood ending--I wanted to hurl when I left the theater. I won't give it away here, though. The only thing that kept this movie from sinking beneath the weight of all that schmaltz and expository dialogue (just in case we couldn't follow the action) was the performance of Jude Law as the Russian sniper. Law is a chamelonic actor whose performances in films as diverse as "Talented Mr. Ripley," "eXistenZ," "Wilde," etc., have been consistently excellent.The other bright point in the film was the brief appearance of Ron Perlman as a fellow sharpshooter who is sent to help Vassily (Law). Perlman is always worth watching and isn't afraid to exploit his unusual looks. (Catch him in "Island of Dr. Moreau,"--an otherwise dreadful film--"Name of the Rose,"--an OK movie--and the very odd, visually riveting "City of Lost Children." And, oh yeah--does anyone remember the TV series "Beauty and the Beast"? Guess which part Perlman played...)I suppose the reason they put in the love triangle was to capture the female demographic. As a female myself, I say "Shame on you, Jean-Jacques!" (Annaud--the writer and director.) Don't you think us women can't enjoy a straight war drama if it's done well?! Puh-leeze....Anyway, I was vindicated. I only went to this movie because my boyfriend wanted to see it. I had a good idea before I set foot in the theater that it wasn't going to bowl me over, but once the film rolled, and a voiceover came on to set us up, I knew we were doomed...Told ya so, sweetie!</fullReview>

All the actors put in good performances particularly ed harris. The film basically never gets to grips with its material or the setting. Are we grateful to the russians for saving us from fascism and being utterly cruel and heartless in the process or should we revile them as they were in the cold war ? This is not a dilemma the film answers but just raises over and over while pointing out these are all people who love and hate and are weak and strong and they are in a war, apart from that the war could be anywhere. Lack of vision is what i'm talking about. For example the film actually opens to tell how far the "german jackboot" has put its heel into Europes back, well so what if you were unaware of a war in Russia or a place called Stalingrad in history this piece of information is next to useless to citizens of 2001. It is clumsy and at best school room history. Then theres the whole issue of the central character and his conscience over killing so many for whatever cause. Little effort is made to see inside the characters beyond some minor lines about the obvious side of killing for example Zaitsev explains to a would be sniper that these are real people they are killing but he could be talking about buying cucumbers at the supermarket for all his zeal in the task. The script is poor and does no service for a new europe seeking truths in the past for all that the film is just another technical production success with a well acted drama element not untypical of a tv show like wings of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adventure worth waiting for video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The war drama definitely lived up to its nickname "Saving Comrade Ryan" in my eyes. After beginning with a great opening, from the soldiers arriving at the Russian docks and thrown directly into the battle - to the first semblance of battle on Russian soil, this movie takes and amazing downturn and never recovers.In a movie about Russian and Germans, the last thing I expected was that all characters in the movie would have British accents (except Ed Harris who had an American accent). And if this was not bad enough, the film makers had to flaunt this on film by letting us know that indeed, they did not care about making this movie believable. Case in point: When Fiennes' character was dictating a letter to Law's character, Fiennes told Law how to spell something... using ENGLISH LETTERS. I can understand the use of the English language, so the audience could understand, but the least they could have done is made the effort to pretend they were speaking Russian, and either have told him how to spell it in Russian, or just scrap the scene.Their are many more reasons, but I think these reasons alone make it a bad film.One last thing. In a movie where suspense should have been so easily achievable, the lack of it is unforgivable.</fullReview>

Jude Law does an excellent job of acting without speaking much. Even he manages to look grubby most of the time -- and for someone who first saw him in 'Gattica' that seemed darn near impossible. I'm not a big fan of love triangles, but they managed to not mess up the movie with this one. Applause for all involved. I just thank my lucky stars that I was not born into that conflict myself -- I'd be one of the dead ones, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horrors of war broken down to the lowest common denominator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nameless bodies floating face down in the Volga River or boats blown to pieces from bombs dropped by Stukka dive bombers is war as we have sort of known it in films, but when it gets down to the cross hairs in a high powered sniper gun being fixed on a enemy that you could recognize in a police line up for example, is another matter. "Enemy at the Gates" puts the cross hairs directly on the mark. I'm a big Ed Harris fan and he is wonderful again as Nazi super sniper Major Koenig, but Jude Law takes the day as Russian hero Vassily Zaitsev. This film is stark and real almost to a fault, but in the end it is a battle of wills of two men. One is described as a Bavarian aristocrat and the other a farm boy from the Urals. Throw in a grand performance by Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and a generally wonderful cast and you got an "eight" out of ten. Since I reserve "10's" for perfection, I have yet to see such a thing. I rated "Saving Private Ryan" as a nine, so if the blood and guts of real war bother you, stay home, otherwise go see this one it is great.</fullReview>

Aside from a few powerful battle scenes, the movie is almost two hours of sitting around, waiting for the elusive enemy to show himself in the sniper's sights. The love plotline is cliche and feels tacked on, and not enough of the characters are likeable or memorable. And there are only about three of them. Why do these Russians have British accents? And there's no trace of anything German or Russian about any of the lead characters...underdeveloped story, overdone score, and historical errors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a frustrating movie for me to watch. Stalingrad looked like a once-great city devastated by war -- except for the clear paths through the rubble. The city at night and the interiors of buildings looked convincingly devastated -- except for the soft glow of light that radiated from some unknown point that kept any area from being completely in shadow. Haggard, grizzled, dirty, starving Russian soldiers and civilians looked like they'd been through a physical and emotional wringer -- except for Jude Law and his perfect hair or Rachel Weisz and her clean, made up face. The battle scenes, while impressive in scale never immersed me in the experience since most of the time the camera statically recorded the fight from a distance on the sideline. The plot and characters were also seemingly recorded from a distance. The writer knew which buttons to push, and pushed them all in the right order, but without much emotional involvement. The whole time I knew I should be feeling horror at watching the Russian infantry mowed down by first the Germans, then their own troops. I knew that I was supposed to hope that the two lovers who were brought together in a war lived happily ever after. A big flashing sign was almost visible over the angelic Stalingrad youth which read "care about me" and I knew I was supposed to be concerned for his well being. The actors did their best with what they had and the performances were great considering the lack of depth with which they were written. It was like that for just about every facet of the movie: you saw what they were trying to do, they just missed the target with every shot. The whole affair came off like a movie with aspirations of greatness rather than a great movie. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like `Saving Private Ryan', `Enemy at the Gates' starts off forcing the viewer to bear witness to some beautifully disturbing battle scenes. In `Ryan', American soldiers are dying at the hands of the Germans. In `Enemy', Russian soldiers are dying at the hands of the Germans and Russians, whose twisted idea of human expendability causes them to shoot any soldier who turns back. By removing the `Ryan'-style rah-rah patriotism in the first fifteen minutes, this movie earns credibility in my book.The storyline begins with Vassily Zaitsev (Jude Law), an adept marksman, saving the lives of himself and Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) by gunning down an unsuspecting group of German officers. A friendship forms, and Danilov soon after describes Vassily as a Russian hero in the propaganda he authors. Vassily, as a newly promoted sniper, becomes a national icon and draws the attention of the Germans. Reasonably, they suspect that killing Vassily would demoralize the Russian forces and send their star sniper, Major Koenig, played by famously blue-eyed Ed Harris, to stop Vassily. The movie becomes an edge-of-the-seat game of cat and mouse and even manages to work in the requisite love story, with Tania (Rachel Weisz) as the interest.Some have been critical of this film because the sniper rivalry is rumored to be fictionalized, and understandably, since the film is a multi-national effort, one would hope for an accurate history lesson in the process. I am unsure of these criticisms, but I am sure that the film, though long , is a well-done look at an often forgotten war front. The actors all put in stellar performances, but perhaps Ed Harris, as the cunning and calm German, takes the cake. Fans of war films based largely on words unsaid like `The Thin Red Line' and `Apocalypse Now' will find this movie more of the bubble gum variety, but this, in my opinion, does not detract from the film's quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am from Germany (so please be gentle with my english)and i was very intersted seeing a big european movie (a lot of german money were involved in this production)about the WW2. Stalingrad was a turning point for the war and many people on both sides died a horrible death.This film is truly a anti war movie, showing the the Beast of War with impressive scenes of dying people. The first 10 minutes are a lot like "Saving Private Ryan" with excellent music and a bitter and hopeless athmosphere. But you won´t find the bloodthirsty Nazis as hellspawn, you will find cruelty on both sides and the will to live another day.This film is called in Germany "Duell" (duel) and that is the leading story here. A russian sniper (Jude Law acting really good) and a perfect cool and blue-eyed Ed Harris as his german counterpart. They play a deadly and very intelligent cat-and-mouse play in between an bombed city.And this is the only point where you could say: "Hey, this is a lot like a Playstation game (i.e. Medal of Honor) and it looks like a lot of fun." The killing of nearly 2 million people on either sides is a background theme most of the film.Robert Fraisse handles the camera right for an action movie with a lot of close ups. So, you will get two hours of intense athmosphere and authentic pictures of a war i luckily never saw for myself.The War scenes are not gory, but keep in mind it is a war movie without glorification of the war. So deaths are shown in many ways and when a sniper hits the head of a soldier it is shown with a lot of blood.For the price of your ticket you will get a very good filmed movie with a few special effects (like a bomber squad bombing Stalingrad)and extremely good actors. The love story involved is just a bit emotion, mixed in this man made movie and the happy end not that believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful drama, historical, riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true life exploits of a Russian sniper during World War II and the German sniper sent to kill him. When the Germans start their invasion on the city of Stalingrad, a political officer Danilov, witnesses the incredible shooting skills of another comrade, Vasily Zaitsev, a young man who was taught by his grandfather to shoot. Over the following months Vasily eliminates many German officers and Danolov uses his exploits to raise moral throughout the Russian Army. The Germans bring in their own legendary sniper, Major Konig to track him down and eliminate him. What follows is a cat and mouse chase through the rubble of a destroyed city and the emotional struggle to survive. What was memorizing about this movie was the way the film makers drew the audience into the story. From the outstanding performances to the pacing and the emotional musical score, never were you given a chance to become restless or bored. Using some filming techniques seen before in Saving Private Ryan, the director really shows the brutality of the conflict between these enemies. The only failing that I would have to say about the movie would be the performers' accents. All the characters were either Russian or German, yet all the accents were British or American. Most noticeably was Rachel Weisz. She turns in a fantastic performance but her quite apparent British accent sometimes really distracts one away from the emotional attachment you might have towards the character. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone who is up for a true-life tale of amidst the horrors of war. The graphic nature of the war scenes are not so over the top to scare away the squeamish, but it is shown so be prepared.</fullReview>

I did not care because this movie is in a genre called historical fiction and of course changes will be made. People should stop complaining how this movie insults them or how its not accurate.This movie has a few similarities to Saving Private Ryan especially the beginning. This is about the battle of Stalingrad between the Germans and Russians. The Germans send their best sniper Konig to kill the young, star Russian sniper.The acting is very good. I always enjoy Ed Harris in whatever movie he acts in. Jude Law is surprisingly great in this movie. Rachel Weisz adds a great screen female presence.Overall, I thought this was a good movie but it has some flaws. There is plenty of gore and action here. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

It's definitely not a boring film,If your like me and are interested in the Eastern Front of WWII and weapons like the Mosin Nagant rifle you will find this movie very entertaining. Overall I highly recommend it,After you watch the movie I suggest you too get Vassili Zaitsev's memoirs "Notes of a sniper" that tell's the real story of the movie,you will find some of Zaitsev's real account's are portrayed in the film,like how he used pieces of glass to blind German snipers.10/10</fullReview>

This film is quite striking just for its war scenes. The Russians have so much resolve and they truly wore down the German machine. I'm sure that given a place at the Russian front terrified most German soldiers. Krueschev comes off ass despicable. Like most in authority, he is fine with sending wave after wave to be cannon fodder and then spends his time intimidating those who haven't' made that sacrifice. The boss, Stalin's, presence is in every scene. Jude Law's sniper is just a cog. Heroism really counts for nothing. The only result is getting the German's out of Stalingrad and turning the tide. Imagine the dehumanizing of this man. It makes the point again what a waste of lives, property, and human spirit war is. It sets back humanity every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your jaw drops as you see Russian recruits charging German lines in Stalingrad, and then being shot by their own when they try to retreat. You know this film is going to show a carnage of the greatest magnitude.Amidst the carnage, Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) meets Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a man with deadly aim. When Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) visits, Danilov proposes that they use all means to promote Vassili's skill to increase the morale of the people. Soon, like Sergeant York, his legend grows throughout Stalingrad, and the people are temporarily happy. As Khrushchev says, "Vodka is a luxury we have, caviar is a luxury we have, time we do not have." The problem is that the German bring in Major König (Ed Harris) to find Vasilli. Konig is just as good as Vasilli, maybe better, and a cat and mouse game begins.The always lovely Rachel Weisz is there, and Danilov is pursuing her aggressively, while Vasilli looks on longingly. Another contest? Danilov and König prove they are above nothing in their quest for glory, even setting up one for a kill, or killing a child. One hopes for the end of both of them.A very satisfying story about a Hero of the Soviet Union.</fullReview>

Easily one of the best war movies that I have seen, young Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), sharpshooter from the Urals, finds himself the hero of the Battle of Stalingrad on account of his superlative sniper skills. He also finds love in the beautiful Moscow-educated Tania (Rachel Weisz) and the two catch some fleeting intimate moments in the midst of the horror. The fame and love awaken jealousy in no small measure in Commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who clears his conscience in one last cathartic act. And the showdown between the deer-hunting German nobleman sharpshooter Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Vassili is the piece-de-resistance of the movie. It is a rare combination of the depiction of the large-scale brutality of war coupled with the cat-and-mouse game of the two sharpshooters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts off strong, as it depicts the absolutely hellish city that Stalingrad became in probably the most horrific battle in history. Of course a lot of the events being portrayed did not actually happen at Stalingrad but instead were amalgamations of various events that happened during the German Russian war during WWII. At first the Russians were totally unprepared and under equipped, there were reports of soldiers being sent to the front lines without weapons or ammo. However, at this point the Russians were far better organized.Then we have Jude Law as the frightened little Russian soldier being sent to war. Did not actually buy it, in fact I didn't buy hardly any of the characters, except for perhaps Ed Harris, who made a great Nazi, typical cold and efficient. Rachel Weisz may have the brows to play Russian, but what's with all the cockney accents? Anyway, the movie starts from somewhat realistic (forgiving the inaccuracies) and quickly goes downhill. The dialogue is terrible and is extremely blunt and unsophisticated. There are all these fake tensions that are created that don't really go anywhere. Everyone looks far too pretty and happy, with just the right amount of makeup dirt applied for that semi realistic look. These people were starving for pete's sake, they were in horrible conditions.Anyway, back to the historical inaccuracies. I realize that a movie is a movie and not a documentary, yet if you making a movie about real people and real events then you have a certain duty to portray those events with some accuracy. After all, most people are not going to see this movie to see Rachel Weisz (as pretty as she is) and Jude Law make out, they are probably somewhat interested in the story of two snipers facing off against each other. At that level the movie is pretty good, but once again pretty far fetched and absurd. Ed Harris' death isn't even that exciting, for such a great sniper he dies in a really stupid way. In between we have a lot of inane dialogue and bad acting. Oh well, nice try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot to recommend about this film that is essentially the story of the duel between a Russian and German sniper set against the backdrop of the Battle for Stalingrad in the Second World War. This is a well made movie that benefits from European direction and seems less bombastic than American made Second World War efforts and is all the better for it. There are good performances her as well especially by Rachel Weisz as the female lead Tania and Bob Hoskins is a fantastic supporting role as Kruschev. Joseph Fiennes is also very good as Danilov. My major problem with the movie is Jude Law. I just do not get the appeal of this actor. He seems to deliver the same performances in every movie I have seen him in, and for me this only worked in AI. This resulted in me not being able to invest in the lead character and I felt it also led to Ed Harris completely dominating there duel from an acting perspective (does he ever deliver a bad performance). This is a shame because the rest of the movie is excellent. Though I am not sure how much weight can be given to the historical accuracy (not that much from what I red on IMDb). In the end I enjoyed this film but Law puts me off wanting to watch this movie again unless there really was nothing else to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Russian - This film is good in the sense that it can bring some attention to the battles Russians fought against Nazis. I guess it is the only English title on this topic, while this front was the biggest, hardest and bloodiest one. From the other side it is full of myths, "western" myths about Red Army in WWII. There were no "zagradotryad"s in the city of Stalingrad, beside that "zagradotryad"s were never deployed right behind attacking forces, shooting their backs. Instead there were behind front lines catching deserters (some were shot, but most of them were sent back) The river crossing at day light under Nazis shells and bombers do happen - but only ONCE, and it was HIGHLY critical for holding the city at that moment. Russian soldiers were not taken as sheeps into Stalingrad, they fight for their motherland, and everybody knew about significance of this citadel. And much much more, but, I can only recommend (to those who are interested in topic) to read excellent book by Michael Jones "Stalingrad: How the Red Army Triumphed". As far as I can judge, it is free from Anti-Communist as well as Communist myths, and based on veteran's interviews - very easy to read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jude Law plays an elite Russian sniper locked in a duel with Major Konig, the legendary German sniper while hundreds of thousands of soldiers are fighting in the streets of Stalingrad for the future of the world. The action-packed Enemy at the Gates showcases the amazing skill of the sniper as well as one of the bloodiest, hardest fought, and inspiring battles in WWII.Jude Law plays an expert sniper who is fraught with fear and doubt of his ability to live up to his expectations. Enemy at the Gates tackles the medley of feelings that plagues every soldier.Jude Law plays an ordinary soldier who goes into battle expecting to die singlehandedly saves his own life and the fate of the mission. The Russian government makes him a symbol of bravery and hope to motivate their soldiers, but he starts to lose sight of what he's fighting for and nearly loses the will to live. Enemy at the Gates is an excellent critique of Communism and the lack of individualism of war.Well, which is it? This movie fails to achieve any of these objectives, because it tried to do too much.The movie doesn't follow through as an action flick because the climax is Jude Law shooting Konig from 20 feet when they are both standing in plain view. Needless to say, not a very difficult shot. The movie built up to this moment with both snipers having a series of intense duels where they repeatedly bluffed and set traps for each other. The movie did a great job of making you believe that all the insane sniper scenes were actually happening and that Law was overcoming a veteran sniper who didn't make mistakes, and then it had the most pathetic climax ever. Also, they didn't show ordinary soldiers fighting it out in the streets, even at the end, when the Russians were at risk of losing Stalingrad altogether.The movie fails as a depiction of the soldier because it follows extraordinary soldiers and political officers. I don't think any of the normal soldiers even talk. The movie also makes you roll your eyes a few times. I don't think political officers get military style pep-talks from Kruschev. I don't think any soldier would tell somebody his girlfriend had died while he was trying to shoot. No soldier, no matter how much he doubted the nobility of his mission would fall asleep on the front line. I could go on.The movie fails as a critique of Communism because it doesn't really have a message. It has a bunch of people talking about how they hate communism and it has Kruschev looking grumpy and ordering people killed, but it doesn't really spend much time with this idea. This movie, like way too many movies, creates a false feeling of a sophisticated message, as though it is necessary. All movies do not have to be complex or deep to be worth watching, and a movie can easily be complex or deep by examining the characters thoughts and feelings without trying to make a statement about war or the duality of man. The deep scenes are really out of place in this movie, and it almost seems like they are in just because the protagonist is fighting for the Russians.I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, because it seemed like it had the type of actions scenes that would stay with you. You just start with everything that goes into sniping in a congested city. Then you take the kind of fighting that took place in Stalingrad, where every flowerpot is a strategic point and the sheer mass of the Russian army is up against the crude technology of the Germans. Instead, the action scenes petered out half way through. Annaud (the director) basically starts 3 movies and doesn't follow through with any of them. There are a few amazing scenes that are perfectly paced, but nothing strings them together and you are left wanting more out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite all time War movies in general, maybe because it's different two snipers vs each other is the main point to the whole movie,, yes there is a love interest in the movie and probably could have done without it,, but hey other than that.. you have Ed Harris as the Major, who is sent out by the Fuhrer himself to eliminate the top Russian Marksman,, Vasily Zietzsev. Jude Law was excellent i thought as the Russian Hero.. his love interest is Rachel Weisz who is cute and nice to look at it, but a war is the wrong place for a love story,, the two characters play cat and mouse practically the whole movie,, the scenes of the Luftwaffe when they attack on the Volga River are totally awesome i thought,, the special effect,, bullets flying,, everything was realistic i thought, the movie is very tense and well put together,, the struggle for Stalingrad in the Fall / Winter of 1942 early 1943. Stallingrad gets overrun by German's and the villagers left to survive help Zietzev in his quest for fame by trying to eliminate the German Major,, Harris doesn't appear till the 34 min. mark but is very effective all the way to the ending of the movie. There is some treachery, and backstabbing,, going on in the movie,, some people that you thought you could trust,, you can't,, i liked Bob Hoskins character prob the most, as Nikita Krushchev,, what a riot he was,, so all things considered this is a great movie,, not really to be missed at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Battle of Stalingrad or rather cat-and-mouse game of snipers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit one thing at the beginning: I am not a fan of films on WWII because of the exceptionally brutal history piece when the human suffering reached its top and the dignity of human being seemed ruined. I was encouraged to see ENEMY AT THE GATES by my friend who told me "It's a masterpiece". After the first viewing, I could not notice any aspects of "a masterpiece"; later, however, I could find some strong points, which finally did not change much in my opinion. ENEMY AT THE GATES tells the story of Stalingrad from a particularly subjective point of view. As a result, it causes some serious historical travesty (which has already been discussed in other comments) in spite of the fact that at the beginning, it interestingly presents the map of that time, which would indicate that it's gonna be a serious historical work. However, it is not the only film that does that travesty and, therefore, I would rather concentrate on its cinematic values than focus on it as a history lesson. Let me look at it as a film only.CRUCIAL ERROR: The movie lasts for 2 hours. It is true that it keeps your attention. It more or less accurately shows the atmosphere that must have been in the ruined Stalingrad then. It does show the misery of war and the loss of human feelings that war promotes: "The one with the rifle shoots". Moreover, it contains quite an interesting story of the main characters. Yet, its crucial error is that it MOSTLY concentrates on snipers' cat-and-mouse game (as it has wisely been called in the plot outline) between Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and Major Koenig (Ed Harris). That is Stalingrad, that's meant to symbolize the battle. Koenig is the enemy at the gates since he is a German. That not only results in serious misunderstanding but it also has its consequences in the lack of character development combined with clichés. We have many characters and yet, they are mostly names and faces, not more. There is no insight into their feelings, emotions, tragedies. There is one little exception: the character of a young boy Sacha (Gabriel Thomson) is interesting. His tragic story is a true tearjerker. Nevertheless, even this is centered on Vassili. Therefore, the film should not be titled ENEMY AT THE GATES but VASSILI-A HEROIC SNIPER. Finally, one sniper (Koenig) dies in a very illogical scene... Was that realistic to try to shoot so many times and once believe that it's the perfect shot...REALISM and REFLECTIONS: I admit that the film is quite realistic in general. There are unforgettable moments like the one on the boat or bombarding. It also contains profound thoughts. Consider, for instance, the last words of Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Vassili's friend "There are always rich and poor, rich in gifts, poor in gifts..." I also loved the idea the director presents the blindness of communist regime. You watch the film and after 20 minutes you get totally upset-and you ask yourself: "Did they really do such things to their own people? But this blindness and fanaticism is wonderfully conveyed by Chrushchev (Bob Hoskins) "so worried" about Russians s...... their pants. If you decide to see this film, pay attention to the moment Vassili is at Chrushchev and a big picture of Stalin ("Boss") is hanging on the wall... Good scene!LOVE STORY: The character of Vassili is not only developed in terms of sniper skills but also in terms of male-female relationship. Vassili is after Tania (Rachel Weisz) an intelligent Jewish girl whom he gets to know in the house of Sacha. The way their love is expressed as a growing feeling is good. That feeling seems to win at the end. However, their performances make it unnatural. Neither Jude Law nor Rachel Weisz are appealing as a pair. I have rarely seen a movie where there is hardly any chemistry between the couple as here. Maybe, some people will not agree with me but that is what I think and I had to say it. The moment of their love scene is foremost lust and nothing more.TECHNICAL POINT: From the technical point of view, the movie is not bad. There are impressive shots of crowds of people, there are very good shots of snipers' fight (but too long as aforementioned). There are also SOME good performances. Generally, if there was no love plot, I liked Jude Law as Vassili. I can forgive him the British accent which does not suit to the Russian character. I also liked Joseph Fiennes as Danilov and Ed Harris as cold, elegant and brutal Koenig. Yet, there are two people who really do great jobs: Bob Hoskins as Chrushchev and Gabriel Thomson as Sacha. There is a FEELING in these performances. Hoskins, no wonder, since he is a very good actor considering his many roles. But Thomson, a young boy who acts like a professional, is a real surprise. They raise the value of the film.I rate the film 7/10 because of some factors like performances, the justice it partly does to communism and its blindness. Yet, as I said before, it's far from masterpiece. If you really like WWII movies, I recommend you to see ENEMY AT THE GATES and evaluate for yourself (perhaps compare to other movies). However, if you are someone who cannot stand bombarding, shooting, blood, cruelty, helplessness - stay away! Although the end is not that dramatic, the movie is overall very upsetting. The film attempts to answer the question: Were there no humans then? Was it only war which did that? Supposedly, not only war. The world was governed by comrades whose only sacred duty was to serve the power of the totalitarian regime that once lasted under the name of Soviet Union.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glaring problem makes for difficult enjoyment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what, aside from a few bad clichés and a couple poorly acted scenes the general story-line of this movie would have been great, save for one problem. The real trouble is that this problem isn't just a little problem but a huge one. How am I to take any part of this movie seriously, or to take any comment that stresses the director's eye for authenticity seriously, if the entire Russian army is British???!!! A movie like this would have done well to have proper language speakers and subtitles, but if the filmmakers feel they have to pander down to a stupider, less forgiving audience then they could have at least gotten the actors to speak English with Russian accents, maybe even some Russian extras... You know what, even if the director felt that bad accents might mar the quality of the performances, fine, have them all speak in British accents, but stay consistent! All the Russians are British, except Ron Pearlman, who is an American doing a British accent, playing a Russian (!!!). Then the first German voice we hear is speaking English with a German accent, but then after that, all the Germans are British,except for Ed Harris who keeps his American accent (too tough for ya huh buddy?). Then some German extras speak German (only some), the Russian musicians sing in Russian, and, the piece de la resistance, the Germans and the Russians can communicate with each other whenever they please (Ed Harris to the little boy who I have trouble believing is fluent in German and a couple other times as well), yet they need translators in the Russian army to decipher German messages... huh? no kidding?... It's unavoidable really, the mess that this whole language thing produces makes it hard to take any scene in this film seriously. I don't even want to get started on how much it ticks me off that Hollywood loves representing every other language on the planet with British actors (it's different, but everyone can still understand it without using any part of their brains). Terrible, just plain terrible. I bet the real Vasilii Zaitsev is rolling over in his grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just reading the superb book by William Craig 'Enemy At The Gate' when they announced they were shooting the movie so my expectations were really high, since there is SO MUCH material and SO MANY characters in the book that covers the Stalingrad's battle. As in some latest historical or 'fiction-historical' productions there had been some good examples on how to make the story flow between so many characters intersecting each other, or sharing just a common place if not a common time. I should not say this is a bad movie as for the actors or the effects, but to me it lacks completely of inspiration. All the rich material from the book has been erased to give space to a kind of stereotyped single handed duel: my advise to the producers is to change the title in 'High Noon at Stalingrad'; to the viewers, please read this important and beautiful book: you'll then know what I mean! As an after thought, it is NOT enough to use the flying past bullets' effect after 'Saving Private Ryan' to create a realistic WWII story! After reading others' comments, I remembered there had been some beautiful movies about WWII in Russia: the horrific 'Idi i smotri - Go and See' or 'Stalingrad'; the great Tarkowsky's 'Childhood of Ivan'; even the fictitious Peckinpah's 'Cross of Iron', all were much superior and effective in taking the audience to the front lines and its horrors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful story, realistic content, the usual stereotypes, bad screenplay with many historical incorrections, an audience biased adaptation of the story undermining any artistic ambitions. Romanticised and even with the usual car pursuit and sex scene (even if totally neutral for the stories' sake) this story is clearly a consumer product. I think they must be part of some «secret» American checklist. Are «cars and girls» a central element in the Stalingrad battle? Artistically (and art must make a statement) what is point of broculae in a movie about a «chef»? And what might it's relevance be in a war movie? Artistically nil as the screenplay and the realization might be it's a nice entertaining film on a subject where it would take far worse a work to make a boring movie. P.S. In every movies American have to crash a car and strip a woman. How creative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very amusing flick, boldly exploring nearly all the major Hollywood clichés. The guy gets the girl, the guy wins the fight, the other guy who was jealous and betrayed him ends up sacrificing himself, you know the deal: the usual. There were some interesting scenes. I now know that if I want to hide my presence during winter I should eat some snow, preventing my breath from turning into vapor the second it leaves my mouth and/or nose.I liked the movie. It opened the way to openly gay movies like Brokeback Mountain. There's lots of scenes where you just think that Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes will get it on. And admit it, they're hot. They'd make a really great couple. Rachel Weisz doesn't quite cut it compared to them, but she does give a pretty good "OMG I'm losing my virginity and it hurts" impression, her eyes almost impossibly distended.I wonder if they're ever going to make a movie that actually accurately portrays the battle for Stalingrad. But so far it's pretty neat to see an American movie where the Russians are actually the good guys! Anyway, it's an entertaining movie. So don't expect to learn any deep truths about life (probably movies are a bad place for that anyway); watch it to be entertained.</fullReview>

Every movie can't be like The Passion of the Christ where the dialog was in Aramaic. The part that bothered me the most: THERE WAS NO ORAL SEX AT STALINGRAD As tender a scene as it was I'm sure that soldiers in a fever pitched battle who haven't probably bathed in months would not be doing this.

		<fullReview>I thought this film was great. The fact that it is actually the perspective of the war from two different countries other than the U.S. Learning of the horrors of Stalingrad in school as well as the huge casualty counts, I could never grasp how bad it really was until I watched this film. You are blown away from the very beginning of the film. It has many touching moments that will make you shiver and maybe even glad to not be a Russian soldier during the Nazi invasion.The only reason I didn't give this movie all 10 stars is because of the accents. I felt they should have dished out the extra cash to train the actors to get Russian and Germans accents, at least somewhat. Jude Law's British accent doesn't go unnoticed and Ed Harris sounds as American as anyone. Other than that...this film rocked...simply said. If you are a war movie fan like me this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Storytelling through a Suspenseful Tale of Individuals at War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've now watched this movie four or five times, and it continues to impress me with each viewing. Criticisms that it does not accurately depict the battle of Stalingrad are missing the point. The movie doesn't purport to tell the whole story of the epic battle of the greatest land war ever known (and we hope humanity will ever endure) in terms of a historical recapitulation of this happened, then that happened, and so forth. It rather instead attempts to take this epic, incredibly difficult story and reduce it to the battle between two men, two individuals, two snipers - the ultimate individualists and cold-blooded killers. That the movie has both interesting personalities, a gripping action arc, and still manages to encapsulate the great sense of apocalyptic struggle that was the combat of World War II makes it all the more remarkable. It manages to be epic through a simple love triangle and a simple contrast between the simple but indomitably optimistic Zaitsev and the sophisticated but world-weary Koenig.There is not any particular sympathy for either the (Communist) Russians or the (Nazi) Germans generated in the film.The movie opens up with Russians massacring their own troops who have the temerity for retreating from an attack cut to pieces by the Germans, where only a fraction of their force are even armed. The character of Koulikov, an expert sniper sent to provide cover for Zaitsev in his duel with Koenig, through the simple story of how his Communist masters quickly turned on him ably sums up the arbitrary terrors of the Stalin years. The Nazis in turn are shown sending a prisoner to his death at the hands of his Russian comrades and engaging in other personal atrocities that demonstrate their ruthless inhumanity without resorting to the typical film stereotypes. (The most effective of these comes at the film's climax, epitomizing the strange humanism of German culture as corrupted by the Nazi sense of utility which was ultimately so amoral.) There's an economy here in the storytelling which others would do well to imitate.For the most part, the ordinary German and Russian soldiers are shown for what they were -- suffering cannon fodder, the two clashing (and discreditable) ideologies that cause their suffering distant in the background. Yet we manage to get a sense of why each man fights -- the sense of duty that devolves (or evolves) into a sense of loyalty to one's comrades and ultimately just to the man (or woman) right next to them. Koenig becomes more and more isolated -- the lone eagle, or wolf, as it turns out in the film's opening metaphor -- even as Zaitsev develops a complicated set of supporting relationships. The heroism of Zaitsev develops in an interesting contrast to the propaganda version of Zaitsev created by his friend, the educated political commissar Danilov. Danilov's genuine willingness to lay his own life on the line, his desire to make his own contribution in what he clearly sees holistically as a grand, epic battle on which the whole fate of the country is clear from the first scene where he and Zaitsev meet in a no-man's land filled with the corpses of their comrades. Yet Danilov degrades, gradually, his personal loyalty being subsumed by his ambition and the success, and Zaitsev becomes more a tool for him than the friend who saved his life. The ends of politics become a justification to Danilov for personal betrayal.Caught between Zaitsev and Danilov is Chernova, who has the education and skills to be an intelligence officer or political commissar -- and seemingly the perfect match in background for Danilov -- but the heart and desire to emulate Zaitsev and become a sniper. She moves from Danilov's world back into Zaitsev's in a way that is almost a barometer of how the spirit of the Russian soldiers ended up winning the day in spite of, not because of, the brutal ideologies of their government.The duel is unpredictable, yet also predictable in a way, and without giving out a spoiler let's just say that even if you can guess the outcome, it's still worth watching for the suspense of exactly how it's played out. What I really admire about this film when all is said and done that despite the pseudo- intellectual critical analysis I've described above, it's just a taut story that moves you along without having to really see the whole big epic sweep of themes. One incidental note: complaints in other reviews about the "lack of accents" by the various British and American actors is really missing the point about doing a film in English about Russians and Germans made by a French director. Not resorting to the fakery of movie conventions of trying to do fake accents for the bad guys (and usually American accents for the good guys) simply allows the actors to act, and without any context for the typical viewer as to what an educated or peasant accent might be for a German or Russian, their own voices come across somehow more authentically.</fullReview>

But the director manages to keep the movie in line and interesting at all time.There is really only one major thing I dislike with this film and that is the fact that both the German side and the Russian side is very very good in talking English. Its very sad that Hollywood flicks mostly has this all out-good cast of English talking actors.that is the reason I lower the rate for this film.

		<shortDescription>An Underrated, Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not get the credit it deserved when it was first released. It should get it's credit now with the DVD. I heartily recommend it to any fan of war movies.It is a rarity amongst World War II movies ... a story told from the Soviet point of view. The Soviets suffered heavily during the war, both from casualties in the face of the Nazi juggernaut and from the stupidity and cruelty of their own leadership. Yet there was great heroism and bravery on the Eastern Front, as there were on the Western, told in perhaps hundreds of films."Enemy at the Gates" tells the tale of one Soviet hero, the sniper Vassili Zeitsev. It's an excellent film. It has epic battle sequences, including a terrible flight across the River Volga. It has tension and suspense well fitting the stalking mentality of the sniper. Best of all it has an emotional core surrounding an unlikely hero and the woman who earns his respect.I only gave this film 8 out of 10. Although they did a good job, the main actors Jude Law and Rachel Weisz really didn't play their parts as Russians. Joseph Fiennes and Bob Hoskins (who is superb as Nikita Kruschev) did just that, and Ed Harris played Major Konig as the perfect noble German. But Jude and Rachel didn't quite hit that mark, although other parts of their performances were quite good.Even with those flaws, this is still a very good telling of the Siege of Stalingrad, with sadness and tension and action and emotion. It's earned a place in my collection.Barky</fullReview>

Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev, the Russian sniper, was very real; but some doubt has been cast over the historical truth of the personal duel. Because it is a member of a much too rare breed; movies about the most momentous land battle in history, the Russian front, this movie falls short on many levels, it tries to give some sense of the scale of events, and early on it succeeds; but it retreats before the sheer immensity of its historical context into a personal story; and in the end it's almost as if the war has stopped so these two can shoot at each other. Other than that it weaves historical content into a human story, the nature of totalitarian regimes and the indifference to human life that the Red Army displayed early on, the Party involvement in morale making, the front line role of women etc; it was enormously refreshing to see a story told from the Soviet side; almost all prior movies on the subject were Nazi-sided (See Peckinpah's - Cross of Iron). It also contains excellent action shots; making the humble bullet a mighty dangerous object again, as it should be. Though it falls down in not being able to devote enough money to huge battle scenes (almost every German vehicle sighted is stationary); and so cheats on a real sense of the battle, it's good for what it is. Those who like historical war films can only hope that the true balance of land fighting of WW2, ie: the Russians with some help from the Western allies toward the end; starts to be reflected in cinema; at least Enemy At The Gates has given a start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good but not great movie about a seldom seen side of WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can I say. Not often before have I been both so impressed and so disappointed by a movie at the same time. What "Enemy at the Gates" does well, it does extremely well. But I can't help but feel that it could have been a whole lot better.First, the good things: first of all, there's the excellent opening sequence which shows thousands of Soviet soldiers being ferried across the river towards the battle of Stalingrad. They're being shelled by artillery, shot at by Stuka dive bombers, and executed by their own officers if they try to flee. The utter chaos and desperateness of these early scenes rivals those of "Saving Private Ryan's" Normandy beach landing. Very well done indeed.The rest of the movie also features some enormously impressive and very tense sniper duels between the Russian hero and his German antagonist. These scenes are easily among the most nail-bitingly suspenseful I've ever seen.For the most part, "Enemy at the Gates" is also a very well-made movie. The acting is great (especially by Ed Harris), everything looks very authentic, and the ruins of Stalingrad look very impressive. There are some fairly fake CGI airplanes in a couple of scenes, but that's about the only technical flaw I can think of.What could have been a lot better though is the story. I understand the need to take some liberties with reality in order to make for a more interesting narrative, but the story here feels rather contrived, relying of a lot of coincidences. The ending in particular is a let-down. After so many good scenes, it feels like a huge anti-climax.Also of note is the awkward love story between the hero and a female Russian soldier. It feels out of place, it's very clichéd, and it actually takes up way too much time that could have been better spent on either real character development or more sniper duels.All in all, it's still a very suspenseful and impressive movie, but I can't help but feel that with a bit more work on the story it could have been so much more.**** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad film but the people that dislike this movie prolly expected too much of a war movie. Enemy at the Gates isn't a war movie though, it's a battle between a Russian and a German sniper which is placed at the WWII Stalingrad background. The film could have taken place at any war any place for that matter.Best actor in the film was in my opinion Ed Harris, I totally loved him in his role of Major König. For the rest the 3 main actors aren't doing too bad either but they surely don't compare to Ed Harris.Film has a decent amount of gore in it. At the end of the film I think I'd seen enough headshots but hey, what to expect about a sniper film. :) I did buy it on DVD though and IMO is worth the purchase if you like the genre.I gave it a rating of 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hollywood War Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a sniper instructer in the Marines and being familiar with the story of the legendary sniper, Vasily Zaitsev, I looked forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, I only recently had the opportunity. I was very disappointed.Although the movie is based on a true story, it deviates considerably from the true story. In true Hollywood fashion there is much more fiction than truth in this movie.Right from the beginning, it deviates from the truth. It shows Vasily as a 5 year old firing a high powered hunting rifle. It don't happen that way. I fired my first rifle when I was five but it was a cut down .22 using short rounds. It was all I could handle. Just the recoil from the type of rifle Vasily was shown using would have hurt him. He may have started hunting at the age of 5 but not with a high powered rifle. I went with my father on hunting trips starting when I was 5 but I wasn't allowed to use a high powered rifle until I was 15 when I was physically able to use it. But before that I learned much from my father about hunting.Second was the scenes following when Vasily was in the boats crossing the Volga River in BROAD daylight. The history of the battle of Stalingrad is that the Soviets never crossed the Volga during daylight because of the German planes and artillery observors. They only crossed at night.Next, was the futile attack by Soviet soldiers, many not armed. At that stage of the battle for Stalingrad, the Soviets were not wasting troops attacking the Germans. The strategy was to defend the City at all costs. It was to make the Germans pay dearly for every inch they took. So it was ridiculous to show a futile charge by the Soviets and then Kruschev telling the general in charge of the failed attack that he should commit suicide. It would be more realistic if the general fell out of failure because his troops retreated from a defense position.Next, Vasily's story never included a love story. That is pure fiction. It detracted from the true story of Stalingrad which was the ferocious defense the Soviets put up. The movie would have been more interesting if the makers had made that the central theme.At times the movie makers did do some good battle scenes and at times they did show how snipers really worked at their trade but at times they botched it. A sniper never wore a helmet. Helmets by their shapes or silhouettes are dead giveaways. That is why Marines started wearing camoflaged covers on their helmets during WWII to break up the silhouette.Nor did snipers ever carry anything that was shiny, that would reflect light such as a nickle plated bolt handle on their rifle or a badge on their hat or uniform. Reflections were dead giveaways.Lastly, was the way the movie ended. Since the story of Vasily Zaitsev is legendary and has been broadcast many times on the History Channel and in other documentaries, many persons are already aware of how the true story ended. But for that reason I have no qualms about telling the true story of how the German Major who was their top sniper was killed. Those who I talked to about the movie all said that they knew Vasily would eventually kill the German sniper. The only suspense was how it would be done.Vasily and he were faced off against each other. As the German Major, who hidden, was trying to spot Vasily, Vasily saw the reflection off of the German's telescopic sight. Vasily aimed at that reflection and just as the German spotted Vasily, Vasily fired and killed the German.But the movie had the German sniper walking in the open when Vasily shot him. That never would have happened in reality. Snipers just did not walk out in the open because it was suicide to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy at What Gates?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Herein.The first thing about this movie is that the title has no relevance at all to anything that transgresses in the movie. Enemy at what Gates? Both snipers are deep in the heart of Stalingrad. Neither one has a hard time getting there. Could this refer to the Nazis? They have already overrun much of the city at the start of the movie, so this does not explain that either. Anyway, that is not extremely important.If you are a historian, or care that movies are true to the actual events, this is probably not the movie for you. Apparently, at least in this movie, the only thing that happened in Stalingrad was that a Soviet sniper killed a bunch of German officers, so they sent in a sniper of their own to take out the Soviet sniper, but not anyone else. Excepting the first scene of the movie, you would not have known that a war was taking place in the city. Only one bombing run by the Nazis, and only one large scale battle leaves the viewer wondering if this is actually a war movie, or if it was just Assassins remade in a different time period.That being said, the movie has its tense moments. Surprisingly little happens for a 2 1/2 hour movie, but this really isn't noticed during the viewing, this is only thought of after seeing it. The sniper battles are entertaining as well. The viewer gets to see the mental process and the mind games that take place between the two outstanding marksmen.This movie does have one of the least believable sex scenes in history. First of all, it was somewhat unnecessary to the plot of the movie. The audience already understood that Soviet sniper guy and Rachel Weisz are in love, but then they go and have sex in the midst of hundreds of sleeping people in a secret underground barricks.All of this having been said, this movie was surprisingly enjoyable, despite all of its flaws. If you can put aside the fact that it is not all that historically accurate, and lacks any real prescence of a war, you should enjoy the movie.Rating: 3.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked sniper film full of power, emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It surprises me that this film did not receive very much attention upon its release. It definitely deserved it, because "Enemy at the Gates" is a powerful and intense war film that centers on a type of soldier that rarely gets a full movie devoted to it: the sniper. This film's major accomplishment is that it shows the maddening and awful pressure-filled world of the sniper. Centering around Vassili Zaitsev, a young up-and-coming Russian private who has amazing shooting accuracy, the film not only shows the awfulness of battle and the carnage of war (with the Russians killing their own attempting-to-flee soldiers), but how the media turns Vassili into a hero-even though he is chafing under the constraints of his new role. Thus, "Enemy at the Gates" is simultaneously an action-packed war drama and a grim media satire. The peformances are high-quality, with Jude Law as Vassili, Joseph Fiennes as his tormented friend Danilov, and Rachel Weisz as Tania Chernova, the woman who tears the two apart. Also, Bob Hoskins is coarse and humorous as Nikita Khrushkev, while Gabriel Thomson gives an excellent portrayal as Sacha Filipov, the Russian boy who attempts to play both sides against eachother-but learns that one does not mess with the Nazis as easily as one would like to. The standout, however, is the incomparable Ed Harris as Major Konig, a master Nazi sniper who the Germans bring in to take out Vassili. Harris' performance is one of his lesser-known roles, but it shows his mastery of understatement. In fact, it is his character's very emotionlessness that makes him all the more frightening. There are amazing battle sequences (the early Russian vs. German, where the Russians are basically mowed down, is heartbreaking in its futility, as there is a packet of ammo and a gun for every two soldiers), and the final moments between Konig and Vassili show Law and Harris at the top of their game (the quiet physical statement Harris makes at the end is a perfect representation of his character). Also, the love story is as heartfelt as it is desperate. Many comments say this section of the movie was "clumsy" and "unnecessary". I disagree, I feel that the attraction between Tania and Vassili is beautiful, while Fiennes is perfect in expressing the pain-filled jealousy of Danilov. These important relationships are what leads up the final shocking moments-without the love story, the film loses much of its power. Truly, "Enemy at the Gates" is a worthy film-at least better than "Windtalkers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a war masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe there's something nostalgic about Russians and German characters not speaking with their proper accents in war movies, because that's how a lot of war movies used to be made, but it's something that just gets on my nerves. The opening battle scenes are on par with Saving Private Ryan, the tension of the two snipers' duel is nail-biting, but the love triangle subplot is forgettable, and the filmmakers fail to utilize and comment on the propaganda used by both the Soviets and Germans in any meaningful way. The movie does get points for showcasing the Eastern front of the European theater. Hollywood would have us believe the US won the war single-handedly, but the Russians were in fact instrumental in the defeat of the Nazis. Still, I just can't get past those Russians with British accents. 6/10.If you'd like to see movies that highlight the Eastern front even more effectively, check out Sam Peckinpah's Cross of Iron from 1977, or the German-made Stalingrad from 1993.</fullReview>

Apart from the historical inconsistencies, it's hard to accept that the entire Germany 6th Army only had one sniper (how else would the hero know who's after him?).

The movie was just less...mature than I thought it would be, dickering around with a tacked on love story, shallow characters, and a bunch of people doing exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong moment to get themselves killed. Not to mention a fleet of bombers who apparently only flew overhead when it was going to serve the plot in someway. I was hoping for fewer cliches and a grim gripping WWII thriller. What I got instead was an unevenly paced mess. Like the title says, disappointing. And not even in the same league with a movie like Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the better war movies that I have ever seen. In Russian in 1942, the Russians are fighting to keep the Germans from taking over the city of Stalingrad. Under the leadership of Khruschev (Bob Hoskins), the country will fight for freedom. But one man, Vissili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who -thanks to his best friend Danilov (Joseph Fiennes)- has become a famous Russian sniper known for being able to get any man. But when the Germans dispatch Major Konig (Ed Harris) to kill him, the two begin a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse in the burning city. Rachael Weisz and Ron Perlman also star.I can understand that since this is an American movie, that the language would be English, but otherwise it would most likely be Russian and German. This film smashed at the box-office and is one of the most triumphant war movies ever. Also recommend would be BLACK HAWK DOWN and WE WERE SOLDIERS.ENEMY AT THE GATES: 5/5.</fullReview>

I'm not a fan of Ed Harris, but he is really one of the best actors in Hollywood, he really deserves some credit.The rest of the cast were about average and didn't impress, but maybe they suffer from a boring script. Compared to other war movies like Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, "Enemy at the Gates" doesn't deliver the same quality.I will rate the movie 5/10, it's mainly because of the sniper scenes with Ed Harris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie!! The cast was great and everyone perfectly fitted into their roles especially the main characters. I have seen many war movies but no movie has ever made me feel that I wanted to go out and get the bad guy(in this case the German sniper Major Konig). This movie has it all: love, loss, suspense, action, and betrayal. The story line is one that quickly draws the viewer into the world of battle, the battle for Stalingrad and the personal struggles the characters faced. It most strongly illustrated how one man in this case Vassili Zeitsev (Jude Law) could change the fate of his country and how he alone could give hope to those who had none. Vassili was not the only hero, there was Tania(Rachel Weisz),Danilov(Joseph Fiennes),Koulikov(Ron Perlman) and others. These heros had wove a fine web of dependence upon each other to stay strong, stay alive and to face the enemy. This movie definitely defines what a true hero is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the film that could have been. Fairly stunning opening sequences and then what happened? The choice of cast was the first mistake - I didn't realise that English public school boys and clean cut 'English Roses' (enter Rachel Weiss) fought on the Russian Front. That was the main problem - they brought no character to the roles, though were too 'clean'. Some say it was a thinking mans war film and we were supposed to be kept on the edge of our seats by the (yawn) battle of wits between German and Russian sniper. I did think, mainly I should have bought a ticket for the film next door. Change the cast, chop half an hour (at least) off the length and throw in just a little more action and it might have been half decent. Don't rent this - try Cross of Iron, which although almost 25 years old is twice the film this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat forced blend of history and Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy At The Gates initially reminded me of a lot of other films; three which spring directly to mind being Saving Private Ryan for the grueling slaughter of almost helpless troops in the opening ten minutes, Shot Through The Heart for the opposing snipers theme, and Full Metal Jacket for the tension of urban close-quarters combat. This is not a historical document on the battle of Stalingrad, nor does it pretend to be, though the events depicted are, by and large, historically accurate, down to the character of the Russian sniper Zaitsev (Law). It should be noted, however, that the central character Zaitsev was by no means the only sniper of note at Stalingrad, and while some Soviet sources claim the duel with Koenig (Harris) actually occurred, this is not widely accepted, as no reports from the period make mention of it. Overall, I found the film gripping and entertaining as the relationship between Vassili Zaitsev, a conscript who finds himself used as a propaganda tool due to his skill as a sniper, and Danilov (Fiennes), the political officer who acts as his "agent", develops. The mutual love interest Tania (Weisz) acts as a catalyst to the rivalry as Zaitsev comes to resent Danilov making political capital of him, which justifies the presence of the, presumably, historically inaccurate romance in the film. While a number of points jarred about the film, the accuracy of the uniforms, equipment, and vehicles is commendable from the point of view of a military history buff like myself. The actors do a fine job overall, and a number of the performances were refreshingly out of character - Law is distinctly rough around the edges for a change, and Bob Hoskins is almost unrecognizable as Nikita Kruchschev. However, both Harris and Fiennes leave an annoying amount of ambivalence as to the motivations and psychological makeup of their characters. A flaw in scripting of Zaitsev is his sudden hate towards Koenig at the end, despite the fact that Koenig has been picking of his comrades for the best part of the film. Also, given the carnage inflicted upon the troops on both sides and the civilians stuck in the middle, there is marked lack on the part of all characters of revulsion and resentment for the fact their political leaders are putting them through the meat grinder. Apparently, only American troops gripe about feeling their lives are being wasted for no good reason. But all this does not detract from the fact that Enemy At The Gates is well-researched, well-made, and thoroughly entertaining overall.</fullReview>

Ed Harris was great as the German antagonist. Bob Hoskins was a surprise as the burly Nikita Khruschev. This to me is the WWII movie for the Soviets what "Saving Private Ryan" is to the Americans.

		<fullReview>Watching "Enemy at the Gates" is like watching multiple movies at one time. Rather than just being about World War II snipers, the film has been interjected with plots of romance and friendship, loyalty and betrayal, self-doubt and self-realization, heroism and cruelty, cowardice and bravery. Each of these themes is weaved carefully upon one another, and while integral to one another, remain self-sustaining. No matter what genre the viewer is partial to, there is something in this movie that will reach out to them and connect. The ever-brilliant Jude Law is wonderful in his performance as Russian sniper Vasilli and is surrounded by an array of astounding actors, such as Joeseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins and Ed Harris. "Enemy at the Gates" is an emotionally charged movie that also delivers on its promise of action, a rare find in today's collection of mindless action movies and character-driven plotless films. My favorite surprise in this movie was the acting ability shown by Rachel Weisz, who most will recognize from her role in the popular movies "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns" as Evelyn 'Evie' Carnahan. Having seen her in mostly small roles, she more than met the demands of her character. Overall, I would have to say this is a well-made movie with both a great plot and great acting; a movie of mass appeal and substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The missing link between Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Pearl Harbour (2001).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which has to account for the overall blandness of Enemy at the Gates...Firstly, lets look at the problem, never before has a language barrier marred my enjoyment of a film, but with Enemy at the Gates it's just a little silly, for you see, director Jean-Jacques Annaud believes that letting his actors speak in their native accents is an interesting concept, and doesn't take away any of the believability of the performances. So, it's not out the ordinary to find an English schoolboy or an Australian sniper musing around Stalingrad. This just destroys any of the film's power, at one point, when Jude Law's character first meets Tania (Rachael Wiesz) a friend says that she taught her German, that's all well and good but who the hell taught her English. It's pathetic.The look of the film however is splendid, lots of washed out colours and sub-dogme hand-held camera, clearly inspired by Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan... But without characters that are believable this is all just a pointless exercise in style. The acting is also bad, Law looks puzzled, Wiesz is as good as ever, and that's not a complement, she has to be one of the worst actresses working at the moment, Fiennes just hangs around like a wet blanket, only Ed Harris walks away with any dignity, but then again he is the first "American" soldier I've seen working for the Germans.Added to that the plot makes no sense and there's actually very little action to keep you're attention, also there's a pretty useless sex scene, that seems to be there for the soul reason of saying, "look, a sex scene"... This is an average film not worth the money of a rental, wait for this to be broadcast on TV... The only reason I could possibly think of to recommend this film to any one would be so they can check out Bob Hoskins' performance, as a cockney Khrushchev...5/10... Still better than Pearl Harbour though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding jaded in my old age, I'm continuously amazed at the quality of reviews that can be summed in "Wow, man. Totally awesome!" or, "Man, this movie sucked." C'mon. We pay these guys salaries buying tickets and renting videos or DVDs. As such, we can do better by looking at the content and form of the film. And, this film is excellent in both form and content. I'm constantly intrigued by how the English can kick our butts in the acting game. I mean, Jude Law is Vassily Zaitsev (the name means 'rabbit' in Russian, BTW) and Ed Harris, getting to be one of our best, is Koenig (I prefer the German spelling for 'king'). Fiennes and Weisz are likewise superb as is Hoskins, a long way away from his initial exposure in Roger Rabbit. The theme of this film is chaos. And, if you read the defense of Stalingrad, that's what it was. Seeing the scenes in this wonderfully dark film reminded me of reading Simeonov's Dni I Nochi, 'Days and Nights,' one of the most accurately portrayed histories of the Red Army's defense of Stalingrad. It is a superb film and, gang, let's get beyond mere grunts of approval and disapproval of a fine film as this one is. Save it for the endless sequels of Teen-age Slice 'n Dice 25." Sorry to be such a curmudgeon, but I really loved this film and think it deserves much better attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can do more than echo the sentiments of the many viewers who criticized the contrast between the excitement of the opening battle scenes and the way in which the movie bogs down in the middle, as it changes to a cat-and-mouse story. The opening battle scene does indeed give the opening of "Saving Private Ryan" a run for its money, and the portrayal of the devastation visited upon Stalingrad is indeed ... well, devastating. However, the movie is simply too long to sustain the battle-of-wits story it becomes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best WWII Movie I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read the title of the review, and let me tell you something, I've seen a lot. I remember when Saving Private Ryan came out I went in excited, and came out bored out of my mind and half asleep. For this movie on the other hand, I expected some good battle scenes (this prejudice of war films had been given to me by Saving Private Ryan) but the rest would probably be s***. I was wrong, while it would have been better without the love interest, it was good. Solid performances, especially Jude Law and Ed Harris, some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen (kudos to Robert Fraisse the DP), and a nice story line to boot. I wouldn't be surprised if this film gets a couple Oscar nods (especially cinematography), but then again I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't get any (except cinematography). There were high points and low points, but the high ones dwarfed the lows. A great film that pays tribute to one of the greatest heroes of WWII (Vassily Zeitsev).8/10P.S. Some history sources actually tell of a relationship between Zeitsev and Chernova. Others don't say a thing about it. I just thought I'd add that for the people who thought the love interest was thrown in by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A human story in a harsh battle environment. Superb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy At The Gates is a film that I have gone to see, not because I have heard rumours about its budget, not because I was bombarded in the media about how it is filmed, how many great co-stars and stars were in it, but simply because I happened to go see it with my friends and it was on the Battle of Stalingrad, with no great expectations. I knew Jean-Jacques Annaud was a good director but I didn't know how he could manage to make a war film, as all his previous stuff were human stories (yes, even L'Ours was) and didn't involve too much action; I mean, Name of the Rose is hardly in the same league as your average Steven Segal film, is it? When I walked out of the theatre, though, I was stunned. I was so absorbed in the film that I didn't even notice how the time passed. I felt the Battle of Stalingrad, I was there, I shared the terror in the faces of the army recruits when they see the battle for the first time when they open the train cart's gate, I felt the Soviet soldiers' dilemma when they were either killed by the Nazis if they went ahead or by their own commanders if they returned. It was the best film set in war that I've seen in a long time, and is surely in the same level as with Tora, Tora, Tora. Besides, I was sort of right, as Annaud had made a war film based heavily on a human story which made it even stronger. The Enemy at the Gates may be compared to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but while that film then becomes a classic Spielberg film in the latter stages, this one remains that tense for the whole length of the film. The acting of Jude Law and Gabriel Marshall-Thompson (the informer kid), Bob Hoskins, and of Rachel Weisz are very neat and makes you be part of the story, but it is Ed Harris that makes the greatest impact. Harris has charisma leaking down his trousers, something that can be equalled only by the likes of Sir Sean Connery, Bob DeNiro, and Jack Nicholson. Besides, the script is very well-written and very well-fitting, plausible, and convincing. This film which shows us how to do a film that represents the war is heads and shoulders above the $270m flop Pearl Harbor and surely is one of the best films of the year, along with Hannibal and Shrek who lead, to my opinion, their own genres in the past season. Anyone who is interested in World War II, or in films that show the human condition, must watch this film. It's a must-see. Really!</fullReview>

It was absolutely awful! Every effort was made to ensure that the military hardware was correct but absolutely no effort had been made to to research how Russians would have acted (or in many cases looked) during the war.&lt;WARNING, SPOILER&gt;One particularly risible episode: A small boy, Sacha, has been spying on the Germans but he's caught and hanged. Later a political commisar is atttempting to get the boy's mother to join an evacuation of civilians prior to an expected German offensive. The mother refuses. In a "noble" gesture the commisar lies and says that Sacha has defected to the Germans.Now, in real life the mother would have been (a) terrified of reprisals but also (b) mortified that her son did not die fighting the fascist scum. In EatG she is overjoyed that her son is safe with the Germans and leaves her home without further delay.Still it was marginally better than Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good core concept marred by uneven acting and bad subplot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy at the Gates tells the small story of Vassili Zaitsev, a Soviet marksman, inside the larger stories of the Battle of Stalingrad and World War II.It is a rare WWII film in that the Americans are not involved and the Soviets are the heroes.It is nitpicking, however, the filmmakers went to so much trouble to depict the violence so realistically that it is jarring that everybody speaks English! This is aimed at mainstream audiences and they would not have attended if the Russians spoke Russian and the Germans spoke German. It was weird to see a memo dictated in English magically appear as Russian on paper. It was also unintentionally funny.The Soviets use the exploits of Zaitsev as a propaganda tool so effectively that the Germans are forced to bring their own expert marksman. The cat and mouse game between the two snipers is effective and interesting. If the filmmakers had concentrated on that they could have had an effective and interesting movie. Not to mention a much shorter one than the dragging 131 minutes they ended up with.Instead, in a move that feels like a decision by committee, they graft on a boring sub plot about a romantic triangle that is poorly done and detracts from the suspense the sniper vs. sniper was building.Jude Law , who looks and sounds very British, fails to sell himself as a "sheperd boy from the Urals". Bob Hoskins is a farce as a cockney Krushchev and Rachel Weisz is beautiful but superfluous and had the unfortunate fate of delivering the stupidest lines in the movie. Only Ed Harris does a solid acting job.In the end you take a good concept , dilute with uneven acting and accents, graft on a boring and unnecessary sub plot and you have a forgettable experience.Rated 4 of 10 - primarily on the strength of Ed Harris and the sniper vs. sniper confrontation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was thinking - should I visit this movie or not, I thought that this movie will be another like "Saving Private Ryan" movie which show how USA was fighting with Nazi Germany, but the WWII was not between USA and Germany only. After seeing that film I was deeply impressed - I even can`t imagine that non-Russian director could film such a good and truthful movie about the most great battle in WWII - Stalingrad battle. Yes, he was right by showing poor russian soldiers (One rifle for two people, for example) and fully equipped German warriors, but, it was only the beginning. Then he showed us a real heroizm of all Russian people who is fighting for his own land, who is together is fighting against one enemy - the Nazis. Maybe he was right to show how the propaganda works on people, but, believe me - if we take out from this movie all such things (like newspapers with Zaitsev photos, like Nikita Krushchev (I don`t know at all what he is doing there, BTW) - we can see there one REAL man - Vasiliy Zaitsev - this men really exists, and he really was sniper. This is the one not-russian movie [I`ve seen] which show truth about WWII, which show truth about who was fighting in this was and who is really won the war. Yes, I`m Russian. 10 from 10. (And I`ve checked back Saving Private Ryan movie and lower my rating for this movie, because, again - Enemy at the Gates - is the best non-russian movie about WWII)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better then expectedThis was actually a very good movie, but that was not what I expected. After have seen a couple of interviews with Jean-Jacques Annaud - and also after had seen his latest movie with Brad Pitt - I was afraid that he had become to interested in the commercial parts of the movie industry and that the movie would follow standard form 1A...but it didn't.The fact that everybody talks english wasn't at all as annoying as I had expected either. The thing was that it would have been very strange if the movie involved talk between germans and russian and both are screaming in english but they don't understand each other...luckily there is no such talk between the both parties so then it's ok with english.The actors was of varying standard. Jude Law - whom has gotten much criticism for his part wasn't all that bad. Rachel Weiss was worse - can't understand why they screened her. Joseph Fiennes was ok but not more...and Ron Perlman was - not good but contributing to the movie with his presence. Best was Ed Harris as the German nobleman....there was real blue blood in his veins. Bob Hoskins was ok as Khrushchev.The settings was magnificent and the sf/x was good.One annoying thing was the music...James Horner must have some other music than 'Braveheart' and 'Titanic'....sometimes it felt like he had just taken the score from those two movies and added them in this movie. Not good - even thou the music is good it's sad to hear it in all the movies in which he composes the score.All in all. a 9/10One more good thing was that the love part of the movie wasn't as misplaced as it was in Braveheart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know about the World War II not only from the books. My mother was 6 years old when her village near Smolensk was occupied by Germans. Memories of mass killings, neighbor village burned along with its population, their entire village moving to live in a nearby forest, bombings, famine, decease, blood-drenched fields, hanging of a traitor, are forever imprinted in her mind. My (Jewish) father's 9-year old memories of evacuation from Kiev in one of those cars you can see in "Enemy at the Gates", being separated from his mother on the way (she stayed in one of the train stops to bury her infant son who didn't survive evacuation).I can't take War stories just as "stories". They are my family's life. "Enemy at the Gates" from the first scenes struck me as very true to what I heard from my mother and father, what I've seen in Stalingrad' museums when I visited the city as a child. I'm really surprised by tepid reviews this movie received. Some say it's not deep enough, others say that the romantic part of it could be left out. May be it's not very deep, but it's true. The "meat grinder" scenes, Soviet officers killing unarmed "cowards" who showed their backs to the enemy, "creation" of a hero, and love and lovemaking amidst it all: it's all true and it did happen. Somehow it's important to me that people know and remember it all. I have this stupid hope that if people know and remember, they will not let it happen again.Obviously this is a very personal and emotional view. Watching a desperate half-armed attack of Soviet troops, I whispered to my husband "This is how your and my grandfathers were killed". Of course we'll never know if they were killed by German bullets. This film is very important to ME, because I BELIEVE that knowing my homeland history is important. Watch this movie if knowing true history is important to you. Skip it if you are fishing for entertainment, or for very deep lessons about life, or for deep and interesting character development. I'm not sure how deep comrade Zaitsev was. Maybe he was a common person put in very uncommon circumstances.I give this movie 10 for truthfulness. In this particular case everything else is less important to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Like Watching Nazis Die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes of this movie, that depict a peasant boy being taught to kill wolves, intercut with a scene of Soviet soldiers being mowed down by Nazi automatic fire, were very hard for this viewer to watch.I'm not inured to cinematic violence. I wanted to give up on this movie for that reason. But, I had other reasons for watching it, so I continued.The violence is very well crafted. I felt as if I were watching real men being mowed down by real Nazis. I cried.The speeches commanders were giving their men -- reading letters from Russian mothers adjuring their boys to sacrifice for the motherland; informing men that deserters would be shot; the command, "The one who has the rifle shoots. The one who doesn't have the rifle follows him. When the one with the rifle gets shot, the one without the rifle, takes the rifle, and shoots," are movie lines I don't think I'll soon forget.The performances are brilliant. Everyone, except, maybe, Bob Hoskins, who is depicted as simply older than Krushchev was at this time -- other than that, though Hoskins is good -- but everyone else is superb.Rachel Weisz, without a touch of make-up, her eyebrows untweezed, is so beautiful, inside and out, you can see why two men are in love with her.Jude Law is convincing as a Russian peasant who grew up to be a WW II sniper. This guy really is so much more than a pretty face. I think if he were not so good looking his deftness as an actor would be much more widely commented upon.Joseph Fiennes brings great conviction, intelligence, craftiness and fire to his part as a Communist propagandist."Minor" roles are similarly knocked out of the park -- Eva Mattes as besieged housewife, Gebrial Marshall-Thomson as a little boy taking on the job of a very big man, Ron Perlman as a man who sees through Communism, Sophie Rois as a female sniper, add depth and texture.Ed Harris as Major Konig really hypnotized me here. It was like watching a cobra in human form.It's a good thing that a mainstream, big budget movie addressed the Soviet contribution to the war.It's also a good thing that this movie is not any more romantic than it needs to be about what Soviet Communism was really all about, behind the slogans. At one point, a key character delivers a speech that is one of the best deconstructions of communism that I've ever heard. I ask myself, "Would I watch this again? Why or why not?" I don't think I could ever watch this again -- it was just too hard, too unrelieved. Mud, death, corpses, killing. Yeah, that's war. Why the sensible among us don't like war.I have another reservation about this movie. As hard as the opening scene was to watch, I watched it twice, at least partly because I knew it would be capped off with Zaitsev (Jude Law) the Russian sniper, swiftly picking off a handful of Nazi soldiers.Again, I try to avoid violent entertainment, because I agree with research that shows that violent entertainment changes us in ways I'd rather not be changed.When a movie makes me want to watch men die, I am fearful of what that movie is doing to me.I did want to see those Nazis die. I enjoyed watching Zaitsev pick them off.Part of the message of this movie is: lone, righteous man with gun solves problems by shooting bullets into other men's heads.That gives me pause.PS: James Horner's score may sound familiar to you. In fact, he is using bits of Prokofiev's score for the film "Alexander Nevsky." Nevsky, of course, depicts medieval battles with the (Germanic) Teutonic Knights, and was meant to be analagous with the Soviet struggle with Nazism. So, Horner's score's quotes from Prokofiev brings those motifs full circle.</fullReview>

What finally got me to see it was that I heard, and mistakenly so, that Rachel Weisz was nude in it. She is not, though you barely see the top of her butt. VERY disappointing. The story was okay, and the actors did fine. Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris are always great (though I do NOT recommend seeing Pollack) as World War II Sniper guys trying to "off" each other. Rachel was not as beautiful, except for MAYBE that partial nude scene. If I were you, I would not waste my time. There are many other GREAT movies out there. 11-30-03. waltcd@hotmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy of the mediocre lineup that is in Australian theatres right now...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of July 27, 2001, the films available for viewing in the local theatre are Bridget Jones' Diary (note the proper spelling, publicists!), Doctor Dolittle 2, Evolution, Final Fantasy, Heartbreakers, Moulin Rouge, Shrek, Someone Like You, Swordfish, and Tomb Raider. Then there is Enemy At The Gates. It could be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. I'm sure the Russians who fought in the battle of Stalingrad would feel that at least someone painted a realistic portrait of the hell on Earth that they endured. Of course, the film comes of as being somewhat fantastic, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was actually a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it very entertaining to watch.A lot of historians have it that the battle of Stalingrad was the most unpleasant one fought during the second World War, and this film's set design and cinematography capture that impeccably. When the Russians are battling the Nazis, you get the idea that if the Nazis didn't kill them, malnutrition, tetanus, scurvy, bubonic plague, or a million other things would. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes lend authenticity to their roles that makes it even easier to follow them on their personal journey through hell, and Ed Harris is scarily convincing as a high-ranking Nazi. The real surprise here, however, is Rachel Weisz as Sergeant Tania Chernova, and the very heart and soul of the film. When she describes the reasons why she decided to take up a gun and battle the Germans, it all makes so much sense that you just want to buy the poor girl a beer and give her a good warm embrace. Not that such things would erase the scars that her character bears, but one would feel obligated to try.Writer/Director Jean-Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. It's very tricky to get these two things in proper sync, but they more than manage here. They also don't rely on any hokey photographic effects to tell the story, simply letting you see everything as clearly as possible, letting your imagination do the rest. Anyone who's read anything credible about the inhuman suffering the Russian soldiers endured during this battle will have no trouble filling in the gaps that the narrative leaves about their living conditions. The blood and gore shown during the battles is also very conducive to the atmosphere. Rather than just expecting you to believe that a solider gets his stomach spread all over half a kilometer of pavement by enemy bullets, they show you so you can get a feel for how bloodthirsty both sides in the confrontation were. Even the sex scene doesn't look out of place here.To make a long story short, this is the first film I've seen in a long, long time that I haven't been able to come up with a list of criticisms for. It is simply excellent, and the 7.1 rating it is currently stuck with does not do it justice. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and even the equal of Saving Private Ryan. Vassili Zaitsev would be very happy that his struggle has inspired such a commendable piece of art - it is exactly the sort of thing he and millions of others like him (on both sides of the German Reich) were fighting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan may have been the best war footage ever shot. The first 30 minutes of Enemy at the Gates is at least as good. And the rest of this remarkable feeling is better -- for its clear-eyed view of the war on the Eastern Front, the story Hollywood never tells. The struggle between two totalitarian leaders, Hitler and Stalin, was the most bestial and ferocious battle in history. The film opens with an unbearably horrifying tableau in Stalingrad. The Russian conscripts, without enough rifles to go around, are sent armed and unarmed to charge a well-entrenched German position. They are slaughtered by machine gun fire. As they run back to their own lines, their own officers open fire on them, shouting "deserters will be shot." From this shocking beginning, we are offered a vision of war in which there are no winners, no right side and wrong side, in which all but the leaders are victims. Enemy at the Gates is perhaps the most honest film ever made about war. It has subtle, trenchant observations about the nature of propaganda and of genuine heroism, and its depiction of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) is as compelling and realistic as anything put on film. There are a number of exceptional performances. Three young English actors -- Joseph Fiennes, Jude Law and Rachel Weisz -- offer a superb ensemble performance. They make their unglamorous characters utterly and compellingly human. Yet they are overshadowed in a career-best performance by the American actor Ed Harris, who in his maturity is emerging as one of the finest American actors of the century. There is a strong resonance of Burt Lancaster in his prime in Harris's nuanced, brilliant performance, where every gesture and every facial expression is invested with meaning and depth. Bob Hoskins is terrifying as the calculating and brutal Nikita Sergeyevich Khruschev, who made his name as a political commissar at Stalingrad and later succeeded Stalin as dictator of the Soviet Union. There is a superb cameo as well from the rarely-used American actor Everett McGill, who had the starring non-speaking role in the director Jean-Jacques Annaud's film Quest for Fire. Yet it is the central performances of the three young people that carries the film and gives it emotional weight. Annaud weaves their performances into an intimate glimpse of what it is like to fight for rulers in whom you have no faith, against an implacable enemy, all the while trying to retain a vestige of your humanity. Fiennes as the disillusioned propagandist Danilov -- a Jew who becomes a political commissar to escape persecution -- is very good; as is Weisz. Yet it is young Jude Law, in a performance even more impressive than his role in The Talented Mr. Ripley, who fills the screen nearly as well as Harris. If Law continues to be this good, he could very well grow up to be the next Michael Caine. A first-class film all around, and the only "must see" movie of the year. Far better than Pearl Harbour (which I rather liked, despite its old=fashioned sentimentality), Enemy at the Gates is war at its most elemental -- a raw struggle to defend all you have and are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Carry On Stalingrad".....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence is a plain rip-off of Saving Private Ryan.....and the casting in this film must be amongst the worst in living memory...... OK the film is intense with good battle scenes.....but the attempt to disguise this movie as truth is laughable. The essence of the picture is about 2 snipers battling it out for supremacy...one Russian and the other German at Stalingrad. Now.... what really irks me is that most of the lead actors have accents and mannerisms which are totally regional(south London circa 1980's at that) which from my perspective makes viewing this movie even more difficult as I am meant to be watching Russians in the 1940's! Ed Harris is the German Officer...Ed Harris you ask?....A fine actor normally but he is 100% Yank(and it shows)....and the really hilarious sight is to see Bob Hoskins with added nose as Krushchev.....oh dear.....its all completely over the top with blazing eyes, cockney voice and market trader mentality....at least dear old Bob has now taken over from Donald Pleasance as the Greatest Living Ham..... The film is further ruined for me by silly sub-plots such as Joseph Fiennes re-doing his role...though this time its' Shakespeare-in-Hate...and so all in all a 3 out of 10 is generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just have one thing to say : the movie is much better than Saving private Ryan !!! Jude Law acted so well, so did Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz and Bob Hoskins. Didn't like Fiennes much !

		<fullReview>I didn't know that movie was coming. So when I just saw Jude Law interview and movie shots from "Enemy of the Gates" - I wanted to see it desperately as I like war dramas, actors involved - Jude was great in "Talented Mr. Ripley", when I found out that Rachel Weisz was also there - that was just WOW! And well, I'm Russian. How could I miss that one? Luckily it was in Russian movie theaters at the beginning of April. Beginning of the movie, introduction of the characters was great. Jude looked as believable Russian soldier. Rachel Weisz was incredible, I can't stop admiring her beauty, and yes - she looked very Russian as well. As it was said here, finally there was given some credit to Russians for beating fascism. The movie is superb. It's romance, suspense, war drama. You care a lot about characters. The plot got some nice twists and wasn't banal for a minute. Love scene was amazing. The acting is great, Jude and Rachel were awesome. Hoskins, Pearlman did a great job. About Vassily Zaitsev - I'm 20 and many people of my age don't know him here in Russia. So he is not that well-known hero now, that movie will remind of him and other millions sacrificing their lives, struggling for future of their wives and children, not comrade Stalin. The truth about NKVD and penal battalions was never revealed during Soviet regime, it was not in any history books until USSR collapse. That was never showed in war dramas of Soviet period. It was interesting to see the historical moments live with the help of sound and visual effects. I can tell that there were no laughs about portraying Russians by Americans in this movie like it was in Armageddon, etc. I read a lot here about British accent, but I watched it dubbed in Russian. It was good. I'll check later on DVD how was the original dialogue. The spelling in letters seemed to be correct (comparing to other movies like Virus, Saint, etc. - I can't stop wondering why American movie makers can't hire some immigrants who talk and spell Russian, but no - they literally translate some stuff which sounds so stupid, and yes - fake Russian sounds funny for us). It would be interesting to find out impressions of Soviet veterans about the movie. People applauded when Hoskins introduced himself as Krushchev, he acted great. By the way he played communist leader Beria already in some movie about Stalin regime few years ago. At the end just want to say that many friends of mine loved the movie and acclaimed it as superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed to deliver on almost every level...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I may have been biased after watching Saving Private Ryan a few days ago, I was absolutely dismayed by the lack of quality presented by this movie.As a whole, the movie just seemed like the director was painfully trying to make everything fit together. The wolf scene in the beginning really did not have any correlation with the movie; although it suggested he may have been hesitant about taking lives, it was clear that he had no such qualms after the first 20 minutes.The script was one of the worst I have seen. Despite Jude Law being a terrible selection for a war movie in the first place, they didn't have to give him a head start to his sub-par performance by providing him with laughable dialog. Some of these reviews talk about authenticity; what the hell did the director expect to accomplish by giving his actors cheesy lines that they read in accents completely opposite to what they should have been. I mean, we know Jude Law's British...let's not make it agonizingly obvious by making him use his normal accent as a Russian... By far the worst performance was the Russian with no teeth that gets shot in midair... I was actually laughing at his dialog because it was so forced and pathetic.And if this weren't enough validation for me to slam this film, the director decided to throw in another forced element: a corny, trite love story. As if we needed another Pearl Harbor... As far-fetched as it was to have a female elite sniper that was moderately attractive and somehow in contact with both Law and Fiennes, Jean-Jacques Annaud decided to have her fall in love with Law and add some facetious gap-filler to his movie.Seriously...the movie probably could have been squeezed into about 15 minutes and it would have been just as eventful; the only interesting parts were the battle scenes (which is where the three stars came from), which I thought portrayed not necessarily a historically accurate view of Stalingrad but a visually stunning one nonetheless. Props to Annaud for the one thing he did right. But his empty, implausible storyline that just made me sit back in my chair and wonder how much longer it would be until the pain was over absolutely ruined this movie. The nail in the coffin was finding out that the girl that got blown up by an artillery shell actually survived so that the movie could have a fairy tale ending. If you thought this movie was good, go see Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers so you can see what a real war movie with good actors is supposed to be like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least a U.S. WW II movie without an American Hero on it...I found exiting to see a very good movie (a heroic movie) with a different concept on it...this time with a hero from the other side (the side always to be the enemy side)... ...besides, it has a "foreign" (as US people say) look.... that I (a non US person) would better say is an "european-independent" look......definetelly, it doesn't has a U.S. movie look...and looks strongly different to false-artificially-made War movies like Pearl Harbor, The only thing that would be necessary for this movie to be 100% satisfactorily COMPLETE is the Russian (and German) language instead of a full English spoken movie (I hope to get the Russian DVD version some day for seeing it with an original language fell on it!!).I'm hoping to see more movies like this...with different heroes from different places over the world. thanks for reading.</fullReview>

A heroic tale with admirable, principled characters, all willing to risk their lives for what they think is right. The opening sequence is possibly the best I've ever seen for bringing the horror and terror of combat right into your heart and the movie lives up to that level of intensity, while beautifully narrowing the focus to the conflict between one expert soldier from each side. I could go on but let me just say rent it now, you can thank the producers later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cookie cutter failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was excited to see Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes in the same movie, `Enemy at the Gates' still managed to disappoint me both in plot and acting. This movie is another in the series of easily predictable cookie cutter `war/love' films to come out of Hollywood. Peppered with irrelevant metaphors of wolves and donkeys, I found myself laughing at the moments that were supposed to be serious. For example, Danilov says, `What we need is a hero.' Khrushchev sarcastically replies, `Do you know any heroes?' Danilov answers, `I know one.' Please, this scene happens in every movie. Naturally after that conversation, the camera moves to the main character, who is also the `hero' previously talked about. As for the romance, it was completely unnecessary. The romance was so forced. There were no sparks between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz. The love scene in the barracks was completely unbelievable as well as unpassionate. First, I thought it was totally lame that they make the girl start it especially if we're supposed to believe that she's a virgin. Second, she looked as if she were in pain during the whole sex part and if they were really in love, he would act like he cared instead of pounding away. Third, like the guy walking through wouldn't notice, let's get realistic here.  I personally think that I may have enjoyed the movie if Tania character were a guy or not in the movie at all. The love was not only forced, but was completely unnecessary and took away from the movie instead of making it better. Her character was a complete stereotype the `smart strong independent coy tomboy.' How she was going to be involved was so obvious and bland. I was relieved when she got shot, I thought there was going to be a plot twist, but alas she miraculously bounced back to perfect health in some random hospital. It was clear that the love part of the movie was in it because it was part of this equation that supposedly equals `good epic film.' Visually, I got pretty tired of the shaking and moving camera during fight scenes and scenes with sniper stuff. I know that it was supposed to create confusion and discomfort like the characters feel, but it didn't work for me for over two hours. I did however, really like the fonts that they used on screen in the beginning and again in the credits in the end. I think those parts were visually well done. The favorite part of the movie was the part with the map and the Nazi regime looking like black blood infesting Europe. I thought that was a great visual representation of what was happening at that time. The only scene that had any positive impact on me was the beginning when all the soldiers were being forced out of the train to battle to fight and most likely die. That scene was pretty well done but the blood explosions in slow motion were a little too much. This movie was trying to be a riveting `epic film' geared toward everyone with war and explosions for guys and love and `hot guys' for girls. With all these supposedly promising ingredients the film didn't work because there was no chemistry between Fiennes and Law or between Law and Weisz. This is a hard thing to not have because they were trying to portray these dramatic roles that were very heavy and serious but instead the acting and `love' scenes made me laugh instead of identify with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands tall among most war time movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie definitely tops my list of war-time movies. My absolute favorite. Great package of everything - story, screenplay, direction, acting, casting, background music, cinematography. Watched it in star movies some five years ago without any clue of what its in store. I must say I was just glued to the TV set. When it got over.. I was like "wow! what a movie!" Vasilli zaitsev is not only courageous, fearless and possesses razor- sharp focus but also a very intelligent sniper. Each encounter of his with the enemy sniper simply deserves an applause for the way he uses his presence of mind and outsmarts the enemy. I feel thats the main reason why this movie is so engaging and different. Unlike other war movies this one revolves around only one soldier most of the times. His valour and brilliance is all what the movie is about. Jude law pulls it off in style.The supporting casts add power to the movie. Outstanding war scenarios give the needed momentum. All in all its a must see piece. Go watch it now to enjoy this great work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mano a Mano, Sniper to Sniper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is set in the second World War, on the border between the Soviet Union and Germany (actually, more in the Soviet Union, as the Germans have reached Stalingrad). But the story is of one man, a farm boy who has grown up to be a sharp-shooter. We see his skill, his love, and his adversary.This film is fairly interesting because, from America's point of view, neither Germany or Russia was really the "good guy", even if we officially had Russia on our side. But here we focus on a man, who like any other soldier or even any human, has the same struggles and feelings. So, we can't help but feel sympathy for him, even if we want to dislike the Russians. (I, for one, do not identify any one person with their country, but it's easy to do.) The commissar tries to paint things on a national level, saying that the sniper conflict is "not just a war of countries, but class struggle" because the Russian is a farm boy and the German went to good schools. How much any Soviet citizen or official took this sort of view seriously, I don't know. To me, it sounds flaky. The Soviet Union had very little to do with class struggle after the first few years, and I'm fairly certain everyone knew that. But, I could be wrong.Another piece of wisdom bestowed in the film is: "In the forest, the wolf lives for three years, the donkey for nine." They explain this means that the more useful creature ought to live longer, justifying the uneducated getting sent to war so the educated can keep society running. There are so many things that can be said about this... I don't even know where to begin. But it's very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally good, but with a few problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, I liked this film. It had a good story, based on historical people and events, some taut drama, a nice little love story on the side. It was well-shot and mostly well-acted.There are, however, a couple of significant problems with the film. First, there are the accents. Most of the actors made little effort at developing believable accents and spoke in their own accents. I could have lived with this, although some credible accents would have helped. What was really objectionable was Ron Perlman, who tried to speak with an accent, but it came out more Australian-sounding than Russian. He would have been better off just using his American accent.My other chief objection involved the climactic scene. Without delivering any spoilers, I will only say (as others have) that it seemed to have been plucked straight out of a western movie. There was not even any subtlety to that allusion, and it served no purpose in the film. My guess is that writer-director Jean-Jacques Annaud was a fan of those classic western showdown scenes and wanted to incorporate the look as a matter of style. It didn't work.Having made those objections, however, I will re-iterate that my overall impression of the film was positive. If you enjoy a good war film that is not just a "rally round the flag" kind of glorification of war, you will probably enjoy enough to make it worth watching. Just don't expect it to be on your list of all-time greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comrade Kruschev is sent to stiffen the spines of the Red Army.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Less than twenty years after these events,Premier Kruschev was taking off his shoe and banging it on his desk at the United Nations Building. Always a consummate actor,Kruschev terrified half the world,put the first man in space,built the Berlin Wall and forced Kennedy to remove US bases in Turkey by deploying missiles in Cuba.He debunked the myth of Stalin when it suited him and gloried in the image of the ignorant peasant who had fought his way to the top of the heap.People who bought that fatally underestimated his political genius. A crumbling Red Army was re- vitalised by his dynamism and dialectic. Sniper Vasily Zaitsev certainly had his mind concentrated wonderfully. His exploits were broadcast throughout the Soviet Union,making him a legend amongst the defenders of Stalingrad. In order to eliminate him the besieging Germans employed Major Konig,their best man."Enemy at the gates" tells the story of their duel. Both adversaries were cunning and ruthless,but also respectful of the other's ability with a rifle. Along with the operators of flame throwers,snipers were the most hated of opponents and could expect absolutely no mercy if captured by the enemy.Neither Zaitsev nor Konig had any intention of being captured. The siege of Stalingrad was definitely not won on the playing fields of Eton.The Russians were systematically slaughtered by the Wermacht and the Luftwaffe to whom they were "untermenschen".Hardly surprising then when the roles were reversed very few German soldiers returned from Russian Prison camps at the end of the war. I will mention Mr Ed Harris who gives the standout performance as the cold - eyed Major Konig,seeking revenge for the killing of his son. All the other actors are more than adequate without really breaking into a sweat. There is a quite unbelievable and absolutely unnecessary "love" scene where Miss R.Weiss struggles to get into Mr J.Law's pants and when she does it seems hardly worth the effort. The raison d'etre of the movie remains the battle of the two marksmen which is resolved finally in a bit of an anti - climactic scene where Major Konig removes his hat and stands still whilst Zaitsev shoots him at close range. But to me the shadow of Nikita Kruschev looms large over this movie,as it did over the world at the height of the Cold War which remained Cold not least because Kruschev had no intention of ever letting it become Hot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snipers in Stalingrad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about this film before I watched it other than it was about two snipers playing cat and mouse during the Battle of Stalingrad. While that is correct as a very basic summary it doesn't do justice to the excellent film set in a part of the war rarely featured in movies that tend to concentrate on engagements involving Commonwealth or US forces.The film follows Vassili Zaitsev, a young soldier played by Jude Law, as he goes to Stalingrad and it thrown into battle without even a rifle, he is just told to take one from his comrades when they are killed. After the battle he hides in a fountain where he meets political officer Danilov. Danilov wants to shoot the Germans who are in a nearby ruined building but can't do it so gives the rifle to Vassili who dispatches five of them without them returning a single shot. The political officer sees that Vassili can be used as a propaganda tool, both to inspire other Soviets and to demoralise the Germans. As he kills more and more senior Germans he does indeed become a hero and the Germans send their top sniper to Stalingrad to kill him. What follows is a cat and mouse game where each tries to lure the other into a trap so that they can kill them.In the background to this action there is a love story between Vassili and a female soldier called Tania, the situation is complicated by the fact that Danilov also fancies her and as she can speak German he gets her transferred to his department.The story is well told and exciting with great performance from Jude Law, Ed Harris (German sniper Erwin König), Rachel Weisz (Tania) and Joseph Fiennes (Danilov). While the love story wasn't strictly necessary it didn't distract from the main story and was well executed. While it only tells one small story amongst one of the largest battles of the Second World War it is still a film that most fans of war films will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This (i think) is the greatest example of what happened at the beginning of the Battle of Stalingrad. This film shows what really happened at Russia at the time for example: The Russians would shoot there own men if they ran away from there post, betray there country, even if they hesitated they would get shoot on the spot. Also, at the beginning of the film, the Russian generals would throw there men into battle with any excuses and most of the men did'nt even have weapons, it was a bad start for the Sovient Union in world war 2. A lot of hatred is shown in this movie, as Danilov betrays Vassili Zaitsev because he caught Vassili kissing the woman Danilov loved. Great acting by Ed Harris as Major Konig and Bob Hoskins as Krushev, plus Jude Law as Vassili Zaitsev.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant war film, but not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent war film, and at the times when it depicts the battles against the Germans it is brilliant and absorbs you in the moment. Also the brutality of the Russian commissars against their own men is fantastically portrayed. This movie influenced the first Call of Duty game in the way that Saving Private Ryan did for Medal of Honor. However some aspects of the plot are too Hollywood, such as the romance between Law and Weisz which I find completely out-of-place in a film such as this, particularly how she is always so well kept. Plus the bunker they hide in is far too well stocked, what happened to living in sewers and eating rats? One of the reasons the Battle of Satlingrad is so infamous. Once the film moves into the second half, the two snipers seem to almost forget they are in the middle of the greatest battle of all time, and the story becomes a bit too self-centred. To conclude it is an excellent, authentic war film, but the plot is too blockbuster, and thus loses some of its realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War II Told From A Soviet Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "Quest for Fire" director Jean-Jacques Annaud's World War II spectacle "Enemy at the Gates" reminded me of the "Sgt. Rock" comic books that I used to peruse as an adolescent when I was growing up in Mississippi during the Cold War years of the 1960s. Those fiendishly duplicitous Nazis in "Sgt Rock" always set up ingenious ambushes, concealing themselves in places where the unsuspecting American G.I.s would least expect to spot them, such as either disabled tanks or the rubble of fallen buildings. "Enemy at the Gates" keeps that Nazi skullduggery intact. Although French director Annaud, whose credits include "Seven Years in Tibet" and "In the Name of the Rose," condemns the Nazi, he goes to heavy-handed lengths near the end to rekindle our antipathy to National Socialism. You'll know the scene when you see it. I hate movie critics would give away too much of a movie plot.Anyway, the aristocratic Nazi Major Konig (Ed Harris of "Stepmom") dispatched to kill our heroic Red Army sniper disguises a department store mannequin in a gray Wehrmacht uniform with a rifle. Talk about symbolism!? Weren't the Wehrmacht supposed to be the good guys, and the Nazis the evil villains? Although this large-scale, $80 million, World War II epic glorifies the marksmanship of real-life Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law of "Cold Mountain") who bagged 300 Germans, Annaud condemns the Soviet ideology that Vassili defended. At the same time, no matter how magnificent the set design, costume design, and overall production of the film remains, "Enemy at the Gates" is painfully predictable, though far better than its American counterpart "Saving Private Ryan." Indeed, while both films feature snipers, "Enemy" achieves far greater realism and far less sentimental loquacity than Steven Spielberg's highly-overrated D-Day saga. Nevertheless, "Saving Private Ryan" and "Enemy at the Gates" both celebrate the supremacy of the individual.Anybody that marches into "Enemy at the Gates" with the impression that the Nazis will triumph is hopelessly na?ve, so Annaud's cinematic strategy of making this movie into a cat-and-mouse duel between sympathetic snipers falters in the last half-hour when the Nazi foe unveils his murderous colors. Ultimately, "Enemy" shares more in common ideologically with director Howard Hawk's patriotic 1941 film biography about World War I Tennessee sharpshooter Alvin York in "Sergeant York." York captured hundreds of German troops single-handedly by using his sniping skills in World War I. Warner Brothers produced "Sergeant York" during the tumultuous days of 1941 to drum up patriotism among Americans and give them somebody to emulate. Similarly, Vassili rise to prominence as a Red Army war hero occurs when a young Communist political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes of "Elizabeth" and "Shakespeare in Love") suggests the way to inspire morale during among the infantry is to reinvent Vassili Zaitsev as a hero for the army to worship. One of the problems about being a film critic and film lover is that you spot some things that nobody else would care about, like Danilov's "Battleship Potemkin" eyewear. Real cute, Jean-Jacques.Anybody that has read anything about the brutal battle of Stalingrad in 1942 knows that it emerges as one of the savage battles of all time. Imagine Dante's "Inferno" as the genuine article, and you have a fair idea how devastating the fighting was. "Enemy's" opening scenes show literally thousands of young Soviet troops piling aboard filthy railroad cattle cars and freighted to the war-ravaged city on the Volga where most would die. As "Enemy" unfolds, our protagonist, young Vassili Zaitsev, finds himself among scores of comrades as their officers issue rifles to every other soldier while those soldiers-in-between receive a mere magazine clip of bullets. Basically, the Soviets hurled more men into combat than they had rifles to arm! Sounds rather anti-Soviet to me. If an individual survived, he had to participate in the gory art of battlefield salvage. In other words, taking rifles off the dead! Anyway, Vassili charges off courageously into the fray with a fistful of bullets and bides his time until he can acquire a rifle. ("Enemy" loves to flashback to childhood memories of Vassili in the snowy Urals lining up a wolf in the cross-hairs as it attacks a staked out horse. The outcome of this flashback is pretty predictable, too.) Meanwhile, Soviet officers gun down without qualm any infantrymen that retreat from the Nazi horde. Neither side emerges from "Enemy" as white-washed as the American G.I.s in "Saving Private Ryan." The Soviets aren't quite as diabolical as the Nazis. After all, remember who won World War II. When we first meet Comrade Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins of "The Long Good Friday"), he forces a high-ranking Soviet general to commit suicide because he cannot repel the Nazi invaders. Usually, this scene appears in only Nazi war movies where suicide is deemed the simple way out.Basically, "Enemy" chronicles not only the cat-and-mouse showdown between Nazi Major Konig and Vassili, but also a love triangle with Vassili, Danilov, and a beautiful Jewish girl, Tanya (Rachel Weisz of "The Mummy") whose parents died at the hands of the Nazis. Indeed, Annaud manages successfully to blow soap bubbles amid bullets. Imagine "Jules and Jim" in Stalingrad and you know what to expect. The outcome is a predictable as who survives the duel, but Annaud gives it the kind of noble gravity that it requires to rupture your tear ducts.Guys who like war movies where you can see authentic vintage bombers dropping loads on the battleground, especially the Junkers 87, aka "Stuka" dive-bombers, will love this war movie despite its romantic interludes. Had Annaud gone against the grain on certain plot elements and characters, "Enemy at the Gates" might have qualified as a contemporary classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long Days Journey Into Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt that with this motion picture a difficult ability was made more difficult.There is no time perhaps even unto mans history when such battles were fought as was the days that engulfed the world in World War II.The Battles at Stalingrad and then Kursk would for those interested mark drama so deadly,the cost in life so extreme that it is cause to look again at the passing of time with but a steadfast eye.It is a serious affront to our place in matters of the world and as compelling as any death the likes of which have no equal lest there be the tolling of the bells with the onset of the "Black Death".It is a very difficult position in its entirety to allow all the days to be as these days whereby millions of people were removed from the earth and time merely stood still as there was no day to be tomorrow for today was enough.The tragedy was not to be extended it was to be protracted in an end time concern.The Red Army was triumphant though such triumphs should be warned against when looked at more closely because there was nothing its equal in the record of mans place in this world and though it is an expense, the cost was a cost that turned the tide of events of World War II.When Germany's 6th Army was defeated it was representative of the rolling back of the tide with the battle of Kursk looking like a serious attempt to merely establish a holding position.It was not to be for the German 6th Army was not to stop back pedaling perhaps it can be suggested until the days of this war were to be done.Though it is suggested by these comments that the German 6th Army was retreating it is a note to be certain that the retreating Army did not always look like a retreating Army.Those whose interests have ever eclipsed the War between the States here in the America's will know that with Robert E. Lee at the helm.Confederate forces provided for General Grant more than a handful of engagements that were so deadly that they had eclipsed a much more deadly engagement merely days before.It was during the days that followed The Battle of Gettyburg a retreating Robert E.Lee exacted a cost that though dramatic and even victorious was to serve notice as to those who followed for this was war.Indeed it was something from Abraham Lincoln which though somewhat shocked at the toll of these engagements was to say,"Grant Fights".The northern industrial might was a terribly important piece in determining the final outcome and indeed there was a real step up for the Russian Red Army that was supplied with so much that it just got bigger and bigger much like the Army of the Potamac under General Grant.Critical and dramatic were these events and one might suggest not unlike the other.This particular account in Enemy At The Gates is merely some Hollywood offerring which by no means allows us to know much of anything and as well everything sort of looks like everything else which is something that does not make anymore anything better.There is historical information that the account of the Russian defense at Stalingrad did benefit more than merely one expert sniper in Vasili Zeitsev,it benefited from an entire account as Russian sharpshooters were eating the Germans alive.Though Zeitsev is championed in this motion picture there were others whose accomplishments were even more so as there numbers were greater in confirmed enemy kills.There is mention of a film called "War of the Rats" whereby this very sewer to sewer,building to building,pipeline to pipeline served to undermine the German position and was instrumental in the German High Commands Decision to send for one of its very best Sharpshooters in a Major Konig.This particular film is useful at least for a time with this clever battle of wits that both sides waged with the arrival of Konig.If there was a moment whereby I judged this film it was in the moment of victory over a predator in this Major Konig as portrayed in the picture.I watched closely for an inability to know and was satisfied that indeed with a victory in hand there was no doubt in its execution.There is a real disadvantage that the public in General are victims of and some of this victimization is as a result of not knowing the truth nor possessing the will to know better than merely this kind of offerring.One of the areas not dealt with in a much the same way however the Russians had an expert Spy ring called Lucy which was so well informed that long before something was to happen they,the Russians were to be ready.It was in an account of the Battle of Kursk where some of these hitherto unknown strengths possessed by the Russians became evident.This film is somewhat reticent to discuss these areas and indeed as suggested this maybe merely an entertainment vehicle which I wish could find entertainment elsewhere.Hollywood belongs not on the field of the dead nor should such be made as to make money in performing as if to be something that this is not.This is not the real thing and it should not no not ever thought to be the real thing.It is thought that there was all this that occurred however there is in this film much exxageration with story telling more important than the story of The Russian Sniper Division so effective in disrupting German interests at Stalingrad that it may of in fact altered history.If this film did anything it forced me to do some research and it is this research that made this A Long Days Journey into Night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A HERO DOES NOT CHOSESE HIS DESTINY, DESTINY CHOSES HIM. This is an actual life historical drama about a young Russian Shepard boy from Urals who with the chain of events become a symbol of pride, heroism and hope fro his nation. His moments of test came at the time when their country was run over by the Germans in ww2. Reluctantly Vassily zytzev was sent to war in Stalingrad.This city was besieged by Germans and if the Russians lost it their whole morale would lay in ruins. By shooting down 5 Nazi officers Vassily is in the views of comrade damalov ,who than narrated his story to khruschev, at that ti8me country was in the grip of chaos and oppression of Joseph Stalin and the assault by over zealot adolf Hitler was in insult to the injury. That was the time when damalov said we need our heroes who can make the whole nation believe in the victory. That Vassily became a hero overnight. Although he knew the burden of huge responsibility he s going to have and he is somehow scared from inside, as in the start of the movie we saw him shooting at a wolf under the observation of his grandfather and later he misses. Than he is locked in a cat and mouse battle with best Nazi sharp shooter who has his own bitter experiences of war. This shows how sometimes some persons in real life have to go through the stations which they don't want but they face it with courage and valor and their decisions turn the face of both their nations destiny and history. Some how its a great movie and story. fantastic direction and acting. I love it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very well made.Well written, good actors, convincing set design, costumes and cinematography.But it has a major flaw.It is not Russian. It doesn't feel Russian. The main reason is language.The actors are well cast and all of them could pass for Russians, but the way they act and deliver lines is utterly non-Russian.The same thing with Doctor Zhivago and The Beast of War, for example.All very good movies and worth watching, but fake.For West-European and American audiences they're probably OK, and actually that's their target audience. But for Slavic and Eastern European peoples - they feel fake. Not to speak for the Russians themselves.So, in my opinion, these kind of movies are a waste of money.The right way for Hollywood would be to make a co-production, with entirely Russian (or other) cast, and preferably Russian (or other native) over-the-line crew - writer(s), director, set designers, cinematographer.Something more in the Mel Gibson way.Nevertheless, such movies are a way for western audiences to get acquainted with other cultures, events and history.In overall - a good watch: 9\10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertaining stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a history of the conflict in Stalingrad this isn't up to much, it sticks to an anti-communist line portraying the Russians as unwilling to fight the Germans and having to be threatened or tricked into doing so and there is an annoying little speech at the end about how communism was a bad idea and couldn't work.I don't watch war movies for the history, very few are accurate and most take sides and push political agendas, I watch them for the entertainment and this is good entertainment.The actors deliver good performances although Law doesn't have a lot of acting to do, it is Fiennes who gets most of the dialogue and supporting characters also deliver good solid performances.The direction is good, it gives sweeping views of the various scenes and doesn't fall back on gore or jerky close ups.The pace is quick with lots of mini battles and a few close escapes.The romantic triangle is largely irrelevant and seems forced but it doesn't hurt the film.There is very little new here though, the dialogue is uninteresting and the action is fairly standard stuff.There are a few surprises in the plot and the ending is good with a few dark twists added in to tie things up.This is a light weight war film, worth watching but nothing to get excited about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Add A Script To The Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Millions of dollars spent on sets, great actors, technical advisers, authentic weapons, equipment, etc....and it all went for nothing, for want of a decent script.Stalingrad was one of the most dramatic battles in history, and it's worthy of more than one movie, and certainly deserves a saga better than this. It all seems like a tremendous waste of an opportunity. The setting is just too big for the story.The cat and mouse game between snipers could have been pulled off with drama and suspense, but the scenes are clumsily handled. There is no buildup in tension. The German sniper is shown to be more skilled than the Russian hero, who seems to get by mainly on luck...there is no even matching of skill. The sniping scenes are short and ineffective, except for one in which the German holds the Russian at bay, which turns out to be the only exciting scene in the film, but only leaves you unsatisfied and looking for more.I began to think it would have been much better not to have even shown the 'enemy' German...maybe just short glimpses of his hand or his eye, and make him out to be like a supernatural figure. Ed Harris has got the perfect look and acting ability, but he hasn't got much to work with here.A major flaw in this film is the weird point of view. We are supposed to identify with the Russians, and yet, from the way they are portrayed, they are as bad or worse than the Germans. We never understand exactly what they are fighting for, or what would motivate them to defy the German invaders and not turn against Stalin themselves. From the comments of my Russian comrades on here, it appears this film is full of clichés.This is another film in which scenes of combat just don't hold up. Brightly lit trains full of German troops with wide glass windows pull into a war zone. Germans and Russians shoot their own men for no discernible reason. Everything is portrayed as a big wild melee with no tactics.Yes, the photography, sets, acting, are good, but the dialogue and overall clumsiness of the story add up to a very distressing and unsatisfying tale.</fullReview>

Nobody pushed them with machine guns, everyone of soldiers had rifle, or machine gun (don't forget that Mother Russia is behind them, but Germany is far away). Everything in this movie is an anti-soviet {anticommunist?) propaganda. I am an anticommunist too. I personally know people ( soldiers and officers) who have been fought in this bloody war. They are parents of my university mates. They say to me something else. At least there are books. Keep slowly friends, it has never been the Battle Of Stalingrad. It was 100 000 POW russians have been taken in the Staligrad battle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ENEMY AT THE GATES*** 1/2 stars out of 5 (7/10)."Enemy at the Gates" is entertaining and well made. Its heart is in the right place, and the director isn't an amateur. Nonetheless, this war movie is anything but perfect.Vassili Zaitsev (JUDE LAW) and Political Officer Danilov (JOSEPH FIENNES) are two Russians behind Nazi German lines during World War II. Using the only rifle available, Zaitsev snipes 4 or 5 Nazis, saving the life of himself and Danilov. The two quickly become great friends. One day, the Fiennes character suggests to the Russian leader Kruschev (BOB HOSKINS) that the Russian people need a hero to boost morale during the battle of Stalingrad. Using his writing skills, Zaitsev quickly becomes the Russian hero; being the ultimate sniper and the ultimate soldier. The Germans find out about it and send their own killing machine; Major Konig played by ED HARRIS. They must eliminate this threat. That's what this movie is about; a duel between two snipers at Stalingrad.I am giving this movie a positive rating, but I'm gonna be doing a lot of complaining. There is a beautiful female soldier named Tania Chernova (RACHEL WEISZ) who becomes Vassili's lover. Danilov also likes this girl, and becomes increasingly jealous. When we first find out that the Jude Law character and Tania are "in love", we originally had no idea. In fact, a child tells Major Konig that the two will probably get married, and that's when we first find out. As I was watching, I wondered "When the hell did all this happen?" The two characters had barely talked or glanced at each other, and now we're under the assumption they're in love. I think the director himself noticed this loophole. Zaitsev and Chernova get down and dirty on the ground a few minutes later. That's not the way to correct a mistake. We're supposed to understand that they are in love because they have sex; it's all clear now. Of course, I'm being sarcastic, but it was one of the film's biggest flaws; the potential love triangle. It is material that belongs in soaps, and not on the big screen. I'm not saying these kind of relationships aren't possible in the movies, but how they are executed determines whether or not they should be on the the silver screen. It was both over-the-top and unneeded. I think this film is a true story, so the triangle may or may not have happened. In the film, it was poorly executed. That's all I'm trying to say.Again, this film can be very entertaining, and it has more than enough heart. At times, I felt like I was playing "Medal of Honor", but most of the time war is not seen as fun; which is another positive. All of the performances were A-grade, especially from the great Ed Harris. Even though I spent most of this review complaining, you should know that it's worth a see. It was skillfully made, and it keeps your attention. "Enemy at the Gates" is inspirational, well- acted entertainment...why else see a movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching such films as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Patton;" I have come to appreciate war films. For this reason, I decided to see the latest war film, "Enemy At The Gates." "Enemy At The Gates" may be one of the best war films I have seen since "Saving Private Ryan" because it is executed perfectly. With incredible performances, script and the impact I felt; "Enemy At The Gates" sets the tone as the first great war film of the 22nd century. This film can be served as the appetizer to the main course coming out soon, "Pearl Harbor." Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins come together to re-visit the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The best thing about seeing each one of the actors perform was they all gave 100 percent effort to make the film as real as possible; they did an excellent job. Fiennes, Weisz and Hoskins were the icing to a cake that was delicious from the start.The highlights of "Enemy At The Gates" always came when Law and Harris were on screen because they played excellent psychological mind games with one another to win; furthermore, it was like watching master chess players playing for the grand prize. It was also enjoyable to see the strategies and tactics each would use to out-maneuver the other."Enemy At The Gates" drew me with its many action sequences similar to those in "Saving Priate Ryan." Also, the love triangle between the three main leads was interesting to watch and see how it would unfold. I felt like I was in the movie because the writer did an excellent job at making me feel exactly what they felt and experience what they were going through.There is no rule that states dialogue is needed for a successful film. While "Enemy At The Gates" has dialogue, the scenes that have none stand out in my mind the most because we see close-ups of both snipers and the expressions on their faces. This is incredible to me because the intensity shown on their faces speaks volumes about what the movie is really about.This may not be the best war film ever made but with two of the brightest young stars on the rise, a very talented actress and a veteran that continues to turn in knock-out performances, "Enemy At The Gates" will be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great war film that doesn't involve the US.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've scanned several comments placed on the imdb board about Enemy at the Gates, and felt a need to respond. I really enjoyed this film, with a few exceptions, and feel some of the posts are a bit over the top in negativity.My theory is that this film is so overlooked because it doesn't involve the US, rather two "enemy" nations - the USSR and Nazi Germany. If the US was involved, more things would have been forgiven in this film. Enemy at the Gates attempts to move the audience's attention away from the uniforms and towards the people involved in the battle. Yes, it is framed in a hero-versus-villain narrative, where we all cheer for the underdog, but it is done more intelligently than (for instance) Saving Private Ryan with its "USA all the way" sentimentality.The complaints about the use of accents are totally misplaced. Did anyone else notice that the Russians spoke with english accents while the Nazis spoke in american accents? Does anyone else think this is deliberate? I certainly do. Arguing that the accents takes the attention away from the film because they were different to what they should be ("Ze germans! Ze germans!") are rather short-sighted. The accents were used to differentiate the conflicting sides to the audience, nothing more.I also found the romance a little tacked on to the movie, but it isn't that distracting. It does contain a realistic element or two, and serves to give the characters something to loose and / or fight over.The real thrill is the battle between the two snipers. Leaving behind huge explosions at the films climax, it all comes down to a battle of skill and patience. Good war films reduce the conflict of thousands into a conflict of just a few people (in this case two) that the movie follows. Enemy at the Gates does this successfully.Parts of this film are flawed. It does seem to follow the dramatic structure of Saving Private Ryan in dropping us straight into a horrific battle where one in every two Russian soldiers is given a rifle and the other is told to pick it up when the holder dies. Still, the technique works and does grab you. Parts of the film also feel a bit cliched (eg the love triangle) but a solid cast does manage to lift above this. Ed Harris is fantastic and Jude Law does a very solid job.Finally, for all those people who went "there was no gate and no enemy standing at it", well... sheesh. I'll explain it for you, since you obviously missed the film's explanation. Stalingrad was seen as a key city for the Nazis to overtake if they were to conquer the USSR. If Stalingrad fell, it was a) a slap in the face to Stalin who oh-so-modestly named it, and b) it was then a short trip to the capital (St Petersberg? Leningrad? I forget!) and victory. The Nazis were the enemies at the gate of the USSR's capital. Easy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I like the most about this movie is it`s mixture of several things that make a movie worth watching. The story takes places during WW2 in Stalingrad were a young sharpshooter becomes a hero and the russians most important weapon against the germans. While his friendship to a young politofficer make him the most important man inside of Stalingrad both guys fall in love with the same girl. This is a story by it`s own which makes the movie much more interesting of course. The rest of the story is the battle between the russian sharpshooting hero and a german sharpshooter who has a reason of his own to fight the russian sharpshooting hero. The authentic battlefield, the actors (especially Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins) are great and play their roles very well. James Horner did another great job being responsible for a soundtrack that gives the movie some extra effort. I consider this movie to the list of my must have seen movies and one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILER A gripping story, made even more so by the elements of truth in it. Acting superb, with Law, Harris and Weiz standouts. Realism at a high level, and brought home the extreme conditions experienced during the siege of Stalingrad. Like many others *spoilers coming up* I agree that the action of Koenig exposing himself at the end was totally uncharacteristic given his professionalism. It was as if the director wanted to end the movie quickly. Factory ducts moving in the factory giving away snipers' position also a bit forced, given how careful they were. Accents did not bother me, because it allowed me to concentrate on the movie. Forced Russian and German accents are distracting.In summary, an excellent movie. I hope someone makes a similar movie about the siege of Leningrad (999 days), preferably with Weiz and Harris in it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director was an old french dude with messy white hair and it's like you know it's going to be good. Like, he wouldn't let the movie be released unless it was perfect? Well, I'm not saying it was perfect but on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd put it as like a 9.3 maybe? Nothing below a 9 though, if anyone cares. Well all you people disappoint me! This was an excellent movie thanks to our foreign director. Had great story lines, great special effects, great acting...the only thing I would've done is make the love story a bit more interesting, but oh well even the love story was pretty gosh dang good. And the best part of it all was Jude Law, he was just so hot...so like it's a bonus for all the girls out there. Anyway, don't just take my word for it...go rent it...it's really good.

		<shortDescription>Movie that gives you a really good feeling of the WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie goes about the Battle of Stalingrad that took place from end 1942 to begin 1943. The Nazi's send very many troops to Russia to conquer the oilfields. Instead of capitulating, the low-technised Soviets, fought back with all their man and might.Instead of Pearl Harbor, this movie is not very romantised and more pointed on giving you the feeling of this very ugly war accros the Volga river. Joseph Fiennes plays the role of a Russian Political Officer, Danilov. His life is being rescuied by the soldier Zaitsev played by Jude Law with a talent for snipering. Danilov makes a hero of Zaitsev and he comes in the Russian Newspaper. Vassili Zaitsev becomes a warhero. When the Nazi's are aware of Zaitsev, they send a very high talented sniper from Bayern to Stalingrad to take out Zaitsev. This role is being played by Ed Harris, who plays Herr Konig.There is also playing a little romance between Zaitsev and Tania (Rachel Weisz) also a Russian soldier.I liked this movie very much because it is very realistic. It reminds me of Saving Private Ryan, wich was also played on a bloody battlefield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good war movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy at the Gates" is a good change of pace for war movies. Instead of making a setting of Americans/British vs the Germans or Italians, this one takes a look at what was happening between the Soviet Union and the Germans. Stalingrad was also a good choice. The writer could also have chosen Leningrad as well which was just a brutal. This movie gave the audience different look as how the war was fought on the Soviet side. How much of it is true and not completely sure. However, the tactics that were used by the Soviets seemed accurate.The sniper warfare of Stalingrad was also accurate. However, the duel did not occur the way it was depicted in the movie, it was a little more complicated than that. I am also sure they were never close enough to see each others faces without looking through the gun sight as it was depicted in the end. All in all, the movie was entertaining did not fail to keep my interest. The love story could have been a little better or it could have been eliminated completely. The film would not have suffered much if it had been eliminated. Overall, this one is worth seeing, (8 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy at the gates is one of those films that is not massive box office material and was not heavily promoted when released , which makes it all the more of a treat when watching it. i wasnt expecting to much and what i got was a joy. Enemy at the gate feels like a low production film while still look superb and that is no critisism. The film revolves around a young Russian sniper who becomes a hero for killing many German officers in the fight to save Stalingrad. Because of the impact of these assisinations the Germans send their best Sniper to try and Kill the Russian.It sounds like a good story and it is. Good performances from Jude law and Ed Harris ad to this compelling movie. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well. What can I say that has not already been said? I really enjoyed the film. I have to disagree with people that say the love story detracted from the overall quality of the film. Human life is not as simple as one emotion or action at a time. There is a constant barrage of things going on..much less in the minute to minute existence of the Russian soldiers. Ed Harris is quietly superb, as we expect, and Jude Law plays a range of emotions, from enthusiastic early on, to old beyond his years later in the film. The accents may not have been authentic, but this did not bother me either. It's much better than hearing BAD German and Russian spoken throughout.All in all, the cat and mouse game between Harris and Law WILL keep you on the edge of your seat. The audio in this film is simply amazing, and the cinematography puts you in the muddy, rubble strewn, bleak landscapes of 1942 vintage Stalingrad in ruins. Not for the short attention-span set, but that's a good thing. Films are supposed to make you think. Hollywood take note, we LIKE to think.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very realistic from the human point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on dvd a few days ago and, in spite of its many flaws, I am still wondering about it. The plot is very confusing and I agree with another reviewer that it might work better if it would be just another unnamed city rather than Stalingrad.I believe that the opening scene is almost irrelevant to the rest of the movie and, historically, is misleading (so to speak) as well as the entire ``political'' foundation of the movie. Indeed, the opening scene makes an impression that all the Russian soldiers went to the war just because they were forced by komissars (or whoever), who shot them in the back forcing them to go forward. It is obviously not correct - most of them just protected their homes and families in this extermination war, where more then 20,000,000 (13, 600, 000 military) of the Russians fell (compared to more that 7,000, 000 of Germans (3,250,000 military), 295,000 of the US loss (including in the Pacific) and 388,000 of the UK death toll). This is actually confirmed by the main part of the movie where obviously nobody forces Russians to fight as they did during these very long months.Of course, I was not there, but I understand that if the company officers start shooting their soldiers in the back in the front lines, they will be shot by them ``incidentally'' very quickly too. So, this part of the movie is wrong to me. However, it is a historical fact that there were indeed security/interior troops staged relatively away in safety from the front lines, who did all the catching and shooting of those troops who were retreating to Stalingrad during the preceding months, following this stupid Stalin's directive forbidding it. I believe that this stupidity and incompetence led to the loss of so many lives, when Stalin did not allow the troops and civilians to leave desperate and useless positions/cities or wanted to take a certain city on a certain holiday date, forcing his generals to comply with him.Another ``historical'' mistake was, I think, showing that political officers (like Hoskins) played the most essential role in the defence of Stalingrad. It was done by regular militaries too, who eventually made the komissars look as they were the redundant there. In the final victory the general Zhukov played the main role (as he did in all major victories in the WWII on the Eastern front: Moscow 1941, Stalingrad 1942, Kursk 1943, and took Berlin in 1945). I think the pivotal role of Stalingrad for the Russians was also exactly that Stalin and his likes finally understood (or more precisely were forced to undertand and back-off for a while} that the military professionals should be in charge if somebody wants to win.Having this in mind, and accordingly ignoring the opening scene I enjoyed the movie very much. I think it is one of the most realistic war movies I ever saw, where people are people and are not heroes (like Segal and his likes), and every one can die next in this terrible mess. So, I applaud the authors of the movie who show how normal people could find strength to remain be people in Stalingrad. As a suspense, the duel of snipers was very realistic and interesting to me, without this ``heroic'' cloud. The love triangle seems very proper to illustrate this ``antiheroic'' war reality, where people did not expect to survive but still wanted to have hope and remain to be human.</fullReview>

The movie takes place in Stalingrad under the second world war and the scenes is very detailed and gives you the feeling of being there.

		<fullReview>For the next twenty years, every war (or anti war, I guess) movie will be compared to 'Saving Private Ryan' and not without just cause. SPR is a fantastic movie, delivers a wonderful message, and almost singlehandedly rekindled this country's pride in our WWII veterans. Unfortunately, that also means that excellent movies like this one will be compared and if they do not deliver the same earth-shattering impact that SPR did, they will suffer for it.I waited for the DVD of this movie and am glad I did. With my family neatly tucked into bed, headphones on so I could listen at a respectable volume, on a 36" TV, I think I got as good a show as any I could have gotten from a theater. At least there wasn't some moron behind me talking. The story is as intense as any I have ever seen, the acting wonderful, and the scenery so authentic looking, I think it may even surpass that other movie. The JU88's and Stuka's used in the film were all of course computer generated, but were used sparingly enough that I didn't even bother to look for flaws, but they did look grand for the time I did see them.]Oh, and BTW, Ed Harris is one of the two greatest actors alive today. Hands down and no argument. I leave the other for you to fill in because I'll bet you can't think of more that equal him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good War Story Without Revisionist History Lessons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie alone "Enemy at the Gates" is well worth seeing, as a "war movie" or as a piece of historical insight into a crucial part of World War II, seeing it is an absolute necessity. More than that, it is worth seeing simply because it is a movie with a plot, characters and story to tell, unlike many of the big-budget, high-tech, special effects failures foisted upon on a weary movie-going public this summer. Springing to mind is "Pearl Harbor", which by most accounts is a lame love story crudely and gratuitously cloned on to a pivitol part of American, and World history. (After I read that Disney Studios toned down that film in deference to the potential Japanese and Germans audiences, trading potential foreign sales dollars for veracity and integrity, I decided never to spend a penny on it myself). "Pearl Harbor" is pertinent here because "Enemy at the Gates" also uses some very impressive special effects to depict realistic combat (which we all first saw in "Saving Private Ryan"). The horror of Stalingrad, the August '43- February '43 battle in which the story takes place, is remarkably brought to the screen, and the miserable conditions of both the Russian and German soldiers armies are shown, a detail worth noting: the Battle of Stalingrad represented the first loss by Hitler's Nazi forces, and the victory helped to inspire the Russians to begin their hard fought march to Berlin (culminating in April of 1945). To put things in perspective, the Russians lost between 500,000 and one million killed in action during this fight, and the Germans about 150,000 dead; (of the 91,000 Germans who surrendered on January 31st, 1943, only 6,000 ever made it back to Germany after the war). Compare these figures with the 300,000 total Americans killed in both Europe and the Pacific in World War II, or the 58,000 killed in Vietnam from 1963 to 1975. Stalingrad has almost religious meaning for the Russians (and the opposite for the Germans, would would have conquered Russia if this fight had been won). The story of the movie is of a Russian farm boy thrust into a major propaganda role by a Communist operative looking out for his own advancement as much as that of the Glorious Red Army. The operative had witnessed a sharpshooting display by this unassuming new recruit and realizes that tales of this simple shepherd fighting for the Fatherland would be a potent motivator for soldiers as well as the home front (the sharpshooter did, in fact exist). As the exploits of the new Hero are reported by the Soviet propaganda machine, the Germans learn of him, and decide to send their own top sniper to crush this rekindling of Russian fighting spirit. The second half of the movie follows their personal war, and its conclusion and although slow going at times, is still interesting. The actors all comport themselves well: the hero is Jude Law (the rich boy in "The Talented Mr. Ripley"), the Communist Party operative who makes him a hero is the guy from "Shakespeare in Love", the pretty Russian Jewish girl who comes to play a big part in the relationship between the hero and his lobbyist is the female lead from the "Mummy" movies. many other people have commented on the use of accents in the film. The Russians speak with English accents, but I think this is just a device to show a) they are foreign and b) the class distinctions between them (the hero has a low class accent, the Jewish intellectual a high class accent). To have had them speaking in corresponding American accents would have been distracting. Also distracting would have been fake sounding "German" and "Russian" accents if employed by the cast. Most viewers will be surprised by the brutality and cruelty shown by the Communists towards their own people. This was very accurate. The fact that the Germans (although certain atrocities are mentioned) are not shown as evil caricatures (like the British Commander in "The Patriot") is also positive for the overall story. The heros nemesis, (played by Ed Harris), is shown as a high born and high ranking German thoughtful and cunning, as well as cruel, when necessary (he is, after all a sniper). Heavy handed moralizing or messages do not get in the way of the character development or the story. (It is an interesting situation for an American to watch Germans and Russians fighting as a detached third party). In short, it's a good story, and an interesting look at an important piece of history without minimal Hollywood-style revisionism. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping from beginning to end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest surprises for me was the epilogue which flashed across the screen. It said that the film was based on the true life story of Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev. How much was true and how much sprang from the imagination of the scriptwriter's imagination matters not. The fact remains it's a war film that's up there with the best. It's another film about the battle for Stalingrad, and there'll probably be a lot more to in the future, because this event was a turning point in favour of Russia and its allies in WW11. One can't help but compare this film with the German production "Stalingrad" (1993) because both were produced on the grand scale. "Enemy at the Gates" is a better production. I felt more involved as I watched the frightened young Russian soldiers some without guns stumbling on towards the enemy, snatching a rifle from a fallen comrade and charging into the barrage of fire. The harrowing scenes which followed with bodies lying bleeding in the churned-up mud were heart-rending. I guess a lot of the set was put together using computer technology. Some of the distant background looked a bit unreal, but the over-all effect was truly amazing on the giant screen. All the battle scenes were believable as we watched the slaughter of the Russian troops who understandably had lost all hope of victory. But battles can be won with words as well as guns. Propaganda can be a powerful weapon. Young Vassili a superior marksman starts to pick off some of the German Officers. The news (plus the distribution of propaganda pamphlets) starts to spread rapidly among the troops and the general population. The morale of the Russians starts to improve as Vassili is painted as a hero. Jude Law is likeable as Vassili the former shepherd boy now a national hero. To win the battle for Stalingrad the Germans must destroy this hero worship. Into the scene comes the top Nazi marksman Major Erwin Konig (a splendid role for Ed Harris) whose sole mission is to find and kill Vassili. The ensuing scenes are intensely gripping as the opposing marksmen seek each other out amid the ruins of a burnt out department store. I found the display models particularly scary as I wasn't certain whether perhaps they were living beings about to spring, and the glass reflection scene had me almost at breaking point. There is some love interest in the film. And this was necessary I think to give some relief to the pervading horror of those dreadful days. The film I thought gave a fairly balanced view of the German and Russian attitudes. There was brutality on both sides. Desperation, too. I came away from the film with the gunfire still ringing in my ears and believing that I too had just been through the hell of Stalingrad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there is no such thing as perfection as there is no movie which pleases everybody. I think it is actually much better than Saving Private Ryan. Though of course this one was made with SPR's success in mind. People here are complaining a lot about the accents. I agree, it would have been much more believable if the main parts were played by Russian actors with perfect Russian accent, or even subtitles. But let us face it, this is a big budget production, there is simply no way that unknown in the West actors could have been cast. So they went with familiar European looking faces of Jude Law, Rachel Weizs and Ralph Fiennes. These guys are British and nothing can be done about it. If they faked Russian accent, it would have been utterly ridiculous not only to the Russians, though first of all, to them. They went the natural way, not faking any accent, they all spoke they way they usually do and I respect the director for that decision. This way actors concentrated on acting rather than artificial accent.Somebody accuses this film being a war propaganda. It can not be further from the truth. The war is shown very cruel, bloody, senseless and terrible, it makes us remember the sacrifices made for the peace.I think it is pretty well known that the movie is based on a true story and people still complain about plot not being believable (yes, hanging of a boy and falling asleep on duty really happened, this guys had chronic sleep deprivation, they were under siege). Especially funny is somebody not seeing cleanly shaven Ralph Fiennes during the course of the whole movie. THEY WERE UNDER SIEGE, they did not have opportunity to shave everyday! Besides, the guy is dark haired, he will have five o'clock shadow in couple of hours after shaving anyway. Bottom line is that people seem to divide for those who like to pick on movies and those who come to the theater and take it as it comes, trying to find that movie magic, which is almost in every movie to some extent.The movie "Enemy At The Gates" is beautifully done, it has fine cast, interesting plot and characters, and is showing the part of history that is largely disregarded in America. I would advise to watch it to everybody who loves movies and history. This is the best American made war movie to date, if you ask me. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're coming off a year in which a sandshoe-swordfighting epic is our best picture and the Academy has made some improvements with its selections. Members of the Academy, pay attention. This film stands out as one of the best movies I've seen in a good couple of years, and I won't be surprised if it turns out to be better than Pearl Harbor.What makes this film so riveting is not its dialogue -- rather its atmosphere and the non-verbal emotional roles that the characters play. When is the Academy going to grow some guts and give Ed Harris the recognition and Oscar he deserves? This movie is yet more proof why he stands among the elite (along with Morgan Freeman, I consider him the best actor working in America) because he can take a role with very little speaking and elicit an extremely strong reaction from the audience. This guy will make you hate his character when all is said and done. Jude Law is perfectly cast as our resident hero and counterpart to Harris, and Joseph Fiennes continues to make leaps and bounds in his performances. (I wasn't expecting much out of Fiennes, but his performance as a Soviet propagandist was so breathtaking real it could be considered the show-stealer.) I enjoyed the subtlety of both the romantic sub-plot and Rachel Weisz's performance, and the atmosphere created by the directors leaves your blood running cold.The movie is partially fictionalized, but yet again, truth is not only stranger, but more compelling, than fiction."Enemy At The Gates" is more than worth your $9.50. It's certainly not for the light of the stomach -- the sniper violence can be visually shocking and nauseating at times -- but hey, war is war. If you're the type of moviegoer who appreciates subtle action and stories told with emotions, not words, then this one is definitely for you. 9/10</fullReview>

Jude Law gave wonderful performance, he looked 100% Russian soldier during the siege, thin, dirty, desperate. I liked Joseph Fiennes's Othello like jealosy, when he saw Vassili and Tania together. Rachel Weizs and especially Ed Harris were superb too. Visuals of battle scenes and pictures of city devastation were stunning, the war was bloody and ugly, like every war really is. I am quite surprised that nobody here mentions the most obvious goof, the fact that Nikita Khruschev NEVER was neither commander in chief, nor major officer of the Stalingrad front. In fact, he was a political officer like Danilov during the war. I am not even sure if he was at Stalingrad at all. It almost escaped my mind, why would screenwriter put him in this position, when I realized that Khruschev is well known in America. He famously gave speech in United Nations and put missiles in Cuba. While the real mastermind behind Russian victory in Stalingrad (as well as the whole WWII victory on Eastern Front in Europe) was general Georgiy Zhukov. But who would know him in America, except for geeks, watching the History Channel? Given the fact that movie slightly exagerrates with painting Russian Army black, perhaps it is not too bad, that Khrushev will take the blame instead of real hero Zhukov. Though Khruschev's son is a history professor and naturalized American citizen now, I think he has a strong case for libel. Anyway, the movie is fiction, not a documentary, at least here Russians won, not somebody else (case in point, U-571). As many people have already pointed, movie also downplays the fact that Russians fought for survival and defended their motherland and did not always have to be motivated with bullets from their own political officers.In spite of these obvious flaws, I still think that this is a great movie. It shows courageous and noble people as well as the scum. And what is the greatest thing, that now Americans will learn that Russians fought in WWII too! Seriously, this movie might get few people read something about this period in history. Martha Stuart would have said that this is a good thing. Don't you think so?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best war movie I've seen in the last few years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actual reason I went to see "Enemy at the Gates", was because of a friend who is a fanatical J.R.R Tolkien fan and wanted to see the "Lord of the Rings" trailer which he knew was going to be played before the movie. As for the movie itself, I had heard it being described in the Media as an interesting example of how European productions can be as spectacular as American ones, but I had no real urge to see it, as I am not a war movie fan, and furthermore, knowing the history of the Second World War quite well, I feel a certain sadness when viewing a recreation of scenes of death and drama that have actually taken place. Still, I have come to admire Jean-Jacques Annaud after watching "The Name of the Rose" but mostly for his less famous film "The Bear", which I saw as a child and had moved me deeply. Moreover, a cast including actors like Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Bob Hoskins, and mostly, Ed Harris, seemed to guarantee that the film wasn't going to be a flop.I actually found the movie very good. The characters were well-structured and interesting, the performances of the actors were very good, with Ed Harris being an excellent, awe-inspiring figure as the German sniper, the scenery was impressive, the war scenes were few but spectacular and realistic, and the scenes of the sniper duels were undoubtedly the most exciting of the movie. Still, for some reason, many people, including most of those that posted in this column, didn't seem to have liked the movie.Concerning the love story, I must agree that it was a little naive and perhaps at some points became tiring, but it never was annoying and it was stressed just enough to give a romantic feeling without overwhelming the movie's war element at any point. All in all, I found it necessary for the movie's completeness. Concerning historical accuracy, the real events were widely distorted, of course, but it is this slight distortion of history that separates a good war movie from a bad documentary. As for the language issue, with the Russians talking with British accents, a fact which many people found annoying, it did seem awkward in some points, as my friend commented during the movie, but I think it was a right choice on behalf of Annaud. The story was mainly told from the Soviet side, and if the central characters spoke subtitled Russian it would be too alienating and tiring, while if they spoke English with Russian accents it would be too cheap and silly, reminding us of naive American action movies like "Rambo". In fact, Jude Law's English-farm-boy accent was very fitting with Vassili Zaitsev's Soviet-country-boy character, while Joseph Fiennes' accent was very fitting to the low-class intellectual he was impersonating. After all, don't forget that the more decent movies featuring Soviets as the main characters, like "Gorky Park" or "Hunt of the Red October", have them speaking with British accents. As for commissar Danilov's final acceptance of the imperfection of the socialist system, which many people saw as a hint against communism, I find it a simple and fair acknowledgment of the fact that Stalin (and his various successors) was no better than Hitler.The violence and killing in "Enemy at the Gates" were realistic and dramatic without being disgusting and aiming in shocking the spectator through sheer brutality as in "Saving Private Ryan". Furthermore, although both movies view the Germans as the villains of the story, Annaud's characters are deeper and more human, as he shows that both camps had good people as well as evil people, focusing on the drama of war, as opposed to Spielberg's intolerable approach of presenting the Germans as a swarm of brutal and mindless monsters, something close to the Indians in the mid-war westerns or the aliens of "Independence Day". In short, I found "Enemy at the Gates" not only a worthwhile European production, but the best war movie of the last few years and one of the finest World War II-theme war films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the life of me I cannot fathom why this got only half favorable reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. I'm no war movie fan but this is really interesting. The laying-in-wait, sniper vs. sniper thing is fascinating. The imagery looks better than average. Yeah, there are lesser moments. As when falling glass in an abandoned factory lands in a position no piece of glass has ever landed; allowing a German sniper three or four perfect reflections of his clandestine prey. I'd happily watch this a few more times to pick up more details, or to explore the secondary story threads. Law and Fiennes are both good. Even Rachel Weitz can't ruin it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a great film and it had a lot of potential...too bad it's ruined w/meddling love story. It's not that the acting is bad or the very absurd hardly true story of the famous Russian sniper. Yes the German's sent one of their best to kill him, but other than that there isn't much known. This could have been a good flick about Stalingrad, but that seems to be secondary to the completely forced love story/jealousy garbage which is a shame. Hopefully another good story about the truth of Stalingrad &amp; the entire WWII battle on the Eastern Front because they don't need to invent anything to make any more interesting. The stories are there, they just need to be found.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is quite good, but it lacks some historical reality. One mistake is that the movie says the Russian Vassili Zaitzev poached wolves in the Ural foothills. The truth is that he hunted deer.A second mistake is that they say the German Major's(although he was really a colonel)name was Konig. His real name was colonel Heinz Thorwald.But there is some truth in the movie. For example, he was accompanied by a political instructor/officer named Danilov, and the German was hiding under a sheet of metal.8 out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family and my friends rented the DVD from the rental store near our home and watched it during the december holidays in 2003. we didn't check the back, and it was already too late when it came to the part where they show some partial nudity. Jude law's said before that he doesn't mind that, but anyway, the butt was somewhat interesting...Overall, the impact of violence and anger is wonderful! bombs and guns and blood, it's super!I really love this movie, NOT because of the nudity... but partly because of Jude Law (I love him!), but mainly because war/military movies appeal to me, ESPECIALLY this one!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rather average film, rendering dull quite an eventful historical context, with a rather typical modern Hollywood disregard for character, intrigue and nuance. The acting is largely mediocre, and even the best on show, Ed Harris, cannot rise above an insubstantial script. The question of laughably inaccurate accents isn't as important as the general lack of interesting dialogue and (its) delivery. Law and Fiennes show little acting flair, portraying uninteresting ciphers accordingly. Rachel Weisz adds little to a tenuous, tediously inevitable love interest. Bob Hoskins, oddly cast as Kruschchev, is ok, but has too small a part. The filming of the few battle scenes and sniper "duels" is passable, but far from innovative, or, truly, exciting. The music is horribly bland and formulaic, inducing from me not emotion, but ample yawning. There are historical errors, but worse is the lack of interesting characterisation in the slightest, and the avoidance of theme or insight. Rating:- **/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Enemy at the gates" is a rather successful war movie where Jean-Jacques Annaud's command of making is no longer in doubt. However, I think that it's also an impersonal movie. I mean that it's a French filmmaker who made this film but it could have been made by any filmmaker because the story is very Hollywood. Nevertheless, this is a thrilling, but never boring movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one on one sniping movie left me bored and disinterested. In addition, the lack of an American forces the American viewer to choose a protagonist between two typically villainous countrymen; we must root for a German Nazi or a Russian. In light of not caring for either character, it was dull, and the love story was not developed much. All said I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone, even to someone who enjoys WWII films.

		<shortDescription>I almost cried...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often I cry when I am at the cinema, infact I don't think I ever have, but Enemy at the Gates brought me close in one instance. Just the frequency of bloodshed and loss of life so is imense it boggles the mind to think of it. I thought Enemy at the Gates gave a good even handed approach to that battle. While the love triangle is a bit intrusive to the one on one between Law and Harris, I do not think it spoils the film in any real way, like so many other reviews have said.When I saw that Ed Harris was going to be in it, I was a little apprehensive... but overall I think he was very well suited to the role.. he certainly looked German enough. Law was very good also, except that for some reason most of the main Russian actors (barring Hoskins) didn't attempt an accent... odd esspecially Sacha, I almost expected a "SHINE YA SHOES GUVNA!" from him while he was cleaning the boots of Koenig (Harris).Overall a fine movie, well put together and realistic (from what I have seen of the real battle). The movie does lay the line down, there are no good guys or bad guys... only individuals, something I thought Saving Private Ryan did much less. Oh yes and HORRAY for a war movie where America wasn't even mentioned if I recall correctly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Hollywood Film with some Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has read Anthony Beevor's magnificent history of the battle of Stalingrad will find their toes curling at the way that Hollywood distorts this historic victory. The real story of the battle that stays in my mind the most is that when the German 6th Army's Panzer divisions advanced on the city, Soviet troops fought them off with anti aircraft guns lowered to the ground. When the troops had all been killed, the guns were taken over by a group 0f 14 year old girls from a local school, who fended the Nazis off for hours before every one of them in turn were killed by the world's best army.The story in this film highlights the story of just one hero, Seitsev, a sniper, who was actually Asiatic. In this film he is changed to a pretty boy white European. Frankly, that's racist! During the battle, the Stalinlist press focused on his remarkable achievements as a sniper, but the truth was that it was a collective effort. This film continues that fiction whilst making crude American points about Communism (it's too idealisitic, doesn't work in practice yak yak - yeah, just like the American dream or Iraq, Vietnam, etc. etc.).Stalin's regime was horrible, but I would have preferred more insight.However, Bob Hoskins makes a superb Khrushov, and I wish he had a better vehicle to explore the character of this remarkable (but venial) man who turned against Stalin after his death, and tried to save the dictatorship by humanising it somewhat.It's good to compare this film to 'Downfall', which was made with grown-ups in mind. Without embellishment or distortion, it presents a picture of the Nazis that makes your blood run cold, and gives those of us who didn't face the last war (unlike my poor father on Arctic convoys) an idea of its horror, heroism and desperation. And sheer madness.Stalingrad deserved a better treatment than this piece of nonsense with its manufactured romance and conflict between two rivals. Oh, please! it's just the same old plot with Red Army uniforms......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I myself was never into war epic movies. Oppressive violence on screen never did seem to impress me much. While "Enemy at the Gate" provides us with the regular amount of blood, gunfires and chopped up men a respectful war flick demands, it also portrays a different kind of battle, one of patience, unshaken stillness and quietness. It's a fascinating duel between sharpshooters Law (on the Soviet side) and Harris (on the German side) who was sent out to Stalingrad especially to kill troublemaker Vassili (Law). What we witness is a battle through the eyes of the duelers and, despite of the contrast with the loud environment it never falls into a dull moment. On the contrary. The intensity that the precise eye closeups convey is tangible enough to keep us hooked.Also the cast helps immensely, of course. They certainly had a lot of sensibility casting actors with such remarkable expression on their eyes.Law is altogether fierceness and tenderness. He's absolutely alluring on screen, everything he does is fascinating and you don't wanna miss one single movement. Every gesture, every glance of his eyes has this depth and sincerity that are incredibly captivating.Now Ed Harris is a guy who truly supports a film. He inflicts so much intensity in such a subtle way that even though he's not the main character, you can't imagine the movie without him. And also there're those fusillading blue eyes of his which can be as sharp as any weapon.In the Sovietic side we also have Joseph Finnes, as a regular Russian intellectual, obviously more useful on tactical field than on battle field. A very skilled writer who created the legend of sniper shooter turned into Soviet pride Vassili. Rachel Wiesz represents the women on front. Another strong presence in the film.On the background, astonishingly crafted battle scenes, breathtaking bombings and an incredibly realistic setting. Great cinematography recreates properly the bleakness and desolation of a grim Stalingrad back in 1942.Romance is inevitably provided by the love triangle among Law, Finnes and Weisz'characters (apparently the war was not enough to keep them busy). If I had to pick a favorite war movie, this is it. Well done, Annaud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young Sniper vs Sniper Tactician</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main character is Vassili Zaitsev as played by Jude Law. The secondary characters are Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz), Major Konig (Ed Harris), and Sacha Filipov (Gabriel Thomson). Other important minor characters are Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) and Koulikov (Ron Perlman).The time period is World War II, specifically Fall in the year 1942. The location is Stalingrad.The main plot/conflict of the movie is can a young Russian sniper hero defeat a high-ranking German sniper who is a veteran and a better tactician during a World War II battle at Stalingrad. Vassili is an excellent marksman who crosses path with Commisar Danilov who recognizes his ability during battle. Danilov presses Khrushchev that what the Soviet Union needs is to make an example of hero's to the rest of their nation to inspire their troops. Germany is badly defeating Russia and Stalingrad is the last stronghold. Once that city falls, Russia is lost. Khrushchev allows Danilov to print publications that highlight Vassili as a hero by continually exploiting his kills. Germany high ups start to notice and sends Major Konig to take him out. At times, Vassili finds comfort in Stalingrad at the home of Sacha. Here he meets another Russian soldier, Tania, who both Vassili and Danilov desire (love triangle that helps to keep Vassili alive twice and resolve the movie). Koulikov is a former student of Major Konig prior to the war who helps Vassili try to defeat Konig but takes a bullet for Vassili and thereby keeps the plot going. Major Konig is a strategist and a better one than Vassili. Five times they are pitted against each other and the first four times Vassili gets away unharmed due to circumstances that help him get out of a jam. Both are excellent snipers but Major Konig has the upper hand as he outsmarts Vassili constantly. Very interesting characters and plots twists. It was interesting to see the Major and Vassili going against each other so many times with interesting results. The circumstances to which Vassili escapes death each time is very believable. Vassili knows from the beginning that he is against someone "one step ahead" of him all the time. A typical Hollywood ending might have had it that Vassili eventually outsmarts his enemy but this is not the case. One of the two conquers but only out of sacrifice. The other thing that kept me going was that it was a mystery whether the little boy Sacha was helping the Germans or misleading them. I actually got confused on where his loyalties fell. Jean-Jacques Annaud also directed this and he has written "In the Name of the Rose". Alain Godard co wrote this and co wrote "In the Name of the Rose."</fullReview>

The accents were posh British and really stupid - I would not have minded a less obvious accent, even if it wasn't Russian. Characters' actions were completely unjustified and the dialogue was awful.

		<fullReview>The critics got this film so wrong. They gave it a disgraceful two out of five stars, it should be at least three or four. The only reason being that two or three actors were miscast, I can agree Bob Hoskins as Russian Nikita Khrushchev was difficult to deal with, but everyone else was fine. Anyway, I think it is quite cool. Jude Law plays Vassili Zaitsev, a Second World War hero who managed to shoot some key German personnel, and he and his friend/news writer Commisar Danilov (Shakespeare in Love's brilliant Joseph Fiennes) are on the hunt for Maj. König (a great Ed Harris). Along the way he shoots many other Germans/Nazis, and falls in love with the same woman as Commisar, German translator Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz). With great gripping scenes, a good romance, and Weisz's great but brief arse, this is a terrific film. Ignore the critics. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Good!</fullReview>
