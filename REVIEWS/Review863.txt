		<shortDescription>Worse than Batman v. Superman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to keep up with the plot of this movie is like chasing a moving train. Except even when you think you've caught up to it, you're not sure you want to get on board. As someone who went into this movie with tempered expectations thanks to negative critical reviews, yet also hope it would have some redeeming moments due to the overall positive IMDb user reviews, I can honestly say that the critics may have won on this one. Suicide Squad has a number of issues, but is not a total loss for comic book fans. The performances by the actors is not what stops this film from being a success, but it doesn't stop their characters from going in the wrong direction. 1. THE PLOT: The plot was pretty much a mess. This was a common complaint about the Batman V. Superman movie: the plot defied logic and had too much trivial sub-plot due to the amount of characters. Suicide Squad runs into a similar problem. I feel like they compensated logic to simply include scenes that would satisfy comic book fans, however it's at the sake of the film's success as a whole. Nothing is ever explained that you want explained. And somehow the movie is a confusing blend of predictable yet unclear. I found myself constantly asking "Why wouldn't you just do____?" 2. Not enough screen time for the other squad members: The rest of the squad (Other than Harley and Deadshot) are not fleshed out well. And the movie's feeble attempts to add background, dimension or complexity to the characters fails, with flashbacks and random monologues that don't elicit any sort of empathy from the viewer. I found myself easily not caring about the squad or its success at all. (Example in point 6)3. PACING: I think the attempts to flesh out the characters failed also because of the way the movie is paced. It's about 2 hours, yet feels like a 30 minute movie. Scenes jump around quickly and what they do choose to drag out (flashbacks amongst other things) may be fun to watch but is unnecessary. 3. Overuse of Music: A little more nit-picky, yet nonetheless something I noticed. Now I'm for every character having a cool theme, and soundtracks are great but... Suicide Squad utilizes loud, distracting, CONSTANT music... over dialogue, over key scenes.... music accompanies everything. Or at least that's what it felt like. Don't get me wrong sometimes it works. 4. THERE ARE NO STAKES INVOLVED WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING MONSTERS MADE OF GOOP: I worried about the antagonists of this movie when I saw the trailers. None of the fight scenes have any real tension or meaning, because of the type of monsters their fighting. Faceless, CGI, magical goop. 5. Uneven Dynamic of Power: This is a big issue I have with the movie. A lot of the characters seem extremely unnecessary and frankly misplaced, due to the disparity of power between all of them. In Batman V. Superman, people worried about how Batman would stand next to Superman, Wonder Woman and Apocalypse. In Suicide Squad it just felt wrong that a girl with bat and a guy with a boomerang were even within two feet of a guy who can breathe fire and a woman who can tear a hole in the sky. You simply don't believe Harley, for example, is needed in the group, which throws the logic of the film out of wack. Or that her bat can rip apart monsters, when Waller's bullets don't pierce them or Katana's sword. Not sure if this is a popular opinion, but the thought definitely occurred to me. 6. Katana : Out of all the characters in this movie, Katana's character was the biggest wasted opportunity (Boomerang is a close runner up). I'm not too familiar with her character in the comics, but I've looked up a couple strips and she's speaking English. THEY FREAKING SUBTITLE HER IN THE MOVIE. She can't even communicate with the damn squad. She could have been a character that could bond with them and be pretty cool, but she's reduced to a non-English speaking, body guard. And the film's attempts to humanize her couldn't be more ineffective. I had hoped this character would be utilized stronger and better.7. The Joker : I never thought I'd say this in my lifetime, but this film should not have included the Joker. He should have full gotten his own movie or only been in certain scenes. Jared Leto does a great job, and he's definitely a scene stealer. In fact, I could see people leaving this movie thinking he was the best part or the only redeeming quality (Which in my mind is actually Will Smith), but I did enjoy watching the Joker. But his appearances made no sense in the context of the plot and felt fairly forced and random. I was expecting complex schemes from him or maybe an interesting sub plot, but that's not what I got from the movie.8. Still Fun to Watch : The movie with all its faults is nonetheless fun to watch at times and the performances aren't bad. There are particular moments that I think are done well or include nice cinematic details. Batman v. Superman is overall a better film, but Suicide Squad is definitely more exciting. In conclusion: It was difficult to keep this review fairly spoiler free, but I think I did it. Suicide Squad may become your next "guilty pleasure bad movie" film, but I think the average viewer will definitely find the film to be subpar. I did, and I hope this review helps you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a comic book movie level, this is pretty typical but as a straight out fun summer movie, this more than worth your time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad has been the long gestating DC Comics film that every single fan on the planet has been waiting for. From the controversial casting of Jared Leto as the Joker to the rumored reshoots, this is a film that has been on everyone's minds for the past two years since it was announced. So, how does it hold up? Well, let's start off with the great. The greatness in the film sits on many shoulders. Jared Leto as The Joker is probably the most interesting part of the film. Leto does not even try to top Ledger or Nicholson, he simply does his own thing. He's devilishly charming but extremely psychotic. I compare him mostly to Mark Hammil's Joker from the animated series in the 90s. It is unlike anything we've seen before so, for that, I give it kudos. It is pretty cool seeing this type of Joker but I will admit, I would have loved to have seen more of him. What is a good actually is a bit of a bad. Leto is in it for merely 25 minutes tops which is a bit disappointing considering his performance is absolutely mesmerizing. On to the rest of the Squad, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is exceptional. She delivers a performance that is straight out of Girl, Interrupted. She is extremely unpredictable on screen and it is a pure delight watching her relish in exactly what makes Harley Quinn memorable: her sultry psychotic demeanor. Will Smith as Deadshot is just Will Smith. There is no real boundary breaking performance here. He is the lead actor of the film and the film plays out like such. Not saying that Deadshot isn't a cool, badass character but it is just Will Smith in costume. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney, Joel Kinneman, Viola Davis, Scott Eastwood and Adam Beach, all give great performances and there isn't one false beat. There is a true chemistry on the screen that is palpable and David Ayer deserves high praise for that. The film is good but the performances are great. There is a clear intention on building up these characters over building the film which is another good quality turned bad. The film itself is a typical comic book movie of the 21st century. It is heavy on the characters and extremely light on plot and a villain. The first twenty minutes are spent introducing these characters, not a plot, just these characters. This is cool at first but once you realize most of the important plot points are in the trailers, it becomes a bit disappointing that there isn't a villain to rally against just anti-heroes to rally behind. By many standard traditions, this is a film very close to The Dirty Dozen or The Magnificent Seven. It is not about what is going on, it is about what is going on inside these character's minds that really push the movie forward. It is an ensemble character piece above all else. While much of the spoilers have been spoiled long ago, there are still a couple things that will bring smiles to fan's faces. So, overall... Does it break new ground? No. Is it badass? Yes. Is it fun? Absolutely. Should you see it? Without a doubt. Suicide Squad is definitely going to put some nerves at ease since Batman V Superman. But DC has a long way to go in terms of churning out undeniably great comic book films outside of The Dark Knight trilogy and Suicide Squad is most certainly a great start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not as good as your expect nor as bad as you heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start it off, i'm a big fan of dc cinematic universe, and the year 2016, hadn't been a good year for me and the other fans. Even though, i'll state myself optimistic, since actually, all my hopes and expectation fall into this movie instead. OK, Let's start with the strong aspects of the movie; performances and characters. well, i actually think this is what the director want to top off and show to the audience, thus forgetting the plot, which we will get into later. but the characters and the performances are well-performed- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn really tops off my expectation. i'm a fan of harley quinn character, and she actually brought me the harley quinn i'm expected for- sexy, beautiful, it girl of joker's. while watching the movie, and whenever i'm feeling bored, harley quinn is there to make the scene fresh. and i think all audience, including audiences who didn't know her will love her and feel sympathetic to her. Will smith as deadshot actually didn't deserve much of my appreciation. i mean even though he's one of the great and strong aspect in the movie, i just thought i don't see will smith even trying to act, which weirdly works. watching Will smith here is just watching him using a kickass suit. Jared Leto as The Joker, is actually isn't the worst part of the movie (unlike what people might have said) i think that Jared Leto pull of a great effort into his character, and some scene of him showing up gave me goosebumps and own joys. but, maybe how little the scene for him is, or his character is pretty under-developed that just doesn't fit the puzzle in the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller also brought up my her characther pretty well, as she played the cold-hearted leader Amanda Waller. other performances are great, like Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Karen Fukuhara, and Cara Delevigne.The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as the development between their relationship. in my opinion, one of the strongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary. Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under-developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.At the end, everything has its bad and has its good, what i really suggest for you to do is just lower your expectation, yet don't miss it either. it may not lift the hype as in the greatness in the trailer, but i think it's still a great fun must see summer movie , and you should enjoy it without all the overly negative critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's with these ratings? This is an exasperatingly bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get the ratings here. This is a cut and dry poorly made movie and fans of the DC universe deserve better. I don't normally post my reviews here. But I have to share my take on this movie because it just wasn't good. I didn't even have to go into spoilers to show how terrible it is. Movie goers shouldn't mindlessly consume these films. Christopher Nolan set a high bar, but producers and studios need to step messing with auteurs and maybe we can get a quality DC movie:There is nothing in Suicide Squad that shows any hope that an auteur filmmaker can do anything distinctive with the current cash cow of the Hollywood machine: the super hero movie. What Christopher Nolan once made his own has devolved into a predictable pastiche whose charms should be wearing thin on audiences. It doesn't help that the movie is also an example of how bad one of these films can be when it becomes watered down and designed to refrain from shaking up anything in the so-called DC Universe. Suicide Squad, a PG-13 film, was supposed to be DC's entry to rival Marvel's R-rated Deadpool. Even though Deadpool had its own problems as a self-aware action movie, it still had focus and a bravado that is nowhere to be found in Suicide Squad.Suicide Squad follows a group of villains with super powers released from prison as part of a government plan to protect the world from terrorists or whatever sign-of-the-times fear currently plaguing society (Zika?). Starring Will Smith as the hit man Deadshot and Margot Robbie as the Joker's manic girlfriend Harley Quinn, alongside several other less familiar DC baddies, these guys are supposed to be complex people who have long fallen from grace and are supposed to rise above to find their humanity and gain the audience's sympathy. But writer-director David Ayer tries so hard to take a safe route, you can see the gears trying to manipulate audience emotion, revealing the inherit problems of these comic book adaptations straining to catch up with decades of printed storytelling.You can't totally blame Ayer, who last gave moviegoers Fury, an incredibly strong and startling war movie featuring a better fleshed out motley crew of characters. The preciousness Hollywood has for its ongoing world building of interconnected comic book films creates such tight restrictions on storytelling that anything that might upset that world has no room to prosper. At one point, toward the end of Suicide Squad, one character asks another, "Shouldn't you be dead?" Of course not, this is the DC universe, and it's gotta be milked. That means no major players should be written off in one movie.The result of these storytelling restraints is a soulless kind of filmmaking hampered by pussyfooting. It's like a syrupy glaze that drowns out any possibility to shine above what has become a predictable pattern of storytelling. Characters dole out uninspired lines that play superficially to feelings, like, "Dad, I know you do bad things, but I still love you." Then there are the clichés, like "fight fire with fire." Sometimes the script inadvertently deflates the tension by spelling things out. Someone over a radio says, "Use extreme caution," and someone in the action responds, "I don't like this." But in case you miss that, someone else says, "I don't like it either." A kid playing with his action figures can come up with better chatter to establish tension....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tries to be so much but ends up being a real mess.Where do I begin? Character introduction runs for almost 40 minutes and I still don't end up giving a damn about anyone.Jokes are often very misplaced and feels extremely forced. Many scenes feels like they were made solely for sake of the trailer and also the trailer resembles nothing of what the actual movie is like.CGI is so off that I divide the movie into 2 teams, CGI-team and real team, and I keep ending up thinking how the ***k is human team going to beat world consuming superman-like characters.However I do like the look of the Villains, especially Enchantress.Maybe this film is the best thing for DC Universe superfans, but for the casual viewer it's very hard to get a grip of this movie, at least for me it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're the bad guys LOL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointment. That's actually far better than what I felt after watching this movie. I wanted to leave the cinema about 30 minutes before the end but that's against my personal policy so I tried plan B but found nothing to poke my eyes out so I watched, and cried...-First, where is Deadshot? No, because all I saw from start to end is goody Will Smith playing the good family guy, very far from the cold hearted hired assassin he is supposed to play.-Second, what was that false publicity? The Joker appeared a lot in the trailer but he has absolutely no purpose in this movie apart from being the background story of Harley Quinn. Really, you remove him, you get the same movie but with only half of the theatre full.-Third, while I'm on her, the guys who made this movie obviously didn't get the relationship between Harley and the Joker. The Joker don't give a damn about her, she is his tool, he can throw her from a bridge without a second thought while Harley has developed a serious Stockholm Syndrome toward him. In this movie they are all lovey-dovey, at the end of the movie I nearly expected to see them leave in a car with "Just Married" written on the back with a "And they lived happily ever after."-The first half of the movie is actually not that bad, the villains really look and act like villains most of the time but everything started to fall apart after Will Smith reunite his troops after they failed the mission the first time, each one of them just want to drop everything and leave but then Will Smith says they can't give up and of course all the bad guys listen to him because he is Will Smith (God?). That was when I did my first face-palm.-This movie is 50% Will Smith, 40% Harley Quinn, and 10% the others. Really, apart from the first two, the others are just background characters, to make a comparison, in Guardian of the galaxy, you got one hero but you know the background stories of every members of the team, and they get their fair share of screen time. In this movie, they just don't care.-The jokes, sorry... The "jokes", well, I think the quotes speaks for themselves. Sometimes it's funny, most of the times it's not and sometimes they even try to explain the joke you understand but don't find funny. I think Warner tried to be more funny and less dark in this movie after they got some bad reviews about Batman Vs Superman being too dark but that's just ridiculous, they remade some scenes to add jokes and sometimes it even breaks the action.-And while I'm on it, Batman vs Superman had an impact in the DC Universe, it starts with the consequences of what happened in Man of Steel and at the end of it, the world has changed. In this movie, there is no progression of the DC Universe, it feels more like one of those filler episode you don't want to watch in any series.-I won't talk about the end of this movie because, as a sadist, I want you to go watch this movie and suffer during the two hours needed to finally reach the end credits. Just know that the last minutes are actually way worse than the rest of the movie. Enjoy ;)Anyway, as a DC fan, I wanted to see Harley Quinn in a movie but certainly not in this one. I really, really, REALLY hope that Warner won't use this movie as a reference to make Justice League because if they do I'll have to formulate an official request to DC so they can let Marvel do their movies :D See you all in 2017.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am so-so sad :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really really disappointed to be honest. I was waiting for this movie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I was so happy when the news arrived about the live action movie. And as a massive Jared Leto fan I was extremely happy they chose him for the role of my all time favorite character, Joker. So I was hyped to see him, but the whole gang too. And what I got from the movie was equal with pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes and his role could have been easily left out, I only knew the characters because I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which by the way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actors could have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn't really get to know them... and the other characters were only there for... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise and you ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into a live action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alone movie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing! I am so, so sad right now... All of the actors deserve way better than this and they all have great potential</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, terrible plot, mediocre action scenes and shoddy humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from the movie and have a few feelings about it. It started out solid enough, we get to know the characters/motivations/weaknesses. Yes it was hurried but necessary and stylish.Then things drastically started to go downhill. DC's answer to Samuel Jackson is the stony faced Amanda Waller. She decides she needs to get these people together in case of another meta-human attack and by doing so she instigates the attack itself.So now we are faced with the big bad enchantress who we know nothing about and really aren't that committed to as a movie baddie. But that's OK... the bad guys aren't that important if our protagonists have good charisma with each other on screen. Here was my biggest issue. They just don't.The enemy ends up being a barrage of blackberry-headed minions and it begins to feel like an annoying video game. Step into a room, kill all bad guys, move on to the next room and repeat. To add insult to injury Rick Flagg even gets dragged away twice and has to be rescued like those ridiculous 'keep them alive' missions in video games. The action feels more suited to a war movie than to a comic book movie (perhaps the directors past is showing here)I wanted to like this movie, I wanted to like the characters but there were points where the dialogue was just so bad. TWICE, characters randomly hit on Katana to which she does not respond. It's not funny. TWICE everyone ends up ogling Harley Quinn. The attempts at humor in the movie were weak at best. Killer Croc utters so many pointless one liner's that are neither funny nor useful. It just didn't work. You want humor? When the characters are being shown their wildest dreams, give us a ridiculous seen with Boomerang. Give us some funny scenes with Diablo and stop saying 'esse' at him.I loved the romance with Joker and Harley.. give us more of that, don't squeeze the joker into a bunch of different personas.The bar scene was lovely, you felt the characters come close to something like a bond. Don't give us that at the end... give us that at the start of the movie, make us actually feel like these people mesh together well. They call themselves a family at the end but they have done nothing to merit that.Diablo had a cool scene at the end and Will Smith played an amazing Deadshot but I feel Rick Flag was just badly cast. I never really cared for the Rick and Deadshot scenes together on screen... It never felt like it really worked. Overall, I'll still watch DC movies, but I do feel like they are missing something that the Marvel counterpart has got right. Maybe it's heart, maybe Marvel just have more practice but I hope DC can redeem themselves next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and messy :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie and only ended up with a huge deception. The script is messy and there are way too many characters that are too quickly introduced. Many of these "villains" would require a whole movie to give intensity to their character... I really feel like DC just wanted to have as big an audience as possible without spending a penny on the script. Some good things are the special effects , the movie is overall very beautiful to watch. Some characters need a bravo for their wonderful roles: Harley Quinn mostly... The others are kind of empty to me. And some are very very bad like enchantress who mumbles in a foreign language all along and whose only 3 lines in English SUCK (when she asks Flag to destroy enchantress instead of saving her blabla). The Joker doesn't have a place in the movie, his role does not add anything to it and half of his lines are... awkward moans. El Diablo's behavior is predictable from the very beginning, Batman really wasn't necessary, Katana's few lines are desperately cheesy, etc... As a conclusion, the viewer is unable to feel a link whatsoever to any of the characters since their stories are disappointingly and quickly told. The acting of many characters does not help, whether they were just bad or the director asked them to play in that un-subtle fashion. The script is disjoint, flashbacks don't add much quality or intensity to the movie, and the "big plot" revealed at the end is... not much of a secret since the viewer KNOWS enchantress escaped from the hands of Waller. I feel like this is a big commercial move from DC to attract people... However, this will only disgust the people who were fans of the heroes/villains in the beginning. Money over quality</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilersI went in the movie with reservations, I heard negative reviews, I heard good ones. As always I make my own judgment afterwards.First and foremost, this is probably the worst and most over dramatized version of the Joker I have ever seen in my life. I was raised in comic books, they tried entirely too hard to make Joker look crazy. It seemed way too forced, he and Harley Quinn both look more like junkies than psychopaths. Not to mention they horribly botched the relationship of Jokers impression of Harley. I have no idea what they were aiming for and even less of an idea on why Jared Leto accepted that role. Harley Quinn, again they spent way too much time and effort making her a sex symbol and made her look like some white trash/hood rat combo with minor Harley Quinn traits.Deadshot, honestly, this was where I held most my reservations. I didn't like the idea of Will Smith in comic movies, but I think he did a fantastic job. The claim that Margot Robbie stole the screen just doesn't seem right as the movie centered more on the changes that he made as well as the leadership role he acquired.Killer Croc, I don't even know here. This was just plain bad in so many ways. I will just leave this one alone.Boomerang or whatever he was called, yet another utterly useless character I half expected to be killed off. Like the Joker in this movie he was a try hard with no real desire to see again.Katana, yes because who doesn't like having someone show up that doesn't speak a lick of English. You know the very language that the rest of the movie was in.Flag, no depth of a non-"meta human" kinda expected more than a minimal love story.The enchantress wasn't bad when she wasn't doing some weird fish like dance moves.Plot, terrible. Outside of the focus on Deadshot the plot seriously lacked. Why would you bring Batman into a movie for parts yet he keeps himself away from a several day long battle, especially with his decision to make a team after the doomsday problem.I would have scored this movie lower if it wasn't for the occasional Harley Quinn like characteristics and the fact that Will Smith shined pretty well.Whoever wrote some of those scripts and designed the characters should be exiled from Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Got out of the early screening earlier and was super surprised. First thing i want to talk about is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She did an amazing job, at times it can be confusing because her voice switches from her signature Brooklyn accent to just a normal American voice but it works out perfectly. Jared Leto is great, he is a very controversial pick as the Joker but i think reactions will be mixed, I think he was fantastic though. Not enough of him either. Then there was Will Smith as Deadshot, he was more or less the main leader of the suicide squad (or the squad) Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was probably the best casting In a superhero movie since Rdj as Iron Man. She was so menacing and is such an amazing actress. Batfleck is in it for a little, you were expecting him to play into the story more, but every scene he was in the crowd was Cheering. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Killer Croc, who was good, but wasn't a stand-out like I was hoping, although they didn't really put him in it to much but he was still good. Diablo was an okay character, easily has the most bad ass powers in the squad though. People Do die. I'm not going to say who, but if you watch the trailers there is a certain somebody in the squad who you assume does die... If you know who that is then you know who dies. The first 15 minutes of the movie is pretty slow. It shows all the villain's backstories. Flash interacts with Boomerang which was an Amazing scene. The flash is awesome so hyped for Justice Leauge. All in all this movie had enough Comedy and Action to blend in to an amazing summer movie. I won't compare it to Bvs Or Captain America because it isn't fair, they are all good in there own way. I highly recommend it. Go see this movie in theaters August 5th and buy it on DVD when it comes out. It's highly worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie terrible? Absolutely notIs this movie great? Absolutely not.I always heard from people that they either HATED or LOVED this movie. And for me it was neither.The audience for this film is served with a classic action movie/comic book. "The world is in danger! There must be a solution! Although there are bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solve the problem"The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classic superheroes, we have bad guys. To that I say "so what?". The movie didn't really establish why I should care about much of what was going on on screen?it was all just classic popcorn movie action and sequences that were occasionally broken up by half-attempts at character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flat jokes, one-liners and terrible chemistry make up this movie. As usual, we see a group of heroes taking on a legion of mindless alien/zombie/no-named soldiers who have absolutely no chance. There are so many awkward moments in this movie. You don't have to see the movie to know how it will play out and end. The bad guy is lame and uninteresting, who apparently has the power to instantly disarm all of the heroes but doesn't use it until the very end -- when it's too late. I get that they want to show us that she is "powerful", but they just don't know what they are doing. Just terrible.Save your time and money. There are few memorable things about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why and How is Will Smith the star of this movie?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start...woe is me...where to start?!?! First I'll say I was looking forward to this movie for a long time..like many people. All I really cared about was of course...the resurrection of The Joker!I think Jared Leto has the kind of God given talent that can never be taught to any actor. He was born with it, like Nicholson and Ledger before him. So needless to say I was absolutely stoked to see what he would do with such an iconic character. I didn't really care much about anything else. Which leads me to say WOW! The marketing on this film was the definition of false advertisement. There were so many interesting story lines to play with here. The Joker and Harley Quinn with their demented love story wouldve been my first choice. It was Jared Leto and Margot Robbie that shouldve been leading this movie...NOT WILL SMITH! guys I can't stress enough how much i dislike Will Smith. Guys this whole movie revolves around Will Smith playing Will Smith in a movie where he's supposed to be playing Deadshot.God I can't stress enough just how much he ruined this movie for me. Basically he did his whole schtick from Hancock but threw on an extra layer of "stereotypical hood black guy" and called it Deadshot. As an African American..I cringed every time he opened his mouth.Sorry about my Will Smith melt down...he is just really awful.I really would've liked to understand more about Enchantress..there was definitely not enough time to establish her at all. The "Villains" were literally moving props whose only purpose was to slow our heroes down.Also, I'm not sure Cara Delevigne has the gravitas to really dig into Enchantress...but I could be wrong...The fail on June Moone could very well all be on David Ayer's shoulders. Also the CGI for Enchantress and her movements in the final sequence were actually laughable. I couldn't take her seriously.Diablo was the only actual Metahuman and they didn't explain his origin whatsoever. Not in a meaningful way anyway. Captain Boomerang wasn't terrible..not memorable either. Killer croc was there...could barely understand anything he said...but he was there...and apparently loves BET(GTFOH). Viola Davis was solidly cold hearted as Amanda Waller. Davis, Leto and Robbie were the only strong points of the film and there was not nearly enough of them.Personally, I really enjoyed Batman V Superman. I know the plot was a bit of jumbled mess and the bat vs supes was like 5 mins long and then there was Doomsday..ugh. But I still really liked it. There was a lot of it that dealt to me very believable circumstances. I can't say the same for SS...I never bought it. Not once did I sink into the story of the characters...I was always very aware I was in a movie theater watching the fresh prince flap his lips.To the folks at Warner Bros..ya'll need to step your game up..and do it quickly. You cannot keep making sub par movies like this. I'm this upset and I didn't even have to pay to see this movie. I can't even imagine the folks that are shelling out hard earned money for the 2 hour crapfest I just sat through. Jeez man...What a waste of Jared Leto. Save your money guys and pirate this crapfest in a week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't lie, the movie isn't perfect. A few jokes fall flat, and make those moments awkward, but the rest is superb. The acting was more than I expected out of this movie. In terms of acting, I'll go in order of my top 3: Robbie, Leto, and Smith. All of their portrayals are excellent. El Diablo is a nice surprise, his character made us feel for him, maybe even more-so than the top stars. Leto knocks it out of the park. As a Ledger fanboy, I was dreading his performance, but his character was amazing down to the slightest movement. No amount of dialogue is wasted nor any simple movement is wasted. Overall, the movie was great, again, some awkward script, but the action scenes are done extremely well and the acting is great. 8/10. Leagues above Batman v Superman in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overly hyped film and a very unfortunate disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage. Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some points. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have been chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A weak six stars and a onetime watch.</fullReview>

Problem solved.It doesn't quite have the fun of the trailer, which can happen when someone not involved with film cuts something that may not represent the film.Harley Quinn obviously a stand out, but the BIG ONE for me, was seeing Batman, albeit briefly.

Couldn't understand who the hell is the enchantress' brother and his connection to her, and they barely appeared in like 1/4 of the movie, didn't care much about them. - Not enough focus on the special abilities of each member of the squad and what makes them special and different from each other. - Not enough Joker presence, but I understand he wasn't supposed to be over-present in the movie.Joker was great for me and Harley Quinn is the best in the movie. Viola Davis (Waller) and Will Smith delivered outstanding performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Suicide Squad" made me wanna hang myself...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of superhero films in general (a handful of exceptions do exist), but I was feeling (stupidly) optimistic for Suicide Squad. I went with my friends to see it, and while they admired parts of it and were able to have a good laugh about it, I couldn't. I didn't enjoy one second of the two hours I was in that seat. My eyes eventually began to water...I was the only person in the theater who didn't enjoy it.Everything about the film felt fragmented, and whether or not that was the intention is irrelevant to me, because I wouldn't have liked it either way. The soundtrack consists almost entirely of hit songs... clichéd songs (songs that I actually love by themselves).The acting wasn't bad at all, but it always felt odd and off. I'm not doubting the talent of this cast because I've seen just about all of them play an amazing role elsewhere. I don't even want to get started on the humor. I'm no prude when it comes to comedy, but for the entire two hours of run time, I didn't even crack a smile. To me, the most entertaining part was my buddy quietly singing along to the songs as he set beside me, wholly immersed. Action scenes were typical, predictable, and not very creative; just typical superhero movie fight scenes. As a whole, the film is so predictable that you could probably guess what's going to happen scene-by-scene as the story progresses.As mentioned previously, this movie was so boring. Had I gone by myself, I would have definitely walked out probably the halfway point. I didn't feel invested. I didn't feel interested. I felt absolutely nothing.You might be wondering as to why I gave SS a bonus star. It definitely tried, and I recognize a lot of the talent and effort that went into some of the special effects and makeup. I really couldn't give it much credit for anything else. The bonus star is for the production. Unimpressive, movie. I know there are many people who also despise this movie, but it's in all honesty a very polarizing piece. You have to see it to make an actual decision, but I can certainly tell you where I stand. If you enjoyed it, kudos to you. I simply couldn't, despite really, really wanting to. Ten minutes in, my mind just gave up, and I sat there like a vegetable for the remaining one-hundred and ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilariously Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was a horrible film. I don't even know where to begin. I went in hoping that the critics were wrong, and it would be an entertaining summer blockbuster. I was painfully mistaken.First of all, the dialogue was atrocious. Especially from Harley Quinn. Everything that comes out of her mouth makes me want to cringe. "We're bad guys, it's what we do." "Puddin', I don't know how to swim." Terribly delivered lines. I can't blame Margot Robbie for this performance. No one could say those lines without sounding like nails on a chalkboard. Every line that comes from Viola Davis' mouth sounds like they're trying to be sophisticated, but they don't make any sense. "We put they (or her/ him, can't remember) in a hole and threw away the hole." What a great line. Also, the last line from the terribly forgettable villain (a seven-thousand year old witch that wants to kill every human on Earth) was "you don't have the balls." Bravo. I also remember Deadshot's daughter to have very bad lines, but maybe it was just her robotic acting. And I know it's nitpicking, but the Joker's laugh as he lays down beside his knives in one scene (was also in the trailer, I think) tried to be creepy and menacing, but came off has laughable. But more on the Joker later.Next, the structure. The first fifteen to twenty minutes is just introducing characters. Viola Davis sits down, and talks with food in her mouth, telling several men about the villains (which would later become the Suicide Squad). I even have a problem with *this* because they introduce only Harley Quinn and Deadshot, and suddenly the title pops up, and then they get back to introducing the rest. Either have the title at the beginning of the film, or introduce everyone, and then play the title. Anyway, almost the entire movie takes place in a city, going through buildings. The same place in the trailers. We see flashbacks to each member of "the Suicide Squad's" past life (except for Killer Croc, and there's only one for Captain Boomerang, that only lasts a few seconds during the introduction). This film really confused me at first. I have no prior knowledge of the Suicide Squad in the comics, so I thought Cara Delevingne's character (who is the villain) was a part of the Suicide Squad at first. The way she got possessed by the witch (don't remember her actual name) was walking through a cave, and she broke off the head of some doll, and apparently got possessed. They give no backstory on who this witch is, where she came from, why she had a doll in a cave. You really just have to accept it. Most of the other backstories are cliché. The "Fire" guy (don't remember his name) was a family man who loved his children, but one day he killed them all in a freak accident. Deadshot, another family man, loves his daughter, but was arrested by Batman because she "told him not to shoot". Harley Quinn's backstory is a tad fuzzy. She falls in love with the Joker at the Arkham Asylum (she's apparently his counselor or something), gets a machine gun for him, becomes a stripper, and falls into a barrel of paint. Best not to ask questions. Then the Joker drives her off a bridge, and Batman saves her. There's no real plot to this movie. Viola Davis wants them to kill the witch, who is terrorizing the city, they have awkward conversations and argue along the way, Harley Quinn breaks a window, then they go to the witch (she also has this boyfriend, but don't even remember what he looks like) kill her boyfriend, the Harley Quinn stabs her, and her *other* boyfriend (who fell in love with Cara Delevingne) crushes her heart. And they leave it on a cliffhanger, when the Joker breaks into Harley's prison cell, and lets her escape.This film is also unnecessarily dark. No, really, it was hard to even see what was happening at times, because the film had some sort of "shadow palette" added to it. Why is DC trying to make their films as dark as possible? The Man of Steel was dark, Batman V Superman was dark. Make a film colorful if you want to include "humor". It's like Breaking Bad taking place on Sesame Street.Lastly, the Joker. Why is Leto's Joker being applauded? I personally think Leto is a great actor, but his performance reminded me of Lex Luthor in Batman V Superman. Way too over-the-top. He's hardly even in the film. I feel like he tries to be menacing, but everything he does just falls flat. They shouldn't have included him in this film, I felt if he had more backstory and purpose (and less over-the-top acting) I would have enjoyed his performance just a little more.I give this film a 2/10, and wouldn't recommend this anyone. Wasn't even very entertaining. The only reason I give this a 2 instead of a 1 is because they actually put effort into this film. I can tell Jared Leto, Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and everyone else in this film is actually trying to put in effort to their performance, but they fail in doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you go into this movie with low expectations (like Transformers type expectations) I feel like it would possible to have a alright time and you could moderately enjoy the film. The movie is all over the place from the beginning and doesn't ever quite hit its stride in establishing It's identity as a film. The character development was unconvincingly rushed; in what seemed like no time at all the independent, villainous, metahumans go from being hellbent on revenge and/or escape to becoming a super positive tight knit "family". The humour was very hit and miss as most of the intended funny moments felt awkwardly forced and/or geared towards a yonder audience. There were often moments where it seemed they were pushing really hard for a laugh, but instead, it just came across forced opposed to organic. On the upside the acting was solid for the most part and the movie boasted an awesome soundtrack throughout. Overall I was pretty disappointed with Suicide Squad and recommend skipping right over this flopped summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

Explosion didn't look so powerful...Why at her final appearance Amanda Waller had her fingers on the touch screen of her phone and this didn't kill anyone? Who gave Harley a cell phone? And did't spy her communication at least? This could save few marine's life and a helicopter.Why Deadshot,Boomerang,Slipknot,Harley Quinn (and even Katana) were considered as meta humans?Why Amanda took the helicopter as it was the helicopter? There was no helicopter operational more than 2 minutes , before it was took down.Does the enchantress has two hearts at the end? How nobody recognized her brother's statue as a dangerous thing? Was his heart hidden somewhere? And what kind of archaeologist was June? She brook the potential precious artifact?And she was alone in the jungle?Why Slipknot was not present in the initial intro of the 'metahumans'. He came out of nowhere and died stupidly.How the squad attached so fast to each other? Especially the boomerang who killed his biddy during the robbery.And even a simple pistol is a superior weapon than this stupid boomerangs.What was the point of captain boomerang , except the hovering boomerang with the camera?And the joker was a joke.

Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no story.

		<shortDescription>So Bad Even Shills Can't Ensure The Truth Won't Get Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a tedious movie. I saw this last night and I've tried to forget it ever since. From the get go, the Suicide Squad anti-heroes are introduced one- by-one. Then, once they're all given their backgrounds and clichéd introductions, they are delivered to their new boss, one . . . by . . . one. This consumes about the first 45 minutes, just before the meaningless action takes place. What's really ironic, More time is spent describing their ironic natures than explaining their first mission. Consequently, their first foray just seems pointless, because it is. The character development was weak and I really didn't care if they came back alive or not.HACK: In a fiction-writing context, the term is used to describe writers who are paid to churn out sensational, lower-quality "pulp" fiction such as "true crime" novels or action centered "super hero movies".Batman Begins (screenplay/director: Christopher Nolan) is a study in character development. Suicide Squad (David Ayer writer/director) is a hack job if there ever was one. And yet it has a 6.9 as I write this, so I see shills at work. Time will water this "dog" to it's real valuation, about 4.7 is my guess. I gave it a 1/10 because it's was insultingly bad. PS - Will Smith is interesting as usual, but not nearly enough to recommend this. This movie is a study in rote-cliché, predictable and plodding screenplay development, and extremely poor dialogue. Dead Pool is SO much better, that is if you want to laugh at super heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a fan of 1987 Suicide Squad comics I was pleased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this can't be looked at in comparison to The Dark Knight because these are two very different stories in the Gotham Universe. People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I know this was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don't mind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a "main character" type. It was something I could dislike easily because she's usually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended up playing a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals the show. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.There's some good character development and the writing was more funny than I expected but DC is just so dark all the time I felt like it enhanced it. It's funny but in a dark twisted way in the comics. If I had to say some negatives... I don't like the shaky-cam action fight that are way too zoomed in to see anything. It was tolerable and there were some great action movie moments. However because they had character development, it allows the audience to care more about the fights/action. You can have a good character piece with bad action cause at least you care about what's going on. Bad writing or bad character presentation with great action will not get the crowd to have a reaction. But I wouldn't go as far as calling it bad. However the editing was terrible. I heard they took this movie into a focus group who knew nothing about movies or proper story structure for that matter and let them dictate what happened to it. David Ayer did a great job, don't ruin his work through editing. I'm reviewing this based off what I saw in his original idea. The movie would get a 9 if they didn't change it.I can't really judge it on a typical movie goer scale because I go to see the comic book movies for a reason. When they get it right, it's gold. I don't mind a few changes if they positively affect the overall outcome. This movie succeeded with that. I'd highly recommend to comic fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad had some genuinely brilliant trailers and looked like it was gonna be the first movie in the DCEU that actually knew what exactly it wanted to be. I was absolutely convinced that this movie was going to make me sigh in relief that there might actually be hope for DC's new movie universe. Instead it was by far the worst movie in said universe thus far. The thing is while Batman V Superman was a mess and made absolutely no sense it at least had a few big wow moments. Suicide Squad doesn't even have that to offer it's just a monotonous bore from start to finish. The first third is pretty much nothing except for a huge exposition dump. Rather than naturally learning who each character in this team is throughout the course of the movie, David Ayer thought it was a brilliant idea to waterboard the audience with forced flashbacks that strive not only to give us the facts about them but also try to get us emotionally attached to them. I can't believe Ayer is so stupid that he doesn't know you can't expect an audience to care about a bunch of characters just because we are told to. It's literally like: "OK, Deadshot has a daughter who he loves, Harley Quinn was very tragically twisted and tortured by the Joker and Rick Flag fell in love with this scientist lady but she is possessed now. OK attachment out of the way let's get started!" Not to mention it's just boring watching 5 elongated flashback sequences back-to-back. The worst character out of the bunch though is the villain. This one actually manages to make even the worst of the Marvel villains look like Heath Ledger's Joker. Not a word that comes out of her mouth is interesting and her evil plan is as clichéd and tiresome as evil plans get. Oh and if you were planning on seeing this because of the Joker, don't hold your breath. Leto's baffling performance is original and new in all the wrong ways. He strays so far he loses any semblance of actually playing the Joker and instead feels like some drugged up, gang lord pimp who is neither scary nor entertaining. However the worst thing of all is that you just can't have fun with this movie. There's a clear attempt to ape Guardians of the Galaxy's success with similar soundtrack choices as well as frequent jokes and bombastic action sequences. This attempt falls flat on it's face though seeing as the music is awkward and out of place, the action scenes are repetitive and unimaginative and the funniest jokes in the movie barely even manage a chuckle. I will give credit to some of the actors though, in particular I think Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller are ideal choices. And every now and again this movie does manage to do something entertaining which is why I am bumping the score up a bit but overall those moments are so rare it doesn't matter in the long run. A bad movie which I couldn't have seen coming in a million years. Lots of potential for solid and fun entertainment wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boycott Wonder Woman and they'll reboot the DCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a mess. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was great. And Will Smith brought his A-Game. But almost everything else about the film is boring, lame and OMG WHY DID I PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS? I could go on but you heard it all before. So let us talk about the Joker. Fanboys are giving Jared Leto's Joker a pass by saying we didn't see enough of him to judge him. Ummm, did they watch the same movie as me? The Joker had more lines then Wonder Woman in BvS. We saw him interact with Harley, some thug, Harley a few more times and some other guy. We got to see Leto's Joker. And spoiler alert, it sucks. Leto's Joker reminded me of those Jokers you see in a fan- made YouTube video. Basically, he is generic as hell. So yeah, this current DC cinematic universe killed off the Joker. If you fools want to continue pretending like the DCU is anything but below average then you can go right ahead. I gave them 3 honest chances. I will not be spending a DIME on anything to come out from Warner Bros (DC films or otherwise) until they come to their senses and REBOOT THE DCU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a total disgrace to the DC Villains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole plot of the movie was a mess. It really confused me what all the characters in the film was fighting for, I mean there was no real goal of the movie for the first 70% of the time. Then they set up the story in a way where the friend turns into the foe, and those friends are now facing this foe as their primary enemy and not the one it was shown at the beginning of the movie. I think the whole script was written by a total non professional guy who needs to again go through the basic levels of a film school. This movie made DC lose its fame towards its fans and I hope they bounce back in their next show. Thank you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just want to say that these guys were supposed to play bad-ass villains, but honestly the villains from power girls are darker and with a better humor than these clowns.Non of the other characters are worth the ticket (with one exception which I will mention at last) nor they seem interesting, Will Smith seems super generic and you don't buy it that he was a criminal. The rest of them are not even worth analyzing. Then you have the witch, which was the worst of the bad, seems to me that Cara is talent-less for acting, worst if it's suppose to be a obscure and ancient villain.The only reason for not giving a 1 out of 10 is Harley Quinn. Margot is insanely hot! and she indeed seemed crazy as supposed to be for her character, she definitely is the spark that lights up the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as the development between their relationship. in my opinion, one of the strongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary. Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under- developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.</fullReview>

Perhaps a cameo by deadshot instead of this 123min waste of time and money. - Joel Kinnaman... why? seriously, who the hell put this guy in the movie? - clichés. clichés everywhere. - the ending was good. because I finally got to go home, watch netflix and forget about this horrible, horrible thing.Please, do not watch this movie at the movie theater. Not even at home. Just make a new movie in your head and pretend that this one does not exist. Trust me, whatever you imagine gets an Oscar compared to this thing.I love movies, and consider myself with a decent amount of knowledge to rate a movie and this, my friends, is a total disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity that ends up as a damp squib.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any pre-showing excitement we had built up at being entertained by a fast paced, visually outstanding or witty film dissipated within the first half hour. Recent superhero or comic book based films have offered so much more. From the sharp, dark, deadpan humour of Deadpool or even the all round family appeal of Guardians of the Galaxy. Instead here we have a confused plot, painting by numbers editing and flat bland dialogue that amounts to a tedious mess. What a wasted opportunity from such good potential?The editing was bizarre and disjointed. Some opening scenes were lengthy, introducing a few main characters in detail and then the remaining characters were dropped in, almost as extras. As if they ran out of time because they didn't plan the structure of the film properly.It felt like entire scenes were cut when we jumped from the Enchantress being contained to suddenly releasing her brother. No explanation or reason as to how or why this chain of events could suddenly happen. The scriptwriters use the Enchantress and her brother as a Hitchcockian McGuffin. They simply become a plot device to enable the Suicide Squad to bond together to fight them. But without any narrative explanation, the viewer is left being unable to identify with any of the characters and has no one to will on to win the fight. Therefore the film lacked any tension. The only worthwhile elements in the entire film are the superb costumes and the casting for Harley Quinn and the Joker. Without the pair I would have walked out before the end so bored was I with the dull way the film plodded along. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie have found their niche. However it is disappointing that neither were given any amusing dialogue and no effort was made to use their anarchic characters to develop the plot. Once again we were treated to the true misogyny of the Hollywood film industry. The sexy and fearless Harley Quinn came to existence as a result of her crazed passion for the Joker. An already dysfunctional character prior to meeting the Joker she then has her true self unleashed upon meeting of her soul mate( Bonne and Clyde style ). It's a tortured love affair that's complex and brutal. Yet in this version she is shown as a respectable character corrupted by a love spell cast by the Joker. He is then shown to create her madness with electric shock therapy . The violent and insane nature of the male characters isn't offered a similar treatment. They are accepted for their violence and anarchic streaks and their life choices. Why is it so hard for Hollywood and male film directors to show a woman being naturally dangerous or driven insane with desires? Then we follow up later in the film with a scene that showed Harley Quinn's true desire to be wanting to conform and have the picket fence suburban family. This is a complete betrayal of the original character. As if we can only offer redemption and embrace her madness because deep down she just wants to be married and have a baby. Did we drop back into the fifties here? The film continues its treatment of woman as only bad ass characters because of the influence of men. Katana is a top class martial arts killer but only because she is redeeming the death of her husband. It is shown that a female can only be in a position of authority if she is as cold and brutal as any killer. I can't recall many male protagonists in charge of similar teams in other films shooting their own staff for no genuine reason other than sheer ruthlessness. Tired and clichéd sexist nonsense.The plot was formulaic and then became confused and jumped about all over the place. The Enchantress's army looked like extras with bad acne straight from a 1950's b movie and not the least bit scary. And as for the climatic ending, had someone just watched the original Ghostbusters and thought ' "Hey that's a great plot line"? I don't know which is more depressing the thought that this is the type of film a modern day audience expects to view or the fact that executives think this is the type of film that we should be viewing. Doesn't hold much hope for a brighter film industry. Less suicide squad and more damp squib.</fullReview>

We wasted our money.Don't go to this disaster. You'll regret it no matter your age.During each scene, I was wondering what is happening.Because the lighting was so dark,I couldn't make out the action. There were times I kept asking myself why I had agreed to come to this film. The character,Harley Quinn, had this Brooklyn accent which didn't really fit in.

		<shortDescription>Pro's and Con's of Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie since last summer. Part of me enjoyed the film while the other part is so disappointed. (If that makes sense)Lets start off with the pro's. Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, and Will Smith were all great for their roles, most of the humor worked, Harley Quinn was exactly what I had expected her to be and she was the best thing in the movie (just my opinion), Diablo's full powers were very unexpected and awesome at the end, the soundtrack is perfect, the practical effects were used very well - Killer Crocs makeup looked so realistic. Now the cons -The CGI was a bit iffy at times, Katana, Killer Croc, and Slipknot were literally there for no reason. I get that they used Slipknot to prove a point (don't mess with The Wall or you'll get your head blown off) but I feel like we needed to know the character a bit more. Scott Eastwood is just a soldier. That's it. The villain's motive weren't very clear.The Enchantress and her brother wanting to destroy was so out of nowhere. Just like Xmen Apocalypse. Literally so much of the footage from the trailers and the behind the scenes footage/pictures were cut from the final product which was a huge disappointment for me. I also feel like we didn't really get to know the character June Moone in order for it to be emotional at the end before she wakes back up. The monsters that were apart of Enchantress's army were basically harmless. I mean they could fight but they were such an easy target. I also felt like the bond between the squad was so forced and way too rushed. The action sequences could have been way better instead they were so messy. The marketing made it seem like the Joker was going to be one main stars but he ended up being in a small portion of the film. The editing is so bad. Soo bad.At the end, although the editing, screenplay, and CGI weren't great at times, underused characters were added for no reason, and so much was cut from the film - most of the acting worked, practical effects were appreciated, and the light tone was a big step up for DC. Suicide Squad is nothing more then a fun flick to watch when you're bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently it's good to be bad, should be DC's tagline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start, where to start? This is probably the main problem of the DCU at the moment. They're playing catchup to Marvel, they see Avengers they want in. The problem is, Marvel have spent 4,5 &amp; 6 movies setting it up. We care if Cap gets hurt, we understand the Hulks turmoil and we saw Starks motivation for donning the suit. But here we're introduced to a whole new cast, backstory and all, in 30 mins tops. It just doesn't work, it's rushed, it's lazy and it has no effect in making the audience care about these characters; which in a movie where the stakes are so high, does not bode well. So here's what I thought of each character:- Will Smiths Deadshot - has by far the most screen time and manages to annoy in every single scene. He hits all the clichés, slo-mo gun catch, CHECK. Says the movie title, CHECK. Even when he's playing a cold blooded assassin, he's a good guy. Rating 2/10- Margot Robbies Harley Quinn - looks the part, has the voice, has the insanity. It works well. Some of the jokes miss and some of her stuff is very repetitive but she's the best of a bad bunch (pun intended) Rating 7/10 (let down by the writing, she's great as Harley)- Jai Courtney's Boomerang - here's something I never thought I'd write. Jai Courtney acted well in this film. Criminally underused, could have been such a Deadpool-esque self aware character but again the writing (and Will Smiths screen time) sold him short. Rating 6/10- Jay Hernandez El Diablo - starts off boring, does some fire stuff and some CGI stuff. Lame. Rating 3/10- Viola Davis Amanda Waller - the best part of this film, even if her motivation is kind of all over the place. She's menacing, but justifies it. Rating 9/10- Cara D Enchantress - Abysmal. She can't act, simple as. Why she got the job is beyond me. She's monotone, she has no emotion, she just can't act. Stop. Stop giving her parts. She's awful. Rating 0/10- Joel K Rick Flag - Insipid. Boring. Tom Hardy would have been miles better. But I wouldn't want to hurt his career by being in this trash. Rating 2/10- Killer Croc 4/10 pointless- Katana 3/10 pointless- Slipknot 0/10 pointless- Batman 0/10 pointless (just in it so he can be in the trailer and sell more tickets)- Jared Leto Joker - Pointless. Again only for the trailer to sell tickets. He's weird, he's creepy, but he is NOT the Joker. He's Scarface with mental problems and a fetish for tattoos. They used very similar imagery to Heath Ledgers in some scenes. But then went batshit crazy (pun intended) in others. Unlike Heaths Joker who had a clear plan of just wanting chaos, this Joker is just meh. Take him out of the scenes he's in and it wouldn't change the scene, take his scenes out of the movie and it wouldn't change the movie. He's hardly in it but he gets a 10/10 for disappointing in every scene he's in. Rating -10/10Finally, it wants to be the avengers, it wants to be Guardians of the Galaxy, it wants to be the Dark Knight, it wants to be Deadpool, in the end it was just another DCU film. A ringing endorsement if ever there was one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was expecting more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this movie. I'm not familiar with the characters from the comic books, but a gang of super villains turned super heroes seemed like a lot of fun. What I discovered was that the super villains weren't so super, the graphic design was bland and the action generic. All of which did not lead to an engaging movie. The short of the story: Post Batman vs. Superman, Batman puts a few bad guys in super villain prison, an even badder guy shows up, a proactive political type takes the initiative to let the bad guys out to get the badder guy and save the world. Sounds cool, right? The problem is that, for the most part, the characters and action were flat with no payoff. Back in the good ol' Arnold/Sylvester 80's action movies you got a story setup where the only way out was through, action that was ridiculously over the top but creative, comic relief (with quotable cheesy one liners) and a satisfying ending of poetic justice. Suicide Squad did not follow this formula and would have been better if it had. Where did it go wrong? First, the characters. The only character with a real attempt to add dimension to was Deadshot. The only real problem with Deadshot was that Will Smith played the character and Will Smith has a tendency to be Will Smith in every movie. There was some backstory on Harley Quinn and Diablo, but nothing that added any real value to the story. All of the other supers were basically red shirts.One of the biggest letdowns for me was Harley Quinn. Before seeing this movie I read so much about how she was the highlight of the show, but the character really missed being a lasting classic character on so many levels. I was expecting a complex mix of manipulative powers similar to Black Widow, but more flirty with a big dose of Hannibal Lecter. What we got was an attempt to convince everyone she was crazy by saying off the wall things and laughing all the time. The same is also true for the Joker, who goes hand in hand with Harley. What made classic insane characters work like Hannibal and Heath Ledger's Joker work so well was that they were based in real characteristics of mental illness and the criminally insane, not the superficial "voices are telling me to kill everyone" that we get here. Criminal insanity is the inability to tell right from wrong, or as I see it, complete loss of any type of empathy for others or a conscience. It is often accompanied by a view that the whole world is doomed anyway, so why would you work to better it or care what happens to it, which would be an easy perspective to pull off with any of these characters.My biggest issue with this movie is that the super heroes were not very super. It seemed that they needed saving more than Generic Soldier #X. Even in the universally panned BvS each character had complimentary abilities needed to solve a problem. Except for Deadshot no one's abilities were used very much at all.The real mystery of the movie was why the director approved faceless potato men as the graphic design of the villain army soldiers. Not scary.The Good? I gave this 2 stars solely for Viola Davis. She shows how a good actor can turn a sow's ear of a script into a silk purse. She knocked the character of Amanda Waller out of the park so hard that she seemed out of place here. This character was the only redeeming aspect of the movie. Amanda was the politician trying to save the world, but in the process was more evil than any of the super villains. It was a dose of reality that may be lost in the shadow of a bad movie overall, but was brilliant in concept. A subtle yet chilling badness that should have been applied to Harley Quinn as effectively. Both characters could have been equally strong and vicious, but yin-yang opposites. That could have been interesting to explore.The verdict? Pass on this one. If you want good over saturated superhero movies re-watch The Dark Knight and the original Avengers again, or maybe one of the X-Men movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's cool, but what happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge DC fan, and was eager to see the film when I first caught wind that 'Suicide Squad' was in the making. Though having many expectations, hopes, etc, I walked into the theater with a blank slate - I wanted to judge this film based on the film alone, without comparison to any other sources. The film has a quality soundtrack, and Will Smith and Margot Robbie's characters fill the screen with their amazing acting and portrayals of these quirky villains, and though slightly overused, the kaleidoscope effect in the end credits was pretty cool... But I think most of the film's budget went into that rather than the post-production editing team's paycheck. The editing was okay, but it muddled up the time lapse within the film. Though "3 days" had passed, it had felt as though the whole film had happened within a single night. It was messy, and the CGI with Cara Delevigne's character felt a little mediocre. Suicide Squad had potential, and if the producer(s) had made their minds up rather than creating two 'separate' films and awkwardly combining them both together, it could have truly been a great film. The pomp and flash of the design and humor caters to a wider audience, and it's no secret why Suicide Squad is doing so well financially. But the truth is, though it has some great characters and awesome music, it's not well edited and it's not a brilliant film. It tried to bring in the humor and kick of Deadpool with the whimsicality of Guardians of the Galaxy, and I feel that if DC tried to be DC, and stopped trying to compete and out-do Marvel, it could produce something truly spectacular. We've seen the Dark Knight, we know what DC can do, it's about time it brought that flare back and created something truly spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Ayer must be so annoyed right now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When David Ayer was brought on to this film, he was given SIX WEEKS to write this film and prepare to direct it!! And then the studio interfered with the footage they had so much and destroyed a (just) good movie to something absolutely terrible!Do not get me wrong, there are things that I did like about this movie. Will Smith as Deadshot was awesome, he was cool and suave and threatening. He was a nice guy but a guy who's bad side you do not want to be on. And they still managed to have a soft side that wasn't cliché but actually helped his character. He even managed to be funny without being a Deadpool or Spider-Man like character. Margot Robbie was also great and together her and Will Smith stole the movie (what was left of it in this mess). She was really funny but didn't distract from the story (even though it wasn't an actual story but you know what I mean) as her comedy came from what was going on in the film. Deadshot and Harley Quinn also had great chemistry as the bad boy and cool girl of the squad. Thanks to this the scene where Waller made Deadshot try and kill Quinn was one of the movie's best moments and then having Waller "kill" the Joker really helped her character become even more of an asshole as well as not letting the Squad free at the end. I also really enjoyed Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. She was menacing and horrible and you literally just wanted her to die horribly and that is what you want a villain to be (although she wasn't technically the villain but she kind of was but that is not a problem with this movie). I am also one of the only people that liked the whole Enchantress/June Moone concept but it's execution was really not good. But it's concept had the potential to be so good if it was cast better. I have no problem with Cara Delevingne but she really was not good in this movie. This movie had some real heart (the great scene in the bar really showing this) with most of the characters and with Deadshot and Harley Quinn and Rick Flag we almost got all the heart that we wanted. Unfortunately, the Enchantress thing became predictable and she should have just stayed dead being as she won't be in any future movies and it would have had a more powerful ending and would have improved Rick's character being as he could be in future movies. El Diablo was also kinda cool but was nothing special.What I didn't like about the movie was that it DID NOT HAVE A STORY. It was put together to just be a bunch of ideas and had absolutely no proper structure.Deadshot's daughter became a little cliché at the end and I did not like her talking about guns and shooting people being as Deadshot did not want her to know about it, so that just didn't make sense and Harley Quinn's flashbacks were great they should have just been placed somewhere else in the movie and the flashback with Joker that we saw in the trailer was ruined in the film. An attempt was also made to give El Diablo some heart but there really was not enough time put to it and his backstory was only put in so we could see Enchantress use it against him so he could lash out and use his powers.Cara Delevingne's acting was horrible to watch. Although Cara is cute and they needed someone cute to play June so that it would be easier to give Rick flag more heart. But there are plenty of cute actresses that could have done this. Also making Enchantress the main villain was stupid and she was really really bad and her brother was even worse.The Joker really should have been in the movie more. I am not sure how I feel about this Joker because I can't tell if he is going to be a disaster or is finding his feet as a completely new interpretation which is good I guess because it means risks have been taken. Although his flashback scenes were cool it is clear that DC are still not 100% sure where to take the Joker. At the moment he is a sort of mad gangster of sorts which could work just needs to be a little more solid. Having the Flash in the film for, literally, a few seconds was really a poor choice being as we have not seen enough of Flash for that to be an acceptable thing to do and the flashback of Superman's funeral with rock music under it was really inappropriate and SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE MOVIE.Slipknot was actually needless. And having him in the movie just so that they could have killed him could have been done well. If they had set him up properly and then killed him without everyone in the audience knowing it was going to happen would have been a good plot point and added stakes by making the audience think that nobody is safe. So that is the main jist of what needs to be said about Suicide Squad. I really don't think they are also going to release an extended or director's cut to this movie as well so I guess it's just a huge shame about what happened to this movie and it sucks for David Ayer as he missed out on his opportunity to direct a great superhero movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what it said on the tin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past couple of days I've been hearing a lot of stuff about this film. I've been very excited for Suicide Squad ever since it was announced, being a bit of a DC Comics fanboy myself, and have thus been keeping up with the film regularly. For the past few days a lot of negative reviews have been thrown at this film and now, after watching it, I don't really understand where all that negativity comes from.Let me just start off by saying that if you're coming into Suicide Squad hoping to get a really deep and interesting story or to see Leto's 'Joker' then you're probably going to be disappointed. That's not to say Leto is bad, despite my fears I actually very much enjoyed Leto's portrayal of 'The Joker', it's just he isn't often present. And that's a good thing, I was genuinely concerned that Leto may take centre stage and was pleased when he didn't.The plot is probably one of the film's weakest points. This plot is a very overused plot by now and especially in superhero flicks. If you're expecting a film full of twists and turns there aren't many here. However, the lack of sophisticated plot feels both justified and adequate to me as instead we are treated to a lot of interaction between the large cast, of mainly unknown characters. I was surprised by just how much characterisation most of the characters received in this film. Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Enchantress, Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, Katana and El Diablo all get given a glimpse of detailed backstory that helps to develop the characters, some more than others, and it surprised me. Not only is this characterisation surprising to me, but it was also done rather well in my opinion, especially with Deadshot, El Diablo and Harley.The performances in this film are actually all very solid for me. Margot Robbie had a monumental task in bringing one of DC's most beloved villains of recent years to the big screen and she pulls it off pretty perfectly. Viola Davis is a very good Amanda Waller. Will Smith pulls a good amount of weight as Deadshot and he really pulls the role off, despite my worries, all the more fool I. I enjoyed the other characters also, most receiving less screen time but all of them having their moments to shine.The visuals in this film too, are amazing. Some of the scenes with Delevingne's 'Enchantress' are simply amazing just to watch, seeing as that character visually is the most difficult to pull off with the possible exception of El Diablo. The final battle especially, for me, looked amazing. It is very rare for me nowadays to honestly come away from one of these superhero films, Marvel or DC, and say that I saw something new. However, the final battle and the visuals on the main villain really sent chills down my spine, I hadn't quite seen something so intimidating in one of these films yet and it really affected me.The only other thing I think that is worth noting on this film is that the pacing can sometimes feel a little off, especially at the beginning. Most of this I attribute to the main character's introductions and backgrounds and thus I give it a pass. I myself know each and every one of these characters well, but I perfectly understand why the introductions need to be done for those who don't know the universe as well as myself.To round off, I found 'Suicide Squad' to be an extremely enjoyable film. There is nothing truly groundbreaking here, so if that's what you're looking for you will probably be disappointed. Where the film lacks a complex plot it makes up for itself strongly with characters, a wise focus because each and every one of these villains is extremely interesting. If you're going into this film expecting Killer Croc or Katana to steal the show then also be prepared for some disappointment, as the film focuses more on Quinn and Deadshot than the lesser known characters. Regardless, 'Suicide Squad' is still a crazy, insane, fun joyride that asks you to simply sit back and enjoy the show. It's not trying to be complex, it's not trying to blow your mind, it's just trying to give you a good time and for the vast majority of the time, I was extremely content to let the film take me wherever it wanted. Ignore the reviews online and see it for yourself, as long as you sit back and relax you'll have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece, but a great time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a very hyped movie, with a lot of mixed reactions, even when there were no material at all to be shown yet. I notice how a lot of the hate was towards the new joker, played by Jared Leto. And indeed, I was also skeptical about this. He could either ruin the joker, or make it better. What did he do exactly? None of it, actually. Leto's performance in Suicide Squad as the Joker was good. He gave The Joker a new face, and in my truly honest opinion, he did it well. He tried to make it his own. Not replicate or try to live up to other actors that have been playing the joker in previous movies. Now, don't get me wrong, Jared Leto's joker is nothing against Heath Ledger's version. BUT? and I say this once again; he didn't ruin it. That's really my honest opinion. He's not trying to be like Ledger, he's not trying to be something that we've seen before. He's doing something new, and I liked it. Also, for those of you who read the comics, you would actually notice that Jared's take on Joker is close to his persona in the comic book series. I actually wish that he would have had more screen time, since in the entire movie he was in maybe 20 minutes of the actual 2hr film. Now, I read about this final version, and it's said to be cut out a lot and that the director had been working on his own cut, while the studio made their own. So, I can barely wait for the Directors Cut to be coming out. Hopefully, more screen time for Leto will occur and maybe a lot better pacing.Enough talking about Leto; let's talk about the actual film itself. Critics have already been slaughtering the film, giving the film awful reviews and such- The thing is; I don't really trust critics. They are too narrow-minded, they act like they are the only one who's right. I never care about what people, especially critics say about films before I've actually watched them. Then I can look back, and see if I agree with them, based on my personal opinion and interpretation of the movie itself. I can not make you like this film. Just watch the movie yourselves, then judge the film. Many people have been throwing negative reviews on this film, without second thought and some have not even watched the film. This is the worst things about reviews by critics and reviewers on IMDb. You simply cannot trust anyone, including me. So I advise you to watch the film, go back and read my review and see if you agree. That way, you won't miss a move you might have liked. All the actors does a great job portraying their characters, even though Will Smith's performance as Deadshot was a bit? meh. He was funny, though. But it just feels like Will Smith playing? well, Will Smith. The flashbacks in this movie are the best scenes in my personal opinion. They give you a little more depth to the story and makes you sympathize for the characters. As a person who's watched a lot of Superheroes are good, villains are bad-movies, I thought it was refreshing that for once, the villains aren't portrayed as just pure evil. However; this film absolutely has flaws. Loads of them. But rarely any film these days is flawless. There's always going to be something that you can comment on and sometimes even get annoyed by. One thing is the pacing. This film is a chaotic mess when it comes to the pacing, confusing the viewer. Too fast, too slow, but never in between. When introducing the characters, I felt that the music was overused. Every time you met a new character, and this was in quite a short time, a new song would play. However, the soundtrack is good even though it feels a bit out of place. After the mess, called BvS, I am glad to say that this film changes a lot. It shows that DC doesn't always have to make overly serious films, but can have a little fun with it too. While I like Marvel films too, they are sometimes a little bit too cartoony, the humor can feel out of place and well? let's face it, sometimes you need a superhero/villain film for adults. Visually this film is amazing in every way, the amount of detail and wonderful CGI is just pure eye candy. I loved the 3D, although it wasn't quite necessary, but hey, 3D is the standard these days for films in cinema. Overall, I do not think in my own humble and honest opinion that this move deserves the hate from the critics. Most moviegoers, people I know who have seen the film, liked it. It is not a masterpiece. Long way from that. It is not an Oscar winning film by no means. It's just a really fun film to watch and I've gotta say DC is pulling in the right direction. More work needs to be done, though and there is serious problems about this film despite it being enjoyable. Reading some interviews etc, I found that the script was very rushed. (Being finished in six weeks, not okay.) Also, while I laughed and giggled at some of the jokes, some of them felt forced and out of place. However, DC has taken a huge step and I hope they will be making more movies like this one.As a final verdict, I think this movie is worth your time and is a good watch. Don't listen to critics. Heck, don't take my word for granted either. You will love it, or hate it. That's how it works, we have different opinions and tastes. I was not disappointed and I look forward to the next installment in the DC universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A (new) DC disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was curious about this film, as a DC fan. The film belongs to the DC world and is a continuation of the last movie - Batman V Superman. That's why I did have the feeling to watch a series, not a movie. Too many characters tucked in barely two hours of film, however, can not be given to everyone as individuals. Most space (or time) are expected to get Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot, others are gathered crumbs and are presented in retrospectives. Joker I can not like, definitely the worst Joker in history. Too much they tried to squeeze in a film so that a slurry is full of ingredients, but the mixture was not good. The film is incomplete, with a bad story, at times too much CGI effects. If you disallow the brain, maybe you like it or you at least have a little fun. The disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad is a colorful yet a drab movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Came out of Suicide Squad thinking it was a fun movie, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it wasn't fun, but just an extremely poorly made movie. The villain was terrible. I liked her in feral witch mode because she was actually kind of frightening. But once she became Aztacian, was confusing and awfully executed. Cara does a good job with what she is given initially, but the snake like dancing make no sense with what her character is. She seemed like a Shaman wolf in her first "form", almost demonic, but once she is transformed yet again, turns into a seductive Sucubuss, or a snake. Enchantress/Dr. June Moone was already a doctor who turned into an other worldly witch, she didn't need to be a doctor who turned into an other worldly witch who turned into a sexy and even more powerful other worldly witch. It was counter-productive; it goes against what was already established as her character ? as someone who turns into an even more powerful someone. Having her become more powerful by her brother defeats the purpose of having Enchantress being the main villain. He in-fact is the object of her power, and creates nocebo effect in which he is actually is more powerful than Enchantress. The Suicide Squad being more afraid of her brother and not her is a negative idea, as it makes Enchantress the lesser of the two. SHE'S THE VILLAIN, THEY SHOULD BE AFRAID OF HER! She was also terrible because of unclear motivations, and strange and out of character choices like: why did she resort to a sword fight for the final battle when she had incredible magical abilities? Why did she leave her heart in the cave after she realized Waller knew about her or even allowed ARGUS to get ahold of her heart? Why did she have to create a weapon when both her and her brother were gods with the same amount of power as the weapon? Why did she allow Harley Quinn to get in arms reach of a sword when she knew Harley was mentally unstable and was lying about siding with her, she did have telepathic abilities after-all? Viola Davis is a strong actress and is good in the role of Amanda Waller, but had a weak excuse for bringing the Squad together. Her excuse is that there aren't any heroes remaining to take down the next bad Superman, even though we already have Flash, Wonder Woman, and Batman being heroes in this Universe. She's wanting a team of Meta humans, but the only meta human's she recruits are El Diablo and Enchantress. El Diablo refuses to use his powers and Enchantress doesn't even become a member of the Squad. There are major plot holes like: Captain Boomerang is leaving the Squad and is leaving town when the Squad is at the bar, but is in the very next scene standing beside them. He never came back, and he was farther away than the rest of the members. How did Joker survive when he didn't jump out of the helicopter and the nuke hit the back where he was seemingly at? He would've died first come think of it. Then again, Harley was in the helicopter too, how did she survive the initial nuke. I understand she was pushed, but the nuke was aimed right at the Joker and Harley. There were among other plot holes that had ruined the movie.El Diablo is one of the strongest characters, with one of the most effective stories. His backstory highly effects his current actions and is a more positive influence than other characters. The redemption arc presented in this film works well with the overall plot of the film, but does however, get saturated by a simple yet ineffective script. Highlights like this, and the interactions between Harley Quinn and Joker create a veil that elevates the quality of the film. Harley Quinn, another highlight of this movie, is a fun and colorful role that allows Margot Robbie shine in a bland script. At times, jokes and innuendoes seemed forced, but Margot works through these problems and allows her acting to overpower these lines. The Joker on the other hand, has a rougher time overcoming these obstacles, as Jared Leto is often times seen struggling to out power the bad script, but this is more due to David Ayer directing Leto to be more like a psychotic version of Al Capone, when the character was written more like a comic book accurate Joker. A notable scene that shows the contradicting styles is when the Joker is in the middle of the weapons circle telling Frost to find Harley in a menacing glare, then suddenly leans back and creepily laughs. The other problem with Joker is having to few things to do in the film, which leaves a much less desired Joker. With these problems in mind, I look forward to see Joker in future films, and to see how Jared will do under the direction of a more seasoned Ben Affleck.The music was also very jarring, because they blasted the "greatest hits" and drowned out the actors. Editing suffered from the same issues that Batman v Superman endured, quick scenes that would either move too quickly, or jump from one scene to another than back again. It was at times either confusing or disrupted the flow that the scene had already established. Most notable of these was during the final boss fight, in which the editing completely damaged the suspense establishing Harley's motives. Only redeeming thing about the film were the characters, the actors which were just amazing, and setting up the future of the DC Extended Universe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long wait for this movie, I've to admit that it is one of the most disappointments I've ever had in a movie. For the first 30 minutes I didn't feel that the movie had actually begun !!!!, I didn't even know if it was a long flashbacks or the real time-line of the movie is that boring, then suddenly it became a crowded chaos disaster. The characters in my opinion don't fit with the story, and about Amanda Waller she wasn't only a crazy bitch but she was also even worse than the so-called villains or the bad guys, She killed her own team !! the good people just because they weren't supposed to work on such classified data !!! so why did she even bring them ?!!! I think Deadshot and Diablo were the best in that crap.I'll not talk about Harley Quinn or The Joker because I don't want to remember their roles Finally I think the movie wasn't written well and of course not well directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumbled mess from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying I love DC Universe and despite its hate, I thoroughly enjoyed "Batman vs. Superman" and thought it was a pretty solid movie. I can't say the same for Suicide Squad. I was really looking forward to this movie but ultimately felt disappointed when I left the theater. This moving lacks in everything from acting, writing, storytelling, emotion, direction, editing, and even the sound mixing. Suicide Squad simply put is a jumbled mess, especially in the writing and editing department. Scenes are thrown together all over the place. There's no pacing and no proper "arc" to the story. We spend a significant portion of the movie introducing the characters but not enough time actually growing to like any of them. One of the things that really bothered me about the story line and pacing (related to editing as well) is that, there was no real motivation to initially form the Suicide Squad by Viola Davis's character Waller. She just happened to put them together, then immediately following there was a big, terrorist attack by the evil enchantress and her brother. She just then happens to have the Suicide Squad available. Wouldn't have it made more sense for the terrorist attack by the enchantress to motivate wanting to use extremist "bad guys" to fight her and not just conveniently have them? This is but one of many poor areas in both writing and editing of the film where things didn't make sense.Another thing that didn't make sense was Joker's involvement in the story. His character ultimately felt completely pointless to the storyline of this film. I almost feel as if they just threw him into this movie to make people want to see it because it would have the "Joker" attached. I firmly believe the writing, story, and editing would have fit better if they weren't trying to give us some silly and pointless side-plots with the Joker. This movie also spends too much time back-tracking on past events about how the characters go to where they are instead of actually letting us learn who they are by dealing with their predicaments and situations in the movie. I have no real comments about Leto's Joker because his character was ultimately wasted and he never really had his proper place in the spotlight. Furthermore Suicide Squad is way too aggressive in throwing in classic-rock soundtrack anywhere where it seemed fit. I can't believe this is something I have to make a point about, but it's so bad that I have to. I don't mind a solid soundtrack to a film, but Suicide Squad thoroughly abused it. Instead of tastefully throwing in classic soundtrack from time-to-time in an effort to tell the story better, the movie just abuses it, throwing in classic soundtracks wherever it seemed fit. Furthermore, they often use the music in at wildly inappropriate times, and also blasts over dialog to the point where you couldn't hear what the characters were saying. How bad does a AAA-budget Hollywood film have to be to not even have a proper audio-mix? I ultimately felt like this movie was trying too hard to piggyback off of "Guardians of the Galaxy" with the success of their soundtrack instead of trying to be original about it.If you've actually seen this movie, ask yourself the following question; who was the main character of the film? Was it Deadshot? Or Harley Quinn? Or the Mexican guy with fire, or the lizard man? Did you even remember the names of some of these characters if you aren't some die-hard comic book fan? And can you also properly describe some of the characters and why they're important? The point I am making here; the movie is easily forgettable. It failed to tell me a story or make me care about any of these characters. In fact, it made me not care about some of the characters so much, that I either forgot their names overnight or forgot they were even in the movie. Are those the qualities of a good quality, Hollywood film? Now the movie did try in some ways to do this. They gave some backstory to all the characters, especially the big-names like Deadshot played by Will Smith. Will Smith was fighting for his daughter, and wanted to prove he was more than a "piece of crap" serial killer. But other than his character, who did they make us care about? Ultimately this movie is just a big mess. They tried to put too many characters in one film without us actually caring about any of them. This is easily a forgettable movie, which is a shame. It had a lot going for it. The action was solid, the costumes were solid, I liked most of the cast. But the story-line and character development were severely lacking. Follow by the the poor timeline of events followed by the mediocre editing makes this one film, I have to say you should pass on on this one. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really expected more from this movie. I won't spoil anything about the plot. But from the trailer everything has been pretty much about Harley Quinn and the Joker.. BUT the Joker has like no screen time. And what happened to all the jokes they were putting in after seeing Deadpool being such a success.. Lame and boring jokes that made me and the people I went with cringe big time. I won't go lower as 4 as the the rest of the movie was alright. I need to fill out this review with a lot of nonsense because I can't think of anything else to put in to this review. I guess I can talk how the trailer made this movie a masterpiece to what it really is. but Jesus... I want my money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good soundtrack trying to cover a messy script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6/10. A film based on a DC Comic in which we see a group of criminals recruited to take down what no normal person can. Off the bat I would recommend the soundtrack, although a lot of very cool songs put together to try and improve on a messy script and story. Directer David Ayer does quite a good job of showing you and introducing you to who the suicide squad are, but doesn't seem to know what to do with them after that. Will Smith as Deadshot does a fine job as expected by him. Jared Leto is an effective Joker, I actually liked his manner and was creeped out by his laugh, unfortunately he is only a side character and not the big bad. But Margot Robbie steals the show as Harley Quinn, with a superb job. The origin story of how she came about was one of the better parts of the film. Action was OK but a bit lacking. The villain was just boring and didn't seem to have any purpose. Overall a little disappointed but some good acting and a few good scenes pushed this to a 6, which means it was better than BVS, but only just. I really hope DC pulls their socks up.

		<shortDescription>A nice idea executed with slapdash laziness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not nearly as bad as the critics are saying but it's certainly not good. This story about a bunch of misfit outcasts being thrown together feels strangely, thrown together. There have been reports that David Ayer penned the screenplay in just 6 weeks which would go someway to explaining the disjointed nature of the film. It is also common knowledge that there were plenty of re-shoots to ensure that Suicide Squad didn't fall into the pitfalls and traps of Batman vs Superman's overbearing murkiness. The aim was to inject some much needed humour into the caliginous world of the DC universe. Instead we end up with questionable editing and one liners which rarely raise a chuckle, often misfiring completely.A few re-writes and I really think they would've had something here. I really enjoyed the character introductions, with their fast funky visuals and vibrant graphics. The performances mostly range from OK to good, with Jai Courtney surprising everyone with his Aussie Capt Boomerang. It's just a shame the final act is an absolute, wince inducing farce. As are all Harley Quinn and Joker scenes. Leto's joker and Delevingne's Enchantress are the worst things in the film by a mile.I've seen Leto's joker described as 'the worst iteration of the joker so far' which isn't fair, as that would suggest there have been other terrible Joker's in the past. This is the first bad portrayal of the joker I've heard of... and it's woeful.A nice idea executed with slapdash laziness. A baby step up from Batman vs Superman but a step up none-the-less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Executed (no pun intended)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start out with the fact that I am not a huge comic book fan. I have had friends growing up who are super into comic books and who would give me the run down on each super hero movie coming out. I do, however, enjoy a well made Marvel or DC movie that keeps me entertained and throws a curve ball at some point in the movie. Unfortunately, many comic book movies, whether you've read the comics or not, tend to be very predictable. Suicide Squad, however, was unusual in this aspect. It seemed that the movie kept you on the edge of your seat so often, that there was no time for predicting. I believe this movie appealed to the artsy crowd with it's variety of colors and unique animation techniques. That was one thing that stood out to me. And as for the ever-pressing Joker argument... Jared Leto did play an incredibly creepy and uncomfortable Joker. Nonetheless, I do not think anyone will ever surpass the performance put on by Heath Ledger. Leto did well considering what he had to follow up, and perhaps he played a better "comic- book-Joker," but Ledger will forever remain the best Joker in my books. All in all a well written screenplay and well executed plot, with fun characters from Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Despite the plethora of critique, I would recommend Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun summer flick with great characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad may not have lived up to the hype, but that is almost impossible considering the amount of hype there was. Disregarding this, it proves to be a fun entertaining film with great memorable characters and a magnificent score, only weighed down by an average villain and some cheesy dialogue.Most memorable is Will Smith as Deadshot, who does a terrific job in playing a character who is a 'bad guy', yet we can relate to him and his humour and timing is on point, so much so that I hope we see a spin off film with him.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is also great and portrays the character well as does Jay Hernandez as El Diablo and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. Almost all other characters are also well portrayed, with the exception of Katana, who whilst a great character, does not say much to actually give judgement.As for Jared Leto as Joker, whilst in my opinion he plays the role well, differently from others who have portrayed the same character but still interesting, he does not feature in the film enough to come to a definitive judgement, but with more appearances, I am sure he will prove to be even better.So overall I definitely recommend Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad "A secret government agency led by Amanda Waller recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions and save the world from a powerful threat in exchange for clemency."The movie throws you into the action from the start and gives you the run down of each character and how they ended up in government custody. From there it's somewhat of a mixture of stop and go when it comes to action and plot. A lot of DC fan service and another notch cutting deeper into the DCEU (DC Extended Universe). First off, Will Smith's Deadshot was pretty awesome, I had my doubts at first. Margot Robbie as and Jai Courtney delivered as Harley Quinn and Captain Boomerang, the rest of the squad "served their purpose" as far as plot goes. Jared Leto channeled a lot of different portrayals of the Joker, from the Jester to the Gangster and the a little splash of Anarchist, definitely looking forward for more of that!Cara Delevingne's portrayal as Enchantress delivered as an overarching threat and made the stakes of the story believable. Two very well executed Justice League cameos served up as a little hype and anticipation to what Justice League will dish up in 2017. The post credit scene will give DC Fans some more hype to enjoy.Definitely would like to see if they release a Director's Cut and see what the other version of the film looked like.&#x202a;#&#x200e;SuicideSquad2016&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;JanSuperheroMovieReviews&#x202c;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have seen a multitude of superhero movies in recent years, from the ultimate good guys, bad-ass anti-heroes and revisionist takes on the genre. Now there is DC's Suicide Squad, a team of bad-guys who have to do high-risk missions for the American government.Suicide Squad picks up where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice left off. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is a senior government official who wants to create a team of meta-humans to do the dangerous missions. Her recruits include Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). The team is called into action when an incident devastates Midway City and to ensure compliance the members have an explosive device implanted in their necks.Suicide Squad is at best in its early potions when Amanda Warner introduces us to the members of the squad before their recruitment. It was an expository sequence but it was made with energy as it shows the backstories of the members of the squad, showing their rap sheets in brightly coloured text and embracing its comic book source material - there is a great homage to a famous comic book painting by Alex Ross.Warner Brothers went full out when searching for its cast and crew, getting David Ayer to write and direct and forming an all star cast. Will Smith and Margot Robbie got the most attention as Deadshot and Harley - Deadshot display Smith's on screen charisma, a smart mouthed criminal who knows how to play hand when negotiating with gangsters and the government. He was one of the most well defined of all the characters, having a rivalry with Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman), a Special Forces soldier who thinks the hit-man would run off. For fans of Smith you get more of what you like. Robbie was a perfect as Harley Quinn - speaking with exaggerated Brooklyn accent Robbie portrayal was like previous iterations in Batman: The Animated Series and the Batman: Arkham games, being a crazy minx who has unhealthy relationship with The Joker. Hernandez was also a standout as El Diablo, a man who wants to suppress his powers and seek some sort of redemption.Viola Davis and Jared Leto were also great in their supporting roles and hopefully we shall see more of them in the DCEU. Amanda Waller, a Machiavellian woman who would do anything to survive and protect 'national security' - she can become the DCEU's Nick Fury, a woman who does not have any super powers but can handle her own in a world of superheroes and villains. As she says in the film she has a talent for getting people to act against their interest. Leto is a terrific actor, but it was an unenviable task of replacing Heath Ledger as The Joker. Yet he succeeds - Leto's version of The Joker is a cruder and more sadistic character, someone who enjoys violence. The Joker was spurious to the plot, he was only introduced to the film so he can be ready for future DCEU films.Other characters were poorer presentations. Akinnuoye-Agbaje is a huge bloke and physically looks the part as Killer Croc, but the character may as well not have appeared in the film - he was just a thug and had no characteristics. The pitch of voice was lowered too much to be believable and it became distracting. Delevingne was miscast as Enchantress . Her human alter-ego is meant to be an archaeologist, but she looks like barely graduated from High School let alone have a PHD. When Delevingne first appears as Enchantress she had a creepy look to her, having a dark complexion and black smoke whirling around her. When Enchantress has her completed form she becomes less effective - she did jerky dance movements and her voice was dubbed with an older English voice which did not fit. The point was to make Enchantress other worldly yet it did not work.Warner Brothers and DC were aiming to make their version of Guardians of the Galaxy. They go to the point where they have a pop soundtrack like their Marvel rivals and are trying to match its tone. The film works best when it shows the relationships between the villains, delving into their past and the conflict of doing their job and their own self-interest. It made for an interesting twist to the superhero genre. However, after the great start Suicide Squad does not stick to its convictions and goes into familiar superhero territory of stopping a big bad guy trying to make a devastating weapon and the film attempts to give the characters a connection with each other, instead of showing them for what they really are, self-interested villains. The film also suffers from writing and editing problems, one character was introduced just so he could be killed.The problem with the DCEU is it's trying to catch up with the MCU, but by doing that it's trying to do too much too quickly - flooding their franchise with characters without much of an introduction. Marvel Studios were able to play the long game and it benefited the series because all the characters get an introduction and the various sci-fi, fantasy and paramilitary elements. Suicide Squad was a way for the DCEU to quickly introduce their villains (as well as some heroes) and it inexplicitly brings in fantasy ideas like a woman having a sword that captures the souls of the people it kills.Suicide Squad does not deserve some of the bad reviews it has received; it is still an entertaining and more ballsy attempt at a mainstream superhero film - it has a 15 rating in the UK. Its basic heroics plot is nothing new or that inventive, yet it does work changing up some of superhero (or should it be supervillain?) dynamics and it does a fine job at introducing some of the DC villains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainingly eccentric.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype surrounding this deranged blockbuster couldn't have been any higher. The casting was bold, director David Ayer promised to bring his off-kilter style to proceedings and the trailers were downright awesome. That it doesn't quite reach the exceedingly lofty heights many were expecting shouldn't come as a shock, however there's enough fun and flair to ensure this demented romp all but wipes away the disappointment that was Batman v Superman. The tremendously enjoyable first act serves as a crazy meet-and-greet ? with cool character title cards and all ? establishing an excitingly wild tone, although this gradually dampens into something more generic by the bland and uninspired final act. The biggest problem with the last 30 minutes is undoubtedly how rote it feels, the dull CGI villains offering zero thrills and the climactic save-the-world sequence a muddled and dull affair with no ingenuity whatsoever. But what comes before the finale is oh-so-good. It's a rollicking ride of gunfights, swordplay and witty barbs as the titular ragtag group of anti-heroes reluctantly band together to defuse a mystical terrorist attack, or else be killed by the explosive chip implanted in their necks by ruthless government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis hamming it up). An early battle against mindless henchmen culminating in Deadshot (Will Smith) stepping up to single-handedly wipe the horde out is an action-based highlight, closely followed by a daring rooftop escape by Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Speaking of Robbie, she's arguably the standout amongst an overall solid cast, although Smith is as cocky and cool as ever, Jai Courtney is surprisingly excellent as Aussie bank-robber Boomerang and Jay Fernandez is suitably dangerous as walking flamethrower Diablo. The big question though: how does Jared Leto's Joker stack up against past incarnations? His laughing maniac is old-school gangster meets volatile nut-job, an utterly watchable psycho who commands the screen with every sneered line or outrageous cackle. Leto and Robbie share an amazing chemistry on screen, their energetic and erratic relationship ? a comic-book version of Bonnie and Clyde if you will ? is a ticking time bomb of death and destruction, which is why their limited time together is a crime. Not the mind-blowing film it could've been, but with one of the best soundtracks this side of a Tarantino flick and a wickedly cavalier attitude to accompany a wickedly cavalier group of (bad) good guys, Suicide Squad is an entertainingly eccentric entry into the DC Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Another sci-fi superhero fantasy that follows the formula alright but just isn't super.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: A band of rowdy misfits battle evil forces.JIM'S REVIEW: Bad is good. Let me re-phrase that...bad is kinda good. David Ayer's well-made but dull Suicide Squad is essentially a war film with "flying men and monsters", including a wicked woman who is "a whole lotta of pretty and a whole lot of ugly". There is a lot of chaos on screen, but most can be found in the film's muddle of a script. Its characters are "bad to the bone", but so is the weak screenplay.Is it as bad as most critics are saying? No...absolutely not, but it is not as good as it could have been. With a better script and a better villain (more on that later), the film could have been an all-out hit. The backstories of these misfits are the most entertaining parts of the film and Mr. Ayer's introduction of these personalities is concise and affecting. But his action sequences generally disappoint, with sub-par CGI and in-your-face rootin'-tootin' shoot-outs and gunfire, the kind of violence without consequences. Some of the jokes between the killer crew land, most don't. Much destruction and mayhem is present without the blood splatter and body count. (Still, the film's PG-13 rating is highly questionable.) The film also has little originality. It's more piecemeal of other films of this genre; some good (The Avengers series, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ghostbusters) and some bad (Sucker Punch, Green Lantern, Fantastic Four). It takes a worn-out premise from westerns (The Magnificent Seven, The Hateful Eight) and war films (The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds, the director's very own, Fury) of assembling a rowdy bunch of bad-asses to do the dirty work and save the world.Still the director continues to be a promising talent. (His 2014 film, Fury, made my Top Ten list for that year. It was a superior film with strong performances and excellent production values.) However, this offering lacks the latter but does have the former. Fortunately, Mr. Ayer has cast his film very well. So let's talk about some of the film's assets, primarily the four lead actors' performances. Will Smith as Deadshot, a hit man with perfect aim, aims perfectly with his character and gives one of his best and most believable performances in a long while. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, a mercenary soldier in charge of the squad, brings gravitas and vulnerability to his character. Viola Davis delivers the menace in large portions. But the real scene-stealer is Margot Robbie as the deranged Harley Quinn, a Kewpie doll who packs a wallop. Her acting has great nuance and she underplays the hammiest of lines. This just may be the breakout role the actress needs to become a big star and she is electric, the perfect fanboy fantasy. (This gifted actress is making a nice resume with her role choices.) The problem with Suicide Squad is the rest of the pack aren't that interesting and are sketchy and poorly drawn (again, the fault of the script). The actors in these parts are good enough, especially Jay Hernandez as the fiery conflicted Diablo, and an underused Jared Leto as The Joker. Yet the other characters, as written, are largely forgettable: Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). The balancing act of bringing all of these marauders together becomes a jumble of forced equal screen time. Less would have been more.Beside a sub-standard screenplay (written by the director himself), the other major hurdle is the film's villain entitled The Enchantress, a laughable Mati Hari-type vixen that shimmies and gyrates and may radiate powerful gamma rays but displays no conflict or personality, let alone posing as a real threat. Without a real baddie at the center of the turmoil, the film has no sense of jeopardy or tension. The actress playing her, Cara Delevingne, rarely enchants, but she does keep a straight face throughout the film so that alone is a credit to her profession.Suicide Squad is not quite dead on arrival, as most reviewers might have you think. Due to some fine acting and some of Mr. Ayer's images, it does have a steady pulse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great fun comic book film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been getting mixed reviews to say the least and I have now seen suicide squad and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees a group of super villains assembled by the U.S. government to take down a supernatural entity. When will smith was cast as deadshot not everybody was happy but I can tell you that he is fantastic in this film. He managed to bring the extra layer of complexity needed for the character but also the charisma and humour that you would expect from will smith. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was born to play the role, she fits it so well. She is clearly crazy but also so charming and charismatic that you want to see more of her. She is beautiful and funny and alongside deadshot is probably the best thing in this film. Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller in this film and she is great, she truly nails the harshness of the character and how morally grey she is. Joel kinnamin plays rick flagg and I actually thought he did a good job with his character definitely developing throughout the film. The real surprises of the film were the characters of el diablo and captain boomerang played by jai Courtney. First of all el diablo is one of the most interesting characters in the film and I liked his powers. I am not a huge fan of Courtney as an actor but I thought he was the perfect choice for boomerang in this film, he brought the snarky fun that his kind of ridiculous character merits and I thought he was great. And finally to Jared leto as the joker, I thought he was great in the film and delivered a different but fun performance. Its just he wasn't in the film anywhere near enough and he felt incredibly underutilised. The story has some decent character depth involved as these villains try to atone for some of their sins. However, the plot is just paper thin and incredibly bland with there not being much uniqueness to the storytelling here. The script has some really great humour easily the best of the dc extended universe films. But it also knows how to use dramatic moments to make you care about the majority of the characters. The style of the film has some good action scenes especially with the unique weapons used by the squad. However, the film has clear paving issues by finding it hard to introduce everybody and keep the film cool. The awful cgi really cheapons the villain plot as well. Overall I really enjoyed suicide squad and it is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>chaotic fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have gotten into the habit lately (maybe rightly or not) of walking into movies with pretty low expectations (see Tarzan review) however both times this has happened I have had a great viewing experience.I get the feeling,although not easily swayed that the negativity that many big releases are getting these days pre release is so overwhelming that it becomes hard to focus solely on the movie itself.Bottom line is that the haters may have written off Suicide Squad already and on some points maybe they are right to but having seen it 2D without gimmicks and so on it is well directed and pretty well acted for the most part.The characters are darkly fun and I love the villain twist.I never got bored and loved the Joker (hope he returns) and for 2 hours or so had a really great time watching a popcorn flick which entertains.IMO it delivers the blockbuster side of the deal,but on the flip side the negatives are,sloppily set up,no real tension on building the team,first 45 minutes pretty crude and messy with no real narrative which has any cohesion and "emotional" scenes when they occur feel slightly shoe-horned in and not massively convincing.Best performances.Margot Robbie,Jared Leto,Viola Davis as Amanda Waller and Jai Courtney who knows about handling a boomerang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I love Batman V Superman (both cuts, with the Ultimate one being superior), and I have to say that this is the weakest link in the establishing DCEU so far.The Editing. Quite funny, considering if done right, you don't even notice the editing in the final product. However, anytime it's bad - it's noticeable. And boy, bad editing stands out in this one. It makes a few sequences look really out of place, like shoehorned in. Whoever did the job needs to seriously punished.Lack of the Joker. Seriously, you hired an Oscar-winning guy to play the Clown prince of crime, basically were promoting entire film with him... aaand you cut out maybe 50 % of his scenes. Seriously, the hell is wrong with you, WB? Leto as Joker was fine, I think, based on those few scenes we got, but the exact lack of those didn't convince me that he is better than late Ledger. Which is unfortunate, because I was looking forward to Leto becoming the final Joker. This is essentially my biggest gripe - not enough of Joker. When I think about it, he is pretty much pointless to the ..."plot" of the film. Makes no impact, whatsoever.The plot. It was going to be simple, sure. I mean, so was Mad max Fury Road and look good that one turned out to be. BvS was aiming for greatness, and say what you want about it, it reached the epic of the clash of the World's finest. Suicide Squad? Basically makes fun of itself, which is NOT the way to go. First half is the actual team-up process, with all the origins stories, setting up and introducing each member. Other half is trying desperately to catch up to the rest of the story and offers very little suspension. There are a lot of plot devices just to make the story moving forward, and that's cheap. Don't get me started on the final fight between the Squad and the main villain - it was retarded. Like, Marvel-level retarded. The Antagonist. Haven't delivered, not one bit. You see all that build-up, expositions of how damn strong he/she is, showing off all them sweet powers and abilities, rendering the villain almost Superman-level OP. His/her plan is silly, with no real reasons to do that, it just happens, and you kinda go with it, because the film itself is entertaining, but.. that just ain't enough.Some members of the Skwad. are beyond useless and out of place. The one is there only just to serve as a comedic relief, another one is wasted in like first 5 minutes after the team is deployed into action (I know it's in the cannon, but this is a film - act like you give a damn), and some other that is seriously underused and looks like he is there just to do that one thing the plot requires in order for the Skwad to succeed.The Music. I was afraid this would be an issue, and I called it. The whole film made an impression of a 2-hour MTV music-video-mash-up. It was refreshing for the first 40 minutes, but then it keeps on going and going, playing another tune after another, with no particular need, it's just there to "lighten-up" the mood of the film - I call bullshit. On the other hand, the movie made a damn good job of making me guess all of the classic hits from the past, so props for that!Batman cameos. You are going to see Batman from a different perspective, they said. You will get to experience the fear and thrill the bad guys experience when they see The Bat show up, they said. None of that happens. You get regular "Batman interacting with the bad guys" sequences, that do NOT stand out. Another wasted potential.The pluses are: visuals - those are top-notch (obivously, Mr. Snyder was involved as an exec. producer)Deadshot, Harley, Joker (given the screen time he had..), Amanda Waller (you are going to hate her.. A LOT. Makes Nick Fury from the friendly Marvel neighbor look like one-eyed tooth-fairy), El Diablo (surprisingly enough, he is the MVP during the last 30 minutes), soundtrack (good choice of tracks and spot-on timing) and that's pretty much it.Final thoughts. It is obvious that for some reason, this film turned out to compete with the Guardians of the Galaxy instead of being full-scaled dark action thriller with formidable Bad Guy, bad-ass team that gets stuff done, supervillains acting like..you know, supervillains (not some wanna-be heroes they ARE NOT), and an occasional one-liner here and there for the healthy laugh. Instead we got the DCEU version of GoTG with far more music and far less chemistry. I still liked this film, took it for what it was. It just didn't deliver. The entire mid-credit scene was somewhat good, but at the same time unnecessary. Bottom Line: Batman V Superman remains on the top of the DCEU (and entire comic-book films genre for me) food chain. Here's hoping that Patty Jenkin's "Wonder Woman" will be better (which for now seems like will happen) and that the Justice League will be the best comic book film ever made, finally topping The Dark Knight.Interesting fact: Zack Snyder directed Flash's cameo scene in this film - one of the good parts of the Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is super fun. Im gonna make it short, as everything probably been said many times. I was not fond of Will Smith being cast as Dead Shot, that's who i had in mind after watching the actor in Arrow. But Will Smith is so charismatic and fun he made me forget all about it. Marggot Robbie as Harley Quinn is just awesome. Even Jai Courtney is very good at Boomerang. Actually my only complain with this character is that there is not enough of him !!! lol The story is basic sure, but it work. Lots of great action. Look although i did like Deadpool, i tough this movie was even better, yeah no jokes.My only big problem with the movie is i am not a fan of Pimp Joker. I mean the actor did a great job with what he had to work with, but the look is completely off. Joker should NOT be tattooed, no matter if once in the comic he was or whatever. The street gang metal teeth look ridiculous too. But Jared Leto has the face for it tough, make up wise and hair colour, that was good. His acting was convincing.So yeah i had tons of fun with Suicide Squad, gonna buy it when it comes out on DVD for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is imperfect, yet fun. A great time at the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third installment in the DC Extended Universe, "Suicide Squad", was almost an antithesis of the movies before it. Director David Ayer was clearly taking notes when people were criticizing "Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice". This movie goes out of its way to create new characters that you could truly care about, even at a small level. Will Smith and Margot Robbie managed to fully embody the characters from the comics they are based off of, while also bringing something new to the table. And of course, there is the matter of Jared Leto's Joker. This was first portrayed on the silver screen in 1966. However, 50 years later, Jared Leto manages to make all of the viewers feel as if they are watching a brand new character. He makes no attempts to stack up against Nicholson or Ledger. He creates a character all his own. To the movie critic, this movie may seem imperfect. Many filmmakers would have did this movie very differently. However, to the comic book fan and the average moviegoer, this movie did very well. It is a fun movie, and to sit down and watch this movie is just a treat. If you watch this, expect action and laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Balances the cast well, but struggles with minor problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the rocky start to the DCCU (Man of Steel &amp; Batman v Superman) was really making people doubt DC's attempt at a cinematic universe. However, after watching Suicide Squad, I can say that my faith in this universe is still intact. I enjoyed the entirety of it, especially how they were able to balance all of these characters pretty well in one two hour film. Will Smith was very enjoyable as a new Deadshot, El Diablo was likable, and the effects that they used for the characters with visual effects (Enchantress, El Diablo, &amp; Killer Croc) were all well done. I also appreciated the twisted character that was Captain Boomerang, the authentic take on Katana, and Jared Leto's twisted Joker.Story-wise, it makes sense that Waller would have to organize this team to save the world from the Enchantress and her brother's magical stuff, but if it wasn't for the humor I think the whole fight-a-major-villain-with-a-very-large-army trope has been overdone. It makes me think if having a few grounded 'bad guys' fight the Squad would have been better instead of an overly powerful 6000 year old creature.The only thing that sorta bothered me was Margot Robbie's Harley. I liked how Harley's words and outfits were inspired by the character's past, but I would have to say that the creators should have put more effort in developing her fun &amp; dangerous side, which we saw sporadically across the film, instead of putting so much effort into focusing on her beauty. Nevertheless Robbie did a good job.I'm a huge Arrow fan (or was) and was kind of disappointed that they removed their version of the SS from the show, but I'm happy that a more faithful adaption has been brought to life.Oh yeah and I loved that the Flash and Batfleck made an appearance! The little ways they are branching out the universe is really awesome. I would give this film a 8/10 based on minor mistakes and my love for DC comics. Special shoutout to Karen Fukuhara as Katana &amp; Viola Davis as Amanda Waller! We got an intimidating take on the character who spoke Japanese full time! Waller was actually scary unlike the CW version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining comic book action film, well worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this film I was already aware of the Suicide Squad. I've had brief glimpses of some of the old and the new squads, and have also seen the animated version (which is definitely worth checking out by the way).So, onto the film. I felt that the pacing was good, as at no point during the film did I feel bored. The story, such as it was, progressed at a good pace and never really gave me a chance to stop and think, which may have been a good thing as it was not overly deep or original. However, this is a comic book film, so I wasn't exactly expecting a highbrow masterpiece in terms of story, but the action scenes were enjoyable and kept the film moving along.The characters were introduced through exposition, which would normally be written off as lazy, but was appropriate in this film in the context it was used. I'm not going to talk about the individual changes to characters compared to the comics as there are always going to be differences; I'll leave that to the fans to bicker about.In my opinion, you were given enough information about each character to get a sense of their motivations and capabilities (very similar amounts to characters in films like The Magnificent Seven and The Dirty Dozen, and you never hear complaints about them). Some people may complain about the number of characters, but those same people won't question the amount in Game of Thrones?The two main characters, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, were both portrayed well by Margot Robbie and Will Smith respectively. You'll probably hear a lot about how little of Jared Leto's Joker was in the film, which people are chalking up as a negative, however, I'd be disinclined to agree. The Joker should never be a main character in a film where Batman is not also the main character, and in this film, Ben Affleck's Batman was hardly present (again, not a negative thing).This film is about Amanda Waller's Task Force X (the Suicide Squad), who was played very well by Viola Davis (Waller is definitely not someone to be messed with), and this film establishes them as 'The Other Guys'; the ones you call when the Justice League are too busy, and the ones that the government has near total control over.If you enjoy films like The Magnificent Seven or The Dirty Dozen, and also happen to like comic book films, then I really think you'll enjoy this. People are far too quick to compare this to Marvel's misfit offering, Guardians of the Galaxy (which is an excellent film by the way, you should watch it!), when better comparisons are to the two films I just mentioned. Don't get sucked into the Marvel vs DC debate; it's OK to like both!(Review from my blog: whingewood.wordpress.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't Get The Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story? There is no story. And that's what's refreshing about this movie. It's pure entertainment, in the sense of "Voltron," "A-Team" or "G.I. Joe" which is putting together a unit of absolute bad-a$$es to do something. Does it matter what it is? No.I'm so sick and tired of political messages jammed into Marvel movies (I think comic book movies on DC &amp; Marvel are dumb to begin with). They happen to be the most offensive of the two. I suppose THIS constitutes what the world enjoys now...supposedly. Or the PC police critics.I can't begin to tell you how nice it is NOT to have social agendas in a movie and just...have fun. The hate may stem from the people who love these characters in the book. I can't justify any of it, since I don't read the funny pages, but it seemed to anger a lot of fans of the characters. Personally, Leto's Joker is...too comical for the grit of this movie. He's not as bad as you want him to be or as fun as Nicholson made him out to be. The Ledger Joker was...let's be real, the guy was fishing for recognition. But...it is what it is...entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although i don't think the Suicide Squad was as good as BvS, it was still a really fun time and it definitely enriched the DCEU as a whole. I think that in general the positive aspects of the movie made up for the not so positive aspects. Most of the performances were A+++. Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Viola Davis killed it. Jared Leto was fine as Joker and i would like to see more of him but i would prefer it if it was always in connection to Harley Quinn. Not as a main villain. Cara Delevinge's acting was weak and i am glad that her storyline has closed for good (hopefully). The team dynamics were great. I thoroughly enjoyed Harley's and Deadshot's ''blooming friendship''. And i believe they will be the fan favorites since they were the ones who got a solid backstory and got scenes throughout the movie that helped you to feel for them. I would have liked to see more of Katana. She was cool but the movie did not help me understand her motivations. I did not have that many problems with the editing. Only in the beginning during the character introductions, the scenes were not flowing so smoothly the one after the other. But after the team assembled it was okay. It is true that the villain was the main negative aspect of the movie. Cara's acting did not help but i believe that in an introductory movie they should have gone with a smaller scale villain. Little less on the supernatural side and more comprehensible. Otherwise they should have devoted a little more time in who Enchantress is, her backstory and her relationship with Rick (because i was supposed to care about their romance too). I understand ofc that using the Enchantress made for a really impressive final battle scene. I did enjoy that very much. The visuals were fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly. You should go watch it for yourself and decide yourself. The movie seems to be very decisive. Me personally. I loved it. It was fun. It had heart. And the action and soundtrack was riveting. The story could have been better but as far as a superhero movies goes. It's on par with the usual. Evil wants to take over. And a group of rag heroes or anti heroes in this case has to stop it. Nothing overly complex. But most superhero movies really aren't. Great cast that seem to engage well with each other. Good cgi. I'll definitely watch it again. And I really hope for a sequel. The possibilities are quite interesting with this story line. But I've seen some reviews completely bashing this movie for doing things that any other movie gets praised for. You'd have to be a fool to think the story was too messy to understand. It was straight forward. Editing was a bit choppy in the middle but nothing that puts you off the movie. And people don't seem to know how the rating system works. Giving it 1 star in the hopes of just bringing down the score. When it's obvious this movie doesn't deserve anywhere near 1 star. This isn't the avatar the last air bender movie. Sad really considering this movie is definitely worth the price of a ticket. And it has the necessities of an above average summer blockbuster. Go watch it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In some bizarre way, this film just clicked for me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that the reviews for this film were less than stellar so I was not sure what to expect. The reviews for Batman V Superman were not so good either, but I enjoyed that one and I am happy to say I enjoyed this one too. In fact, I thought it was more enjoyable than Batman V Superman. I cannot explain why, but it just really worked for me for some completely unknown and strange reason. Perhaps, it simply worked well with the myriad of mental issues I have and it blended well to form some sort of connection with my warped brain. I just do not know, but I am glad I enjoyed it as I took a gamble to see it in theaters and I would hate to shell out money for tickets and not like it. Not only did I like it, but the other two people I was with enjoyed it as well. It was not without its problems, which is why I give it a nine rather than a ten, but most of the issues are in the opening portion of the film. Once the squad is together and in the field the movie is off and running and it is nearly nonstop action the rest of the way.The story starts out with a woman with a plan to bring together a team of meta humans and those with special skills to combat any threat from a superhuman. Basically, it picks up where Batman V Superman left off and Superman is dead so not only is he not around anymore there is always the chance that another like him turns up and perhaps this one will not be as friendly. Well, we are introduced to the candidates who are criminals for the most part. There is Deadshot, an assassin for hire, Harley Quinn the Joker's insane partner in crime, Killer Croc, Diablo master of flames, Boomerang and a mysterious woman who is possessed by a being known as the Enchantress. Well that last one turns out to be a huge mistake as she releases her brother and together they hatch a plan to take over the world. The team of criminals are assembled and forced to help a special teams unit as in Escape From New York and are led by Rick Flagg who is joined by a girl named Katana. They must enter the city and retrieve someone important, but the Joker is tracking their movements as he tries to take Harley back! The actors and actresses all do a good job. I especially enjoyed Will Smith's Deadshot as he is probably one of the few people that can make an assassin for hire a sympathetic character. I also enjoyed Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. A lot of people have been complaining about the amount of screen time Jared Leto's Joker received, but I thought how was presented worked as he is not a member of the team, he is just someone trying to get his girlfriend back and does so in strange ways. He was almost like Micheal Keaton as Beetlejuice, not really in the film for very long, but he made an impact any time he was on screen. The main problem I had with the film was the first portion of the film as it was at times, a bit hard to follow. The characters are introduced, but then it flashes here and there; however, this stops once the team is dispatched and after that it is almost all action the rest of the way.So it was not a perfect film and from all the negative reviews it is not going to be a beloved film by everyone. That being said I really enjoyed it. The music clicked for me, the characters clicked for me and the action was great and kept me entertained. That is all I can ask for. It also sets up next year's Justice League film which I saw a trailer for and it sadly had almost the same amount of humor in it than the entirety of Batman V Superman. The trailer was like two minutes long so that should say something. This film, too, had some more comedy and at the same time dark so it melded really well. I would love to see these characters turn up again in another Suicide Squad film or in other films in the DC movie universe as they really made the film work for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Not Bad A they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is definitely Fun to watch! I, along with my friends enjoyed the Humour inserted all though some of the dialogues showed that they tried pushing the humour... I loved Joker, Harley Quinn, Headshot as well as El Diablo! I enjoyed the animated Killer Croc. All though I have had mixed feeling about Enchantress i still was disappointed about the enchantress's Brother being animated. Also pushing deadshot as thinking about his Daughter was definitely not working for me or any of my friends... I am happy about seeing Batman. The movie was of great pace.... the action sequence was fun! I enjoyed so many things. David Ayer definitely made the Dark DC theme very appealing!! The dancing fire in El diablo was so cool!! i definitely Love the movie so did my friends! Its not a super awesome movie, but definitely a treat for the eyes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly enjoyable movie with a few flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually really enjoyed this movie, definitely a step up from the disappointing BvS. Yes, the movie wasn't perfect. Some characters, primarily Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang and Slipknot weren't given that much character development or set-up, but I do think Croc and Boomerang were enjoyable characters to watch nonetheless. The way the film looks is astonishing in my opinion, the score is great, the acting is quite good overall, but I do agree the editing is choppy at times and does detract from the finale in particular. Deadshot and Harley Quinn were standouts for me, including El Diablo, who made for a surprisingly compelling character. The villain(s) definitely could've been given more weight but this certainly isn't anything we haven't seen in a DC or Marvel movie, typical villain that wants to destroy the world, nothing new but they certainly weren't awful in my opinion, they simply left a lot to be desired in terms of, well, good writing I suppose, if you'd even count the other villain as a villain at all.In regards to Leto's joker, I thought it was a little too brief but at the same time I understand that if he'd been in the movie for too long, he'd detract from the relatively, 'lesser known' characters. But my yearning for more from him is testament to how much, to my surprise, I enjoyed his portrayal of the character. He was a different Joker, which I appreciate, although definitely not on the same level as Ledger's joker.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect. But very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the "savior" of DC films. So far I've liked both MOS and BvS but it's more likely than not that I'm in the minority. Out comes Suicide Squad and though it's not a home run that's gonna turn the game around, it's a solid hit. It has comedy that doesn't feel forced (looking at you Civil War) it doesn't jeopardize the character's villainous demeanor to make them more likable but they don't exploit the bad guy cliché either to a point where you can't relate to them unless you're pure evil. It's got some heart warming moments. The action is insane. Shaky cam a bit annoying sometimes, tho. Leto's Joker works but it's not as "Joker-y" as I guess most people expects. There are certain scenes where you kinda expect more to happen but yet it unfolds in quite a satisfying rhythm. Waller... *shivers* The villain was not that great. All skwad member have their moment to shine. It's got some pleasant surprises. The soundtrack is amazing!!! I'll definitely watch it again. I implore all of you, if you wanna watch it, do it. Don't let the critics influence your decision. Don't expect the movie to be perfect either and expand your perspective. You might not love it but you might at least enjoy the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Has Great Characters Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this movie is a great show of characters and characters interations. They are the ones that make this movie. The movie starts with Waller introducing the characters through a sequence of montage. Notably are Deathshot's and Harley's. Boomerang's sequence is good too, especially because it gives us The Flash. Then you got to El Diablo and Killer Croc and the sequences almost bore me, until the movie really starts with the main villain resurrected and wreaking havocs. Then the team is assembled and we go into over drive. Along the way, friendships are made, notably Deadshot and Flag's tense-filled camaradie. Harley and Deadshot's almost flirt each other, but Harley's heart is still with The Joker. Deadshot has many great action sequences, notably when he makes the last man standing atop a car, mowing down the black goo zombies. But he feels more like Will Smith than Deadshot to me. Arrow's Deadshot is the better portrayal. Harley has many opportunities to show her antiques and psychotic quirks, but her intelligence still shows. She is described as even more psychotic than Joker. She and Deadshot carry the movie.The other character that surprisingly shines is El Diablo. Starting as reluctant to show off his power, his action sequences make key moments in the movie possible. Even his remorse and his guilt shows through his acts in the movie.I was expecting Captain Boomerang to be a joke character, but he actually becomes the something more. He always tries to find ways to cut ties with the group, with smart quips and whisperings, but in the end he tags along. Killer Croc and Katana both suffer from poor screen times. The times they are on the spotlight are spent nicely though, as they have their own crucial moments that move the plot forward in the movie, especially Croc and his ability to swim fast and long underwater.Flag and Enchantress are the plot devices of the movie, but they are portrayed nice enough, especially Enchantress and her swift madness.The only thing I hate about this movie is actually the Joker's antics. It feels that he shouldn't in the movie this much, especially sabotaging things the way he does and just get away like that. Waller should have find ways to make him part of the operations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, fun film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing this film, if you love the comic book movies whether it be Marvel or DC then you will love this film. I was going in with lower expectations after reading the critics reviews but honestly they must take their job far too seriously as it was a fun film with great action. All the actors played their parts well, especially Will Smith and Margot Robbie. This film also has a great soundtrack and the music suits the scenes perfectly. If there was some criticism it would be that there wasn't really a proper villain. Sometimes the CGI was a little off (you will notice this) but it isn't a great problem. It would also have been good to have some more chemistry throughout the movie, like the bar scene. However, I just recommend watching the film and forming your own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Review: The Real Highlights and Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was really well done! It was brilliantly choreographed and put together. Amanda Waller was one of the highlights, her performance flawless and terrifying all at once. I want to see a lot more of Katana and Boomerang going forward, though I do think that Boomerang's unicorn fetish was unnecessary humour. He'd have stood well as a character perfectly without adding that in, and still maintained the comedic touch in the movie. That said, the movie does keep a comedic touch. And the interaction of Harley and Batman was well done. I know there were people saying that the biggest laugh comes from Batman punching Harley, and I don't know what theater they were sitting in, because that didn't happen where I was. Instead you get a Harley who's clearly dangerous even though she can't swim, and the CPR scene is clearly manipulated by Harley to make Batman uncomfortable. A great deal of the characters is shown through nuances, which unfortunately, critics were so quick to be critical of because, as always, they don't know the source material and thus don't actually understand why the fans would enjoy the movie. On that note, Harley Quinn was perfectly executed and I don't understand the clamoring fight about sexism or inaccurate portrayals. It's like nobody knew her character before going in. Harley's clearly mentally ill, her love for the Joker is difficult, but it's in no way stripping her of her agency, and all of this depicted in the movie. She's not ready to completely walk away from him yet, but the foundations for that are being laid out in this movie, and frankly, it would have been an injustice to her character if she left the Joker within her first appearance. The critics arguing that she loses her cleverness are clearly not watching the same movie, because from where I stand, Harley managed not only to escape, but she makes her own decisions and keeps her agency and games the system, with help, of course, but that's more than anyone else manages. The second half of the movie when the team bonds I think could have been expanded on, and actually, all this movie needed was ten extra minutes of footage, simply of team scenes, to really give it that edge and make you relate to the characters as a team. The movie was very much a character driven experience, and I do think in all honesty, you want to see more of the characters, the Squad in general. However, as a movie setting up the DCCU, it did just that. You got a taste of Miller's Flash, you got a taste of the villains of the DCCU, you got to see the entire reaction to Superman from the lingering aftermath of BVS and it did what it set out to do. It's not the movie that's going to change lives, it's not an Oscar-winner, and it's not trying to reinvent a genre. It's paving a way to a larger continuum of movies to come, and that's perfectly fine. For it's goal, it achieved that. It leaves you wanting more out of these characters. Diablo and Deadshot took the movie as well, which, Deadshot certainly got quite a lot of focus, but Diablo creeps up on you, and his story plays off so well against Deadshot's story, because it's two similar yet opposite results, and you get the humanity of both of them and genuinely enjoy what they have to offer. Either way, this movie was great, it made me genuinely excited for the DC projects coming up, and I can see Margot carrying her own Harley Quinn movie, I can see Deadshot, Katana, Boomerang, Croc returning to the universe that's being established and I hope, going forward, we get more of these characters. The only real cons, In my opinion, were Rick Flagg's entire relationship with June Moon, which, while it gave Amanda Waller's tactical brilliance a point, it's never really developed and falls flat as far as expanding either of their characters. June Moon was never really developed and explored and you just don't quite feel for her struggle. She just, exists. And is mostly forgotten about. As a whole, the villain was was alright. They had the grandiose drama and flair and fit with the "kill the world" vibe. It wasn't a memorable villain, by far, and is rather similar to Apocalypse. They exist solely to show you how a team can come together, and to riff off the skills of the actual Squad. The villain could have been anyone else and the movie would have been just fine. The other con is that the team bonding, towards the end, feels rushed. They suddenly become a team, but, again,. I was also disappointed with the hype that surrounded Scott Eastwood's mystery character and the way it just fell flat in the movie, but I'd definitely re-watch Suicide Squad and enjoy it. I think the negative criticism actually helped the movie, on another note, because I don't think it would have lived up to the entire hype it generated to begin with. Leto's Joker doesn't exist on his own, but rather, he's a supporting man in Margot's story. The villain is forgettable. The movie should have instead marketed itself as an introduction to some amazing characters outside of the popular ones. But with the negative criticism, most people will find themselves pleasantly surprised and a bit confused as to what the fuss was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great characters, not so great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I got back from from the screening of "suicide squad" and I have a couple of things to say about it. For me it was a fun Summer blockbuster movie, with many flaws, but also a lot of good sides to it. First of I want to point out that it's not really the movie that deserves this score, but the actors and their portrayals of the characters. ACTORS: First of all, like everyone says, there is no better actress than Margot Robbie to play the role of Harley Quinn. She's funny, sexy and of course crazy. William smith really plays his role very well. Deadshot being as badass as he is and with a nice background story to fill his persona. The guy playing Diablo is also very cool and he plays his role very well. Then you have Jared leto as "The Joker". I guess I can't really judge his role, because I haven't really seen him a lot in the movie. Leto's portrayal is so much different from what we're used to, that I'm still getting used to him. But it was very intriguing, so hopefully we'll see him in a next movie if he decides to play the role again (seeing the bad reviews and all..). Than lastly I want to talk about Captain Boomerang portrayed by Jay Courtney. I really liked this role. He was so funny and I really don't understand the fuzz about him playing the role. Every time he was doing something stupid, everyone laughed in the cinema. He added real charisma to the character, which I really liked.For me, the rest of the cast really didn't matter to me, because I didn't like their character or the actors playing them.STORY:I really enjoyed the first hour of the movie. Actually most scenes in the beginning and the prison I thought were really good, but the last half hour is what made this movie going from a score from perhaps 9 to 7. WB PLEASE UNDERSTAND: we don't f*cking care about CGI in a movie. yes sometimes it's fun, but movies nowadays waste their money on these graphics, instead of gathering a couple of people who know these characters to make a great movie. Sometimes I really wonder. Does WB ask fans what they think about the script before going into production or they just give these production chances to directors who think they are fans ??? KILLER CROC ?? what happened to that guy. Why is he wearing a f*cking jacket. He is supposed to be big, mean and above all a CANNIBAL. Give him a good story=&gt; boy gets disease, One day he takes a bath, mom finds out, she tries to scrub hiss quills away, until he bleeds, he gets bullied in school and then eats a hand from a classmate and so his dark persona begins. The killer croc in the movie wasn't the one I expected. But then again when I saw him on the poster I already knew that this wasn't really Killer CrocCAMEO'S: There are some cameo's in this movie. Critics are saying that they don't matter. So every time Stan lee comes into a Marvel movie, it means something, gimme a break !!! I liked the cameo's, so more of that please.Main conclusion:Write a story about these characters, get deeper into their emotions. The main villain shouldn't be a CGI villain or some big aura in the sky. Make it a well known DC villain with machiavellistic persona (like the joker, penguin,...) STORY STORY STORY. ASK FANS what they think about the story, listen to their advice and then start production. I really hate CGI, because despite the "cool" effects it brings, it's so fake. If I want CGI I 'll just play a game. CGI is the cancer that is killing movies nowadays. BTW loved the soundtrack and it really doesn't remind me of Guardians of the Galaxy. Not everything should be linked to Marvel (also a fan).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, worth the time but not flawless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!! You Have been warned! Suicide squad; arguably one of the most awaited movies of 2016. The hype was surreal ever since the trailers went out earlier this year. But after months of waiting,sitting through 2 and half hours of the movie, was the hype all worth it? In short, Yes! The movie is unlike a typical superhero movie where average Joe discovers superpowers, defeats the super villain and restores peace in the lovely city of movie world. No! It's about a group of outlawed super-humans who are used as weapons to fight against terrorism. A band of bad guys fighting a common enemy; kinda sounds like the DC version of the Avengers, but with.... well.. bad guys!! And the super villain? well she's just bad ass; a powerful, eerie witch seeking revenge against humankind. The enchantress and her brother were so powerful that the only superhero(from the squad) that could take them head on was Diablo, that too in his most powerful form. And the character was beautifully portrayed by Cara. Talking about characters, I loved Harvey Quinn; she had a nice balance between insanity and sanity, which is fitting considering her backstory. Others were pretty good too. But the joker, After Heath Ledger, in "The Dark Knight", I have to say I expected a bit more insanity from Jared as the Joker. Some minor things; I loved how each character had their own backstory, loved the cameos from Batman and The flash and.. well.. Superman's Coffin; and some of the minor plot twists in the movie made it lively.Now for the things that could've made the movie better. First of all, the plot is really "A snake biting its own tail". Out of nowhere, they make a task force out of these "outlaws", along with the strongest one; "The Enchantress". She is initially under their control, but then she escapes and tries to bring an end to human-kind. So, it was basically a story about trying to make something, making a mistake, and using that something to fix the mistake, The End(sounds pointless, putting it like that, doesn't it?) It would have been better if the super villain was someone else, someone who would've compelled the government to make the said task-force.; like, Batman! Next point is, that the plot has more "fairy-tale". For instance, Joker and Waller dying wasn't that serious and people could easily anticipate them coming back. But when Enchantress/June died, a moment of sadness could be felt in the hall. Then again she came back, which made the story more fairy-tale. Her death would've mixed the story up a little bit. I was desperately awaiting some major plot twist. Sadly, there wasn't any. Finally, the cliffhanger wasn't that good either. The joker was expected to return, and he did. I would've appreciated a more surprising end that would've created a huge hype for the sequel.But overall it's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Injustice League</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review for Suicide Squad (spoiler free)****(4/5) A lot of people said that End of Watch (2013) writer/director David Ayer was crazy but nobody thought he was this crazy but here it is the craziest superhero/villain movie in existence. Which is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU, and it doesn't take itself too seriously unlike BvS which pretty much just had special effects pizazz to get it's point across, and didn't have any funny dialogue unlike this. Even though in some areas the dialogue is a bit bumpy and could have been better but all is forgiven. Because from the trailer which was released earlier this year and is one of the most viewed trailers on Youtube for movies 2016, it showed that this blockbuster is going to brilliantly bonkers and it is but not too bonkers it still has some serious bits. Which is better than BvS which made people feel more fatigued than there were enjoying it. But enough about that.The story is somewhat okay in this, you can tell it's there but it does fall flat for a few instances and alongside the plot it has the craziness that this Machiavellian crew all have in common. But with the editing it's a little faster due to the executive producer Zach Snyder it's a little darker than normal but that's not to say that, that is a bad thing it just makes the film a bit more serious which is one thing the Suicide Squad shouldn't be especially because in the comics the characters were all nuts, with the insane Harley Quinn as the leader. The characters in this are amazing you can tell that they are taken straight out of the comic book, even with Jared Leto's Joker who isn't part of the Suicide Squad comics just shows to be a formidable force along with the ride. His Joker is brilliant but lacks on thing and that is the purple attire the Joker is famous for but he does rock the 'Damaged' tattoos, also he lacks the insanity of previous Jokers but that's not his fault he still adds a certain efficiency to the story, and at some points makes it better.But the show-runner is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn who looks astonishing in the characters skimpy clothes, and she certainly shows the craziness of the real Harley Quinn straight out of the comic and her one-liners are just hysterical, and one of a kind. However when it comes to the action they all have their special trademark attacks but the one that shows strongest is Will Smith's Deadshot proving to be a better shooter than we last lead to believe he keeps the team strong even when some (Harley Quinn) have their crazy moments. Aside from all the fast-paced action which is amazing by the way it has very good special effects which look absolutely astonishing to match with the purple and green title screen and well it certainly is a strong point of the film. Also one quick thing to add Viola Davis nails her part as secretary Amanda Waller.But on the low side it lacks the origin stories of the characters, the stories are there but they aren't as prominent as I'd hoped, and also they don't last too long and also it looks like the film just cares about the two crazy mains, who are funny which proves that David Ayer can do comedy but it looks like they take the lead way too, the other characters do make an impact though they're left standing like statues. In conclusion even without the stories this is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU and will go down in history as one of the craziest but great DC films. And certainly is better looking and makes you show your sense of humor which is one thing that Zach Snyder lacks.Verdict: A brilliantly bonkers addition to the DCEU filled with enigmatic action and crazy parts that will make even the calmest mind go crazy. Welcome to the Injustice League.8/10 full of energy and action.</fullReview>

The film doesn't waste one second of enjoyable footage with stunning action an amazing soundtrack it shows how dc is really not failing to disappoint it's fans. This movie is good even for people who don't follow comics or watch the other films this movie still amazes random viewers. It's creative aspect follows throughout with good crummy jokes and a threatened appearance. everyone has a good role in the film. Jared Leto kicks it well as the joker showing off his impressive laugh and dark skill set. Margot Robbie plays the mysterious, crazy Harley Quinn who will make anyone want to fall to their knees begging for more. No matter what this is not a film to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's an all round good movie, but could have used a couple of tweeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third installment in the DCEU proved it's worth (For Dc Fans), beating both its predecessors by miles. I'll start with the Pros of the movie.1.The acting in Suicide Squad was spot on, Will Smith was my highlight performance of the movie,perfect as Deadshot, managing to capture both aspects of the character, the hit-man and the Father. Margrot Robbie was just amazing as Harley Quinn, and i'm really excited about what DC will do with her if she gets a solo movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller just steals the show every time she is on screen.2. The story was good, as it really made all members of the squad interact with each other in so many ways, relating both to their Criminal lives and their personal ones.3. The Action sequences are very good, especially the ones having Deadshot in them.Moving on to the Cons:1.The movie was too predictable,when i enter a movie i wanna be curious about whats gonna happen later in the movie, but with Suicide Squad i really didn't find that, as the ending was very predictable.2.Too little screen time for the Joker.I really find it annoying that they didn't give much screen time for the Joker, one of the reasons why i wanted to see this movie was because of the Joker, as i wanted to see if Jared Letos performance could top or equal that of Heath Ledger's performance, but i really couldn't as i wasn't shown enough of him to make my overall verdict about him.3.Very Weak villain, as you saw in most of the trailers and the large media campaign WB gave to this movie, they focus very little about the villain. The final showdown between the Squad and the bad guy wasn't that interesting, as the villain was defeated very easily. Overall Verdict: It's a good movie and is definitely worth your time, it is better by miles than Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. The movie could have had a better villain, more screen time for the joker, but all in all it is a good movie and i am certain most DC fans will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It probably isn't gonna win any awards but damn! I had a good time watching it. It can get a little bit hard to follow but it does have a reasonably coherent plot(kinda simple, but there are surprises). Soundtrack was pretty good and used effectively most of the time. Margot Robbie and Will Smith shine as Deadshot and Harley Quinn, supporting cast is highly effective and overall all the characters were done justice. In conclusion, its a good summer movie to watch with friends and have a good laugh with good fight scenes. I would like to say that I noticed a lot of scenes were cut out and in the beginning there were way too many cuts in some scenes but it does not hold back this film. I'm watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the movie is beautiful to look at and the squad is awesome. The way they are introduced is awesome. The music is perfect. The pace is a bit off at times and the jokers scenes feel rushed and choppy. He's never on screen long enough to get immersed in his character. This feels like editing issues after the fact. Harley Quinn is awesome, and Deadshot is perfect. The movie would have been amazing if it focused on the Joker as its villain but sadly it chooses to have a CGI Saturday morning cartoon villain instead (truly the films weakest link). It's easy to see why the critics are bashing SQ. it feels forced and rushed. As if the camera is afraid to give any one character too much screen time. Killer Croc is visually great but has the worst lines to say (his one liners fall flat). Boomerang is great. That's all I'm going to say because I enjoyed the movie. It's a mess, it's kind of like making a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich and at the last minute you realize you are out of mayo. It's still great but it's missing an important ingredient and in this case, a worthy villain of such a worthy Squad. I wanted More. For the record, I carry a torch for Batman V Superman and thought the rated R version of that film was AMAZING.</fullReview>

As David Ayer (Director) has stated he made this film for the fans and I believe if you are a fan of comic book films and a DC fan you will really enjoy this film. Margot Robbie stole the spotlight in the film with other great actors like Will smith and Jai Courtney were also very good. Jarrod Leto's Joker was different but still very good. The story is plain and simple which is what the film needed with such a large cast and the villain was a great choice.

He's not Heath Ledger, but he didn't play the part like Heath Ledger did. He was...different. And quite disturbingly so. Yeah, he did alright.Margot Robbie. Her character was just about the only one with any back story whatsoever, and consequently (aside from her being gorgeous and having the best lines) she was the only character about whom I cared.Spoiler: Diablo. Great character, some back story, some actual depth (even if he was a walking cliché). But he's not going to be in the inevitable sequel, unless he has some other special power we don't know about. And how the hell did he suddenly become what he did at the end?Deadshot. Jesus, Mr Smith. Are you that skint that you have to take whatever is offered, and that arrogant that you then just phone your performance in? You were out-acted by a headless corpse hanging from a climbing rig. The rest of the characters, including the main not-really-good-woman and the main not- really-bad-villain were utterly two dimensional. Y'know, like they were drawn in a comic.This could have been a great movie. It had a great cast and a really good premise. But DC really need to watch a few Marvel films and learn how it's done...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what did you expect, Citizen Kane? I LOVE THIS MOVIE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are strictly entertainment. Some movies are deep meditations on the human condition. Most of us go to the movies for the first. SUICIDE SQUAD is for you. This is an action extravaganza, full of popcorn munching fun, explosions, and fight scenes. All the actors play their parts well, but Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as the Joker are particularly good. Could there be more plot? Yes, but its a super- villain turned heroes flick----gather the team, beat the bad guy, save the world---. Harley Quinn does crazy REALLY well. Jared Leto is a Joker we've not seen before. He's not making a point to anyone, he is just doing his own (totally psychotic) thing. The soundtrack crushes with lots of classic rock, and there are few dull moments. I hope we'll see more Suicide Squads in the future, but I would totally be down for a Joker/Harley movie with Leto and Robbie. One last point. Its really sad to see reviewers, and by this I mean so called professionals, carry over their personal political/social/moral biases over into the treatment of a movie. This is particularly obvious in the case of Suicide Squad. One reviewer seemed particularly put off by Harley's short shorts. Really? If this bothers you, go watch Beaches again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positively surprised after all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came with low to none expectations at all, I was positively surprised when there was so much to love. Letos Joker was something new, it was like a combination of Ledger and something completely new. Voice was clearly the thing combining his and Ledgers Joker but the facial expressions and habits are something i've never seen on screen before. Lets just say that he nailed it, but so did Ben Affleck, Margot Robbie and even Will Smith (I was a bit skeptical about him at first)The biggest let down for me was the villain, just so so bad. She (Enchantress played by Cara Delevingne) was so laughable, couldn't take her seriously I tried I swear. Sadly just like every DC movie from MoS to this has had a weak ending, they all started of so great and had the greatest point just before the intended finale/high point.If the ending is ignored this is a great movie, even if it isn't The Dark Knight or Civil War of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I want to explain my 1 star rating: this star is not for you, it's not for IMDb, it's not even for the movie. It's for Will Smith, and Will Smith alone. I'm not crazy about Smith or nothing, but I think he made me to sit and watch it till the end. I walked from movies after 30 minutes of Batman V Superman, or let's be realistic here: Man of Steel 2. So, now let's talk about this movie, and I'll try to be profane as little as possible! This movie is bad. And I mean very, VERY bad! I know that DC and Marvel are great foes in terms of competition among two big companies, and every super hero always gets answered by another super hero from the other company and that's old news. What I cannot stand is taking obvious details from competition's films and introducing them in their own movies as something "new" or "out of the ordinary meant to be funny" case in point: UNICORN from DeadPool now in possession of "Boomerang- guy(?)". OK, that's just annoying and cheap, but let's talk about story line: If you EVER seen ANY action movie EVER before, you'll hate this movie. Anyone remember Nick Cage movie "Con Air"? Come on people, it's the same freaking story with some CGI SF elements added to nobody's pleasure!!!! But even if they did a "remake" of "Con Air" they could've made those villains be more villain! Steve Buscemi's scene in a pool singing "He's got whole world in his hands" is more powerful than every scene with Joker and/or Harley! Even Danny Trejo did better than every actor in this movie! At least he's believable. In SS not even 1 character is believable or consistent with his character. At one point in the movie it's totally the same who says what it all starts to sound the same. It's like they all became 1 character saying meaningless one-liners that serve no purpose whatsoever. I honestly think Batman:Arkham (Assylum, Origins, City etc.)games did better justice to the franchise than every DC movie after Batman The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and enjoyable despite some flaws!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters, I am both a Marvel and DC fan, but I'll admit that DCU movies have not been that good lately when compared to MCU movies. Nonetheless, I found this movie entertaining and enjoyable. I found movies like Man of Steel just "okay" and Batman V. Superman was over decent; still, I was still hyped for the Suicide Squad and was excited to see what they would offer.Every movie has its flaws, and I tried my best to stay away from reading reviews before watching this movie. Your best bet is to just go in blind and not hold any expectations and see how this movie will affect you. I was excited because of their direction with a DC movie that has a cast of all villains/anti-heroes, but I was also a little skeptical seeing how DC movies have been a bit lacking lately. I really liked this movie, of course it has its cons like any other film. I love all the characters, the action was fun to watch, and it made me laugh several times throughout the movie. My biggest issue with the Suicide Squad was mainly about how they chose to focus on the characters. Some characters got a lot more screen time and had occasions where their background was explored a little more deeply, while some characters didn't get that much time or focus. Realistically, the cast was large so it would be more confusing and overbearing if they took too much time with each character. (That's also a double-edged sword though, in my opinion). I wish they would have given more screen time or backstory to the other characters, as I really loved Boomerang and Katana, but they didn't have much of an opportunity to be explored more. You do get a good amount of Harley Quinn and Deadshot, which is nothing to complain about as they're also both great characters.Overall, pretty good movie. It was entertaining and enjoyable, and I love all the characters. I wished they would give more time to other members of the squad instead of focusing on just a few too much. Some action scenes felt satisfying while some felt just mediocre. A tip would be to try and not hold any expectations or have your mind be painted by critics or other viewers, go see it and decide yourself! Despite some minor flaws here and there, you'll find an entertaining summer movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad?? Morelike Suicide DCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you expect this movie to be a great fusion of picaresque and superhero genre, you are wrong. This is really a desperate attempt from WB and DC to revive the dying DCU, so they decided to copy what they think makes marvel movies such a success. A PG13 lighter atmosphere and add some comedy. Really? is this what DC thinks people like watch Marvel movies for? Well if they really wanted to be successful like a marvel movie, they should try to make something like Deadpool. Rated R, some blood and anti-hero stuff. As usual DCU completely missed thing that make Marvel movie successful. A good script that makes sense. This is just a movie that introduces less popular DC characters nothing more nothing less. The whole movie is like "This guy is Deadshot he shoots guns! This guy is Killer croc, he is scaly! Here is katana she is for all weeaboos! We have more than Batman and Superman you know." When all the introduction is done, half of the movies is done. And the rest is just rushed plot and really bad PS3 level CG and action to fill up the rest of the time. In the name of bad script, bad CG, bad action. A trinity of fail makes this makes Dawn of Justice look like Citizen Kane. And that is no compliment. Such a shame as it had elements that could have been an innovative superhero movie. But just like dawn of justice, it has been wasted and it will never see the light again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was a film I was not looking forward to after the disaster known as Batman V Superman. As a fan of comics and also as a movie goer, this movie fails on many levels but manages to achieve some things.The Suicide Squad form together to fight Enchantress and her cgi army, they're built up of a bunch of baddies.The start is good but the intros definitely went to long, throughout the story though Will Smith's Deathstroke and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn are really the main characters, everyone is just supporting i guess. The story becomes quite repetitive and boring after the first half of the film. Once the action starts, a brief break, then back to the action. A formula I don't believe is good enough for a film like this. However this film was more humorous than Batman V Superman, which made it much better in my opinion, I was always excited to see Captain Boomerang as I knew he would always have a joke lined up.Joker Jared Leto's Joker appearance is too short for me to make any sort of judgement but from what I saw he was Okay, not as good as Ledger or Nicholson.This film was better than Batman V Superman mainly because it has more action, and its more light hearted. Will Smith did an alright job, but Margot Robbie really shined as Harley Quinn as she did a very good portrayal of the character.P.S Killer Croc looks so stupid</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start, I don't know anything about any of the characters in this movie. I didn't have any backstory preconceived notions about how they should act. I completely relied on the movie to get me to side with these people. Having said that, the movie begins by introducing us to these characters, in an extremely awkward montage complete with randomly inserted classic rock songs. The introductions are lame because being told about these characters through voice-over is never as interesting as seeing it. Show, don't tell. From there on the movie continues its messy narrative with bits and pieces from about 5 different movies with many lapses in logic and tonal inconsistencies. Nothing in this movie worked for me, not even Deadshot or Harley, who had robotic dialogue that served no purpose other than to highlight their already simplistic personality traits. Maybe they're more well-rounded in the comics, but I'm talking about what I've seen on the screen, and it wasn't anything approaching interesting. I won't talk about anyone else, because the filmmakers clearly didn't care about them.I'm happy people out there are enjoying this. Good for you. I wish I could say there was something here that was redeemable for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is the ultimate let-down. For the first time on the big screen, we see some of DC's biggest villains, but completely misrepresented. We have Will Smith, portraying the stone-faced and tough Deadshot, as if he was from a cheap 90's comedy. Harley Quinn, the psychotic yet lovable jester, is morphed into a stuck up and cringe-worthy bimbo. Many of the other "Squad" members are so unessential and pointless to include, that their sole purpose must have just been for marketing ploys. For example, in advertisements and merchandise, we see so much of the Joker. The sad reality is, his scenes tally up to a total of 15 minutes on nonconsecutive screen time. The horrible casting decisions, cheap and overused plot ("misfit team needs to save the earth!"), and the sprinkling in of characters that are so unessential and serve no other purpose than to just stand there, are just a few of the elements that make this one bad movie. One would expect so much more from a film that has been so heavily hyped up and marketed to actually have some sense of direction, but instead us comic fans are left with a terrible excuse of a 'Marvel wannabe' flick. Don't waste your money or your time on this sorry excuse of a 'fun film'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad was mediocre at best but more-so disappointing because of its potential but, at the same time, it doesn't quite deserve all the hate it is getting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the superhero world which has Batman and Superman, what if we were able to convince supervillains - like Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn (Robbie) and the world's top assassin Deadshot (Smith) - to fight for good? That's the premise of Suicide Squad. It sounds like fun. Who doesn't love a good group of anti-heroes? And can you get any better than comic book anti-heroes? Unfortunately, terrible writing and poor decisions spell doom for this potentially fun superhero flick.The movie opens to the music of The Animals' "House of the Rising Sun". We see an intimidating high security prison so, I suppose, we're to assume that there are some pretty mean characters being housed here. We meet our first inmate, Deadshot (Smith), and watch his interaction with a sadistic guard. Aside from the fact that Deadshot is in a prison, we aren't really given any reason why he's a villain. Never mind the fact that this is Will Smith we're talking about. When is he really ever a bad guy? A Bad Boy, maybe, but not a bad guy.We then cut over to meet Harley Quinn (Robbie). Grace's rendition of "You Don't Own Me" plays as we see Quinn lounging about her cell that sits in the middle of a heavily guarded room. The same sadistic guard approaches her and flirts with the supervillain. The bars on her cell are electrified, throwing her to her back into a daze. We cut to a flashback of the guards (led by the sadistic one) force feeding the crying Quinn and even taking a selfie with her while she is bound. Again, we might have some association with Harley Quinn (being the significant other to the Clown Prince of Crime) but we don't know that she's a villain. We continue to meet other people but you get the idea?The Suicide Squad, as we learn, is the brainchild of a stone cold military woman. She opens a binder labeled "Top Secret" and proceeds to introduce each member. Each of the what, 5 or 6 people, have a several minute expository clip. It begins with a still shot of a given character which has their name and some interesting facts about them. It's a tired method of introducing characters and, man, does it take up a lot of time. We're like 20 minutes into the movie it feels like and we haven't even assembled the team! It's almost like we sat through a promotional short film for the actual movie. I'd kinda prefer if that were the case because we might be able to have a better movie in a year or two.The most painful part about Suicide Squad, and I mentioned this in the bottom-line, is that there was so much potential. Leaving the theatre, I kinda wanted to go and see it again because, maybe, it would be different. That's a sign of a healthy relationship, am I right? Save yourself the time and money and pass on Suicide Squad at least in terms of a theater visit. I'd recommend watching one of the Avengers movies if you want a comic book action movie, or maybe Dark Knight if you want a darker comic book movie with a lot of action. Now I've got a few bones to pick so mind yourself of spoilers.There are so many things about Suicide Squad (both big and small) that don't work. One thing, as I mentioned, is the team introductory montage. It's unnecessarily drawn out and it bogs down the rest of the movie. Now, at one point, the story's main villain attacks (I'll keep it vague to protect against spoilers). The main military guy who leads the squad knows what happened. Eventually, Will Smith confronts him and says, "You know what happened. Tell us." So the military guy proceeds to tell them (and us) what happened. Meanwhile, we watch it happen again. We saw it the first time...you know, like, when it happened. Why are you wasting precious minutes actually recycling footage? I mean, sure, there's that film making adage "show don't tell" but, guys, I don't think this is what it means.Even down to the main plot of the movie - so and so is trying to destroy the world - feels tired. You're doing something wrong if "the world is going to end" feels dull. Just because they live in a world with Batman and Superman, doesn't mean that there are different fish to fry (not bigger but different). The lame plot is, perhaps, just an indication or symptom of Suicide Squad's biggest offender: the writing.The actors do a fine job with what they're given but they aren't given much. The character development is nigh non-existent. We only get a few moments where we see the potential of Harley's character. We see glimpses of her relationship with the Joker (Leto) and her feelings but they don't go anywhere.In the case of Deadshot, just having bits of dialog to show that he loves his daughter isn't character development. He's the highest paid assassin in the world (and along with that, I'd be surprised if he only killed "bad guys" but the movie doesn't get into that) and he was captured because his daughter didn't want him to kill his captor. Did his capture get him to reflect on his life choices? Hardly (or if it did, I wasn't feelin' it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Ayer's Writing and Direction- a complete letdown. The Suicide Squad themselves will keep you engaged throughout.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a DC Fan for quite some time after Batman Begins. I was eagerly waiting for this movie after Batman V Superman because it's a continuation story.David Ayer's writing for the movie was inadequately bleak. The story line of the movie was so bland that it was appealing during 1st half but during 2nd half, no sign of any storytelling. The execution of this DC motion picture is far out the most atrocious things I've ever seen. The editing wasn't crisp at all and the transitions were majorly sloppy and out of shape. Ayer should've taken a lot of time doing workshops on Superhero Movies because his previous films were all war and action based so he should've taken interest in following up the textures of a DC Movie. Zack Snyder is also in the same category so Ayer is not alone.The girl who played Katana was horrifyingly cringe-worthy. Her role just didn't make sense to what was integral to the script. It was like Ryan Reynolds in green Lantern- trying too hard to get into the character of a superhero or super villain.The positives in the film are the only the roles. Margot Robbie has finally gotten a good package for this film. After watching the Wolf of Wall Street, she was terrible in her role but for this one, she just finessed although she did drag on a bit during the climax. Jared Leto as Joker was simply great. The comedic humorousness that he had in this role was simply a joy to go through in this film. Will Smith as Dead Shot was adequate and good. He managed to mesmerize everything in the movie perfectly especially his gunshots in the movie.Overall, this movie wasted the potential and could've been one of the finest films yet but landed being a outdated directed superhero letdown fest, which is why Suicide Squad is a One-Time Watch or worth- watching on Netflix or a TV Broadcast</fullReview>

It's all just a clusterfuck, i'm sure the movie was better before the reshoots, but guess what? exactly like FOX and Fant4stic, the studio got in the way and made an unwatchable movie that lacks structure and pacing. The third act is the worst thing on earth, as it contains pathetic fight scenes and manipulative "character moments", at least BvS, a movie which also has an awful third act, is never boring even at a three hour runtime. Don't watch this movie if you don't want your brain cells to die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's clear that this is a blockbuster aim to rake in millions rather than a movie with a decent plot, interesting characters with meaningful relationships and good acting. Not to mention, it's been done before. Recently we've been given the franchise where superheros work together to fight evil forces. Here, it's flipped around and it's not that well done.After introducing the main evil characters, David Ayer decided it's due time for action, action and more action. Hence the characters are flat, no one really cares for them or their motives. It's because they happen to be so awfully annoying rather than intriguing considering the movie is about them. Take Hannibal Lecter for the antagonist of all time. His presence on screen was captivatingly thrilling, he had the audience glued to the plot at all times. I guess it's not Ayer's fault because trying to cram so many characters into just an over two hour blockbuster is difficult for any director. Plus it didn't help that he didn't develop the storyline which happen to be ridiculously silly and at times confusing. Then there is the dialogue. Every line spoken by Will Smith or Margot Robbie were so cliché and brain numbing. Don't even get me started on the Aussie aka Jai Courtenay's Boomerang.No doubt there will be a sequel given the success at the box office and also how chummy the characters became towards the end and with Jared Leto's Joker running loose in Gotham. My bet is that he will be the main villain next time. If you want a movie where big explosions and special effects matter more then this is for you. I watched it to see what the hype was all about. I was right, it's just hype. The one star is for Viola Davis though - for appearing in this mess and delivering her lines like a pro even if she may have wondered what the hell was coming out of her mouth.</fullReview>

As all the events unfold after the first half hour I realized that I had absolutely no clue what was happening. The main villain is introduced and when that happens I actually thought she was a part of the square and the actual villain was coming up. But later I'm pleasantly surprised when I realize that I was indeed thrown into a movie that has all of 3 connected plot points and about 17 different back stories still being set up that are all thrown into a movie that should have been double the length to even be able to establish all the characters and set up a cohesive story line and that I am not incredibly stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen this movie you might find "mediocre" a rather generous review word. When you compare the movie to what it appeared to want to be, a highly stylised anti-hero movie full of the joys of pop icons on a roller-coaster of cool, it comes out pretty mediocre.The script was not well written or delivered, the whole thing was full of holes too glaring to dismiss, the whole anti-hero thing didn't work at all because they just tried to make them heroes... Whereas if they were kick-ass villains doing their villain thing a lot more the film could have worked on the premise it set out.SPOILERS: The fact that the government woman getting attacked was the satisfying bit... Just shows how confused the good guy bad guy thing was.OK so we could have complex bad-guys who are good intentioned or driven to evil etc. But none of that was pulled off well. Harley Quinn is supposed to be crazy but in order to spit out an easy generic piece of smeg script, her and all the others have pretty normal emotional responses despite being supposed psychopaths. Harley says she's crazy but about the only crazy she actually acts out is going along with story elements because OK.The final villain fight was set up like a lame ass video-game, dread the video-game if there is one. Everything cool that could have happened was always taken away just to allow Harley the victory and make the team useful for their individual input. This really isn't the dream team, they don't have to function well together, they're villains, not working well together can be their downfall ready for when they face the justice league. Stop making this a superhero movie! It's meant to be a bad guy anarchy movie...They showed us the witch stuff straight away then insisted on a half-arsed flash back to show "what happened" who was that for?? We the audience had already seen it! If you want to show us the flash back to reveal some twist, keep us along for the ride; in the dark. If that would leave us confused as to what's going on and you have to show us, then just don't do a reveal montage on top of that, that reveals nothing!The whole 'I can give you what you want' thing was ridiculously executed whereby they clearly weren't being fooled they were just dreaming pretty much. If the things they were experiencing were happening in the actual location they were at they'd be sucked in, but no they were sucked in by a complete fantasy (except when deadshot sees his daughter telling him not to shoot) and only reminded by fire guy at some point.A positive point here. At least when boyfriend guy has to take the action to kill his dream of having his girlfriend back finally tied together that whole 'get what you really want' thing. That could have left us with a really sad and informative reason that these guys are bad guys never getting what they feel they need in life and being all bitter and that. But no, they had to spoil that too with a happy ending that makes Harley smile like she has normal human emotions, yet again!What else. The machine of floating garbage that never forms but can zap stuff when she's a witch who could just do that anyway. The dumb-ass bomb thing that I already scraped upon for combining different character's skills. Basic as all flying frig. The only reason for that explosion to cause everything to come back in (unless I'm missing a specific skill of this bomb) is if it killed the witch or damaged her enough to reverse her magic somehow. In which case it would be thrown at her not the clouds that is her magic machine above her.Why all the massive holes. Why all the simplified elements. Was this made for 8 year olds? Because the certificate here in England is 15. For a 15 those generic 'we can cut them up because fantasy' enemies could have been a lot more person-like. Character introduction at the beginning of the film was the simplest possible, and hung unfairly on Harley. I know she's the one we're really interested in, but don't be a dick to everyone else in public, that's just not on!All these bad plays could have been glossed over if they at least came off as constant bad-ass villains with well written and performed lines of script and fast paced iconic poses and action. But no. Mediocre. Having written vaguely about just some of the things that make this film crap, the word seems generous even to me. But no, I won't give it the satisfaction of calling it a terrible bad movie. It is what it is... Just a shame it isn't.Mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defies expectations more than necessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Marvel Studios began expanding their films into more shared universes, a trend has begun to follow among other production companies. The most obvious of competitors would be Warner Bros. DC but there are others. Another franchise that is supposedly expanding its cinematic universe is Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) franchise. The concept is a common thing now among high-end money making movie properties. However this is no secret for Warner Brothers. After losing their chance to reinvigorate their universe with Green Lantern (2011), DC tried again with Man of Steel (2013) and finally brought themselves back from a long period of dormancy. So in order to catch up to Marvel's output, the next choice was making Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). It certainly brought the studio up to speed but whom are they fooling? There were a lot of missteps taken to get there. Adding to that is this movie which promisingly looked like DC's Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), but with villains. Sadly this was not as great as one would hope.This is actually rather shocking considering the cast and crew involved. Crediting himself as writer/director is David Ayer, the same man who headed praiseworthy projects like End of Watch (2012) and Fury (2014). The story is based on the comic about Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruiting the worst villains from Arkham Asylum to fight what the regular military would or could not defeat. That means bringing on Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Capt. Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), June Moone AKA Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Slipknot (Adam Beach) and Katana (Karen Fukuhara) under the command of Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) to take down a powerful force that only they can stop. Meanwhile on the side, the Joker (Jared Leto) is up to no good looking to find a way to break his joker queen out of the iron grasp of Amanda Waller. Initially this sounds fine but the story lacks structure.Close to the start, the conflict begins and the suicide squad is sent out to pacify it. Yet before this even happens, Amanda Waller assembled them to take care of a different reason. This different reason is completely dropped once the main struggle arises. So what was the original mission they were going to be sent on? It's never answered. Either that or editor John Gilroy put the scenes in the wrong order. And Gilroy has been the editor to a number of popular films like Salt (2010) and Pacific Rim (2013). So what gives? Along with that are some backstories that are briefly skimmed over. Why? This film has a two hour run time; Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) has the exact same. Nonetheless even with these written issues, the actors perform well in their roles and are likable to a certain degree. Some of them even have more human backstories than one would expect. The costume/character designs are also commendable. For once, these characters have some color in their suits and aren't so dark and brooding like Bats or Sups.Speaking of which, Ben Affleck as the caped crusader does have a few scenes throughout the movie. Is it worth it? Sort of from a narrative standpoint but in other ways it just feels like Batman was put in to have more people view the film. The action at least entertains for the most part as well. Deadshot's ability to be precise in every round he shoots is awesome. Katana use of the sword is sharper than your average kitchen knife (of course). El Diablo knows how to heat up people's nights with his powers and Harley Quinn's gymnastic acrobatics certainly make her a special addition. Regrettably this does not make up for the sections that have CGI overload. Thankfully it does not get as bad as Batman V Superman with its almost PS2 gameplay like cut scenes, but there are still unnecessary moments. Whether it's the adversary the suicide squad has to fight against or even if it's digitally editing Harley Quinn to have booty shorts. It just seems like wasted amounts where this particular effect is abused for the wrong reasons.Roman Vasyanov was chosen to provide the cinematography to this picture. Vasyanov also worked with Ayer on End of Watch (2012) and Fury (2014). This shows that Vasyanov knows how to make great or accurate looking movies. Fury (2014) had great looking camera-work and End of Watch (2012) made the viewer feel like they were in the movie. None of that's shown here. It's strange too. With all the colorful personalities and costumes, one would think that this movie would have brighter images to show. There are about 2-3 scenes that have daylight in them. Every other scene is in the dark or it's raining. All it does is remind the viewer of how gloomy looking the previous Zack Snyder DC films were presented. It's frustrating. Composing the film score to this movie was Steven Price, another David Ayer collaborator. Price's work is another disappointment. Unlike his past work in films like Fury (2014), there is no reoccurring theme for the suicide squad. And this is the perfect time to establish one for them. But that wasn't done.Unlike what one would expect, this David Ayer film has its moments due to its cast, action and part of its writing, but that's all it can be given. The music isn't memorable, the camera-work doesn't match the colorful characters or tone and the overall plot doesn't make sense for a two-hour film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly. Worst DC Movie. EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE FILM ARE AHEAD.) Alright. I'm going to spoil EVERYTHING that happens in this movie. You've been warned. This movie is TERRIBLE!!! First up, the plot makes absolutely ZERO sense because the trailer guys came in to RE-EDIT the entire film, and because of that there are many, MANY, continuity errors. Next, the visuals are the same story: Choppy, poorly edited, etc, etc. The characters are GARBAGE. The only people who try in this ENTIRE film are: Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and a little bit of Jay Courtney. That's IT. Viola Davis is meh, Killer Crock (sorry for wrong spelling) is BAD, Jared Leto is trying WAY TOO HARD to out do Heath Ledger, and more. And if you expected the Suicide Squad to take on the Joker, you ain't getting it! No, the ACTUAL villain is Cara Delevingne's Enchantress. Bad. Just bad. During the battle, all she does is wiggle dance in front of a giant cliché weapon, and create cliché minions. And when the movie ends, there is a mid-credits scene involving Viola Davis talking to Ben Affleck which makes no sense. Overall, I give Suicide Squad: 2.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a failed attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that tried to do something different in terms of superhero movie genre but failed to accomplish what we already have on this. It seems that superhero movies are gonna stay low for a very long time. Probably one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in a theater. Except the dark knight trilogy which changed our perception towards this genre by its masterful presentation of characters and story accompanied by brilliant acting. the problem with the film was that it went too much supernatural while most of the good(bad) characters do not fall into that category. Its a pity that it wasted talents of some good actors in it. Suicide squad really is bad from starting to end. Worst DC movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved from being terrible by Margot Robbie (and Davis and Smith)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is the best DC of the year, but that says more about its stablemate than the film itself. In the same breath, its the worst film of the summer since the other film. Perhaps Suicide Squad is even more of a disappointment because of the wonders worked by the marketing team, crafting an incredible campaign that duped audiences into thinking DC had pulled it out of the bag with this one. That is a testament to them I suppose and they do deserve all the profits from this one for doing so but the saying goes that even a broken clock is right twice a day. Too many cooks (elements) spoil the broth (film) and I truly kick myself for believing they could win audiences around with this one. Still, even by the smallest sentiment, Suicide Squad is somewhat of a progression, so at least they're moving upwards...SUMMARY: Suicide Squad is saved from being terrible by Margot Robbie's sensational performance of Harley Quinn, and promising work from Viola Davis and Will Smith.REVIEW: http://bit.ly/2bEc07L</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This reminds me why I usually avoid most superhero films...42.5%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this film is the title...which was maybe just enough of a lure to get me into the cinema to watch it. After the closing credits had finished, I remembered why I tend to like the anti-superhero films the best...they're just more entertaining. Amongst those films that I really enjoyed are "Watchmen", "Kick-Ass" and "Hancock", with the latter starring Will Smith, who also has a featured role in "Suicide squad".The plot concerns a secret U.S. government agency setting about to assemble a black ops type team of supervillains, in the wake of the events in some previous superhero film...which I couldn't be bothered watching...one with Superman...or something...the reasoning being that the world needs powerful fighters to combat threats like another Superman...but one committed to evil, not niceness. All the supervillains that the agency has in mind to recruit are in a high security gaol. Obviously a method to gain the supervillains' co-operation needs to be found...it's not like public service is very important to them. The agency's potential employee screening tests will be critically important...A subplot involves a "romance" between two supervillians...Harley Quinn (played by Australian actress Margot Robbie) and The Joker (played by Jared Leto). Their romance is made more problematic by The Joker not actually being in gaol.Whilst the film does at least provide some sort of backstory or origin story for each supervillain, I just didn't find any of it (i.e. the characters or the film) engaging. My guess is that the people who will get the most out of this film will be those who have immersed themselves in this universe, via comics or other media. As someone who had not done so, I just didn't get a thrill out of seeing all these characters, most of whom I was not familiar with.Some characters I was familiar with, like The Joker. Jared Leto's portrayal provides hints of Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz in "Apocalypse now", Jaws, from the Bond universe and a sort of a punk gangster...part Johnny Rotten, part the white singer from The Prodigy. Does The Joker command the screen? No. Of the "conventional" superhero movies I've seen, The Dark Knight stands out for one thing...the performance of Australian actor Heath Ledger as The Joker. By the end of that Batman trilogy I realised one thing...Batman himself is boring. Whilst being a good movie, The Dark Knight could have been great...if it was 152 minutes of Heath Ledger playing The Joker in it.Anyway, since the early part of the movie concerns the recruitment of these supervillains, I was left wondering who on Earth they would be fighting...they do get to go up against a powerful character though, which is just as well (for the viewer).Throughout the entire movie, I laughed only once due to a character saying something funny. Can't remember who said the thing which made me laugh...The Joker? Harley Quinn? These are meant to be "wacky" and "zany" characters, right? Harley seems more like a rebellious teenager than a psychopath (but she is cute). The Joker is mirthless. Supervillains? They seem more like misunderstood and redeemable characters. And Captain Kangaroo (played by Australian Jai Courtney) is a supervillain? He seems more like a grown up The Feral Kid or a glorified goon. Not having explored these characters elsewhere, it just surprised me that the agency in this film would want to recruit somebody like Captain Kangaroo.What's the worst thing about this film? The soundtrack. It's not that I didn't like some of the songs used (early on you hear a lot of baby boomer era pop and rock songs), it's more that these songs function as a substitute for the film's inability to create characters or moments which capture your imagination. In other words, the music is supposed to create that thrill of excitement which the film is incapable of delivering. It's just lazy a lazy shortcut to affect. If you were born after the 1960s and 1970s and are unfamiliar with these songs, then it's hard to imagine these songs being able to manipulate your emotions and thus make up for what the film is failing to deliver. There are some songs from later though. You only hear a few seconds of these songs...not doubt used so as to be included on the soundtrack. Can't say that I heard enough songs that I particularly liked to want to own such an album though.Would I want to see this film again? No. It has zero repeat viewing value. Neither the characters nor the film captures the imagination. By the by: Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman)? Weird name. Made me think of "Ric Flair"! Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is...surprising. Hmm. She's with the government? M'kay.Will I watch a sequel? I very much doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall it wasn't the worst movie that I've seen. Not even close to being the best either though. I had my hopes oh so high for this movie and now I kind of do regret not having lowered them before I saw it. It wasn't all that bad. Pros were for example: great cast, interesting story line and that it really follows the original comics in many ways. But it had a lot of cons: The movie was, in a way, too focused on Harley Quinn (yeah, unpopular opinion but I really saw it that way), obvious plot and that it doesn't follow the comics in the right ways.Sure, Margot Robbie did an amazing version of Harley Quinn. I absolutely loved it at first but as I watched the movie, I became more and more annoyed with it. For example I miss her accent. Her accent is one of the things that make Harley Quinn, Harley Quinn. And her outfit... I think it's fantastic and unique but I wish they hadn't mixed it with the blue. Red and Black are awesome. Jared Leto also did a fantastic job playing the joker. Personally not a favorite but I adored it. But the movie didn't need him. If he wasn't in the movie it wouldn't have made that much of a difference. It's not really a movie I would watch again nor recommend but it is well worth watching maybe once in your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide squad is awful and a waste of your time and money. It's sad to see that nearly no effort is being put into the storyline of movies anymore all the money and time is being spent on special effects and famous actors to bring in the profit.The first half of suicide squad was boring introductions which weren't well thought out, none of the characters made an impression. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense and was just terrible. They had a bad as team of villain's and instead of making them evil they turned all of them into nice guys except Harley Quinn even then she didn't do anything crazy. Why not just make them evil and get on with it they tried to make a few of them seem ashamed of their crimes what a waste. the guy with fire superpowers was scared to use them for most of the movie...? I think the movie industry should be ashamed of themselves.. Where has their passion gone for writing a masterpiece and why has the public rolled over and accepted such garbage from people that get majorly overpaid. They get paid to entertain and they are failing at their job, no effort at all :( !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watched this film 3days ago and unfortunately like almost all American films in 2016, it did not fulfill my expectations,and i tell you why,first of all i am very sad that these days USA's cinema is full of remakes and sequels of films and cartoons that we have seen and comic books we have read,this film was one of the worst films in artistic aspect that has made it mainstream and has topped the box office,the thing that disappointed me the most was David Ayer's directing,i lost so much respect for the writer of training day,and the director of Fury,and the reason i say this is because when you watch the movie you can see the confusion and disorganization of the actors which is the directors lack of control on the actors acting,and that was the worst part of the film the acting,let's start with Leto,he tried to bring a darker and more crazy version of the joker to life but he failed,i expected so much more from an Oscar wining actor,i think Leto,worried much to much about his idiosyncratic acting and how to compete with Heath Ledger,and not only he was not better than Ledger he wasn't better than Nicholson,Blick or Romero,and as for the other actors well you can't expect Brando's method acting,from Hancock,John McClane Jr,a model or Jordan Belfort's wife,and as for other crew members Roman Vasyanov's cinematography wasn't his best work,Steven Price's score wasn't acceptable from the Oscar wining composer of gravity,this movie is only good for entertainment and does not have any artistic value</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect for all the immature adults who require no depth in a movie!Funny how this movie has made nearly a hundred million dollars with so many bad reviews. It really goes to show that Hollywood can use a lot of special effects, introduce a few famous comic book characters, throw in some sexy legs, twisted darkness, and a lot of bad language and people will pay to come see it. I got fooled, but I saw it on opening day so I didn't have much to go by.Now DC has plenty of money to produce another thoughtless and shallow minded movie with no substance, just ridiculous evil attitude because that seems to be what most of the world is being lured into. Now I know to red flag DC movies before allowing enough time for normal people reviews to hit.I can remember an amazing movie from months ago like Lone Survivor as if I saw it yesterday. For some reason I can't remember much from this movie because there isn't much to remember.I guess we got tired of the good guys always winning so now it's trendy to have the bad guys winning, but in the long run, the concept fails miserably every time. Get a clue DC. You can do way better than this with those millions, but then you're making millions and I'm not. So why not cater to millions of shallow minded viewers who won't have the kryptonite nerves of steel to give a mature opinion of what this movie did for them. Well, most of the audience who likes this must not be mature. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best DCU film so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the divisive critical reaction and box office mediocrity of Batman v. Superman, I went into Suicide Squad not expecting much. Surprisingly, I liked a lot about the film. Thankfully, the portentous gods vs men "do we need heroes?" waffling from BvS is nowhere to be found. David Ayer knows that action can be fun, as apposed to Zack Snyder's heavy handed growling and yelling matches. And the "rogues called together to do good" has echoes of 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, one of the best MCU films. And the anarchist spirit is a fun break from the somber tone of the previous films, to a point where it starts to feel like it's not actually part of the same universe, despite Ben Affleck showing up as Batman in a cameo.Jared Leto's Joker is a different beast then Heath Ledger's portrayal in The Dark Knight, and in the DC cinematic universe, it works surprisingly well. Picture Hannibal Lector combined with Patrick Bateman. It's a shame there isn't more of him in the film. If they make The Joker the main villain of a Batman film, I'd pay all the money to see that.Margot Robbie is the standout performance of the film, she nailed the character of Harley Quinn perfectly. Will Smith is good, given how little character background he's given. The rest are hit and miss. Crocodile man-monsters, ninjas and pyromaniacs.The negatives? The choppy editing of the first 15 minutes is annoying, the villain is pretty forgettable, the character intros are hit and miss, and the overuse of pop songs gets old fast. But once the rogues gallery team up to kick ass, it's a surprisingly fun film. For all its flaws, this is the first time I've walked out of the cinema after a DCU film smiling. Now that's an achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit I'm a Marvel fan and not so much a DC fan, Batman and the characters in his comics are great everything else can be tossed out in my opinion. However I was very excited to see this movie. Trailer after trailer made it appear like this Guardians of the Galaxyesque misfits turned heroes all centering around the crazy antics of the insanely entertaining Joker. This was not that movie. Jarred Letto's Joker was well portrayed in the sense of you couldn't tell what he was really doing at first but in all reality they made him an over glorified mob boss who was missing his girl. He was in the movie sporadically, mostly in flash backs of Harley and it just didn't do much for me. The actual villain of this movie was not well developed in my opinion and could have been chosen better, she had minimal character development and they just kind of seemed to throw her in there along with her brother. Character development in this movie was another issue for me, you got to have insights into Deadshot and Harley which was fine but maybe a bit over done at times because you got nothing other than a few explanation lines on other characters and why they were "bad". Overall it wasn't a terrible movie just not one I'd watch again, very forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what happens when a director writes a comic book film and doesn't have a good grasp of the source material.Great performances from Margot and Leto and with that great homage to Alex Ross, it's easy to see David understood these two characters and in this film he reached to both the comic books and cartoon as references points.And contrary to popular belief, this film borrows heavily from the comic books. Unfortunately like BvS, it doesn't go all the way, or cherry picks too much.Which makes much of what the characters do make little to no sense.The characters were also too soft. They are supposed to be the worst of the worst. Double crossing everyone in site and greedy. Here they are not even close.Will Smith is yet again portraying a caricature of himself. It's as if he refuses to portray a truly vile and evil character. Viola Davis was another highlight in this films. Her character simply wasn't written well as it could have been.I personally didn't see issues with editing. The film simply drags because the pacing is very poor.The final act is deplorable. I'm not sure if Cara Delevingne is that bad an actress or if the writing/direction was that awful, that it made her performance that much more cringe worthy.I'm just glad I watched this film at a discount. I hope Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Jared Leto return. The rest, I have no interest in seeing again and DC might want to think about replacing David Ayes as writer and director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting much more from Suicide Squad given the massive hype it has received throughout the past year. The film centres around a group of imprisoned highly dangerous villains, including Deadshot, Harley Quinn, El Diablo and others who are recruited as a team/weapon by the CIA.The plot is quite average, with some obvious mistakes/holes. However the movie is very well shot, camera work is superb, and the highlight of the movie is the awesome soundtrack of golden oldies (The Animals, Stones, CCR and Queen to name a few) which often has you singing along.As for the actors, Margot Robbie is superb as Harley Quinn and is definitely the attention grabber in this film. Will Smith is acceptable-yet-lacklustre as Deadshot. Jai Courteney is brilliant as Captain Boomerang. My biggest disappointment was Jared Leto's interpretation of the Joker (who was absent throughout the majority of the film). All previous interpretations of the Joker captured his essence (random, slightly kooky or camp), but Leto's Joker is calculating,and portrayed as an angry (rather than crazy) mobster/pimp with too much bling on.Overall, it was a fun experience but a let down after all the hype.</fullReview>

Both Movies, Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad are lackluster by superseding genuine story depiction and framing with special effects. Overall, I want more Joker scenes and way less character introductions. I was really confused as to why the joker completely disappeared than reappeared in the last scene of the movie. I think I cannot have a valid opinion on Jared Leto's acting has the joker due to the fact there was so little of it, not even trailer scenes where in the movie! I am also glad that Will Smith and Margot Robbie were able to overcome the misfortune of the butchered story and still be great in there performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flop Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let it be known that I am more a DC comics fan and have loved the Suicide Squad comics that were so excellently written by John Ostrander. Characters like Peacemaker, Bronze Tiger, Nightshade, Black Thorn were missed. Evil characters like Kobra and/or The Crimson Jihad could have easily provided an impetus for an excellent story line.An incomplete incoherent chaotic mess of a movie, the story line suppurated like Lovecraftian flotsam and jetsam slime without a beginning, middle, or end. The loud flashes of photosensitive epilepsy (reminiscent of Cyber Soldier Porygon) failed to charm the dullest of viewers. There was no great reason to assemble hardened criminals together except for Waller's "...making people work against their wishes" rant. I get the Dirty Dozen slant to the whole Suicide Squad thing ? but where is the story, people??? In a setting such as this, where you get a bunch of villains and anti-heroes into a swirl, you need to have a catch with all of them. First off, Deadshot's inaccurate portrayal of a supportive daughter can, however, still be passed off as a reason to let Lawton serve in the Squad and pine for freedom. Why Croc? Why Harley? Why Boomerbutt? Why Diablo? This is a team that is not meant for keeps ? this is a team that arises as the effect of a cause.In the 2nd World War, there were teams of criminals both from the Allied and Axis who were thrust to the forefront and forgotten. They were men who were sadistic and callous and without a hope in hell. But then, they were the effect of a cause. During the ravaged days of the war, with dwindling soldiers and dipping morale, the two sides needed every able finger on the trigger.The mistake, with Suicide Squad is that, there is no reason to assemble Task Force X, except to stop Superman. The reason ? aka, the cause, was lame and not convincing enough in the context of the 120 minute film. A team of heroes is assembled only when there is a cause, and a team of super villains is assembled only when there is no hope left. Enchantress/Incubus could have been that cause, although I was half expecting them to pull out the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from their kitty. Who you gonna call? Not Task Force X. Can I get my money back please?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small good things, but as whole bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this trailer when I went to see X-Men: Apocalypse and then again when I went to see Ghostbusters. The trailer made me very optimistic. Before the trailer I thought that this was not worth seeing. I know, I should've learnt by now that trailers are always better than the actual movie: the movie itself shattered all my hopes towards this movie. Writing in this movie is partially good. The idea of the script is good: let's give the bad guys a chance. Characters are deep, and it's easy to start liking them. They all have backstories, and some are explored. They give the characters something more than "LOL we are just bad and crazy". The only thing is I hate the Joker, but all the other characters were extremely interesting. But the writing is partially horrible. The dialogue seems kinda off. You see what's meant to be funny but it doesn't necessarily make you laugh. And it seems like this movie is trying to smooch off of Deadpool's success, considering he's an antihero, and he had that hilarious yet dark movie. If Suicide Squad wasn't trying to be like Deadpool meets Avengers except in DC universe, then their timing wasn't exactly the greatest.But I don't want to start saying which one is better DC or Marvel. Both are good yet both suck. I'm just saying, the timing was bad.When I watch a movie like this, I have high hopes for the action scenes, especially when technology is getting better and all that. In Suicide Squad, the action scenes are poorly executed. They are messy and it's hard to see what is going on and who is who. I mistook Boomerang for Rick Flag at one point and the dialogue was very confusing. Action scenes are allowed to be messy if they look interesting. These scenes were just shooting, and that's not exactly interesting to watch.I loved most of the actors chosen for this movie. I love Will Smith, I love Margot Robbie, Karen Fukuhara, Jay Hernandez and Viola Davis (and of course Affleck, even if his role is small in Suicide Squad). Now I don't exactly like Cara Delevingne's acting skills, but still there's something much worse in the cast: Jared Leto. I've seen him in two movies before this, so I haven't seen that much acting from him but he is definitely not the right choice for Joker. He's just a disastrously bad copy of Heath Ledger. But the cast is amazingly diverse. Visually this movie is amazing. It's very dark, like David Fincher's movies. That's effective, though sometimes you don't even see who is in the scene. The bright neon colours give a nice touch to the movie.The best part of Suicide Squad is the soundtrack. Few of my favourites include Heathens by Twenty One Pilots, Fortunate Son by CCR, Bohemian Rhapsody, Spirit in the Sky, Seven Nation Army. I can't stand Eminem, but Without Me by him suited this film very well. All are amazing, but still, Bohemian Rhapsody was used better in the trailer - it's really hard to put in an actual scene, no matter how awesome that song is.Suicide Squad has many amazing details, but as a whole it isn't great. The idea is good, but eventually the story is boring. It seems like the film is just destroying stuff, explosions and shooting and smooching off of amazing characters. The characters deserve better movies. I heard there might be a spin-off for Harley Quinn, that's amazing. But I want to see the others in their own movies as well, like Katana and Deadshot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This feels like an unfinished movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was VERY anticipated for this movie, just like everyone else, and I gotta say... I am disappointed.Let me begin with the positives. I like the cast. Margot Robbie was fantastic as Harley Quinn. Will Smith was also very good in the role, which was a big surprise for me. Also was Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez and even Jai Courtney was good. Many people complains about Jared Leto as Joker and I thought, with all the 15 minutes of screen time he had, I thought he did an OK job. I liked all of the Batman scenes, made me even more excited for the solo Batman movie.Now on to the negatives. The trailer made it seem like The Joker had a big role in the movie, which he didn't. Something they could've done was to remove Joker from all of the trailers and the marketing. And also all of his scenes in the movie except for the last scene where he saves Harley Quinn from the prison cell, that way his entrance to the DC-universe would have been more surprising and effective. But now you're just sitting there wondering:"How the hell did he survive the helicopter crash" because they never explain it. Another flaw I had was that the character Katana only has two lines in the entire movie, and that would've been fine if they didn't throw in that five second scene where they try to make us care about her by explaining that her husband got killed by her sword. Boomerang is completely boring and useless. I mean what do we know about him? He has a teddy bear he likes... And that's it. Something else I didn't like was that they tried to make us think that they are all best friends in the end, but you don't buy it at all because their chemistry is very weak.I would still recommend the film because it seems like people are very split about the movie, so it's really more about what taste you have. I didn't like it, but maybe you do...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype behind this film was incredible and especially after the not so hot Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice movie that was previously launched by DC Comics.People were hoping that this would be the movie to jump start new life into the DC Comics movie universe and maybe start to become more competitive with the Marvel Comics hugely successful movie franchise and unfortunately this movie didn't make the cut.This movie had a lot to live up to but undoubtedly could not live up to the expectations of the public.Saying that however this movie isn't a complete waste of time. I don't regret watching it but i do however have to say that Dc Comics have a lot to catch up on.Batman is featured in this film and I do feel that Ben Affleck is growing on me as batman.Ben Affleck should however be given his own stand alone Batman movie so that the public is able to better grasp the type of Batman he is trying to portray.Suicide Squad gives us the back stories of the characters in this film with some characters getting a bigger back story than others.The Joker in this film didn't work really well as they tried to make him too cliché.The story line in this movie was confusing and jumped around too much. There was no real direction and the movie was more focused on Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The characters in this movie also struggled with their identity and when the movie was coming to a close the end scene didn't really need to happen.It was good that they still let the audience know that The Joker is alive but they could have done that in another way that could have lead to a much more interesting sequel.The film was of a low standard with maybe a fresh group of writers and a new director helping the film reach that new level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Had Potential but Fell Short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-SPOILERS-I really want to like this movie, I really do. I like all the actors/actresses (Especially Will Smith), but unfortunately I'm not here to rate the actors, I'm here to rate the movie. The problem with this movie is not the actors/actresses, rather, everything else.The movie is weak in all other aspects. To get the villain out of the way, she's a strong witch that I actually liked a lot. Unfortunately, she got dumb down to a 'stupid' villain that could destroy the world but doesn't. Instead, she wastes time dancing and doing pesky things that does nothing but buy the Suicide Squad time to stop her, of course. The witch and her brother pretty much took over the whole city, killing the army like it's butter and not getting harmed by anything thrown at them. This is ridiculous because guess how they died? The witch was cut with a sword and the brother was killed with a bomb, one that really shouldn't be powerful enough to stop him. This very anti-climatic outcome got me shaking my head and saying to myself, 'really? lame!' (Extremely unbelievable and hard to buy)Moving on to the humor. It's painful to say the least. Most of the humor in the movie don't just feel rushed, they ARE rushed and you know it. I cringed more than a couple times at how awkward and embarrassing the jokes were and something tells me there's no way in hell the actors didn't feel the same way. Removing all of the cheesy 'one-liners' will make the movie many times better. The suicide squad is more of like the suicide duo. The whole movie is focused on Deadshot and Harley Quinn, with the rest thrown in so they can change 'duo' to 'squad.' They rarely get screen time, they don't get a decent introduction or backstory. They rarely talk or have any dialogue at all and to make it worse, they're usually the ones making the lame and cheesy jokes. Most of them aren't even needed and their attempt to cover that up with a simple scene for each person wasn't enough to convince me. It was like me playing varsity basketball in school. I was benched all season until finals, never made a shot, played a few seconds near the end, got a few assists, and got my gold medal. Yea, baby!Joker... what a joke! (Not in a good way). I actually liked the actor, he did a great job and I enjoyed seeing him. The problem, again, has nothing to do with the actors. You pretty saw all there was to see of the Joker in the trailers, minus a few short scenes that shows him saving Harley Quinn. Doesn't really make a big impact in the movie as just kind of just 'there.' Amanda Waller, the person who was responsible for everything that happened was not very convincing. They keep trying to present her as some sort of hardcore 'bad-ass' but she really doesn't seem like it. She comes off as a 'tryhard' and someone who you think would have been killed a long time ago but for some reason, she's still alive. And that is confusing and it takes away from the experience. Even Deadshot makes a comment on it near the end of the movie.Story/pacing is pretty much like what people are saying. It's a two hour movie that feels like it's only 30 minutes long, but not in a good way. You sit down, feel like the movie just started, start to get ready for the good stuff to happen, nothing happens and it's over. It feels like it's only 30 minutes long because it feels like there's not much to it. To make the movie better they need to cut out the bad jokes and one- liners. They need to have more character backstory/development or have the characters be more involved with each other. They need to give the villains a brain and have them actually pose a threat and force the protagonists to actually collaborate with each other, learn something new or become more creative to stop the villain. Not dumb down the villain so they all essentially kill themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a real-life suicide. This movie left a big awful bloody mess. Still, it was alright entertaining movie for the most part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The marketing for this film has been pretty amazing. The playful neon overlaying the normally gritty aesthetic is great, and the perfectly-timed trailers to rock band, Panic! At the Disco &amp; singer Becky Hanson's version of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' &amp; Bee Gees 'I Started a Joke'. Even singers, Grace's 'You Don't Own Me' and 'Sweet's Ballroom Blitz' trailers just knocked it out of the park. It made me, want to see this movie about a group of special-ability incarcerated criminals: sharpshooter, Deadshot/Floyd Lawton (Will Smith), crazy Harley Quinn/Harleen Quinzel (Margot Robbie), bandit Captain Boomerang/George 'Digger' Harkness (Jai Courtney), gangsta El Diablo/Chato Santana (Jay Hernandez), and Killer Croc/Waylon Jones (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) being recruited into a secret, deniable and expendable government task force under the directorship of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis); in exchange for reduced sentences, and not having their heads blown off by bombs planted in their skulls. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is very watchable, however, like the Joker (Jared Leto) says in this film. 'I'm just gonna hurt you, really, really bad'. Indeed, I will, fanboys. I was very disappointed with this movie based off the DC comic book of the same name, directed by David Ayer. It was very mediocre. It didn't lived up to the hype. This movie committed suicide, by trying too hard to copy other films styles like 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy', with that of 2012's 'Avengers', with a slice of 1981's 'Escape from New York', added to it. It didn't seem original. First off, you can tell that this film had some studio inference as the writing and dialogue is all over the place. First off, you got, way too many characters and themes being introduce in one movie. You can't force the whole idea of the DC Extended Universe in one film. Supernatural themes like ancient gods attacking earth, don't mixed well, with Gotham gritty crime drama. Like really, how was the crazy woman with a bat supposed to stop a God-like being!? It makes no sense. It's so sloppy forced and shoe-horn into the writing. Honestly, the film would had been better, if they never did establish the Enchantress/ Dr. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) story-like, but if they did, have her, face Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), or better yet, Hawkgirl since it's Midway City. Anyways, the Enchantress's killer 'light in the sky' weapon is such a tiresome clichés. Didn't we see this, before-like, 2013's 'Man of Steel'!? If anything, I thought, the movie's plot should had been more grounded, and should had the squad hunt down the Joker, because his popular character clearly has been underused, here. Plus, criminals hunting down criminals, make more sense! Another thing, wrong with this film. It seems like Warner Bros really wanted to lighten up the source material, after the critical failure of 2016's 'Batman Vs Superman'. The overused of licensed pop songs in the film, was annoying. Not only does it show that DC Studios trying to mirror Marvel Studios style with the 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy' like soundtrack, but some of the music, used didn't serve much for the plot. It was very jarring. The writing and dialogue is just awful, particularly the second half of the movie, where things started to make no sense and the jokes fall flat. There were very few moments in which, I kinda laugh. Half of the time, I spent, scratching my head, due to the bad editing. Way too much flashbacks, and quick cuts. It really screw up the pacing. Lots of repetitive exposition moments. Also, the film is so chopped up extensively, that the action was hard to see. First off, way too much scenes fighting in the darkness! Second off, fighting in rain, smoke and fog, doesn't help, make the visuals, any better. The CGI was alright, but nothing worth writing about. The action was also a bit, too unrealistic. Now, that he got that of the way, here is some of the positive things about the film. The characters were very memorable, and likable, even if they made, the mercenary Slipknot/Christopher Weiss (Adam Beach) into an expendable character and introduce Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana (Karen Fukuhara) far too late in the film. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a stand out. She really does get the character's quips, despite being sexualized like Enchantress. Both female characters are way too young to be, doctors and scientists. Anyways, Robbie's character is probably the main reason to see this film, even if Harley wasn't in the original squad from the comics. Will Smith as Deadshot was also amazing, even if he seem a bit tired. Jared Leto as The Joker is a mixed bag, since he was forced in, as a last minute decision. Since he wasn't in the film, much. I can't say, if I hate the character or not. I also, don't know, how to feel about the tone-down version of the abusively relationship with Harley. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the government official pulling all the strings. She does her job well; a reserve, stern, credible performance. Other characters worth nothing is Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerrang and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. Both were great in their limited roles. The cameos of Batman/Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) and the Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) was also cool to see. Overall: I don't like bashing the film, but I'm uncertain why DC feel the need to rush into blending their cinematic universe, instead of taking their time to establish the characters in stand-alone films. There's far more money to be made making a single film, then an ensemble movie. So many squandered opportunities, and I really hoped this would be great. C'mon DC, these characters and your audience deserve much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you tired of those same old superhero movies? Do you want something a little bit different? Yes? So hows about instead of SuperHEROES we have SuperVILLAINS as our protagonists? That may or may not be how a meeting at Warner Brothers went down, but still the proposed idea of villains instead of heroes (helped a hell of a lot by the films fantastic marketing campaign) got millions of people pumped up and made this the film the most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2016... But with so much hype surrounding the film the likelihood of disappointment grows higher, and in this particular case, the film is very disappointing.I should probably start with what was good about this film, and I think if there is one positive thing we can all agree on, it's that the soundtrack was really good. There are songs from such great musicians like The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Queen, Eminem and Twenty One Pilots just to name a few (Don't even get me started on the number artists on Sucker For Pain). The films opening 10, 20 minutes is literally good song, after good song, after good song for like 5 or 6 songs straight. So regardless of the films quality the soundtrack for this should hopefully sell well.Another good thing about this film is what the actors do with their characters. Will Smith plays a Will Smith version of Deadshot, Margot Robbie is pretty brilliant as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto does a decent if brief portrayal as the Joker even if his presence is kinda irrelevant (Jared is nothing on Heath though). Although some actors spread there wings and fly with their characters, others are unfortunately never given the opportunity. Aside from those I've mentioned (and Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag I guess) everyone else is just there for the ride. Killer Croc, Captain Boomarang, Enchantress and Katana are given very little to do (Most notably Killer Croc who is probably one of the only character you knew about before this film happened). I'm not sure if its a case of tow-many-characters-spoil-the-broth but the focus in extremely disproportionate between the members of the squad.Suicide Squad suffers with some of the same problems as Batman v Superman, most notably the plot and its messy attempt at a unformulaic structure. The first 30 minutes or so simply introduces characters, but it only really introduces Deadshot and Harley and there isn't really much that is actually revealed about them other than Deadshot is the best hit-man ever and has a kid that is his world, and Harley was a doctor who treated and fell for the Joker and went batsh*t crazy. Also the mission they are on is unknown to us as well as the Squad, but you can kind of guess by putting two and two together which some will but some won't. So pretty much all you get for most of the film is thinly layered character introductions who are set on an unknown suicide mission. We knew more than this walking into the cinema screen. Oh I almost forgot about the oddly placed occasional flashback sequences like the Harley jumping into a toxic vat and making gross love with the Joker scene... They happen for some reason.This film is called Suicide SQUAD and yet the squad never at any point feels like a team. The film fails to form any kind of on screen bond/ chemistry with anyone (except Deadshot and Harley maybe). The film instead seems to have characters make dramatic shifts in their way of thinking for example; Diablo won't fight and get involved with the squad (albiet for a different reason other than not liking them) then suddenly they are his "family" and he, SPOILER ALERT, dies fighting for them. Another extreme out of character good to bad switch is evident in the scene where Amanda Waller leaves her control centre and joins the suicide squad on foot. This character has seemed rather fair thus far in the film... and then she guns down the entire control room, she may not have been all good but this seemed way to far of a leap to the dark side.Overall Suicide Squad suffers from a messy plot, thin character depth and a lot of underused characters, but at least the actors gave it their all and the soundtrack is dope. The DCEU is off to one hell of a rocky start that I, along with millions of others, must be thinking, the only way is up for batsy and his little band of misfits. Right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Man of Steel" was entertaining, "Batman vs. Superman" a forced mess, where everything was rushed to install a copycat of the success from the MCU, without explanations, an lousy script, and, of course "Martha", the peak of ridiculousness."Suicide Squad" marks the new low of a downfall.Although some characters promised real depth and substance, from the first minute on they were pushed into the story, undeveloped and soulless.Jared Leto as Joker is a treat of this cult-character from comics, some others permanently gave me the question "Why?", Captain Boomerang was such an example. This character is totally unnecessary, like Katana, Killer Croc etc.If some DC-fanboy will complain about Marvel-villains (yes, they are mostly weak), Enchantress lowed all of them, including Malekith and the Mandarin.This was the last movie I watched from this intentionally cash-cow.DCCU, you've been dead on arrival, now I'm sure.</fullReview>

Probably b/c all Margot Robbie's jokes were lame, as well, which made her simply annoying, in my opinion. And I was ready to transform into her. LOL Enchantress was the worst of it all. Her belly dancing through the movie was so cheap and just stupid. Not a cool or impressive villain AT ALL. Cara definitely didn't own that part what so ever.The whole movie is basically Will Smith's story about him and his daughter, blah blah blah and annoying Margot Robbie.I had to immediately go home and watch Avengers just so I can watch a GOOD Comic Book movie. A good action movie is supposed to blow your mind and be like, "I didn't expect that coming!" Well...not one time did I think "That was a cool scene".

There has been almost no regard to the source material. The director is armature at best, clumsy and messy most of the time. The only good scene was added by Zack Snyder which stood heads and shoulders above this mediocre film. Avoid. The cast was generally good, though I thought Will Smith looked and sounded like the fresh prince on a Halloween Night special. I would rate this a FF4 type of disaster. not something I would pay to see again or even the first time if I was so forewarned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I'm one of those people whose first review in this site is not out of love, but out of hate. I confess: I was appalled by this movie and everything it entailed. And I'm here to rant.If somebody asks me in the next few days (until I can shrug the rant off): "What's wrong with the world?" I'm going to say "That movie, Suicide Squad". The very thought that this movie exists, a truckload of money invested in it, and people going "wow awesome!" is what's wrong with the world. I guess that's what happens when everything and anything around you today operates as some kind of "upper". And this movie is yet another box of uppers: every element that goes into the art of cinema - sound (echo that laughter), music (shuffle: on), editing (don't stop time is money gogogo!), character development ("that's slipknot, man who can climb anything"), plot (belly-dancer who wants to destroy the world with an army of people turned into goo ***SPOILER ALERT*** is defeated by BAD BUT SOPHISTICATED people), cinematography (MAGIC TENTACLES! KABOOM!!) - each act as some sort of stimulant to get you "up" on your seat, with the obligatory trivialized sexuality thrown in ("wow that woman is a stunner, and she's crazy!"), for a full 2 hours. For the young and eager it can result in a trip (a bad one that you'll regret later), for others who've been there it's likely to bring you down instead. I guess back in the day I did have a more tolerant approach like "meh, it is what it is." Or maybe I was somewhere between that and "this is BS". Now I'm firmly at "this is BS and I want my 2 hours back". And you know what... Even BS used to have some dignity, and integrity. To end this on a less rantish note. Do yourself a favor and watch "Assault on Arkham" instead. Or play one of those Batman video games (or watch a "game movie" version of it on youtube)... Or maybe stare at a wall and think about things... Oh well, there goes the less rantish note.</fullReview>

BvS turned out to be an okay fare and would've stayed that way until that 'Martha thingy' which just ruined all the fun for me.This is a Will Smith movie and boy he is solid as Deadshot! Surprisingly JK's Rick Flagg does a marvelous job as well and both Deadshot/Flagg chemistry is something to look for on-screen.Many say Margot Robbie was born to play Harley. Yup, right! Her love or I'd like to call madness for Mr. J and subsequent descend into crazy is portrayed compellingly. To those complaining "no screen time for Joker", to them uhh.. I say "get a life" cos The Joker is not integral to the movie plot, he's more here as a treat to the fans and reference to Harley Quinn's story arc. In no way, NO WAY, does JL ever comes close to the Ledger's version (no one can surpass that).. not in this lifetime!! The real show stealer for me was El Diablo. Firstly, he's super cool with his pyro power and secondly he's just.. super cool. Other characters were fab too; Katana (ass-kicker), Croc and Boomerang (not much to do tho).The new hottie Cara Delevigne as Enchantress was a delight. Been on her trail after having watched PAPER TOWNS (don't judge). Overall a complete entertainer, good 3D, action, humor, &amp; soundtrack.Special praise for Viola Davis's character as Amanda Waller -- one cold hearted bitch she turned out to be. David Ayer kudos! DC/WB still a long way to go (8.5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DC Universe has only begun its unveiling. Do you think what lies ahead is promising if the 2016 releases are of any indication of what is in store for us?First it was "The Bat" taking on the "Son of Krypton" in a disputably excessive run time (Although the DC Universe has a lot of groundwork to set up for the 2017 line up). Second ? SUICIDE SQUAD!Deadshot (Will Smith) wants to be the only villain of Gotham City. Trapped between the greed of power to reign as the Alpha in Gotham, and the tears of his daughter, he is apprehended by Batman and is incarcerated. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) &amp; Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) employed by a secret government agency are attempting to recruit Deadshot, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Slipknot (Adam Beach) to run secret black-ops missions as deniable assets for the agency. This team of supervillains are assembled sooner than foreseen when yet another asset escapes and goes rouge creating havoc across the city. The Irony of all this ? the asset that goes rouge, is none other than June Moone (Cara Delevingne) the lover of team leader Rick Flag. In terms of a plot, there is absolutely too much going on already and The Joker (Jared Leto) is not even in the picture yet.Directed &amp; Written by David Ayer SUICIDE SQUAD is a half-baked visual marvel. It has everything that a superhero/supervillain movie should have in the department of its original soundtrack, the CGI, makeup and costuming. What baffles me is the fact of what Warner Bros was thinking when the screenplay was initially approved for production? At least with the Marvel Franchises the backstories were clearly laid for each character prior to the Assembly, The Bat Vs SM too can be excused since Nolan and Snyder told the story before. Unless you grew up reading every single comic book, you will be lost in this debacle of a screenplay. The writing is in shambles but David Ayer and his cast certainly didn't take a knife to a gun fight. They gear up, cover up most of the loopholes and punch their way through. Even absolutely short-lived, the Jared Leto performance is Gold. Don't bat your eyes or the joker will be gone! If the character was written better, his performance would have made an AA nod in 2017, but with this screenplay its unlikely.The elephant in the room? Will Smith? Let's agree that he is the money man aka "The Face" for this blockbuster. Would it have been better to star someone else? No, Will Smith does it alright. A noteworthy performance on the other hand, falling behind Leto, is Margot Robbie, every second of her Harley is entertaining, enthusiastic and authentic, seems like she did a lot of research to pull this one off on such a high level. How I hope for a standalone movie of Harley and her pudding. Fanboys will be excited. New to the genre? Best read up on your comics. You may find a ring tone for your phone too.TITLE: SUICIDE SQUAD DIRECTED BY: David AYER STARRING: WILL SMITH, VIOLA DAVIS, JOEL KINNAMAN, MARGOT ROBBIE, JAI COURTNEY, JAY HERNANDEZ, ADEWALE AKINNUOYE-AGBAJE, ADAM BEACH, CARA DELVINGNE, KAREN FUKUHARA &amp; JARED LETO RATED: PG13 RATING: 06/10 RUNTIME: 123 MINUTES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad and not good, but somewhere in between</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the trailers for this movie multiple time, I was super pumped for this film. After reading early reviews, I became very worried. Once I saw the film though, I was left confused. This movie certainly isn't as bad as critics are saying it is, but definitely not a "good" movie. What I really enjoyed was the action. It was a ton of fun and I couldn't help but smile throughout it. The characters Harley Quinn and Deadshot were good in the film. I also really liked the Joker in the film, but I can't help to compare him to past Jokers such as Heath Ledger's Joker. A lot of things drag this film down though. The editing in this film, oh my God, it's all over the place and is just weird. The rest of the characters are also very flat and bland, especially the main villain. It's no wonder why they left her out of the trailers! The climax to the film wasn't anything special either, cliché just like a lot of the lines of dialogue said in this film! All in all though, this is your average popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and Choppy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying that "Suicide Squad" was, among Batman V Superman one of the films I wanted to watch the most this year. And now that I've watched it, I can tell you that while financially it might turn out a bigger hit than what we previously thought, it isn't the hit that the DCEU needed to clear all doubts and ghosts after Dawn of Justice. I can't hide it, I'm a big DC fan, Batman is my favourite comic-book hero and I grew up watching Nolan's Trilogy. Maybe Nolan set a very high-bar on other comic book films to follow and when I go to the theater to watch anything DC-related, I wanna come out surprised and happy. With Suicide Squad, although that happened to some extent, I was much more prone to wonder on how much did the so call suits interfere with the process of making this one, because, although David Ayer has repeatedly stated that this is HIS cut (the contrary would definitely cause some turmoil), I believe he had a somewhat different vision for this months ago.Let me just say that contrary to what I've listened and read from some reviewers, the first half hour of the film was very painful to watch for me. The way the presented each member of the squad (not each because they inexplicably forgot Spliknot - even if he's appearance in all of this is very brief) seemed so wrong and out-of-place. Ayer's first idea, at least from what I gather was not to have the flashy flashbacks, opting for a linear presentation instead. I don't know why this was removed, but I think this way it would've been much better. The poor editing didn't help it at all and I often found myself wondering why they'd make it this way, which was, at least for me, childish sometimes.After that point I honestly enjoyed the film, and I realised I was doing so on the first big action scene, when the Squad fights the faceless hordes of "zombies" spawned by Enchantress and her brother. Deadshot climbing on top of a car and clearing out the street was simply amazing.Major thumbs up for the casting department. I don't know how Tom Hardy would turn out as Rick Flagg but let me say that Joel Kinnaman fits the role very well. Nothing to say about Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Viola Davis and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje cause the really seemed like they were born to play their role.The two major biggies I had with this:--- The Villain --- Cara Delevingne is a fine actress for me, but Enchantress is blend and clichéd as the villain. Lack of motivation, no character development, just the same old game we've been seeing for the past decade. Its the convention, and since this movie revolves around the Worst Heroes Ever, one would thought they'd find a more developed and well built villain to pose a threat.--- The Joker ---I've seen many criticizing Leto, I've seen many worshiping him but right now, I can't quite make my mind about his performance. He has already stated that many scenes of his character were cut, scenes that had even been incorporated on the trailers (suits meddling?) and I guess I'll have to wait for is next on-screen presence to decide.You're not going to watch this for the plot , you're going to watch this for the spectacle. That's why you're buying the ticket.Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC shows improvement, but still disappoints with Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into 2016, Suicide Squad was actually my second most anticipated superhero movie behind only Captain America Civil War. The marketing team did an absolute superb job selling this movie through some of excellently edited trailers and an surprisingly good original soundtrack, an addition that should be considered by more studios. By the time August came around, I had reached a level of excitement almost equal to that of Guardians of The Galaxy. Unfortunately, I left the theatre disappointed, but hopeful for the future of DC films. OK, so I know my tone may seem overly negative, but let me say that I really did enjoy the film. Much like Batman V. Superman, it does not deserve the reviews it's been getting from critics. The film improves upon DC's previous outing by introducing a much more lighthearted tone, at least for the film's first half, crafting a more clear and linear story, and also featuring better character development. Suicide Squad has many of the elements of a typical summer blockbuster which can't help but make it entertaining. While it may not have met my expectations, it still proved to be another enjoyable superhero movie, and that's enough for me. However, as I previously mentioned, this film has an abundance of flaws. While I did do a good amount of nit-picking, there a couple of particular problems that can't be ignored. The first lies in Suicide Squad's villain. I'm sure I'm not the first to say it, but just about everything about the Enchantress is bad. To begin, she was mistakenly marketed as being a member of the team, which lead many (including me) to believe Monster T would be the villain! Her "host" or whatever June Moore adds absolutely nothing to the story. Her brother is just a big pile of confusing CGI mess. Finally, her evil plan to destroy the world is given no backstory or motivation. Suicide Squad also suffers from an editing process that structures the movie in a very unusual way that screws up the pacing as well as the overall tone of the movie, which makes a dramatic shift from lighthearted and fun to dark and gritty. Finally, there's the Joker. I thought Jared Leto did a great job creating one of the most unique Joker's that has ever been portrayed on the big screen. However, I believe there isn't enough of him in the movie to formulate a fair assessment of his performance. One thing I can criticize is his role in the movie, which I felt did not fit. The Joker is mainly just there for some flashbacks that make the mistake of cramming a movie's worth of backstory into a couple of scenes. I understand that he wasn't supposed to have a major role, but I believe the tease David Ayer did give us did not fully represent the notorious Clown Prince of Crime. Suicide Squad is full of potential, and I believe going forward, this will be a great learning opportunity for DC. It shows how to successfully market a movie, provides a glimpse of how to incorporate a more lighthearted tone without being campy, and also displays the importance of proper character development. Repeat this process and then improve upon the movie's faults, and nothing would stop me from seeing a Suicide Squad 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie... Definitely not at Jared leto level of brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the movie is good in many aspects. you would find it enjoyable if you had not expected much from this Squad. but for me i was waiting to see a director that could handle this type of movies. unfortunately i didn't find anything overwhelmingTHE COMEDY PART: it was a major disappointment, i really couldn't even smile. Margot Robbie IS NOT A COMEDIAN AT ALL. I don't know if it was the lines that are not that good or it was her that couldn't deliver it well. to sum up, the comedy lines were more than sick for me. THE ACTION PART: it was above average on the first half yet so superficially taken on the second half. it was normal for DC to deliver such performance on their movies, but for such marketing budgets you need to have a better view for action scenes.THE STORY PART: a very good story that could have much more intense but unfortunately it was not quiet phenomenal. i mean, DC always been able to deliver better comics than this. the introduction part for the characters was really good, actually hilarious. but as you go to the end it is going to be normal or less than normal.THE ACTING PART: i always had faith on Jared Leto sophisticated style on making his characters and this time was no exception. he delivered a world-class performance and created his own joker that i would love to see him in upcoming movies for DC. Jared was quiet phenomenal i would give him A+. Will Smith was good as always. he continued him good work on his latest movies and did a very handsome and good performance. Margot Robbie was never comedy and was abit cheesy at her scenes. i didn't love her in that movie at all, although i loved her so much at Wolf of Wall street which definitely showed her as a good actress but i couldn't find any reason to see her above those classic female actress of these days. she is good but not that good. the other performances were very good as well. which really implies that the director was not good for showing a well built movie to us.to sum it all up. it is not a failure for DC, yet not a hit. but we can say it is worth your time definitely because you would see a classic joker and will Smith doing good performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extremely extremely excited for this movie! I was just as hyped for it as I was Star Wars! I wanted to love this movie! Sadly I can't! It's not an awful movie, but it has a lot of flaws! The characters are all great in their own way, and the action is pretty entertaining! Sadly the plot is too big! Suicide squad has this urge to be big and bad and take place on a huge scale, which doesn't blend well with the characters at all! The Villain is very poorly executed, and doesn't add anything to the movie. The actors chosen played the roles very well, but the camera work and editing were very chopping and not appealing! The editing was very bad, for such a high budget film! The movie had a lot of moments where certain things didn't make sense, or wasn't explained or were just really dumb. I really wanted to love this movie, and I loved certain aspects of it, Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and the entire team I want more of in a much better movie! Hopefully we see more of the characters, but we need better writing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge DC fan I couldn't wait to see this film, most of it didn't disappoint. If you have read new 52 suicide squad this is so true to the comics you won't be disappointed. Robbie and Smith are fantastic and the plot is fun although it misses most of the laugh out loud moments a MCU film has. Lots of folks are talking about the tonal shift half was through (which is more like 25% of the way in) but that made sense to me. The squad start in prison, have nothing to loose and the film demonstrates that by bring jovial. Later in as they are put on a suicide mission their bad ass nature emerges and proves why these guys are in super max. Then the bad, and I mean horrific......I love the joker, I have him tattooed on my body, I like 30 seconds to Mars Jared Leto's band but the combination of the 2 left a very sour taste.When he first appeared I thought I got where they where going, not wanting to copy Nolans/Ledgers vision of the character they where turning him into a psycho mob boss, the novelty lasted 30 seconds to hell then I wanted to see him gone. This portrayal has no redeeming features, he is naff beyond all belief, just horrid. And this isn't in a Joffrey GoT style it's he's so hammy you want to walk out when he's on screen. This film will be great on blu-ray where the joker parts but all in all very much enjoyed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful direction and screen writing. This movie is plagued with awkward and anticlimactic scenes. Seriously, can this David Ayer suck less?Making a movie about illogical people is no excuse to deprive it of ANY LOGIC at all.- First of all, the non-villain characters are completely unlikeable. Flag and Waller act like condescending scumbag all the time. Waller is worse. She's like begging to be hated in every single scene. Why would David try so hard to make people hate a black woman??- The whole disaster of the movie that the Suicide Squad had to fix was caused one of their members - Enchantress. If that project X (that creates the Suicide Squad) was not initiated in the first place, then there'd be no such disaster.- Enchantress caused the disaster by releasing her brother, an almighty being that could wipe out the whole city, even the world. However, ever since she was released by June Moore, she had plenty of chances to do that because she could instantly teleport to anywhere. But she ended up waiting all the time. That means she's one of the strongest but also dumbest creatures on Earth.- Harley Quinn proved her love to Joker by plunging into tanks of chemical toxic from at least the 5th floor, then was saved by just one kiss full of Joker love.- When Waller found out Enchantress betrayed, she stabbed its heart multiple times, but didn't destroy it at all (!!) so that Enchantress could retrieve it later effortlessly and revive. If Waller simply destroyed that heart, the movie wouldn't happen. - There were no character development and some characters were treated like trash. Slipknot as a Suicide Squad member appeared just to be killed disgracefully right at the beginning. Boomerang is also an insignificant character because the movie wouldn't change at all with or without him.- Joker heroically appeared to save Harley Quinn just to be shot down immediately. Isn't he smart???- Enchantress's brother, a Godlike being who devastated a whole city, was killed in an instant with a bomb that barely punched a hole on the ground.- Almost all scenes with Waller were unpalatable, awkward, and anticlimactic, especially the ending of the final boss was defeated. Can David Ayer make the lasting moment of his movies less suck???Overall, I can't stand this state of plummeting movie standards anymore. I would vote a 1 and encourage everyone not to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential is Wasted by a Muddled Plot,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a mediocre movie with a mostly poorly developed plot, despite a top notch cast. The performances are certainly the highlight of the movie, even if they are not all stunning, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto class up the joint. Smith brings in excellent emotional depth, as well as heart, to the role of Deadshot, ending up being the only character that you really sympathise for, his relationship with his daughter is the most compelling aspect. Robbie really brings this bizarre comic book character to life in a humorous, dedicated performance. Jared Leto certainly shines as the Joker, though he may be no Ledger or Nicholson, he brings his own originality to the role, using his unique acting style, he is creepy, lovable in a weird way and has an amazing presence, I hope to see all three of these actors in future films set in this universe. The plot was all over the place, we are given far too many characters to follow, giving us no one to grasp a full understanding of, there is a lack of connection with every character as we had no one to actually follow. The Enchantress story was extremely out of place and absurd, there was too much magic and witchcraft involved that we, as an audience, could not be expected to believe. It was a strange plot line and is where the majority of exaggeration comes from. It had so much potential, being an original superhero film that actually puts the villains in the spotlight, but it wastes this by trying to fit far too much in to one movie, too many characters, too many set pieces, too much set ups for future films, it is overwhelming, but it still manages to end with us not feeling one bit stimulated. As well as that, the majority of scenes have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever, Joker and Batman, the two most famous characters in this, served no importance at all other than to grace the audience with their presence. The first act, the first thirty minutes or so, is terrific, it boasts a great soundtrack and loads of great, quirky comedy, it's what the entire film should have been, but after a while, it starts to take itself too seriously and begins to jump in to very similar, dull, predictable territories. There is so much good in Suicide Squad that it is a pity that it is overrun by the weak spots, if you are a fan of this universe and these characters, you should still check it out and see for yourself, but I would not recommend it other than that. A group of ruthless villains are signed up by the government to use their unique abilities to save the world, despite the lack of interest they have in it. Best Performance: Will Smith / Worst Performance: Viola Davis</fullReview>

The character's origin stories are not generic (except Katana who just comes out of nowhere) like they sometimes are and every character ends up being extremely unique and cool. The jokes never failed and the movie is all in all just very original. The action scenes are very good and many people may think the story is a mess which more or less true. The story is not exactly a mess but rather extremely simplistic which is forgivable because at this point you just want to see the characters interact and of course their interactions are great. I tried to choose a favorite character but they're all so great that I wasn't able. All in all Suicide Squad is my favorite movie of the year so far and I recommend it to people who are wishing to just have fun and don't care about a simple story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read many of the negative reviews which sum up how bad this movie is. The plot is a mess. The story is terrible. As I watched this movie I started to think of the numerous people who made this movie. They were paid a lot of money to use their expertise to make a great movie. Think of all the hype. Then you watch it...only to discover it is a complete disaster. At my job, my boss demands perfection. Things must be done right or don't do them at all. We all have boss (or leaders) who keep everyone on track and demand a vision based on what is right and meets or exceeds a standard of quality. The makers of this film (and many in Hollywood) just don't care anymore. Why? Because they do not have to. This movie is a pile of garbage but it doesn't matter. The movie will still make millions just with people seeing that it is garbage. People have so much free time, they will waste it watching junk because it has been hyped that you must see it. So the masses will pay to see it. How sad this is? I have some advice for those writers in Hollywood: read Shakespeare and learn the basics of storytelling. Learn what a plot is and demand that is make sense. Demand perfection from yourself and from others. For far too long, mediocre was within budget or just didn't matter to be perfect. You must change this attitude and make things right. Actually care about the product you are creating. At the end of the day, I wouldn't waste my time watching this film. If the writers and producers didn't take the time to care then why should you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK let explain what we are missing from this film, Common sense and fast phases. I understand that they want the movie to have action and more action but it was missing the element of introduce the squad. They did very well with Will smith and Margot , but the rest of them team I can't barely even remember them. But what about the Joker, I was so excited to see the Joker fell in love with Harley that I was well I have a new ship,no happening. I was so disappointed that I couldn't enjoy the turbulent love physiology between this two character. I m definitely down to watch a Harley Quinn solo movie, she make me believe that she was the right cast for that character in specific. The films was not only fast phase , it did no make sense in some points. One minute you were watching this and in the other they jump to another locations. Amanda Waller another disappointment, I was like yeah this woman is going to fight and make the enchanted life miserable, No Happening neither.I don't really see the reason of the Flash and Batman to be in this movie even though both of the appearance where short I was like OK. Once again the Joker Jared is no bad but we have a expectation from the Joker that it would never be satisfy. After heath ledger , we have picture the Joker with his face and personality , unfortunately he is no any longer with us to portrait this character so, and I am not a fan of Jared Leto but please stop comparing leto work with Ledger. They would nerve ever been another joker like the one that Christopher Nola delivery us in Batman dark knight. With that been said I give a 6 to this move for the actors portrait , they were good but scrip was trash. It jump to many places and no final destination a film that can't been compared to Guardian of the Galaxy in any sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't awful, but I had quite a few issues with this film. The top two things that bothered me were the lack of things the trailer promised while disappointing you on the things it did deliver on. For example: All the funny lines in the trailer are the *only* funny lines in the movie-so you've already heard them and they aren't funny anymore, on the other hand you don't get any of the cool scenes with the joker that you were expecting because they aren't there. SO essentially you get lines that were overused with no new material and then the stuff you wanted to see more of, you don't. I hate when all the funny parts are in the trailer- especially with the funny/action tone of this franchise- it feels like a waste of money and a letdown that the writers had that little creativity to spread around. Second: Harley Quinn was such a disappointment. Her performance was lauded, but another major letdown. I'm actually embarrassed for Margot Robbie since her job was really just to have her ass out and look pretty. She was useless to the plot and it would've been great to see her and the joker's backstory expanded a bit more than bare dialogue flashbacks that don't give you any reason to care about her character. I wasn't too enthused about the Joker's new look, but Leto pulled it off fantastically. He was great. Even with the ridiculously small amount of screen time he had (and really if this was about suicide squad why not leave him out of it and let him have his own film with Harley? There was really that little point to the scenes he had and was in) Jared Leto was the best part of the movie.Another gripe- the plot was messy and characters underdeveloped. You don't really buy in to them being bad guys because the amount of time fleshing out the characters is dismal. And making Waller a harda** didn't disguise that. The idea of making her worse than the so- called bad guys was a mistake. Why wouldn't she just call Batman for help with whatever the f*ck was going on? Duh. There should've been exposition of the characters backstories to feed in to why suicide squad was specifically needed against Enchantress. The plot problems really pulled it apart. And being the introduction to a new franchise, the setup is really important here to get the audience on board- not only comic readers, but new fans. They failed. I really feel like it was Ayer's direction too- since he's stated that this was his "director's cut." Ayer being proud of this mess is really damn sad. I went in to this with my husband saying everyone gave it a solid seven. To me that's an average score and this was not a little worse than average. A solid 5, but no more. The waste of potential is too big, not to mention you'd think the studio would've been more involved in screening the 'director's cut' before release after the bomb that was Batman vs Superman. I hope they can pull DC back together. Sad panda on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've Been Good, Instead was Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched the marketing campaign for Suicide Squad unfold from June of 2015 all the way to this moment, I knew something was off. At first, the movie was shown as a twisted, dark action character piece. Then, as the reactions to Batman vs. Superman progressed, the marketing changed. The team was not dark, they were campy. They were cracking jokes and slapping each other on the back, stupid one- liners spewed from every character at every scene, and not a single joke worked for me simply because it felt too forced. The re-shot scenes and add-ins stuck out like a sore thumb, in a bad way. The studio stepped in the way of Ayer's vision and it shows. There is a much better movie below this fake one, and it almost seems to be made by studio executives. There is even probably a better action movie in there somewhere too. The action, as we expect from David Ayer, is over-the-top, but it's strangely numb. The camera isn't especially shaky and the action is not too hard to follow, but it is hard to see. The camera lingers on the anti-heroes and their actions during the fighting, leaving the hits and rest of the setting out of view and makes the action pretty awkward to watch. The editing, in most scenes, is okay for the action. In the slowed-down, talky scenes, the editing is pretty bad. That is coming from someone who believes good editing is invisible and bad editing is when you notice a cut. Finally, for the negatives, the movie has a simply awful script with an awful villain. Some lines make you cringe, and others just don't make sense. Not all of it is bad writing, however, and some lines can be clever. The villain is very underwhelming to finish the bad and go to the good. Now, for the positives. First of all, the movie itself has a few pacing issues, but it moves at (overall) a great pace and I never found myself bored. The ensemble cast is also incredibly talented. All but one main acting performance is great. The best include the performances of Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Will Smith as Deadshot, and Jared Leto as The Joker. Even Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang is both funny and well-acted. This cast is just about the one and only reason to see this movie, but don't get too excited for Jared Leto. He is great, don't get me wrong, but he is BARELY in it. Maybe 10-15 minutes of screen-time, but he is almost the star of the show. Is he Heath Ledger? No, not even close. He is, however, a fresh take on The Joker that could expand later on to become one of the best portrayals we've ever seen. Overall, a rating of 6 just might be a bit generous, but it is not a purely terrible movie. It moves along quite well and the acting is just about great across the board. This is a movie that hints at a good or maybe even great movie, but unfortunately we expected this DC movie to finally rival Marvel, and we instead got a disappointing studio-made mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jared Leto did an amazing job and i quite love him as the joker. I am also in love with Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Everyone did an amazing job! They all connected with their characters very well and you can tell they are a squad in real life. The costumes were amazing too! I also loved how they added humor in this movie. There were lots of scenes that were genuinely funny and it made me love the movie even more. I am extremely impressed with everything! I've never been so obsessed with a movie before and I've completely fallen in love with the whole cast. This film was absolutely amazing and any critic who thinks otherwise is more crazy than the characters in Suicide Squad!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suicide squad (2016) ? movie review ? the wait is over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've waited so long for this movie. I actually bought tickets on 7/18 to make sure I could see it on 8/4 in IMAX.I have adored The Joker, in all of his incarnations since I can remember. He's probably my favorite character of all time. I fully admit that I went to see this for The Joker and Harley Quinn's romance. For that alone, it was well worth it. Still, it had a lot more going for it.The film begins when Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles the worst psychotics to take on any non-human threat.One villain, The Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) is a witch unleashed by archaeologist, June Moone. Amanda keeps The Enchantress's heart, which gives her control, until The Enchantress brings her brother back and they begin to take over by turning people into creatures who work for them. We're introduced to most members via backstories. Deadshot (Will Smith) isn't really too bad of a guy. He's a hit-man, who loves his daughter and is captured by Batman because of that love.I adore Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).I would have watched her backstory with The Joker (Jared Leto) for hours. She, of course,starts as Dr. Harleen Quinzel and The Joker is her patient. She falls for him and even brings him a stuffed animal kitty. He asks her for a small favor. All he wants in the whole world is a machine gun. How could anyone deny him that? So, she like anybody with a heart would,gets him one. He breaks out and gives Quinzel a bit of shock. Later above a vat of chemicals that turned him into the sexy beast he is. She willingly jumps into the vat wanting to be his. The Joker starts to walk away. He's angry at himself for caring about her, but jumps nonetheless. I love them together.As the King of Gotham, if an idiot disrespects his Queen, The Joker obviously has no choice but to kill. He, after all, is still The Joker.He's a sexy, David Bowie/Alice Cooper gorgeous killer who needs his own film with Harley.You can keep THE NOTEBOOK and TITANIC. The Joker and Harley ALWAYS does it for me and the casting here was topnotch.Due to Batman's reckless behavior of jumping on his car, The Joker drives into water and narrowly escapes with his life. Harley is then put in jail.Of course, The Joker isn't going to leave his lady love in prison. He gets a guard to sneak her a phone and texts that he's coming for her.Some are upset that the movie didn't make a love triangle between Deadshot, Harley and The Joker. I'm SO glad they didn't. It isn't only Harley's strength that The Joker likes. It's Harley's complete infatuation and loyalty to him. He created her. They're meant for each other as if her were Adam and she Eve. It's her willingness to throw away her career,jump into a vat and be reborn into Harley that makes him take her.It's her complete and sworn devotion to him that not only he enjoys, but the audience enjoys too. The Joker and Harley are perfect together as is. They should be a duo that rules Gotham together. I'd love them to kill Batman and take over. It's like NATURAL BORN KILLERS and BONNIE &amp; CLYDE, but sexy.By the way, how is there not a Harley &amp; Joker comic? Why isn't there one? MAD LOVE is my favorite. I love the backstory between them. Why aren't they ever allowed a universe where they can create mayhem,screw over Batman and get away with it.I would love to see Harley in a position to continuously save The Joker and vice versa.Now, there were other characters too. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is a bad-ass. He lives in water and has the exterior of a Croc. He's strong and doesn't mess around. He was pretty funny and also an intimidating dude.Diablo (Jay Hernandez) is a guy who when pushed to the edge can start fires with his hands. He doesn't like doing it because years ago, he got angry and set a fire that killed everyone in his house.Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is a huge tough guy who loves fighting and throwing his boomerang. He's witty and funny. He definitely has a few shining moments. I wouldn't mind seeing a movie about his character.Amanda puts Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) in charge. He's a soldier who has fallen in love with June Moone and wants to save her from The Enchantress. On his side is Katana (Karen Fukuhara) a woman who traps the souls of her victims in the same sword her husband's soul is trapped in.This was definitely non-stop action. The film was smart enough to divide the time that the Joker was on screen so you never went longer than about 10-15 minutes without seeing him. Jared Leto shines. I knew he would. Ever since I saw the first picture released where everyone was upset about the tattoos, I was like, "Yep, there's the Joker."Leto is different than any Joker we have seen in the past. I thought I'd be the only one rooting for him, but I wasn't. Most of the crowd, at the theater, loved him. He's maniacal, crazy and so much cooler than Batman.Many fans of The Joker have stated on message boards that he needed to be in the film more. I can't deny that, but then again it could have been a 12 hour long one-man-show of The Joker and I'd say, "we need a bit more Joker."Overall, see this in IMAX. I know I'll see it a few more times before it comes to Blu-ray and then I'll buy the Blu-ray.Kudos all around. Everyone did a really great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not what was expected but not a bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review (minor spoilers)Overall the expectations I went in with were probably higher than they should have been. The narrative and overall plot were very difficult to follow. Like Batman v Superman, it wasn't a bad film in its own right but there were many plot points which could have been elaborated on. I figured there would be more humour but there isn't. Harley Quinn deserved more of a backstory. It was faithful to the comics but they rushed her transition from lonely psychiatrist to anarchist. It's a very compelling story of the psychiatrist attempting to turn the inmate sane but the inmate turning the tables and turning the psychiatrist insane. So much so I think there was enough material to make a Joker/Harley film on its own (though I guess a prequel could be still in the cards). Still for what we got, Harley Quinn was very well played and she definitely resembled her comic counterpart.Will Smith ends up stealing the show from Harley. He's more intimidating and frankly more dangerous given his combat skills. The only part of the character I didn't like was having the hardened criminal with the daughter he aims to please is getting rather cliché. Still Smith himself nails his role. Harley is separated from the Joker for most of the film and so Deadshot ends up her grounding rod for most of the film. The brief scene with Batman and Deadshot did have surprisingly good chemistry. Affleck got four scenes. Three as Batman, one as Bruce Wayne. He didn't have a lot to work with but did a good job with what he had. I feel it's premature and unfair to compare Leto to the other Jokers. The Joker doesn't have a lot of screen time and most of it is in flashbacks or dream sequences so there wasn't much room for character development. Viola Davis may have ended up as the unsung hero with honourable mention to Joel Kinnaman. I was heavily reminded of the Nick Fury/Phil Coulson relationship from the Avengers. Without spoiling any plot points, the two use similar plot points to motivate the team. Overall it was a very enjoyable film. The stakes are always high when you have super criminals on the loose. I am hoping for more films with these characters, particularly Deadshot and Harley. I think the reason people feel underwhelmed is that it may not have met their expectations. Expecting a humour packed film of bad guys doing bad things for an entire film was unrealistic. The first act was the strongest with the characters being introduced, the second act definitely stalls and suffers as if the film wanders aimlessly wondering what to do next but the third act redeems the film.It ends in a way in which there aren't necessarily unresolved cliffhangers but it does open up for a world of more films and excitement on what happens next. Final grade 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it 4 days ago and I loved it. The plot was relatively simple to follow, and honestly, because there are so many characters to build, I preferred that the plot be straightforward like this so it's not very confusing. And, the entire theater I was in, which was packed, were laughing all the time and seem to be enjoying the whole thing. You gotta wonder if the critics were taking the movie too seriously to even grasp it. I loved it and that's all I really care about. I will agree that there were some pacing issues, but for me they were relatively minor. I will concede, however, that it was apparent that there were some scenes that were cut, specifically lines that we saw in the trailer. If you come in not knowing about those lines, you wouldn't know they're missing, but if you were waiting for those lines, you'd notice their absence. Was it enough to ruin the film? Hells no. There were also some stylistic choices that arguably could've been done better. But, as I said, overall I was happy with the film. I've seen it twice and I'm planning a third watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no clue what to expect from this movie. some previews looked awesome and others just okay. But I went and really was blown away! It brought me back to the feeling i had while watching the Dark Night Trilogy, not perfect in every way, but still really entertaining! I loved this movie! Sure some of the lines fell flat and they cut so many scenes that certain things felt unfinished but it was still great. Jared Leto as the Joker was by far my favorite! There were times when i watched him that i would literally look at my friend with a disturbed expression because he just seemed genuinely psychotic. Ledger's interpretation was great and very witty but i personally felt that Leto captured the craziness better but in a whole new way. and with that said Joker and Harley Quinn were the best. They were fun to look at and they left me wanting so much more!! this movie was definitely a new interpretation, music choices were good but a little cheesy lol, and they left out way too much that could've tied up some loose ends but all in all i was really impressed by all of the performances!! I would definitely recommend seeing this film but just go into it open minded instead of critical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite what many critics have to say, this is a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good, fun movie. If you like comic book movies you will enjoy "Suicide Squad". I'm not sure why many critics think that this great movie was so "terrible". It had great acting from the entire cast, especially Margot Robbie and Will Smith and it had just the right amount of jokes. That being said this movie wasn't perfect either, but no movie is. The story could have been better, but it was still good and worked fine for Suicide Squad. Also, it should have been longer. When you have so many character that haven't been on the big screen before this you need to use as much time as possible to develop their back stories, which wasn't done very well. For the characters with the largest roles like Deadshot or Harley Quinn their are fairly short backstories, while the backstories for characters like Killer Croc are given no screen time. This doesn't take away from the overall film too much, but it is the reason that I couldn't give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so satisfied with this movie which gave me more than jokes. I cried, I laughed and I got spooked once or twice. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Easy to follow story....but the character development was awesome and it is the characters that drive this story. I really have nothing bad to say about it. I really don't. I liked the creativity of the movie and the look and feel of it. It is unlike any other comic book movie I have ever seen. David Ayer did it again! An urban contemporary grounded super villain film....this one has no heroes even though they do do some good in the end! If you have seen it you will know what I mean. I don't get the critics to be honest. I know where they are coming form but in no way is their logic making any sense. They have been overly critical once again and unfairly of a very good solid film. No way Ghostbusters is better than this flick. The critics have lost their minds or they have an agenda to sink the DC. The audience is going to scratch their heads after seeing this movie and wonder what the hell the critics were watching. The critics are trying to poison the waters of this innovative movie. You will see this style copied by other CBM's in the future for sure. It is a ground breaker.</fullReview>

But, i don't trust them until i watch the movie first. Luckily, i already watch the movie and it is not same with what the "experts" says. The movie is really great, its been a long time that i watch a movie that really great. From the first minute until the credits it gives you the adrenaline rush. The plot is easy to understand and the cast is really doing a brilliant job. Talking about casting, please do not compare "RIP Heath Ledger" joker and "Jared" joker. Both of the actor do their part magnificently. Seriously i feel the airtime for joker is not enough for me...hahah...i feel addicted every time the joker appear. Last but not least thank you to the director and whole crew who produce this very great movie...salute #fromtrainingdaytosuicidesquad</fullReview>

Well I'm glad to say I wasn't ......I go to the cinema to be entertained and I most definitely was. The characters were good, although some don't get enough screen time ( I'm not saying who ) .

		<fullReview>To get right to it, I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining Suicide Squad was. The look of the film, the costumes and overall aesthetic won me over. The humor was great. I laughed a lot. And most of the action works pretty well.The characters are a high point for me.Will Smith, Margo Robbie, Viola Davis and Jay Hernandez are STANDOUTS. I loved their performances as Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller and El Diablo, respectively. And Jared Leto's Joker is sinister. A different take compared to previous Joker incarnations. Playing a somewhat unhinged crime boss as opposed to a "I want to see the world burn." type of villain.The plot is not perfect. It has some weaknesses. and the villain is a bit uninspired. Which is unfortunate because his/her setup was thrilling. But I had the same issue with the villain in Guardians Of The Galaxy. So it is what it is. Overall, there are absolutely more pros then cons for me. I will definitely recommend Suicide Squad. Lots of fun.</fullReview>

But I guess you don't do it for the fans. You do it for the money you want to take from the fans. You cant put 20 mins of back stories then an hour and a half of running around shooting things and lame jokes only to disappoint us. The more you make this crap the more I will go read more books and graphic novels. I wish I could say nicer things about a movie that I was looking more forward to seeing Joker than anything else..

Really boring, cringing and disappointing movie I have watched in quite a while. The only amazing part about the movie is its trailer, and that's it! All, the characters are kinda forced to group up against some illogical $h!t storm that was "accidentally" created. The plotting was really poor, even a 7 or 8 grader could come up with something more appealing. Hope, others don't make the mistake I did. The only thing that took me throughout the movie was the hope of some real action as the movie suggested.

		<fullReview>There is nothing in this movie that would make me want to watch it ever again. There is not even one "cool" scene with good action (which the movie lacked altogether) that I would like to watch again (a la Quicksilver in the recent Fox movies). Clear editing problems, on-your-face pop song tracks, and boring characterization of the criminals of the DC comic books. Another copy of the original Avenger's formula that adds nothing new.-- SPOILERS &amp; Rant ahead! 1 - Killer Croc was a flaccid thug, with a head bigger than his personality (which was non-existent). 2 - Diablo's line "this is a family" (paraphrased) is hilarious and probably the best joke of the movie. At no point in the movie I cared for any of these characters nor did they feel like an actual team. 3 - Captain Boomerang getting away after the bar scene and coming back is the stupidest thing.. probably a metaphor of him being an actual boomerang. They attempted to do a joke, but the lackluster team required him to come back for.. no reason. 4 - Every time they show Flash (much like Batman) I hate it even more. Stupid one liners, pompous attitude.. It's nothing like Barry and more like Wally West, a man-child that thinks himself a superhero.&#xfeff; 5 - Not only do we have a murdering Batman.. he is also unable to find and apprehend Deadshot on his own. THE famous Detective needs a tip from the government to find these things out. OH, and he also hides government secrets it seems! Has Comic-book Bruce Wayne ever done something like that? Why do they ALSO know his identity? They don't even understand their characters (example being Cap Boomerang not even having a 'dream sequence' at the end of the movie). 6 - It would have been better to leave the Joker out of this one. 7 - Etc.</fullReview>

If a film fails on every aspect but still is by all means successful, what does that say about it's audience. Lets stop making terrible movies. One-liner, one-dimensional characters with no depth beyond the label of "bad", "evil", "crazy" fill this movie, as a surprisingly congested script attempts to give them backstory. Although comedy is very subjective, jokes in addition to the majority of the dialogue in general is very cringe-worthy. I felt embarrassed whenever anyone spoke. It all make me want to commit suicide squad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst heroes ever? More like "worst movie ever"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about this film is that I didn't pay for it. Seriously, what a miserable experience watching this film was, and all the ultimately prevailed was feeling really sorry for the cast that despite their dedicated efforts, the movie just turned out to be completely unwatchable. Keep in mind, for the rest of the review, however, my thoughts on the films in this genre are notoriously unpopular on this board. I loved Batman v Superman and thought Civil War was complete garbage. I am getting tired of this genre, so perhaps that has something to do with it. The story here is pretty generic stuff. The final act is almost as bad as that of Ghostbusters, and the film was just as dull as Civil War. The only real saving grace was Margot Robbie, who gave the film her all, and of course also her undeniable sex appeal. Will Smith provides a very generic arc that, for fans of the TV show Arrow, we have already seen (and performed with more humanity). That show clearly isn't amazing and Season 4 is one of the worst seasons I've seen in a TV series ever, but the Deadshot in seasons 1 and 2 I found much easier to connect to. This was simply Will Smith playing Will Smith with a gun, and the character simply lacks edge. That same idea echoes throughout the film - it is so blunt and flat, with nothing of note occurring. Leto's performance is just pathetic. It is humiliating. From the outset I knew he was the wrong casting choice, and the movie proves me right beyond any reasonable doubt. His performance the whole time just misses the mark drastically. This fails to capture the essence of the Joker, and also fails to craft a compelling standalone character as Jesse Eisenberg managed to do with Lex Luthor. Here the character is reimagined as more of a drug-addled hardcore crime lord. It just doesn't work, and it is tragic to think the lengths Leto went to in his method acting to deliver what is ultimately such a tame, lame, and forgettable performance. I do hope they recast him for Batman's standalone film - him as the lead villain instantaneously knocks the film down to a maximum score of around 7/10. Thankfully he is barely in the film, although it bodes poorly for the future films in this saga. I don't think Deadpool was amazing, but it pulled off the edgier superhero film much better than this. Here it is simply grim and mean-spirited, as opposed to being cool in any vague way. This feels like a film more along those lines that was made as a dark, gritty, intense, and just completely insane action film that was later cut into a generic crowd pleaser. David Ayer claims this is his complete vision, in which case I don't know how he was ever hired, and why the making of this film is said to have been so dark and intense. The villain would be forgettable even by the standards of the MCU films. This film is so bad it feels like a failed MCU film, completely missing any distinguishing style. All we get is a muddled mess. Why not just have the Joker as villain? At least that would have been a somewhat interesting failure by the iconic nature of the character. Who cares about the Enchantress and the CGI rubbish in the finale? Overall this film was boring, tonally jarring, mean-spirited, bland, atrociously made, with editing that is amongst the most incompetent I have seen in a large budget film. Really just a complete mess. I hated this film, and it completely betrays what (to me) made BvS a memorable film in the genre. The DC universe appears to have given up trying to stand on its own and simply follow the MCU model, and attempted to make an MCU film. The story is incoherent and frankly garbage, the characters outside of Margot Robbie suck, the action is some of the weakest I've seen in a while, so blandly choreographed and just uninteresting. It is ridiculous but not self-aware enough of how ridiculous it is. It just isn't even vaguely similar to what made the trailers somewhat appealing. Recommended ONLY if you have someone who raped your girlfriend, murdered your parents, ate your dog, stole all your money, cut off all your limbs, and nuked the world, this might be an adequate way to get them back - make them sit through this film. I've called the critics biased before, and that is a sentiment I maintain entirely, although they are 100% right here, particularly Travers who nailed it. Stay away. You have been warned. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty anxious about this film at first. Man of Steel and Batman V Superman weren't all that greatly received, and weren't that good in my personal opinion. I was worried for the future of the DC Extended Universe. I thought it could only get worse or stay the same, but I was wrong!DC has extremely strong villains, that's why this was the perfect story to show and tell. The premise is something innovative and new, not been done before in a theatrical release. Harley Quinn was incredible, and a highlight of this movie. Margot Robbie portrayed her so well, and couldn't have done better, aside from the costume. A solo movie will be amazing! Her relationship with the Joker was perfect.Deadshot was great as well, giving him motivation to care for his daughter, and just wanting what's best for her. Similarly with El Diablo and his deceased family. Many of the villains were shown in a lighter side, and gave them humanity instead of being seen as cold blooded monsters.The story was executed so well and so close to the original material. This is such a high note for the DCEU, despite what critics say. This is a turn around, and with Wonder Woman coming up next, this film series is headed straight for the gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything wrong with comic-based movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My vote is 1 star which is "awful" according to IMDb, and awful just doesn't quite cut it. I would use dreadful, repugnant, and/or execrable.I follow DC and Marvel comics, and the purpose of bringing the characters and plots of these brands to live action is to go all out; and every time I see these types of movies, they are always a let down: characters are misused, under developed, and poorly constructed (and I follow comics, I can only imagine what those who don't feel or think); these movies spend too much time trying to make them--heroes/villains--into something that they have never been (in the worst way possible). How can this be??? The comics have done all the hard work, as a studio the only thing you have to do is give them flesh and blood, that is all!I go to see this movies for the action, for the possibilities CGI and SFX bring to fights, looks, and settings. I already care for the characters because I already know them, and even if I didn't, I do not need flashbacks every 20 min. I do not need to see Batman's origins every time a movie about him is made. I do not need forced humor from characters that don't do humor. I do not need powerful characters (referring to abilities and powers) just standing on the background looking at the camera and see in their eyes "what am I doing here?". I don't need heroes and villains making dumb choices (i.e. Superman wielding the kryptonite spear when you have Wonder Woman around; Enchantress, impervious to bullets with god-like abilities being defeated so stupidly easy; and don't get me started with her brother, defeated by an deus-ex-machina bomb when "El Diablo" was melting his heart and still he--the brother--had the upper hand). I don't need all that nonsense for characters that have been around for DECADES!!!Could these and other problems arise from the need for studios to make their movies appealing to a "wider audience"? If so, I ask: What wider audience? Children? Seniors? Who? Who?? Because children don't have money to pay to see them, and seniors don't really care for them.Enough of ranting. Back to reviewing.Suicide Squad (SS) had tough shoes to fill because of "Batman: Assault on Arkham" (BAA, from here on). The last is an animated film with more or less has the same plot: get a bunch of "bad guys" to do some dirty work for Amanda Waller and, of course, everything goes sideways. Most of the characters are used in both movies: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Cpt. Boomerang, and Joker. To those who are interested, I really recommend it, as well as "Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox". More often that I would like to admit, DC's animated movies are better made than live action ones. Harley Quinn in BAA is truly exceptional, funny, and every bit as psychotic and heartbroken as her comic book counter part. I don't know where this obsession with Margot Robbie comes from, but in most reviews I have read about SS, everyone sucks up to her performance and I only saw that she failed to take the next step to breakout and be Harley; she just took Harley's catch phrases and spitted them out in a very nice-looking package and all her character's jokes where terribly forced and didn't get a chuckle out of me. Deadshot, which is awesome in BAA, is just Will Smith being Will Smith, and that was a complete disappointment, the man had charisma, where did he left it? The only character I really liked better than his BAA counterpart was Jai Courtney's Cpt. Boomerang. I was really happy to see Jai Courtney act, and be, and giving his best like he did in Spartacus; because in other movies he has been he was very unsatisfactory. In SS he had the least character development, and still he made me laugh, he made me care for Cpt. Boomerang, and the thing with the unicorn was just really adorable. I am not going to address Jared Leto's Joker because the man had/has a very big smile to fill. The best Jokers for me are Mark Hamil, for voice acting; and Heath Ledger, for live action. Besides, the Joker has a better role in BAA than SS, in every way.But let me give another point of view: my mom's. She doesn't follow comics, nor cares for them, and she enjoyed the movie. She said it was entertaining and that, for a movie that is 2 hrs. long, it went fast. So maybe you should take her word rather than mine. Hopefully with all the money this movie has made, the studio will pay attention to fan's reviews and take note to do better in future projects. If not, I have learned my lesson with the past 16 years of comic-based movies and if I read and/or hear bad reviews, I'll wait until Netflix or Amazon, or whatever media to stream it and see it then, than wasting my money in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short: I read a hell of a lot of reviews and comments about the movie before going. Many people said it was worse than BTMNvsSPRMN, said it was "terrible" and "disappointing". Absolutely not.Just before it started I said to myself I should only compare this to marvel movies like Captain America or Iron Man. And so I did.Compared to the other superhero movies this was just as enjoyable! The story-line was decent, the introduction was brilliant, the action-scenes were great. The humor kept everything together and wasn't as clichéd/cringy as a lot of marvel movies are now-days. And to top it all off: The music was spot-on! Don't let the critic reviews or meta score put you down.P.S Margot Robbie and Will Smith were amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people fell in love with the story of the DC comic book lore, but majority of people (such as myself) didn't really get to dig deeper into the lore due to various reasons (eg. comic books weren't distributed here, cartoons and movies in the past weren't exactly captivating, etc.)With that in mind, most people that will like this movie are people that fell in love with the idea of Joker, with the idea of Batman, there are no bars set, so the movie makes that leap with ease.Comic book dorks need to take a chill pill, and critics should look for the meaning of life elsewhere, Suicide Squad isn't here to be the next "Godfather", it's here as a FUN and Exciting summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much More Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed the action, the cinematography, the characters and the story line. I am typically not a DC fan (Marvel 100%). However, I loved it and fell in love with the characters. I only expected to love Harley Quinn, but they are all equally amazingly portrayed. Each portrayal of each character was so spot on, that I can't see anyone being replaced. These actors are now forever linked with their characters and I am looking forward to them carrying these characters on in future DC movies. This movie was very well done. I'm most definitely going to see it again. I had the pleasure of seeing it at IMAX in 3D and yes, it was worth the $40 paid for two tickets. Anyone reading this review I'm fairly certain you will thoroughly enjoy the movie as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay; now that I've got your attention, let's get down to the nitty- gritty. For those of you who aren't overgrown fan boys and girls, this film is loosely based on a DC comic that first started publishing in the 1980's. The concept no doubt having been inspired by the enduring popularity of THE DIRTY DOZEN. But, with the reluctant recruits being modern super-villains rather than court- martialed American GI's during World War II!The plot of this movie is likewise from the 1980's. More specifically; it's loosely based on the Succubus/Incubus story arc involving the magical anti-superheroine called the Enchantress. As originally depicted in DC Comics, in the late Sixties, she was as magical as Zatanna...and yet dressed like Mrs. Peel. But, by the Seventies, that had all changed. Perhaps because non-DC readers kept confusing her with the Asgardian super-villainess of the same name over at Marvel.In short; she was the first DC do-gooder to go bad. And all before "Crisis On Infinite Earths!"This 21st century film version goes one step further. It not only updates the character of June Moone into a former archaeologist (a la Indiana Jones). It consolidates the Silver Age origin of her character with both the post-COIE revision and La Ecantadora (the Latina revamp that was created in the late Nineties)! Then, we have Jared Leto's Joker. No purple tuxedo for this dude! He's performed just the way Frank Miller depicted him in that now-classic graphic novel "The Dark Knight Returns." Basically, a sociopathic albino Goth who just might laugh both ways (if you catch my drift). And, as blasphemous as this might sound? I find that take on the character even scarier than Heath Leger's posthumous Oscar-winning portrayal!Other than these two alterations (plus, the Afro-Americanizing of Deadshot by having him portrayed--almost too convincingly--by Will Smith), the movie stays pretty close to the basic premise of the original comic. For the most part, however, this is a straight-up sequel to BvS: DAWN OF JUSTICE. Which, as I noted in my review for that film, was inspired by both the Frank Miller epic and the introductory "Doomsday" story arc in Superman's comics (in the early Nineties).Need I add that Margot Robbie practically steals the show as Harley Quinn? I thought not. Go and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched the movie yesterday i thought it was awesome, i was looking forward to more scenes with the joker i guess the joker and harley quinn was the main reason i actually wanted to watch this movie.. well with the scenes you had of them was just amazing and the style of the movie was so cool i loved the costumes and just the way the movie is made. Acting was 10 out of 10 this is by far the best joker ever Jared leto absolutely nailed it as him. Im just very impressed by this movie haven't watched something this good in a long time it was a very fun movie with lots of action. I would have loved to just get to know the character's a bit more only if the movie was a bit longer but you guys obviously are having more movies come out. Please don't change anything about the joker and harley i love them the way they are!!! The only thing i am disappointed in is that you picked cara delevingne to act as one of the characters she is shocking and she makes me sick please get rid of her nobody likes her in movies you made a big mistake picking her for the role she is a horrible actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I must be one of the few who actually thought it was a decent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being an avid comic-book reader, and also a firm believer that Heath Ledgers Joker could not be topped, I actually liked Jared Leto as the joker. People say they felt it was too forced, but i disagree. He took his own twist on the role, as the DC universe has done countless times in the comics. Some Jokers are bad ass mobsters, while others are hilarious psychopaths with little to no regard for the people around them. Leto portrayed this joker as the latter, and i think he was amazing. The super dysfunctional relationship between him and Harley Quinn was my favorite part of the entire movie, if we look away from the fact that Will Smith absolutely killed his role as Deadshot, but come on, its Will Smith. Of course he nailed it. All in all, my personal opinion is that it was epic. The Joker laugh, Margot Robbies awesome portrayal and my favorite line; "whats for dinner?"If there are any spelling/grammar mistakes i apologize. English is not my first language.I hope the actors and directors don't get too much hate. Because, it was new, different, and not what I expected, but it was awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is truly one hell of a fun and entertaining experience. The opening 15 minutes gave me goose bumps while seeing the origin story/introduction to the squad members. The fight/action sequences are spectacular and would stand up against any modern war movie, mirroring the skills David Ayer displayed in Fury. The story is easy to follow and explains well why people make the decisions they do (something that was missing in BVS) The actors were brilliant in their portrayal of the characters, mostly impersonating their New 52 comic book version, with subtle references to older versions. Will Smith and Margot Robbie were by far the stand out performers, Jai Courtney was a very funny Captain Boomerang and i found Joel Kinnaman to play a good Rick Flagg, a character who you have to like as they are a good guy, but is never really liked by the others. The integration with the rest of the DC universe was good, and one thing that people might not realize is that this film is really a sequel to BVS, and you really need to have seen that for this film to make complete sense. There was enough humor in the film to get a few laugh out loud moments but i would have liked more captain boomerang. So far this has been my favorite movie of 2016, which is something when you consider we have had Deadpool, Civil War and X-Men Apocalypse. I would recommend this film to anybody that likes fun, fast paced action movies, with humerus elements. Its not just a comic book movie, but if you are a comic book fan then i'm sure you will love this as much as me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I'd like to mention that I went into this movie feeling rather despondent. The critics were saying it was terrible and things were starting to get out of hand. I went in armed with all the criticism. And I was still blown away. All the things critics said were bad weren't bad at all. And anything that strayed that way was caught up and blended around by truly UNMATCHED acting.First off, the tone. This movie manages to be more fun than any Marvel movie to date, simply because it is much more depressing. This dark tone ALLOWS for humour to break the ice. And the timing is excellent. Every time the mood hits rock bottom, the tension and chemistry between actors puts a grin on your face.Secondly, the directing and camera-work. Through bright neon colours flavouring a dark, dystopian landscape, Ayer brings out the insanity of the characters in new and jaw-dropping ways. The camera almost never sits perfectly where it needs to be, instead hitting the characters and surroundings at weird and surrealistic angles. The whole movie reeks of tension, and excitement, which is definitely aided by the use of slow motion.Finally, the acting. This part is the MOST IMPORTANT PART. Will Smith returns to the height of his previous successes, and strikes beyond. He makes up the emotional body and voice of reason, while still managing to deliver humorous wisecracks. Margot Robbie is quite simple unbelievable. She brings out the childish insanity in Harley Quinn like no other ever could. Her addiction-like worship of the Joker can be understood and makes us root for her throughout the movie. She herself is packed full of humour, and never fails to deliver. Viola Davis's Amanda Waller is evil wearing a familiar face. She is spectacularly threatening, bringing the puppet master to the big screen in all her glory. She is the adult among children, armed with knowledge too dangerous to share.Although there were many other characters, none of them insignificant (except one, of course), the final words I shall say are the ones you probably want to hear the most. The Joker. Jared Leto exceeds any expectations you may have. He was given way too little screen time due to some editing faults, but in the short time that he's on screen, he steals the show. His Joker is quite simply one of the best depictions of a character I have ever seen. I personally do not like to compare the Jokers, seeing as they are all so unique, but I feel on an acting level, in his limited time Jared Leto brings his character to the same level as the legendary Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill. He is scary, intimidating, effortlessly funny and otherwise perfect. He also really brings back the original character of the Joker, a clownish gangster who shamelessly kills anyone who stands in his way. He is, in a word, perfect.I rate this film 10/10, not because it is without fault, but because it has the potential to spawn a new age of punkier, funnier and crazier comic-book movies. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Delivers Interesting Characters and Great Performances, it Could Have Been Great but Ends up Being Just Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was beyond excited for this movie. From David Ayer directing (I loved End of Watch and Fury) to the cast (Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Jared Leto) and then those trailers were just fantastic. Everything I saw ahead of time said that this movie was going to be awesome and it would be the one to put the DC universe on track (I thought Batman V Superman was okay). Then the bad reviews came out and my hopes and expectations were completely dashed. So I went in with low expectations, ready to be ridiculed for having so much faith in the Skwad but I left the theatre happy. This is a flawed movie to be sure but there's some great stuff in it, I admit it's not the home-run that DC and WB needed though.One of the bigger things that critics have complained about is how simple and scattershot the plot is. Honestly, they're not wrong. There isn't a whole lot to this story as a whole, it's more about characters (not an excuse but the characters are more than good enough to carry it). The arc of the plot didn't bother me, a good portion of the movie is setting up the squad so it's not like defeating the villain was the sole goal of Suicide Squad. The editing can be pretty messy, the beginning of the movie has some of the best stuff but it doesn't flow well. I don't want to go into the behind the scenes news but it makes sense considering the news behind the editing process. I actually thought the movie moved at a good pace and it wasn't as jarring as the critics have said.When it comes to the characters, there's so many in this movie. The upside is that a lot of them are interesting but the downside is that there isn't enough screen time for everyone. The 2 main characters are Harley and Deadshot and I was impressed how the movie developed them. You get behind Harley's difficulties being controlled by the Joker, she kills people and does his bidding but she's been completely broken because of her psychological issues. Deadshot's weakness for his daughter would be corny in any other movie but the movie sells you on the fact that although he's a hit-man, he just wants an amount of normalcy with his daughter and he loves her. Another character who gets some good moments is Diablo, his story is pretty tragic and his story towards redemption throughout the movie was almost touching. To address the elephant in the room, I think the Joker was necessary because you couldn't have done Harley's origin without him (which was very well done) but he has little impact on the actual plot. I understand why they brought him in longer. How do you have one of the biggest comic villains ever in just a cameo? It wouldn't do justice to the character so I get the reasoning behind it.The biggest reason to go see this movie is that for a comic book movie there really are some awesome performances. Will Smith completely returned to form as Deadshot. Deadshot's persona wasn't too far from some other Will Smith roles but Smith looked like he was having a great time and he nailed a complex character. Will benefited from not being the moral centre of the movie and I think that playing a more morally gray character was a good thing to do and he was great. Margot Robbie was awesome as Harley Quinn. I was so impressed that she was willing to get down into the dirtier aspects of her character, she throws a lot of physicality into it even. She completely owns her scenes and if anything I'll be disappointed if this movie isn't a success because it should be her ticket to bigger things. I expected Deadshot and Harley to be good, the biggest surprise might have been Jay Hernandez as Diablo. There was a lot of angst to his performance and he stood out in a crowded group.Some of the other actors were great but I wanted to see even more of them. This is easily the best job I've seen from Jai Courtney, he hit it out of the park but he's mainly a background character. Viola Davis was also solid as Amanda Waller. Joel Kinnaman was fine as Rick Flagg. Cara Delevingne has taken a lot of crap for her dual portrayal of June Moon/Enchantress. She's not bad, she's not the strongest villain but she did a serviceable job. Last but certainly not least is Jared Leto as the Joker. I didn't have a problem with them doing a new version of the Joker but I didn't like Leto as much as I thought I would. He's creepy and unsettling but I didn't find him as threatening or scary as other versions. I understand a lot of his scenes were cut out though so maybe we just didn't get to see that side of his character.Every time I was just about to fall in love with this movie, something would snap me out of it. There would be an awkward cut, a bad piece of dialogue or the CGI wouldn't be as believable as it should (to be fair the action and the CGI are both pretty good throughout). I wanted this movie to be that game changer for DC but it fell short of that. It's not nearly as bad as critics are saying, it's a mixed bag but there are really good portrayals, good action and while it's not completely different, there's enough new stuff here to make it standout from the comic book crowd. I would be closer to a 7.5/10 but to counter the widespread hate around Suicide Squad I'll round up and give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment with a bit of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to state that I respect people who do serious movie reviewing for a living. They are more of art scientists, follow how cinema as an art flows and turns and mostly they can do is just comment on sideways. However I was kinda 'duh' when reading RT reviews on Suicide Squad - luckily, I am bit of movie freak myself and had planned to see this movie anyway. And boy didn't I walk away confused did we even saw same movie. Because I loved it with all it's flaws.So if you don't want to twelve into details - yes, movie is fun, yes, most of SS characters are great, there are few misses but they are mostly script's fault who doesn't let them all breathe - although to be frank, to give them all justice this movie had to be 3 hours. BUT these small issues - along with tone and editing in places - doesn't destroy movie. It's bold, it tries to do something interesting with 'team of baddies' concept and almost flawlessly gets away with it. Definitely go see it at cinema to form your own opinion. Movie is not bore fest, and you can get descent entertainment out of it, even if you end up not particularly liking it.Mild spoilers ahead.Now, what's working and what's not - as I said, characters are done well. If anything, this movie is solid platform for them to grow and enrich any further movies DCU will have (and as most of them are from Batman side of town, you get idea). I am not completely sold on Letto's Joker yet, but I really won't trash him. He's a bit of pain an a ass in this movie, not villain. His screen time is way too short to judge. What I can say though I felt uneasy, his movements hid dangers. Everyone else is doing their part and I bought their performances - yes, even Croc, Boomerang and Flag. Standouts are very good Will Smith as Deadshot, positively crazy Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. Original music was a bit mixed bag (I personally think in some places mix was a bit overboard), but soundtrack is excellent one and will stay with you. Visually movie stays true to trailers and I personally liked that flavor.Overall it is worth movie to see to make up your mind. I kinda disagree with harshness movie received at Rotten Tomatoes. It's certainly more alive than BvS, and characters there are more fleshed out and more reliable. It's not ten hit, but it's not colossal miss neither. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifetime comic book fan that is 100% satisfied</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PROLOGUE: Here's the deal guys, I don't know what movie the critics are watching, but please go see this one for yourself. We went six people deep and not a single person was let down. Two people have texted me tonight, knowing i'd write this review, telling me it's their new favorite super hero film. I CANNOT understand how all of these film critics thought the ending of Guardians of the Galaxy (where our hero tries to have a dance off with the massively underdeveloped villain followed by unexplained magic stuff winning the day followed by a dancing cartoon baby tree) was brilliant, but try to claim there was anything wrong with the way this film went down. The similarities are staggering (besides the stupid dance off) So lemme spin it for you. First off, this movie is FUNNY. It doesn't make fun of itself the way some superhero films do with their comedy, just the characters themselves are funny, and we get a fun bit of profile on all of them early on (besides two and they were both pretty underused (gripe #1)) I LOVED that the presence of The Bat and The Joker were background elements, sort of like two different myths in the villain world that are on opposite ends of the bad spectrum. This is definitely not their movie, but I appreciate their inclusion (not putting them into this world they helped create would've been dumb). If you couldn't tell from the trailer Deadshot and Harley get most of the screen time, and honestly deservedly so. This was Will Smith at the top of his game, he was easily one of my favorite characters to watch the whole film. Everyone else (besides those two I mentioned) get their screen time, their action, and their jokes in. I was surprised at how much use they got out of these characters, especially considering how much the reviews bagged on that very subject. (pro tip, if you wants loads of extra backstory on these characters beyond what the film gives, I recommend comic books. The backstory exists in spades.) My second gripe (and my ONLY other gripe) is that while the source of the conflict was a pleasant surprise (given that the trailers don't spoil any of it) the actual villain was pretty mysterious and we don't get many answers on that subject. It's just one of those things you, as a viewer in a superhero movie where magic and superpowers exist, are going to have to take at face value. For the most part the villain basically exists to bring these characters together and provide action when necessary, but we're given a pretty cool climactic sequence because of it. TL:DR - I'm a comic book fan, I'm an action movie fan, I'm an ensemble fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's funny, the action is dope, the acting is great, Amanda Waller was perfect, the Joker cameos (because they are basically cameos) were fun and gave Harley's character some extra spice, the Batman Cameos were short but solid, and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS for some extra stuff : ) Favorite characters: - Deadshot - El Diablo - Amanda Waller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(SPOILER FREE)Amazing. Ignore critics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, i think something is up, critic ratings are mediocre, audience is good, 8.5 out of 6,000 reviews from audience. Its set up, this movie is fantastic. Will Smith (Deadshot) and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) are great. But Cara Delevingnes Enchantress is the ultimate "adversary" . She is beautiful and her acting is so well done. The story is great, the third act is a little bit screwy, but has a great finale. A bit messy to be honest, but in all a fun roller-coaster from start to finish. The casting, pacing, acting, story, and fun factor are all there and well. Its a summer blockbuster at its best. I would extremely recommend watching this. Best Dc movie since Dark Knight. And im not a DC fanboy, i love marvel. Civil war was great. Hated Xmen Apocalypse, and loved deadpool. Im not being bias, im giving a honest true review. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for all comic book fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just fun!! I don't care if you're a Marvel, DC, Vertigo, whatever fan, this movie is fast paced, funny and straight up enjoyable from start to finish. The problems BvS had was it was slow, tried to jam too much in and at times (as the viewer), you had no idea what direction it was trying to take. In contrast, Suicide Squad doesn't take itself too seriously and never feels like it's being dragged out at all. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto play the Clown Prince/Princess roles to utter perfection (however be warned, Leto's Joker is no Ledger's Joker, which is absolutely fine by me, he's redefined the role and made it his own). Will Smith is BACK WITH A BANG (pun intended). His take on Deadshot is exactly what I was hoping for, humorous but serious at the right times. Without revealing too much, Batman is excellent (and that's all I'll say). Lastly, Viola Davis is just plain evil as Amanda Waller and I loved her take on the iconic role. Would love her to return in the future. Overall, I'm giving this movie a perfect score because it's exactly what I hoped it would be - fun from start to finish.PS - don't let negative critic reviews sway your opinion on this movie. Negative reviews on BvS were justified. Negative reviews on this movie just seems straight up forced and uncalled for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been films that have been divisive for all the right reasons. Last year, The Visit split audiences and critics alike right down the middle into the quality of the film. But there were the people whom already gave the film the brush of because of the director.Now we have Suicide Squad, and it's pretty much the same for this film, but because of some people's views of BVS, many have already dismissed this because it's D.C., and nothing can touch Marvel, or the legacy Ledger left with his portrayal.Haters gonna hate......a team of incarcerated villains, including Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Deadshot, are recruited by the government for a suicide mission in exchange for clemency. Their assignment, however, is complicated by the ongoing quest of the Joker to reunite with his one true love......I'll get straight to the point. The film is stupendously entertaining, it's bright, colourful, devoid of any sort of relevant story, put goes along at such a heady pace, full of wonderful characters, couldn't care less. This is Suicide Squad, The Con Air of comic book movies.The film is split into three. The first part is the back stories and introductions to the squad, and they are each unique to their characters, but do give a little away to how their individuality will affect their actions. Smith for example is easily the most humanistic of the titular group, and it's no surprise as to how his character progresses through the film. Dead shot is a contract killer, not a psychotic killer, thief, or your atypical 'bad guy'. He has a daughter for crying out loud, that should spell everything out.Harley Quinn is good, but she runs out of steam toward the end of the third act. She's amazing to look at, but her little tics and one liners start to grate toward the end, but her story with The Joker is ironically the most interesting thing of the first act.The rest of the characters introductions are a lot shorter bar Enchantress, which has a The Decent vibe to it, but you never get bored of the introductions, eve if it does take a good 30mins of the film up.The second act is heavily influenced by Carpenters Escape From New York, it's them in a desolate place, with their lives at stake, and what pretty much feels like a no win situation, just lake Snake Plisskin had all them years ago. This is where the bad guys and the good guys start to get a little bit of a mutual respect for each other, thanks to the relationship between Smith and Kinnerman, their banter is excellent, and the second act is as action packed and as funny as you'd expect, with The Jokers shadow hanging heavily over the narrative.The third act is very reminiscent of the final act of the original Ghostbusters, and this is where the majority of the Squad come into their own, especially Diablo, played brilliantly by Hernandez.And for once, the trailers haven't given anything about the narrative away, the actual story, as flimsy as it is is pretty surprising, as I thought it was centred around Leto's Joker.Leto, is honestly wonderful as the Joker, and although his screen time is limited, it's the characters shadow that keeps him in the back of your mind for the film.Courtney doesn't do much as Boomerang other than drink beer and play with his unicorn, and the inclusion of Katana is a pointless exercise.But all in all, it's a wonderful creation, frenetic, funny, scary, and well justified of its 15 rating here in the U.K.Ignore the critics and the haters, Suicide Squad, while light on plot, is top notch summer entertainment, and one of the most enjoyable things D.C has released yet.Like Smith said to Viola Davis (who is the scariest thing in the film) 'that's gangster'.......</fullReview>

Gorgeous cinematography, perfect character developments, thrilling action sequences, and an easy to follow plot line that'll make you enjoy every second of it. Not to mention this movie knows how to balance its seriousness with its humour. A when I say humour, I mean real humour; jokes that work with the situation, not forced punch lines like most marvel movies seem to do. Please, I urge you to go see this film it is definitely worth your time! The sequences accompanied with the soundtrack is enough to fall in love with this movie. Keep em coming DC!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is one of the best DCEU movie. It contains a lot of humor that work well in this kinda universe. The characters have so much chemistry, especially between Harley Quinn and Joker although they didn't make much of interaction. Chemistry between Rick Flag and Deadshot is interesting too. But the Characters that surprised me the most is Captain Boomerang and El Diablo. Captain Boomerang character get the best joke in my opinion in this movie. El Diablo character has a back story again in opinion the best. This movie got a really good story, maybe at certain parts is kinda confusing but in the end it solved really well. The week part of this movie is Killer Croc character. He is underused in this movie. It's just like he is there but not very important. Overall this movie is really awesome not to mention the soundtracks it's just perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I absolutely loved this Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm happy to say, Suicide Squad is a better film than Batman v Superman. Not only did it have balanced fun and seriousness (Unlike BvS), it also however made you tense in some scenes and they all were seriously well done. The action in the film was quite pleasing and though I was worried at first about the fight scenes, they were not disappointing and absolutely enjoyable. The only slight issue there is, is that Will Smith as Deadshot just felt like Will Smith playing Will Smith, and he didn't really build up to the character from the comics. Jared Leto's Joker was surprisingly well matched for the Film, and is easily my favorite movie Joker next to Heath. The Flash cameo was shocking to see, and it was a nice treat throughout the movie. Batman in this movie, was freaking scary just as the Director Said, and Ben Affleck as always, didn't disappoint his take on Batman in this movie. Overall I give this Movie a 10/10, Masterpiece. It was fun, sometimes brooding, action-packed, funny, and overall amazing. Suicide Squad was outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hot mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the last 12 months it has been almost impossible to dodge the juggernaut of a film that is 'Suicide Squad'. It really has been everywhere. The trailers appeared to pretty much give away the entire film, and I was hoping that I was wrong and it still had a few tricks up its sleeve, however this was not the case. If you've seen the trailers you almost know the entire basic story line. This was very disappointing. Also, almost every clever one-liner (barring a few exceptions from 'Harley Quinn') was included in the trailers. Bring back the good old days of 'The Dark Knight' where the trailers were unbelievably epic, and yet gave away almost nothing of the plot. The movie itself it also a bit of a mess. There are so many characters, yet none of them are that strong. Quantity over quality never works, especially when it comes to movie characters. A breakdown of a few of the characters:Harley Quinn - undoubtedly the star of the show. Margot Robbie really impressed me in this role. She was far and away the best written character and a terrific performance made her an absolute winner. She alone pretty much carries the film and keeps some quality about it.The Joker - one of the greatest characters of all time, almost completely wasted. Did the writers understand absolutely nothing about what makes The Joker great? He's not supposed to be telling jokes, but he is certainly meant to make you laugh. Jared Leto does his best, but this part of the movie was a complete miss. Never once did he make me laugh, and never once did I find him overly menacing. A horrendously mishandled chess piece that goes a large way towards why this film is so bad. Heath Ledger must be turning in his grave.Deadshot - yuck. What an awful waste, of an already one-dimensional and useless character. His power is that he is an accurate shooter? Are you kidding me? Could there be anything more boring? Then add in that Will Smith is still trying to come across as the hero/good guy the entire movie and you have another horrible element to this film. I was really hoping Smith was going to take a leaf out of Dicaprio's book when he did 'Django Unchained'. Sadly, it's nothing like that and is simply annoying.These are the only characters really worth mentioning. The rest are purely there as filler. The DC universe is in real trouble at the moment, after the abomination that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', and the reason is simple: they aren't hiring the right people to make these films. What made 'The Dark Knight' so unbelievably powerful and successful? Christopher Nolan was at the helm. Now not every film maker is capable of the standard Nolan can produce, but what irks me is that nobody is seemingly even trying to imitate what he achieved. These films are so far from what he was producing that it's ridiculous. 'Suicide Squad' has almost no story. That's unfathomable in this day and age. DC has a lot of films coming up in the near future, and unless they get a film maker on board capable of turning the tables around, they're all going to be equally as dreadful as this. It's now or never for change, but I fear they have no intention of changing.</fullReview>

I've been waiting a long time, only to watch a spoiled opportunity to make something unique. Even the over acting of Jared Leto as the joker, an actor that i've always loved, but here he tries so hard to make something different than his predecessors that he ends up making something that is not different than a regular gangster, with no presence and not timeless at all.

		<fullReview>I have watched tons of movies,both good and bad but I never felt as strongly to review a movie. I judge only the user reviews on IMDb,as there are several movies with a below average rating, but the user reviews were good and it actually turned out to be good. This movie seriously doesn't deserve the current 6.8 star rating. I fast forwarded through the movie, and even then my head is aching. I am not a Marvel fanboy or whatsoever,I enjoy good movies and I don't care which universe it belongs to. Movies like this makes you appreciate how good is Captain America: Civil war. I have watched few animated justice league movies, and those had a strong story line. This one has nothing. Even the episode on "Suicide squad" in the series Arrow , had better chemistry amongst the bad guys. I thought Batman V Superman was funny, but this one is plain ridiculous. No real plot, no real dialogues, no real action. I seriously don't know how can anyone having a sound mind enjoy this movie. I couldn't agree more with the person who commented on the distribution of power in the suicide squad.Captain Boomerang had almost zero action and it was pathetic to imagine Captain Boomerang and Harley Quinn fighting those ancient magical whatsoever! And lastly, it actually pains me to see how they have ruined the Joker. I am a big fan of Jared Leto(Mr.Nobody) and I really wish that he had a director like Nolan. He could've done wonders if the script had supported him. Crazy for the sake of being crazy; Joker is reduced to a mere caricature. Recommend: do not watch, if you ever think of yourself as one with a good taste in movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for full disclosure: I walked out just after they'd all had "Escape from New York" explosives injected and had all met up for the first time. Maybe it got better after that... Watching this movie was like reading a first-time author's novel, where he/she feels the need to give the reader 4 pages of back-story the first time the character appears.I don't care about their unhappy past life - if any of it is relevant to THIS story then show me as I need it...And not for nothing, but if I already know the backstories of the Suicide Squad members then it's all wasted on me, and if I don't know the backstories it's not essential to the movie that I should learn it all NOW.I could care less about the star-crossed lovers, or the born-again fire- demon or the heartless killer who loves his daughter.On the plus side - I thought there were a few funny lines and maybe there was something better to come from that later. But by this point there was way too long to wait and see.And the plot devices - I realise it's based on Comic books but for pete's sake is the target audience supposed to be 14 year old boys? (and if so you need more and better looking women villains I think)Take from this what you will. I went into this movie expecting very little and left early having received even less.Your Mileage May Vary (tm)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailers promised too much, that movie couldn't deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is not a bad superhero movie. But it's not the best. I think the first trailer promised too many things but the movie delivered too few. Sometimes you think it's the DC curse - those people seem to be unable to make a good movie while on the other side, Marvel makes blockbuster hits even from unknown to the general public super heroes like DeadPool.So let's start with the movie: One of the best parts of superhero movies is the initial introduction. See how beautifully every superhero was introduced on Avengers. on SSq. the introduction is weak and somehow tries to be psychedelic and funny but it's not. It's just, too badly edited.Then the "dark" part every superhero movie has nowadays: The ethical dilemmas are somehow lost between serious dialogues and comic relief lines. In the end, it seems to be more of a movie for small kids.As for acting, surely Harley Quinn is the star here, and with her partner they seem to give some color to the story-line, but again, that's just not enough. For example Willy Smith is a veteran, but he's forced to make the STUPITEST come back ("I will help you accomplish your mission because I was touched by.. something") and that's not bad acting, it's just bad script.I think the problem is on all aspects of the film (editing, script and directing) and it's a common DC movie problem, the fact that they are REALLY in a hurry to unify their universe like Marvel does, but it is SO irritating the way they do it.Even on Avengers 2, there were script problems and stupid ethical dilemmas that intended to make the movie a bit darker. S.Sq, tries to make everything dark in a ridiculous way. It's a mixed messages situation, and in the end you can't take any part of it seriously. Btw, same problem was present on "Batman vs Superman". I am not sure why writers want nowadays to paint heroes so dark while they are not. Spoiler: The SuicideSquad talks on the bar about killing people. Harley Quinn is so sensitive about the death of the family of her fellow soldier, but in the end, a dozen of prison guards die so as she can escape (and a whole bunch of others die on Joker's first attempt). Yes she's psychedelic, but people miss the point here - if a point was intended to exist.The biggest worries is that the next DC movies (with the Aquaman being introduced twice so far) will continue this bad bad tactic. DC movies get worse and worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular dropping of the ball.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suicide Squad" is not the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. Remember "Green Lantern"? "Daredevil"? "Batman and Robin"? Visionless, disrespectful travesties that failed because they didn't try hard enough. But "Suicide Squad" is just the opposite: it tries TOO hard, jumbling itself into an incomprehensible mess.It's unfortunate because there's always been a lot of potential in these characters. But somehow, even with stellar source material, David Ayer's pedigree, and a triple A cast, "Suicide Squad" falls apart before it even gets going. There's no real narrative, no cohesion to bond the film's myriad moving parts together. There's too many characters in the principal cast, each with their own backstory and not enough time for Ayer to adequately flesh them out. Then there's a handful of confusing flashbacks that hop all over the yet-to-be-truly-established DC film universe timeline. And, of course, a few vague and unexciting glimpses of what's to come when the "Justice League" films start coming out. I would also be remiss in not mentioning the main villain, Enchantress. There's really no other way to say it: she was really, REALLY terrible.But, of course, everyone's real gripe is Jared Leto and his portrayal of the Joker as some kind of unhinged Hot Topic manager who lost his mind after a particularly brutal Black Friday. Leto's been panning the movie in the press because so many of his scenes were allegedly cut, but viewers can only judge his performance based on what made it to the screen. I think he still has the potential to salvage the role, but as it stands now - it's a bonified disappointment. And for one simple reason: this version of the Joker is contrary to the essence of the character. Even before Heath Ledger took the part into the stratosphere, the Joker was always an agent of chaos - an absolute - concerned only with unraveling Batman's moral code. Money, jewels, and PURPLE LAMBORGHINIS are not on the character's radar. You can't play Batman happy and call him Batman. And you can't play the Joker as a member of ICP's entourage who wandered into a tattoo parlor in South Central.There are a few bright spots in the flick: Will Smith and Margot Robbie turn in great performances as Deadshot and Harley Quinn. And just the fact that Killer Croc - one of my favorite Batman villains - showed up in the cast was a huge bonus, although according to IMDb, most of his content was cut. I'm a huge fan of Ben Affleck's Batman (even though "Batman V. Superman" was just as jumbled and rushed as "Suicide Squad") and the few scenes he appears in were enjoyable, though not as dark or menacing as I would have wanted. And I did enjoy the helicopter scene where the Joker shows up to rescue Harley. It was the only time the Joker was on screen when I didn't cringe.I can't profess to know the machinations of major Hollywood studios and their film properties. All I can say is that as a film and comic fan, DC's last two entries into their expanding universe looked bloated and rushed. Are they playing catch up with Marvel? To my untrained eye, it would seem so. There's enough material in "Suicide Squad" and "Batman V. Superman" for three movies, if not four. But instead of moving forward at a reasonable pace, laying the groundwork for what's to come, everything looks crammed and rushed. These characters need to be established, they need a realistic base if we're ever going to understand them on the big screen.I hope that DC is able to throttle back a bit in the coming years because I love these characters and I want them to be represented in the best way possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promsing start that fizzled out midway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this open minded after the shocking sham of BVS: Dawn of Justice and was pleasantly surprised for a while. I enjoyed this and was generally fun but just pootered out leaving me feel kind of disappointed. All in all I was good. For me Margot Robbie did a fine job as Harley Quinn, Will Smith was so so and was basically the character out of I am Legend but with a costume. Jared Leto WAS indeed pretty damn good as Joker but little screen time - what you see in the trailers is pretty much what you get, give or take a few more seconds. Also didn't feel he really needed to be in it at all as his scenes seemed to be thrown in for hype value and didn't really pack a punch or follow the story. I feel he was only in it for bums on seats as non Batman/Squad/DC fans wouldn't know many of the other "Villains" if not any unless they read the comics or have played the Arkham games. For me there was a wasted opportunity for a "WOW" movie and fizzled into mediocre by the end, HOWEVER, I will state it is a fun film if you can disassociate yourself from expecting anything ground-breaking- My main gripe was it was very similar to Avengers and ,if any of you have read it, The Ultimates. Evil force trying to eliminate the world via non-descript aliens/monsters to be foiled in the end by the crew etc. The final insult was too much screen time for Bloatman...I mean Batman/Affleck - I despise his acting and the fact he is cast as one of my favourite hero/anti-hero. Whoever cast him should be strung up from a tree.Overall: OK for a wet Sunday afternoon film but not worth paying for at the Cinema.</fullReview>

Robbie's performance was by far the one that stole the show for me. Apart from these, there aren't many things to mention... The idea of the film was good but it comes down to the usual and predictable ''super-hero- movie'' plot, action which was not bad but with nothing special either, some poorly and some awkwardly developed characters (except maybe from Harley, Deadshot and Amanda), a disappointing Joker (not Leto's fault) and boring villains( i mean the witch and her brother)...Just a bit above average for me, but maybe still fun to watch!</fullReview>

Instead there was a bunch of misfits whose only purpose was to listen to Deadshot and do what he says. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto were just born to play natural born killers with love for only each other. While Harley provided most of the sick, twisted humour that a film like this should thrive on.

		<shortDescription>Kind of the best DC-Universe movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as movies within the DC universe go, this was the best (ish) so far. It's not a good movie, but the potential is showing. I liked it - but it was far from perfect.I liked how it started non-linear, but as the movie progressed they moved into a more traditional structure - taking away from the competitive edge.Characters were introduced twice, which was redundant. Just having them introduced through Amanda Waller's narration at the meeting would have been sufficient. Moreover, one member of the team did not have an introduction in the beginning of the film (let alone two), so when this character appears halfway the movie, you KNOW he/she will be dead within minutes.The soundtrack was phenomenal. The song selection was the best ever in a movie... but all the songs were cut off too soon, so you didn't get to stay in the mood they were supposed to set. They kept on playing a note or two, and right after you recognize the song they cut it away. This is REALLY REALLY REALLY annoying. Worst was the Eminem song, which they chopped up so the part that they actually played was robbed of its flow.And we must discuss the Joker, and Jared Leto's portrayal of the character. The character had a whole lot of build-up. Both in the movie itself, as in the marketing around it. Therefore, the actual LACK OF RELEVANCE he had to the plot was an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. Although Leto went totally method to get the part right, his acting came off more as imitating the Joker instead of being the Joker. And the design of the character didn't help. Maybe it's just some getting used to. But it's definitely not love at first sight.To end on a positive note: this has a slight edge on BvS and is indefinitely better than MoS. Plus, they made this before MARVEL made a Thundbolts movie. Kudos for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad is a joke ... but not a funny one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no expectations for this film , but I was still disappointed.The Story: Amanda Waller, who works for the government, compiles the "Task Force X" aka the Suicide Squad, to fight against supernatural enemies like a new evil Superman. the most important members of the squad get a little scene, which introduces them. One of them is Enchantress, a half woman-half witch. She is in love with the leader of the Suicide Squad Rick Flag. On a mission Enchantress escapes and revives her ancient brother, to destroy the whole world together. Now the Suicide Squad has to stop them. Beside this main story the Joker wants to get his girlfriend Harley Quinn, who is a member of the Task Force X.The Characters: Rick Flag is a stereotype Soldier, who just excists to include a lame lovestory in the film. Boring character Amanda Waller is ridiculous, she seems to be a really evil woman, but is just a pseud.Harley Quinn is created to be funny and cool and awesome, and she is none of it. She is just super annoying. Expected for from the trailers.Deadshot is the main character i guess, and he is definitely the coolest and best character in this movie. He has some funny and nice scenes. But even Will Smith cant save the ridiculous story.The Joker is not actually bad. Jared Leto is an amazing actor and the Joker has an interesting personality, but he got way too little screen time.Enchantress is the worst and most ridiculous character I've seen in my life, when she whispers: "Enchantress" she turns into a witch and this is so hard to watch , it is just bad.Captain Boomerang: I don't like Jai Courtney, but this role was OK... Yes the character is absolutely useless, but he was not annoying like all the other ones except Deadshot.El Diablo was OK until he transformed into the firedevil ... or whatever that was. Also he got a background story everyone saw 1000-times Killercroc was OK but useless I don't want to mention Katana because shes just ... wtf My opinion: The film wants to be epic, funny, awesome and cool, but he isn't all this at all. The story is so boring and bad. Im tired of seeing villains create a flickering, lightningthrowing, giant "EverythingDestroyingAndKillingMachine".The first Trailer was so cool, the second was eehh, and the film is just a whole mess. I will never watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was good but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am speaking as a fan of dc and a fan of movies themselves.for starters i do suggest seeing the movie i thought it was good but it could have been better.the movie to me seemed a bit off and out of balance and that was mainly due to editing.i would be watching a scene and then out of nowhere the person could move to a complete other side of the room it feels non consistent.another issue i had was with the commercials and TV spots that have been shown to us throughout the year because it doesn't fit the movie how in the trailers it was packed with action and felt like an upbeat anti-hero movie.while the movie itself felt more of a drama stle than full action.it is also very offputting when you see content in the trailers that isn't even in the movie or were changed i.e not a lot of joker and the bar scene.but i mean overall it was good with the acting and actors soundtrack and good scrip. i suggest to rent the movie first then descide if you want to buy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that doesn't make any sense. In the universe they've created there's not a real need of this squad. Having flash, batman, aqua-man, wonder woman and having all the bad guys in jail which is the need? Another reason that I think it is illogical is because the squad is made to defend the nation from a possible future meta human and i think that the Harley Quinn they've created with a bat and a gun isn't much more useful than a seal or a marine. Even though in the acting part Margot did it perfectly showing us the Harley we all wanted.And if they are gonna beat the evil guy with a bomb wouldn't it be much more intelligent to use a missile since the city is just full of zombies or whatever those monsters are?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumbled Mess!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how this movie scores a 6.8 but it was horrible. I can only attribute that to hardcore comic book fans who are blind to it and love anything comic book. What a waste of millions of dollars making this movie. Obviously none of that money went into developing a script or an actual plot line because the movie lacked both. Suicide Squad was never a very popular comic so trying to force this movie was probably a bad idea. All the Jared Leto hype leading into this movie culminated in a huge dud. The lone bright spot was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn but the makers of this movie pretty much wasted her as well. The two words in my summary say all you need to know. JUMBLED MESS!! It's scary to think that there are many more obscure characters from comics that are about to get their own movies and/or TV shows. This movie should be a blueprint for what not to do and it also shows that no matter how much money you throw at a movie if you have the wrong people in charge of making it then it will fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was so disappointing, that I think I will not be able to go to the cinema or watch a new movie for a month or two. So much money spent on such a boring and uninteresting movie !!! I don't think that I have done much in life, but I am proud that I am not the one who wrote and directed this movie (more importantly, did both of those at the same time!!!). I have never written a review; however this movie disappointed my expectations at an extreme level - and I have been waiting for the premiere for quite a long time. The rating that I gave to the movie (1 out of 10) is because cast and acting was not bad at all. But even this could not save the movie. 2 years ago I watched the worst movie in the history of the all universes - The Room (2003). I thought that George Eastman would not pioneer using photographic film knowing that such movie would ever be recorded. However, as of now, if I were given the choice to either watch "the room" or watch the "Suicide Squad" again, I would choose first one without even thinking about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had a potential to be a good movie,But still better than BvS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PROS: 1)Harley Quinn and Deadshot stole the spotlight Both of them acted beautifully! Margot Robbie acted true to character,and Will Smith played as... more of himself than his character.This supports the next point2)The Humor kept the ball rolling The movie had a good sense of humor. Majority of which was given by Harley and DeadshotCONS:1)JOKER was FALSELY ADVERTISED!When we saw the trailer for the Suicide Squad film,we presumed that The Joker will be the main villain in the movie ,even though he had less screen time , it was more compared to Batman and the Flash(HEY I GAVE YOU A SPOILER WARNING!),i.e his value to the movie was more of a cameo,or a side cast at best just like Batman/Flash.2)LESS ACTION SEQUENCES FOR THE MAIN BOSS FIGHTI know,I sounded like this as it was a video game,but honestly if you watch it,it looks like a video game.You got you heroes(i.e bad guys forced to be heroes)rounded up,kill a an army of bad guys and at the end you fight the main boss.OK,now back to the point. In the first half of the movie, El Diablo did not contribute to the fight due to guilt of accidentally killing his family and seeing what a danger to society he is.However he got his shot when he alone fights the brother of Enchantress,... it wasn't that great .. It would have looked a lot cooler though if the squad helped him out .However , Enchantress boss fight was too short,she just teleports here and there and then gives a cliché villainy speech "JOIN ME or DIE!" then gets deceived by Harley Quinn and takes her heart out. Finish..... Yeah that's it.3)Other than Deadshot and Harley Quinn:Barely any action scenes was shown for Killer Croc, Katana and Captain Boomerang .El Diablo is an exception. WHY I GAVE IT 7/10: Honestly I am comic book fan, so whatever I had expected from the books was well portrayed , so I was pleased to see them on the big screen.But due to cons mentioned above,he it didn't reach the hype we wanted.,ESPECIALLY the part where Joker wasn't the villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere between "Ghostbusters" and "Avengers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suicide Squad" is another mildly entertaining film--I wasn't expecting much after I'd heard it was trying to be like "Deadpool". I haven't seen "Deadpool" yet but one film trying to be like another is never a really a healthy sign. The pacing is so similar to "Ghostbusters", and at some scenes the members of "Suicide Squad" come together like they are the next "Avengers", but the characters just don't have the chops for it. Will Smith's character can shoot straight, cool. Another is hot and crazy--Harley Quinn. The other is an over the top psycho--The Joker. Throw in some real life Navy seals, great CGI and some otherworldly witches, and it all adds up to a watchable film. I really enjoyed Mr. Ayers' "The Fury". I suppose the DC universe puts expectations on to a writer\director. You can be good, just don't be great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes OK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We stepped right out of our comfort zone and went to the movies onnaSaturday and the movie that we saw was SUICIDE SQUAD despite the fact that it has been panned by those who make a living panning stuff. It appeared to be the sort of no-brainer that appeals to us. Given the choice between 'Starship Troopers' and 'Philadelphia' we are unlikely to take the latter path of social empathy.A team of super-doopers is put together in case something bad happens, Superman being, it appears, no longer an option. Batman is still around I think but I might've missed his death. The team has all the bases covered with the standout being a perkily-buttocked Harley Quinn who is played by an Australian but sounds American. There is an Australian squadee called 'Captain Boomerang' (Jesus wept!) who sounds like an American playing an Australian but is played by 'Jai' someone or other and as Jai is a name much favoured by bogans he might well have been an Australian. Anyway he's not much chop.The Joker is also in it and he goes OK too. Not as good as the Heathster, but runs a respectable second and he rogers Harley after giving her an acid bath.The squad is put together by ominous CIA type who is not a prisoner taker. Think Bronwyn Bishop with less mercury applied. Lee Lin Chin was BORN for this role.It being a super hero movie a disaster-with-villain is essential. This takes the form of an ancient enchantress and her dodgy brother who decide to destroy the world. Mind you they do have some justification. We've nicked her heart and implanted her into a love interest for a special forces guy. There is always a Special Forces guy. Enchantress is hot but a bad dancer. She doesn't look her age.There are lumpy-headed zombie thingies and a tattooed torch with guilt issues. There is a Deadshot freshie from Bel-Air, and a native American warrior who, in keeping with the pilgrimcentric idea of Americana, is shifty and killed early. There is a big guy with bad skin and pointy teeth. He takes his shirt off but is unlikely to attract the attention of Tarzan who apparently had a 'V' which sends womenfolk into a girl-frenzy. REAL men, and I consider myself one, do not have a 'V'. We have a 'Q' And there is a soundtrack! Creedence, Leslie Gore, Norman Greenbaum, Rolling Stones, Queen and Black Sabbath. Eric Burdon and AckaDacka (ruined by Captain Boomerang). And SWEET. And these are just the ones I remember! It is Tarantinoesque and it was worth the seniors admission just to listen to it. We shall buy the soundtrack.Is it any good? Depends on what you want to compare it to. Ghostbusters? Tarzan? Seen 'em both and it's much more better. There are some funny bits and some serious bits but they might've just been poorly written funny bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promising looking title that did not live up to its expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide squad seemed a title that was promising and had many possibilities but it wasn't anywhere near as good as it could have been. The film took at least 40 minutes before the story started, it took so long to introduce the characters and face lots of details about some for example Harley Quinn and said little about others. The story line was very basic and could have been expanded further and made more complex. At times I feel like Margo Robbie's acting and jokes as Hayley Quinn were the only thing keeping the film going. The acting was of a good standard but he character development was poor. The cast were quite well known so I expected this to be potentially an award winning film but it was nothing of the sort I even felt my self zoning out at times. The sound tack was great but I hardly heard any of the songs during the film for example heathens and sucker for pain. The ending wasn't great because it left me thinking that there could be a second film but who would find it as the first instalment was so poor. Not worth the watch at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to see exactly how people see this as a god-awful flick. Yes there are certainly problems, but nothing that prevented me from enjoying it. Maybe it's the disappointment talking, or perhaps people don't like DC but for whatever reason, nobody gives this film any credit.PLOT: A common complaint is the plot being incoherent and not making sense. While I admit the plot is relatively weak, it is coherent and gives the squad their purpose. There are scenes included just to please fans or just for the trailer, but they are very few. It doesn't stray too far from what we expect which is disappointing, but the concept of bad guys saving the day was enough to keep me interested. VILLAIN: There are similar problems for the villain too. The villain would have benefited from a touch more backstory, but as it stands their motivations and actions can be understood well enough. They are there to serve a purpose and not much else. No original master plan, and nothing that sets them apart from other antagonists. They aren't particularly interesting, but it's fine.THE SQUAD: As someone who doesn't follow the comics at all, I feel that the characters are well enough established here. For the run-time the squad was fleshed out in the right places. However, I wished I could have seen more of El Diablo and Katana. Harley and Deadshot were treated to a lot of screen time and the most backstory, and the rest of the team were definitely developed as characters, but didn't get a detailed story. The characters share good chemistry and their personalities are shown through all round great performances.THE JOKER: While the other characters stay true to who that character is meant to be or how I see them, this incarnation of The Joker sadly doesn't impress me. While Leto's performance is good and kept me interested, he doesn't seem to have anything new to bring to the character. The Joker seems more like a common thug here, wearing bling, driving custom cars and wearing a grill. Also, his relationship with Harley isn't how I imagined. He is shown saving her, risking his own life and being more into her than I feel he should be. In other versions, he uses her and manipulates her but also enjoys his time doing so. There are no mind games or clever antics here.OTHER POINTS: The soundtrack is mostly great, there are times when it seems they are using well known songs every minute but overall it adds a bit more fun.There are a few funny moments to contrast the dark tone of the film. A few more funny moments would have been great.The female characters are over-sexualized. I gave Harley a pass because of her flirty and fun personality. However, the costume for Enchantress can't be ignored.IN CONCLUSION: While a lot of this film is predictable and seen before, every actor involved gives a great performance. It's great to see these characters being realized on the big screen and it doesn't take itself too seriously (like other DC films), and it makes this a good, fun summer movie. Where it shines is in the characters, and while they could have expanded on more of them, it's certainly enjoyable to watch what they did include.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CRITICAL-SUICIDE SQUAD NO SPOILER The film starts from the point where Batman Vs Superman ends. Villains They are recruited fearing an alleged threat of "evil Superman" or similar alien force, an ambitious plan Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). The chosen are Gunslinger (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Crocodile (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Magic (Cara Delevingne) .Juntos they form the Suicide Squad. With remakes made a few months before the release of the film, some cuts and narratives were embarrassing and confused. This is very clear we first minutes of film. The direction the script is on account of David Ayer. He wanted to do a feature on a team, but just focusing and giving more importance to Margot Robbie and Will Smith, after all are the best known and experienced in big screen. Having all this space Margot Robbie did not disappoint, beautiful dangerous and troubled, he stole the scenes he appeared, starring some of the best moments. Will Smith knowing choose his papers did not leave to be desired as the gunman, character It sold very well for him, with the best long action scenes. Beyond these two character another character that was exploited was the Diablo, the remaining balance and miss time, the impression now is they were there just to complete the team. Joker ... Joker is a of the greatest villains of comics, being played by Jared Leto, left much to be desired, it is only an infantile version of Crazy Heath Ledger (Christopher Nolan Joker). Joker is sociopath, selfish, crazy not care about anyone, this film is a spoiled boy. Suicides squad has some of the best trails sonar as with a amazing musical selection as The Animals (The House of the Rising Sun), Severn Nation Army (The White Stripes), Sympathy for the Devil (The Rolling Stones), Paranoid (Black Sabbath), but that does not work, the impression that happens is that we are hearing a great playlist More that does not fit the plot. Is clearly trying to do the same Guardians of the Galaxy on its track. Only it was not well in the attempt, the which is a shame with such good songs. Suicide Squad is fun, Score. Not the best film adapted from comic ta far from being the worst. Could be better, much better but still is already a big step for the DC in theaters, which is learning from mistakes.PERSONAL NOTE: 5/10 DIRECTION: David Ayer DISTRIBUTOR: Warner Bros</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by telling you that I still haven't seen Batmand vs Superman. Despite this fact, I think you can understand the movie and the references; you're not loosing anything. I think this movie should be called "DeadShot and Harley Quinn", because when you think about it, these are the only characters from Suicide Squad that actually have some development and background stories; the remaining members don't seem to have such an interesting development, and there's one that dies right in the beginning of the "gang" being released.Furthermore, I must say I didn't enjoy the fact that Harley Quinn must be IN EVERY SCENE!! I mean, every time there's communication between some members of the Squad, Harley must talk... but why? It becomes annoying, and frankly there are some parts that could be cut (like the purse scene). Deadshot was an interesting character, but I must say it's very similar to other movies WIll Smith has made (like Hancock), so it looses originality. Despite these "complains", the movie is fun to watch. If you are interested in a similar movie to several other superhero movies, but with the funny twist of being the bad guys the main characters, go ahead, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now before people start screaming about shutting me down, keep in mind, that I've promoting and talking about this film for over a year now. Not only that, but I was actually one of the nut jobs standing out in the rain at midnight, waiting to see it the night it came out, and I can honestly say I am disappointed. First of all, how do you make a film like this and not go all out for the R rating? Second, isn't there something wrong with a Joker who is more sexy than he is funny? Let's get into the film. Following the events of Dawn of Justice, the government is afraid that with the death of Superman, should another meta-human come to earth, they won't be prepared to stop them, so they turned to the most skilled and deadly people they can find, the worst of the criminal element. The film starts with a rushed introduction to the characters, which is focuses on Deadshot (Will Smith). So there he is, the Fresh Prince at age 48, with the same persona he had in Independence Day, twenty years ago, telling the same type of jokes that were old then, after 8 years in Bel-Arie, and they are basically per-historic now! After basic training and more jokes aimed at thirteen year olds, they are dropped into the city and dredge on to their main object. Exactly like Katniss Everdeen in Mockingjay Pt. 2, except at least then there were some decent special effects and they weren't fighting big globs of s***. The story here is so basic that it's laughable, the make-up was better than the special effects, and the humor that was supposed to make this movie a classic just isn't there. That's the bad, what about the good? Jared Leto is still the perfect choice to play the Joker, unfortunately he doesn't get enough screen time, and he's not funny, if they ever let him off the leash in future DC films, I'd image he'd give a performance that would rival that of Heath Ledgers. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is the breakout star of the film, and really the only one worth watching in this mess of madness, as she was genuinely entertaining, and may actually be able to use this film as a launching point for a very promising future. I also loved seeing Joel Kinnaman of the Killing, finally get some of the attention he deserves, as he's always great and deserves a lot better than Robocop.The bottom line is that the Suicide Squad should have put DC right up there with Marvel, but it falls flat on it's face. There is no story, no character development, nothing that says we're catching up. While Suicide Squad is pulling in big numbers at the box office, if DC continues to disappoint us, the way they have with their last two blockbusters, that's not going to last either. It's time to take the gloves off and give the fans what they want, because this certainly wasn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or "Antihero gone wrong." Or maybe "Direct-to-TV movie on the big screen". It's like watching some Thor: The Dark World - you don't know what the bloody actual duck is going on. Everything is so faceless, everything is so stretched out... but at least there it kind of looked like a superhero movie.This thing... I think this should actually be Ghosbusters 3, with Gozer coming back. Because, seriously, there was nothing superhero here. I know it's about metahumans and stuff, but damn, if Jeremy Renner can pull it off(much less Deadpool) - why can't a whole freaking squad?Speaking of the squad - it's laughable. Over 50% of the people probably went to see the movie just to look at Margot Robbie's underwear. She acted well, granted, but was probably the biggest eye candy there is. Is that how she really is in comics? I know Black Widow is blamed for that reason exactly, but she is at least in a full leather suit and has quite a character. Harley's character is like a punchline without a joke. She has a couple of bullying scenes, but instead of being a strong, ferocious fighter, she is... just being there for the shots. She narrates, gets the shots, and that's it.Deadshot, to be honest, does not need to be played by Smith. Really, the amount of character and the amount of action he had - could've been easily done by any black Marvel actor. Why would I say it... oh, right, because they've already had more character, so it's done. I admit, I don't like Smith, he is overpaid and over-hyped. But if he can do things, like the original Independence Day or other older movies - he does it. Here he just... makes a few faces occasionally. And delivers a few lines of forced dialogue. I don't see why people think he saves the movie. He is written, sort of, but he gets too much screen time for no good reason. He is like the leader against all common sense, a cute and cuddly assassin, who is suddenly legit. One would think an assassin, who can whack-talk a buyer into 2$mil salaries - would've done a few jobs and disappeared, just stolen his daughter for f's sake and lived in a mansion somewhere remote. No, he needs to be kind of Ant Man, who is struggling to get a job in Baskin Robbins.Rick Flag is... yawn. Anyone watched Captain Phillips? Now there's the SEAL Leader. Just a leader of a spec-ops team created to get -it done. Almost R. Lee Ermey style. Here we have a pussy-whipped American hero, who... Do I really need to continue?That's about it. Diablo is DC's Quicksilver. A character sort of there just to die stupidly in the end. Katana doesn't do anything(except ridicule the Japanese culture, down to the point of harakiri). Jay Courtney is, as always, wasting screen time. Killer Croc's biggest performance in the movie was the reveal that he is black. And why exactly did they add Slipknot? To show that Jay is an a-hole? It's funny, with the speed of his escape, a child could gun him down, but he needed to be made an example...As for the Joker... well, I kind of liked him. He tried. Overacted, perhaps, but at least he tried to get to the comics' level. Unfortunately, there is a thin line between smart and crazy, and Leto went with full on crazy. We've had a clown of the nineties. We've had an unnerving terrorist of Nolan. And in the comics, he looked crazy, but he was ultimately sinister. Here he just... kinda... makes faces, does crazy things... He serves as an exposition, and not just as an exposition, but more like a wrong advertisement. Like a dentist's drilling tool in the toothpaste ad. Looks good, but leaves an aftertaste... Still, as any crazy character - at least crazy is guaranteed to have character, and Leto gets a credit for trying.Now for the bad guys. Well, they pop out of out nowhere. Here's Enchantress, deciding to do... uhm... a little bit of night walking, which conveniently coincides with the anti-heroes first class. Her brother is that kind of invulnerable almighty guy that will die, because of something stupid. Like Apocalypse. And she is practically Azazel+Scarlet Witch, but all she does is a bit of choreography for the camera, and then she gets fooled like a troll in the first Hobbit movie. She can read their minds, see them through the walls, but she can't predict the most obvious deception? Who wrote that again? Oh, right, that was not about her, it was about Harley, she had to do something in the whole movie.As for the minions, they are the classic minions. When they attack random SWAT teams - they are some ravaging, shifting and unkillable monsters, tearing people apart etc. When they fight out heroes, they become those droids from The Phantom Menace, who kind of just sit there on your shoulder until you throw them off. And they die with one bullet shot(or baseball bat whack)On top of that - many questions remain:-Who was shooting at the helicopters? -Why did Walker's helicopter escape 20 feet off the ground right into the lightshow? -Why did Walker keep these artifacts in her bedroom? So... yes, for the small screen, a TV flick with a little bit of CGI, some costumes, little character development and crazy plot - that'd be quite a nice evening watch. But theatrical release with 175$mil budget? Let me guess, Will Smith costed at least 50.Let's call Suicide Squad a "Scary Movie" of "DCU". Scary Movie 4 of DCU, to be precise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dc is rushing to catch up with marvels cinematic universe and its so obvious in their films, Batman vs Superman and Suicide squad, both films tried to set up too many characters and already we have a justice league film coming next year!, marvel took their sweet time and it showed, Dc is now making terrible films in an attempt to equal Marvel. The only good characters are the Joker, who is actually pretty good, Harley Quinn who's humour and personality is played perfectly and Deadshot, because Will smith, but that doesn't compensate for a lack of character development, poor villain and some bad editing. If you are a hardcore Dc fan then you might enjoy this but this film is not worth watching otherwise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Flashy, Not Quite Enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason my rating is 5/10, is me being a DC Universe fan and Assault on Arkham appreciator. I'm pretty sure that I would rate this movie higher if I was new to the comics.First of all, the idea of creating the Squad was a bit off.It's hardly believable that a group of "The worst of the worst" Arkham inmates could ever defeat "insuperable entity." I found it amusing but sometimes "less is more" really. They could easily stick to the more human, non-alien and not so mass destruction issues and make the movie even more entertaining. Mass destruction attracts superheroes!Above mentioned "The worst of the worst" in my eyes are bunch of psychopaths with no remorse and no social skills. Instead, we got a bunch of affliction seeking, strange and loving family of criminals that care for each other. I find it a bit silly.Now, I realize that Robbie and Smith are made to be the coolest, but I also think it was a bit cringe worthy...Will Smith's Deadshot blurting out unnecessary one liners throughout the whole movie was simply too much. Furthermore, Will Smith's Floyd Lawton was ridiculous. Sporting that weird outfit that strongly reminds of that 90-s music videos Smith did, back when M in the MTV stood for music. Also, original Deadshot is white.Harley Quinn would never hide her tears if something happened to Joker. She might be crazy, but she is obsessed with Joker. Also, that rooftop scene when Harley is bulletproof?Joker risking his life and/or freedom to rescue Harley? NOPE.Enchantress was pretty dumb and weak for a magic wielding witch. Hurt by the wooden bat? Eh.The whole plot was a bit shaky but entertaining. I just couldn't find the right wavelength to the most of the characters (also, I'm a bit butt-hurt because Killer Frost is not in the movie.) In my opinion, SS members should have been more distant to each other and fulfill the true meaning of "antihero" or "villain." Instead, they all behaved like teenagers who want to be accepted by the rest of the group. A lack of sacrificial lambs in this movie is really weird since they put in an effort to make so many unimportant characters.Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, Katana, El Diablo could all die and I wouldn't care less.I liked Amanda Waller, she really was cruel, mean and I enjoyed in her character portrayal more than I should. I really didn't mind her not being more intelligent.All in all, the movie itself is overly hyped, fun to watch, comic book based Hollywood creation everyone will forget about in a month or two. There were some awesome CGI scenes I always appreciate. The music was really unobtrusive, yet it made an impact on the atmosphere. Sound effects were really neat- a big plus if you are watching it in cinema.But despite being fun and flashy, there's almost no more to it. Leto's Joker was one dimensional and he didn't do anything to make his role distinct from all the other Jokers. I actually have a feeling that this movie is a pile of various and fresh, but extremely unconnected ideas. I think the idea binding ingredient was to take animated movies like Assault on Arkham more seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try hard mess of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is not a movie as much as it is a buy product of items from Hot Topic. To quote YourMovieSucksDOTorg I found this movie to be 25 percent cringe worthy and 75 percent boring. As a fan of the comics it is genuinely insulting to see all of these dark character's be done in such of superficial way. Every character excluding the Joker was playing themselves and not the character's they are playing.The best part of this movie was the Joker in the sense that he was laughably bad. Every second that the Joker was on screen Jared Leto was trying so hard to be intimidating and insane that he just came off as an eccentric crime boss from the Simpsons. His performance was so over the top that if there was more of him in the movie I probably could have enjoyed this film as a so bad its funny, but that is unfortunately not the case.The primary problem with this movie is the fact that is has on over emphases on a dark color palate in this light tone. This was distracting in scenes were there was a lot of light and of fire. This is also the reason the film is an eye sore on a visual level. There were also a lot of unnecessary flash back sequence's that came out of no were. This would have distracted from the story if it was the least bit cohesive.People may argue that the movie was edited to death and there go it deserves to be cut slack. But in reality my point of view is if it is not in the movie its not in the movie. There are obvious cuts, and even cuts to black which shows there was no effort to conceal the cut.In conclusion this is nothing more then an inconsistent, tone shifting, and edited try hard film. However I can see how somebody could find entertainment from this movie If not only to see character's they like on the big screen. But as I look at this as a film it is horrible. And I'm giving this one a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the trailers for Suicide Squad looked fantastic and was really excited to see this film but unfortunately this turned out to be a bit of a let down. When I think back to what the story line actually was and how I would explain it to someone I realise that it was all a bit confusing. Not in a perplexing or challenging way, but in senseless way that lacked real credibility. It felt like there was a great idea here, and with a heavyweight cast and some excellent visuals, the real possibility for something special. But it had no substance or execution. It felt rushed. A lack of genuine depth saw the latter scenes descend into farcical action sequences. The concluding action scene itself felt like stepping into an acid trip. Another feeling of - how did this get here?? Although I have made these personal observations I still rated this as a 6 because there are positives for the film, and overall it was visually an enjoyable experience. I thought Jared Leto was exceptional in his take on the Joker. He was menacing and unpredictable and I would have liked to have seen more. Margot Robbie was seductively playful and also enjoyably unpredictable. Viola Davis also deserves a mention for her sinister turn. Some of the visuals and action sequences were fantastic to watch. Overall verdict: Despite the huge build up this film really didn't deliver. Action sequences are lazily added to cover a lack of genuine plot. Despite the great visuals and some really enjoyable performances I felt my mind often drifting and wondering about why this was all happening. Essentially the action springs out of the premise of assembling a team to deal with a catastrophe but in doing exactly that create the catastrophe. It's a bit senseless as there was nothing to react to in the first place so the entire film's action is unwarranted and unnecessary because by the end there is no apparent or credible reason or explanation for any of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected, but still not a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, yeah - it's a super hero movie. It doesn't suck the way a lot of people are crowing about, but it's not a masterpiece either the way a lot of other people are shouting.The good: I thought Margot Robbie's acting, without mentioning her accent, was pretty much spot on for what I would have expected from Harley Quinn. (I came close to naming my Harley Sportster "Harley Quinn" but then this movie started being advertised, so I named her "Binky.") The plot made sense, even if it was a bit of a stretch here and there. Other people have complained about it, but I liked the music. I thought "Spirit in the Sky" was misplaced when it started, but whatever. Viola Davis plays a bad guy pretty well. I thought the actor who played Griggs (Ike Barinholtz) did a great job making us care about him and what happened. Jay Hernandez did a good jobs as Diablo. Most of the SFX didn't suck.The bad: Well, Margot Robbie's here and then gone again accent. (I could give her a slight break because I know how hard it is to carry an accent throughout a performance. But, OTOH, this wasn't a live show, she could have had an accent coach, and she got paid a lot more than I ever have, so no - no slight break.) For me the show screeched to a halt every time Leto's joker appeared on the screen. Man, I hated that characterization. It simply didn't work for me, even a little bit. Ditto Cara Delevingne - my Lord she is a terrible actress. And IMHO her body might look nice but her face certainly isn't all that. So, with the lack of a trace of acting ability coupled with not being gorgeous - she must be sleeping with someone to be getting these acting gigs. I simply couldn't buy her enchantress except when she was hidden under heavy makeup and CGI. Why the heck was Captain Boomerang in this story? He didn't add anything plot wise. At least Slipknot was there to show us the effectiveness of the "persuasive device" used to make the Suicide Squad go along.The ho hum: So yeah, once again Will Smith played Will Smith. If you like his "Oh hell no!" plus his "now I'm going to speak slower in a lower register so you can tell I'm a serious and tortured soul" then you will like his 1,000th (a made-up number to emphasize my point) rendering of this character.All in all, not a failed movie and not a master piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this DC Comics based movie looked great, many of the most well known supervillains brought together, I was certainly hoping it would be an improvement on the disappointing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, directed by David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, Training Day, End of Watch, Fury). Basically in the aftermath of Superman's death, at Belle Reve Penitentiary, intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) has assembled a team of dangerous criminals: former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), elite hit man Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot (Will Smith), pyrokinetic ex-gangster El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), opportunistic thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), monstrous cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and specialised assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach). Under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (RoboCop's Joel Kinnaman), the team are to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the U.S. government, the criminals are told their individual sentences will be reduced, and they have small bombs implanted in their necks, which will detonate if any try to rebel or escape. Former archaeologist and Flag's girlfriend June Moone (Cara Delevingne) was intended recruit, touching a cursed idol she is possessed by a witch-goddess known as "Enchantress", she has turned on everyone and wants to eradicate mankind, she has surrounded Midway City with monsters, begun creating a weapon, and summoned her brother Incubus (Alain Chanoine) to assist her. The squad is deployed and briefed, they are under the impression they are tackling a terrorist attack, but they are convinced it is a suicide mission, they are joined by mystic sword wielding Katana (Karen Fukuhara), she is acting as Flag's bodyguard. Meanwhile, Harley's lover, psychopathic supervillain the Joker (Jared Leto) finds out about her predicament, he tortures Waller's man Griggs (Ike Barinholtz) and is lead to the facility where the nano bombs are made, the Joker blackmails a scientist into disabling Harley's bomb. The team's helicopter is shot down as they approach, forcing them to continue on foot, Slipknot is convinced by Boomerang the bombs are a ruse to keep them under control, he is killed attempting to escape, while the Enchantress' minions attack the team. The team manage to escape and reach a safe room, where they learn Waller herself is their mark, she is trying to cover her involvement, the squad escort Waller to the roof for extraction, but the Joker and his men have hijacked the helicopter, they open fire while Harley climbs aboard, however they are shot down, Harley jumps out while the Joker seemingly perishes in the explosion, Harley rejoins the team. Waller is kidnapped by the Enchantress' minions, while Deadshot confronts Flag about secret files found with the truth about the Enchantress, the squad members and Katana leave Flag after he confesses the truth, with Waller compromised, Flag chooses to continue and relieves the squad of the mission. The team realise they have the opportunity to prove themselves, they rejoin Flag, locate the Enchantress and Waller at a partially flooded subway station, the squad fight the Enchantress and her forces, while Killer Croc and Navy Seals, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards (Scott Eastwood, Clint's son), plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and manages to hold Incubus down, the bomb goes off underneath, El Diablo, Incubus and Edwards are killed, the squad members are defeated battling Enchantress, in exchange for their allegiance she offers to fulfil their deepest desires, Harley appears to accept in order to get close to Enchantress and cut her heart out. The weapon is destroyed by explosives thrown by Killer Croc and shot by Deadshot, Enchantress' heart is crushed by Flag, Enchantress is killed and June is freed, Waller emerges alive and the squad members are returned to Belle Rave with ten years off their sentences. In the end, all but Captain Boomerang have special privileges, the Joker breaks out Harley, and Waller meets Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who agrees to protect her backlash, in exchange for access to government files on the expanding metahuman community. Also starring Common as Monster T, Jim Parrack as Frost, David Harbour as Dexter Tolliver and We Need to Talk About Kevin's Ezra Miller as The Flash. Smith is great as the expert assassin with a bit of leniency, Robbie is terrifically mad and flirtatious Harley Quin, the big screen live action debut for the character (first invented in Batman: The Animated Series), Leto is an interesting alternative Joker, covered in tattoos with gold teeth, Davis is menacing, and some of the other supporting stars do well also. It seems that the recent trend of superhero movies are dominated and most successful in the Marvel Universe, which does well with its banter and breeziness, this is certainly better than the last offering from DC, the special effects are fantastic, the story is just about passable, the and the soundtrack featuring songs such as Grace feat. G-Eazy - "You Don't Own Me", Eminem" Without Me", The Animals - "The House of the Rising Sun", Creedence Clearwater Revival - "Fortunate Son", Black Sabbath - "Paranoid", The White Stripes ? "Seven Nation Army", Norman Greenbaum ? "Spirit in the Sky", K7 ? "Come Baby Come" and Queen - "Bohemian Rhapsody" is brilliant, all in all it's a fun anti- superhero fantasy action film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joker - Merchandising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first minute of Joker, you have seen all about Joker. We had a lot of information about the best performance of Joker by Jared Leto... but at the end, it wasn't the best. For me, the best Joker was "Heath Ledger", no doubt, and Jack Nicholson as well. Because when you see them, you believe the role, they are real. Sorry but Jared Leto made a very forced performance, it is artificial. And the problem is that we had a lot advertisements, information, trailers, news... etc.. about he is the best Joker in the history... but at the end is "Merchandising".I give a 6 because Margot Robbie, Will Smith and others were great in their roles. And for me the best was Margot Robbie. The role of "Harley Quinn" is real, you believe it, it isn't forced, that madness is natural. Margot Robbie is a great discovery, imagine Margot Robbie and Heath Ledger together... should be perfect.The story line is normal, nothing new, you will get fun but it isn't the best super heroe movie. What a pity, DC has the best super-heroes: Batman, Superman, Joker, Harley Quinn... but DC doesn't get all potential.Regards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond the interesting aesthetic, "Suicide Squad" doesn't really have much going for it and is nothing more than a film dedicated to Batman and Superman's enemies in which they compare their abilities to see who's the best of all. Thanks to some interesting characters, this is a fun film to watch, but not as much fun as it should have been. It's actually disappointing to see all that potential wasted. But despite some major flaws, this film has good performances from Will Smith and Margot Robbie and a few solid action scenes. "Suicide Squad" had the potential to be an awesome superhero summer blockbuster but unfortunately everything is so flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dc have some of the biggest names in the comic world with the likes of batman, superman, the joker etc etc. Yet despite this its marvel who are the ones able to produce the bigger and better films which is why i am worried for the DC universe. The film is not bad but considering the amout of big names and characters that are involved in suicide squad you would expect it to be much MUCH better. The plot is basic and very thin although there is some great action scenes the film lacks excitement, margot robbie (harley quinn) is superb and one of the highlights of the film, the joker (jared leto) was good but not great and will smith as deadshot was brilliant. The good was some of the cast and the bad was the plot and story, but watching this film does do 1 thing and that's make you appreciate batman vs superman film.If DC don't sort out the next phase of films they will be in a lot of trouble as the first 2 were films that got people excited and both fell short, suicide squad is worth watching with a run time of 110 mins its not too long but i would not go out of your way to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but a step in the right direction for the DCEU.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Batman v Superman came, I was pumped out of my mind for that movie because I love DC, I wanted it to be spectacular, I wanted it to be the greatest movie in existence... and well, needless to say, it wasn't. But for a while, I was in denial, I didn't want to believe it was anything but great, even if some things were strange or didn't make any sense. As time passed and the more I thought about it, the more I disliked it, and the extended edition just made it worse. And then Suicide Squad came, I really liked it, but I wanted to wait a couple of days before reviewing it because I didn't want to be "biased".And well, I thought this was a very fun movie and I was thoroughly entertained, although it has it's fair share of problems. The story is pretty bad, it didn't make a lot of sense, and I'm not gonna go into spoilers but the villain in the movie was dreadful, and to me it was probably the worst part of the film. Also the editing was very choppy. Those were my main complaints after I left the cinema, and they still are. One might think after everything I just said I would give it a very bad score, except like I said, I really enjoyed this movie, and they did right most of the things I wanted done right, namely the squad. The squad characters, and their interactions were just fantastic, they had a great dale chemistry together, and they were really funny.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was fantastic, just how I imagined her, Will Smith was also great as Deadshot, they added a lot of soul to the film. Viola Davis was phenomenal as Amanda Waller, one of the best performances in the movie. Jay Hernandez as Diablo was also pretty good, I wish they'd focused a little more on him. Jai Courtney was surprisingly funny as Boomerang, this is his best role by far. Jared Leto was good, I wish they wouldn't have cut most of his scenes. That being said the other characters weren't that interesting by themselves or weren't developed enough, namely Killer Croc, Rick Flag, and the Enchantress, who was especially bad. Also (not really a spoiler because he was shown in the trailers) the Batman cameo, his scenes short albeit great, I really enjoyed them.Overall this film could've been a lot better, with a better script and less studio meddling, and I know there was a good movie in this one, but I still have hope that the next DCEU movie will be great.5.5/10</fullReview>

Certainly some movie goers might be disappointed in the lack of production values and star power but "Suicide Squad" stands up quite well as an entertaining, well written, well directed summer flick. Will Smith (Deadshot), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), and Jared Leto (the Joker) all give credible performances as well rounded action heroes and Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) stand out simply by acting against type. If you are only going to see one movie this summer, do not go to see "Suicide Squad". But if your week sucked and your brain needs a rest, I guarantee you will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was watching Suicide Squad, I was waiting for something exciting to happen. I was waiting until the movie finished. This film had a whole lot of bad, and not many good things. Lets discuss why the film doesn't work. First, the setup was awful. Viola Davis wanted to get the suicide squad together before the threat occurred, didn't work for the plot unfortunately. The action scenes we're boring, the lighting was so low I could barely see what was happening. Diablo's character's mini plot was destroyed once he used his powers too early on, you can't develop him after that so why try. The backstories were OK, but didn't effect the audience, at least for me. And the ending was the biggest downfall. No one celebrates the suicide squad. I can't even cheer for the heroes after they save the world, Than what am I suppose to be happy about?, I thought this was suppose to be a fun movie, nothing happened that made me feel like I was having fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..looks and sounds good, with great characters... but story and plot need A LOT of work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think of 'super hero movies' I often hear them- the 'Crow', 'Spawn' and 'Watchmen' movies all having such amazing sound tracks that a blind person could enjoy them equally. This is one of those awesome 'audio' movies with both modern and retro blaring beats.It also has a fun color palette and visuals to match. All in all... it looks and sounds good, with great characters... but story and plot need A LOT of work! Instead of building a universe like 'Marvel', 'DC' has just thrown piles of money, characters and CGI at the wall like it did with 'Dawn of Justice' and fortunately for their pocketbooks and the zeitgeist most of it works.Will Smith is NOT terrible, and it turns out he DOES 'play well' with others, which doesn't explain why he hasn't been in an ensemble since 'Independence Day' 20 years ago? Margo Robbie is ALL and everything that you have seen and heard. She portrays fan favorite 'Harley Quinn' perfectly for the characters first live performance and she looks AMAZING every second of the film.Cara Delevingne's 'Enchantress' is the only thing that could tear your eyes from Robbie. Her character has about four incarnations, each almost unrecognizable from the last and is completely fantastic and horrifying at most times.'Joker' is excellent and should have been an integral part of the story instead of a reoccurring gimmick and back story. Jarod Leto is King in this role, playing a very slick and sexy version of the character. I am busting to see his chemistry with Ben Affleck's gritty 'Batman'.The rest of the gang are pretty cool and fun, but at NO point in the movie does this team come across as 'the bad guys'. They're abused at points by their jailers and constantly threatened with death if they are disobedient, which paints them more like victims, and their actions out of prison are almost solely heroic.The plot unfortunately is filled with holes and incredulity. It was more like a 'Justice League' threat, than a job for these convicted criminals. I feel it should have been less epic, and more of a "send a fox to catch a fox..." type story. There was so much unnecessary CGI, explosions, SFX and superfluous characters like the army guys running around all the time. There are three helicopter crashes that everyone survives in the middle of the city. The final enemy/threat/fight is sort of stupid, considering they are almost all 'B-list Batman villains' and the enemy are basically two omnipotent gods.Lots to love in this movie, but once again, seems like it should have been a 'second or third phase' movie, rather than the third installment of the 'DC Universe' building attempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was mostly exited for this movie because Jared Leto was on it, and he stole every scene in Dallas buyers club, one of my favorite movies ever. Plus, the told me that Leto was for about 30 minutes, HE WAS 5 F#$%ING MINUTES ON SCREEN!!!!!!. Besides, no love triangle between Deadshot, Harley Quinn and The Joker, a huge wasted opportunity. Anyway, other than the villain being boring and bad editing, the movie is actually pretty funny and exiting. Smith and Robbie are really good actors and they really show it here, and Jay f$%&amp;ing Cortney, one of the worst actors ever, was actually a highlight of the movie, plus, Diablo, Croc, Katana and Flag were interesting characters as well. Overall, is not awful, is just disappointing. However, its not the 4/10 of Metacritic or the savior of the DCU, its just a decent action-comedy that commits most of the superhero movies flaws (one liners instead of dialogue, bad villain, worthless flashbacks, etc.).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film, an insane mix of DC's bad guys &amp; gals, throw in a new Joker. What's not to like? Well quite a lot actually, which I will come to, but then I gave it 6 stars. Why would I give a film I was unimpressed with an above average score? In a word Margot Robbie (aka Harley Quinn). Quite simply she makes the film (with a little support from Jared Leto's Joker). She's mad as a box of gun totting frogs and utterly at home with that (aside from one forgivable dream sequence). It is hard not to like her cheery psychotic disposition, which takes a battering but is never broken. In so many films where you have a "strong" female lead they are there to endure great hardship or to out bloke the blokes. And while it is true that Harley Quinn shares a blokey love of violence really she is just out to have (twisted) fun. In this she has a lot more in common with Tank Girl (the comic not the film) than he co-female characters (Amanda Waller, Enchantress, Katana) who are all, well, a bit serious. I could have watched an entire film featuring just Harley Quinn and Joker and given it a resounding 10 but, alas, it was not to be. So what was wrong? Well to be honest although the premise was good(ish) and Cara Delevingne's Enchantress a great tragic villain, and Viola Davis gave a good performance as Amanda Waller, and Jared Leto was fascinating as the Joker?..in the end the whole was just a bit too clichéd. There was nothing at all sympathetic about the "good guys". We had sadistic prison guards (yawn), troubled soldier Rick Flag with a tangled love interest (ho hum) and endless fight scenes against anonymous attackers which were just like any other mass fight scene ever filmed. CGI was OK but nothing special these days. Will Smith's Deadshot was a positively pedestrian "bad-guy-with-heart-of ?gold", single parent assassin with teen daughter whom he adores. Adam Beach's Slipknot might just as well have worn a red star trek jumper. As for the rest they were either one dimensional caricatures or just blended into the back ground. I tell a lie, Jay Hernandez did a good, if clichéd, performance as Diablo. It could have been so much more. I raise a glass to Robbie, she may be slight but she must have damn good muscles 'cause she carried the whole film. And finally who in their right mind would think it a good idea to give unstable psychotics guns and expect them to behave? I mean seriously?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you my opinion about the movie. Suicide Squad was an alright movie to watch. There were ups and downs for it. Let me start with the ups. All the actors were great in the movie, Jared Leto did a great job as the Joker, The Margot Robbie did a good job as Harley Quinn in the Movie, The other actors did a good job with their roles in the movie. My only down is that some scenes were not really that necessary for the movie. It look like some parts of the movie were cut and in my opinion it didn't need to remove certain scenes for the movie. Well this is my opinion of the movie. It's just an alright movie but not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not better than BVS ,Action Looks like really low budget Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its hard to sympathies /care for the bad guys but there are few character which shows their inner innocence more than others .Joker &amp; Harley was the best thing of this movie &amp; i would say they are backbone of the movie kind of like the story of saving Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan . Problem with Suicide squad is there is no Tom Hanks to carry the audience in the journey like saving private Ryan.Will smith was good but his role was more like taking orders ,so kind of take away many characteristics from that character .Action sequence is mostly shooting . there are some fun parts with Harley Quinn .Fight was in the night ,it was road,building with not much special fight scene to actually care about .That is the reason felt like a Battlefield game scene where mission is just to go forward .I would say badly choreographed or no choreographed fight sequence for a big budget Hollywood movie .There are back stories for every character but didn't' felt much even for Will smith's story cz there was not much depth on that story but in the case of Harley &amp; Joker felt that story with heart .There are actually one moment among the group(will smith &amp; harley) where i actually felt the chemistry inside the group other than that even in that drinking scene seen on trailer felt nothing .Now i think the Movie Predator(2010) actually showed more character depth among criminals who were abducted &amp; thrown into the alien planet than suicide squad maybe due to in Predator 2010 industry leading top actor/actresses who showed their own charm in acting which suicide squad lacked in most other characters exception Joker,harley ,(will smith kind of but not much due to lack of back story depth).I think the movie struggle between showing inner struggle of the characters &amp; being cool .Now if criminals act like cool through whole movie then audience might not care much but to be Marvel like (last minute edit) the criminals have to act cool .So whole movie old edit showed one side &amp; new edit showed another side.Also maybe due to things which make a groups of people care about each other lacked in this movie or maybe team work wasn't the main theme of the movie but even when they acted as team their motivation behind that wasn't that clear.Audience might get confused to what to feel but luckily for Harley her story didn't changed much &amp; that story showed a smooth transition from one part to another but that can't be said for other characters .Sometime directors had to make hard decision to make audience feel something or even to bring the characters more closure of each other but which suicide squad lacks mostly or director chose not to go in that directionAfter watching suicide squad i feel if they had added more of the Joker &amp; Harley scene &amp; based the movie around that story line then It could have been another Dark Knight level movie but they have ignored the best part of the movie &amp; went to a direction which most audience can care less.i give it 6.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst "superhero" movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is such a big mess... Don't even know how can I start describing how bad it is... It starts describing the main characters and this part seems OK. Then, after the so said "Suicide Squad" is created, it creates the problem and destruction that the very same squad will have to destroy later... Really bad scrip writing here, seems like the writers were more interested in showing how "cool" and "edgy" the heroes/villains were and didn't even mind in writing a decent plot for the movie, one that actually made sense, ya know. And if you think the plot is bad, wait for the characters to show up... Harley Quinn is hot as fukk, true, but thats the only quality she has, cuz she is annoying and useless as fukk, I mean, shes only in the movie to be a sex object or something, cuz there is no other explanation for her as she has no superpowers whatsoever. And the acting of the actress is really bad and cringe worthy... Gosh. And then there is the Joker, who is portaited basically as a gangsta/rapper/thug/wigger... you got it. Yes, the Joker is a gangsta, let me puke: blergh! Sorry guys, cant write no more, this movie is so bad it gave me cancer, literally: Im getting chemo on tuesday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun film worth seeing, but very forgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy superhero movies and are only looking for light entertainment for a couple of hours, then watch this film. However, if you are expecting a stunning new action masterpiece, don't waste your time.I must admit I knew very little about any of these characters going into the film, so didn't really know what to expect. Overall, I enjoyed the film, but there were near-endless flaws. Firstly, I find it hard to believe this plot was written by someone over the age of 10. The story is almost non-existent, and the little plot that is there makes very little sense and felt incredibly rushed. The entire first 20-30 minutes is spent introducing the characters 1 by 1 and is probably the best part; fast paced and gives those who don't know much about these character's backgrounds (like me) a small amount of insight. From there onwards it goes downhill steeply. For most of the film it felt like the characters were running around not knowing what they were doing. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is by far the best thing about this film. Her acting is far above the others and was the only character that truly felt fleshed out. Will Smith was okay, but the others in the group lost any identity and I often wondered why they were included (looking at you, Killer Croc). The villains made absolutely no sense and I really was not expecting this. It was never clear exactly what they were trying to achieve (other than 'take over the world') or how they were going to do it. It would have been far better if the squad had been tasked to tackle a human threat of some kind, but the writers went for supernatural beings that we do not understand the full power of. This is always a mistake in my opinion. The story moves from semi-realistic to incredibly far fetched and silly very fast as a result. I am baffled as to why the Joker was in this film, and it feels like nothing more than to create a selling point. Not only this, but I think Jared Leto was not the right man to portray the character. The menacing and lunatic nature of the Joker is lost in this film and I began to find myself cringing when he was on screen.The soundtrack is fantastic from start to finish and is one of this film's few redeeming qualities.To summarise, if Harley Quinn and the fantastic soundtrack were not in this film, it would be one of the worst I've ever seen. If you ask me how to make this film good, it needs a complete rewriting of the story that creates a genuine threat, and characters that all play a part, not just the most popular two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All hail Margot Robbie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do recommend watching the movie, because it is entertaining, due to the excellent acting of Will SMith and Margot Robbie. Their characters are amazing and it is so worth it to see both of them interact. Both characters do have some depths and it is hard not to enjoy their jokes or Robbie's eccentric acting. In addition to these two, I really liked two other characters. Enchantress and Rick Flag. Their special relationship was a breath of fresh air. Interesting and definitely not boring, compared to all other characters, besides these 4.I was really excited to see Jared Leto as the Joker. But that was a joke. Seriously. No class. No personality. Simply unnecessary. He had way too less time to develop. I personally think, that they should not have added him to this movie. This ruined his whole appearance.Everything else was dull and felt superficial. It did not even entertain. The other characters could have been gone from minute one and you would not have noticed. El Diablo had his moments. But that's it.The story was absolutely forced and felt unnatural. The explanations were illogical. And I mentioned before, that i really like Enchantress. But what do the DC-Guys do? They transform her into an overpowered, in one place mounted sentry, that is able to destroy locations on the other side of the world, but can be beaten into the ground by a fricking baseball bat.I read online, that they cut an incredible amount of scenes. And I guess, that this is the reason, why this movie feels so unfinished and leaves you unsatisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is DC really trying to do? (A Rant)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many who have also spent their money to see Suicide Squad despite hearing not-so-great reviews, I decided to keep an open mind and stay optimistic. And well... I wanted to leave halfway through the film.SPOILERS.By the end of the character introduction, which I don't think should have been placed at the beginning like that as some expositional ploy to get to the action, I was already disappointed. As a viewer, you could kind of tell that they gave WAY more screen time to Deadshot and Harley Quinn just because they were Will Smith and Margot Robbie, respectively. I wanted to know more about the OTHER characters as well because they had just as much potential in terms of power capabilities and back stories to carry this movie. Don't get me wrong, Smith and Robbie did great at executing their parts. But just as well, I believe that the other actors could have shared the screen time with similarly great executions. I mean, at many times I did not get the sense that Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc were even part of the Suicide Squad. Rather, they just felt like dummies who were added for light-heartedness (Boomerang) and to give the audience an insecure person who 'becomes' confident at the end (Croc) for character development satisfaction. Also, if they had eliminated the military (and probably even Katana, who, let's face it, did not even need to be there), the movie could have focused so much more on the bonding of the team and how they even transcend their wicked ways to do something good then probably go back to being wicked to escape their way out of Amanda Waller's control. Instead, I felt like Rick Flag was the main character! Moreover, the Joker and the Enchantress (with her strange dancing) have bigger identity crises than they let on. Like who was the villain? They obviously had different evil agendas (kind of? Not really I guess because the Joker just spent most of his time being with and then saving Harley). In the trailers, it looked like the Joker was the villain, but I was so shocked to find out that it was the Enchantress!! WHY? WHY? She could have been a great addition to the team. In fact, she could have formed a great bond with El Diablo, who shares the same fate of being 'cursed' with a power and does not wish to harness its evil potential anymore. Maybe they could have even added a plot for them trying to find a way to get out of their powers, and El Diablo, who is accepting of the consequences of his actions helps the Enchantress overcome her fear of hurting others and suppress the evil inside of her. SOMETHING that gives meaning to doing a movie about the BAD guys.Instead, I felt like they used 'bad' characters to 'do something different' so that they could stray from the sometimes righteously good tones of Marvel but they really did not know how to do that and just copied the typical superhero plot of forming a team with characters we all know and love to get rid of the bad guy. And just because the Suicide Squad so happens to be the bad guys, they should just end it by putting them in jail...because they're the bad guys.Despite all my ranting, I did feel something from the movie. Like when the team felt pity for El Diablo at the bar and how Deadshot really misses and loves his daughter but compromises seeing her just to save Harley. THOSE kinds of moments, the ones that show that we, the audience, are maybe like the villains too or that they are worth giving a chance should have been the biggest advantage of whatever this world DC is trying to set up.Instead, I feel like DC is riding this superhero wave and that they are okay with whatever happens just as long as they get to make money. Well, guess what. DC Comics superheroes should be at the HELM of this wave because their characters have been the epitome of superhero images and many of them are the original superheroes. But I think that DC maybe knows that and the fact that they have had flops with the lighter Superman movies and successes with the darker Batman trilogy have led them to believe that it is the darker tone that people want out of their world. It's not. It's great storytelling and really showing people how DC characters are relatable because their heroes are much more powerful than Marvel's superheroes.If you can't tell already, I'm a bit cynical of the recent and future DC films because I feel like there is this overarching need to compensate for their losses made by Marvel, whose direction in movies has built long-term investments by creating a truly immersive world to explore on film. DC films have so much potential, ESPECIALLY by making Suicide Squad, which would have at least related to the success of grim the Batman trilogy. But I think that if DC focuses on itself and what kind of message it needs to leave with the audience, then they will definitely deserve the praise and respect of its super/antiheroes.(Also, I just realized this, but I think that the roots of the comic universes may also be a source of their conflict because the company that distributes DC films is Warner Bros. and the company that mainly distributes Marvel films is Disney. The two men who created Warner Bros. Animation were originally from Disney and left because of some bad blood at the time...so yeah, maybe it carried on?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had great trailers and promotional material, but they were to great for the movie. David Ayer didn't't really do a great job.There were a few characters in this movie that felt wasted to me. Captain Boomerang was just there and didn't't really do much. Katana wasn't in the movie enough and I believe her sword wasn't shown enough. Scott Eastwood's character was barely shown. And Killer Croc was again like the others barely in it. Amanda Waller was a standout for me. I though she was one of the best and well done characters, besides when she shoots all the people in the room when the squad comes to save her, which i thought was a bit random and didn't't belong. El Diablo and Deadshot were also both good, although I don't believe that El Diablo should've met his demise in this movie (if he did). Deadshot did have a nice scene, which was actually one of my favorites which was the one with his daughter, teaching her about angles. I didn't't like Enchantress, she was probably the worst out of all the characters. Harley using the sword on her was terrible writing, and I didn't't really like Cara Delevingne's acting. Her being as powerful as she was, and losing to the 'Suicide Squad' wasn't written to well, and went a bit to fast. I also didn't't like that brother thing but it wasn't to bad The 'Suicide Squad' did feel a bit week and under-powered in this movie.Now to the Joker and Harley, probably what a lot of people were most excited for in the movie. The Joker didn't't feel like he was in it enough, and some of his scenes even felt they went to fast and were just, bad (the scene were he is surrounded by knives). The relationship between them wasn't great. I felt like we just didn't't see them together enough. And i didn't't like the Harleen Quinzel scenes either. We didn't't get to see there relationship grow, it just kind of, happened. And they were in one of my worst favorite scenes, were the Joker shoots that guy after giving him Harley as a gift and it felt so stupid, especially when joker put his hand up to his mouth with the mouth drawn on his hand. They did have some good scenes and some bad, but besides the Joker scenes, Harley did alright otherwise besides her voice being a bit off sometimes. I didn't;t like whenever she said puddin' either, and her Dr. Quinzel lines were spoken too fast.Batman wasn't in it enough, and his scenes weren't great either. His scene with Harley saving her was a bit dumb, and I didn't't like his scene with Deadshot that much either. The Flash had a tiny scene which was alright. There isn't much to say about the scene though.Ultimately this movie was average, and was very disappointing. The cutting from scene to scene was bad, the story was badly told, characters didn't't get what they deserved, some songs shouldn't have been in it as they were distracting and some didn't't even fit the scene. Some scene didn't't even feel connected, some didn't't even feel in the right order, and some went to fast. There was a lot of footage cut, and by the looks of it a lot of Joker footage cut. There were some nice moments though, and there was some good storytelling, but I believe that some of the trailers we got felt like a different movie, a movie i would've preferred to see. This is a good movie if you want to have a bit of fun, it did have a pretty good soundtrack as well, and i feel with a bit of changing around it could've been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can we say about the latest summer blockbuster of 2016 that is Suicide Squad? Alternatively, more to the point, what positive observations can be said of this extremely hyped and over-sold movie? Well, not a lot apparently. This is not a writers' concern here, meaning that what we see here on Screen from this particular genre is to be expected, and it really is not too heavy to digest nor is it surprising and innovative. No, what we have here is a visual bombastic overload; too over-produced and too much going-on to make any smooth and even sensibility. The whole escapade begs too many questions as to point out that the graphics, in part also, the visual narrative and its projection, are simply too messy that, in turn, only deprives the viewer from any pleasure it tries to convey. This then, sadly, turns the final feel and mood of the whole experience into a what-could-have-been to shame-about-that and resets the tone from hyped monster to nothing more than a Dirty Dozen retrospective with migraine inducing illustration. The premise is a simple affair that really does not hold too much weight for character development and only gives us a skimming of background development to just keep the level of interest in motion, typical of this genre. The overuse of Rock and Pop tracks are poorly placed and badly timed to the point of distraction and is extremely irrelevant in areas that really do not hold contention. Where this may have been an interesting guise, at least, and in some part it just pulls it off. Overall there is soundtrack saturation to only bug and bore the viewer insofar that it seems that this tact not only tries to explain the narrative further it seems, at worst, to patronise the viewer as to make them seem incapable as to fully understand the narrative without an extra source. On the positive, there are some moments that are worthy of merit, and this is seeing Mr. Smith enter this genre, and making a good show too boot, there seems to be a close level playing field with egos that does not tarnish this project. With the Poster Girl for this movie is the eye-catching Margot Robbie that add both glamour and humour to set the mood and the spine-chilling Viola Davis that brings a grimly posture to the proceedings which each carries the film onward and upward. It is not a too bad a movie, and it really will be seen once more, but what does let it down is that the graphics', and soundtrack, within certain areas, are trying too hard, too quickly and too vigorously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do I think this saves DCEU after the disaster known as BvS? No. Will I be sad if Warner Bros decides to reboot DCEU due to poor reviews and box office results? Heck no. But I am glad this movie is made, for properly depicting the members of Suicide Squad and being what it is: A comic book movie for people who like and/or are interested in the characters it depicts. This movie is a solid 7/10 for me and I acknowledge that this score will change for someone else with different expectations from movies as a whole.I am in love with this movie. I am in full acknowledgment that this movie was purely made as a knee-jerk reaction and as a shameless rebellious mindset with little base to support itself, and it should be obvious to anyone that this movie has a myriad of flaws. I am not ashamed of excusing these flaws to enjoy a proper depiction of really, REALLY underrated comic book characters like Deadshot, Katana and El Diablo. This movie makes me care about characters I don't think I would ever care about, and that's a definitive plus if you ask me.I don't know what the critics were expecting from this movie but I have somewhat of a theory. I did also like Warcraft: The Beginning (despite me having absolutely no knowledge on Warcraft lore) when it was absolutely destroyed by the critics. Warcraft and Squad both have supernatural elements in their story lines that were not properly explained in their origins and they expect you to believe these elements just happen to exist. I think MCU and The Dark Knight trilogy spoiled everybody in that regard: They try to ground their superheroes in a believable setting that could exist within our own reality. This is a movie where we are expected to believe ancient artifacts can encase supernatural beings, a human being can born with pyrokinesis, and a katana sword can entrap souls of its victims.The story was simplistic alright, but it works on the story's benefit. You don't need to know much about the story other than these are bad people with criminal record and due to their unique specialties they were chosen to assume roles in a governmental response team to possible supernatural attacks. This is a lovely premise and I cannot think of a better team to embody this idea. Sure, half of the team is vastly over-powered compared to the rest like, say, Captain Boomerang, it becomes downright comical: but movie downright acknowledges it and SUBTLY addresses to it when other characters find it socially awkward to point that out.The main squad members were on point. Killer Croc sadly pales in comparison, but efforts were made to involve him in the story. Slipknot does not live for long, but he serves his purpose. Margot Robbie is wonderful and her depiction of Harley Quinn brings more than just a sex toy for the Joker: She shows duality, she shows ingenuity. This Harley is a character worthy of her lore. Characters like Will Smith's Deadshot, El Diablo and Katana, certainly surpass their lores and bring intense amounts of humanity to their characters. The rest aren't as well developed but they share a comic relief spot altogether and it definitely works. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller and Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag also bring more to the table than expected. The villains are okay, the depiction of Enchantress and his brother Incubus was lovely, although the latter was fragged a bit easily IMHO. They were depicted as vastly powerful beings but Incubus was taken out a bit easily comparatively.And to be honest, this leads to another theory of mine: This movie reminds me of a perfectly good session of a game of FRP, like Dungeons and Dragons but ofc in a modern superhero setting. I love when movies do that. We start with established characters telling their backstories, banding together with their own specialties to bear through minion encounters with memorable details, and then they take down the big bad for some loot. Just like that, not always every character's dice rolls like it should, and sometimes a poorly thought move deals devastating blow as if their character rolled a 20.Jared Leto's Joker is completely underwhelming. He is miscast and his method acting is nil. Due to the fact that he's extremely cut from the movie benefits the movie tenfold. He serves some bit of purpose in the story to elevate Harley's character and then he storms off (kinda). I don't think his persisting presence would in any way help the movie from that point onwards. And I don't really care? Despite how this movie's advertised, this is not a Joker movie, this movie has more to do with Harley than him, and Harley was done so well I don't care about Joker. I believe they designed him to be a modernized version of Jack Nicholson's Joker, and I absolutely despise Jack's Joker (and Tim Burton's vision of the Batman lore as a whole) and I believe everyone who show a baseless respect to Jack Nicholson's Joker while simultaneously hating on Jared Leto's Joker to be completely contradictive, if not selective and biased. The only difference between Nicholson and Leto except the gangsta motifs of their characters is that Nicholson is naturally charismatic when Leto is a black hole of charisma. While charisma is a big part of Joker's character, Tim Burton's Batman ruins Joker's character in so many other ways it doesn't matter anyway. Everyone got their best Joker out of The Dark Knight. Move on.I like this movie a lot and I think this was a movie made for people like me and it's a hard thing to find when comic book movies are so marginalized and marketed towards a wide audience. I am glad and will definitely take this movie as a perfectly beautiful standalone movie when DCEU is discontinued.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set after the events of batman vs superman, Amanda waller recruits what she calls the worst of the villains to stop a witch named enchantress. Those team members include deadshot, Harley Quinn, killer croc, boomerang, and el diablo. I would say in terms of performances, margot Robbie is awesome playing Harley as someone who captures the character as someone who is crazy but a sweet innocent deposition. Jared leto is sadly underused as the joker but he does manage to do well with the screen time given. Viola Davis version of Amanda waller is someone who is cold and calculated but not afraid to do what is necessary. Will smith character being a person balancing fatherhood and being an assassin.

		<fullReview>After I saw the 1st trailer for this film, I was very excited for the film. It looked so promising. Now here we are...let down. The film is average, at best. The story just does not add up at all, even when you try to piece it together. The mission that is described to the characters at the beginning of the film has a very confusing result, even when you try to go back and remember everything that happened and who said what.The characters are not bad at all...except The Joker. This is my least favorite interpretation of The Joker. It reminded me of Johnny Depp's 'Capt. Jack Sparrow' at times. The way he talked and laughed just didn't go together. Leto's acting coach should have pulled him to the side and said "You need to work on this more." Anyone involved in this movie should have told Leto "...You really need to work on this more."I enjoyed Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Diablo, Croc, and Boomerang. All solid performances, some tongue-in-cheek lines/moments, but that is the writers, not the actors.If you intend on seeing this film in theaters, brace yourself for a mediocre movie. This could have been so much better. DC Comics really need to sit back and think of their upcoming projects, rethink of their upcoming projects, and then think once more about how they are going to write and direct the upcoming films.

It was excruciating listening to her every time she opened her mouth. I was so happy during the part when she almost died. Ugh, she was horrible. And it's a shame, because her character was the one I was most looking forward to and the one I was most disappointed with. The whole production was just really cheap and cheesy. Also, I offered to buy my friend a drink afterwards because she had sat through the whole shitty thing. I felt bad. I was embarrassed that I had recommended we go see it.

Amanda Waller was more pomp than substance.. Jareds Joker was possibly the worst portrayal in the history of the Joker.. it seems all that "staying in character" was more pretentious publicity and unfortunately for the franchise did nothing to add any depth to his character. The prequel to the actual battle was lengthy with a lot of whining from an emo Diablo.. the plot lacked the depth and was least convincing in its execution. An utter disappointment.. After the tragedy called Superman vs. Batman, DC comics has scored another dud in its comic lineup..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUICIDE SQUAD, conspicuously hits a nadir in its feedback from critics, which officially raise the curtain of the battle-of-wits between DC franchises and carping pundits, perhaps it will be wiser for their next projects to skip the early critics screenings, if their claim of those films are made for die-hard comic books fans is sincere, who cares about critics then? The only problem is, the die-hard fanbase alone cannot cough up enough doughs to cover its hefty production budget, and since it is all about money, one might expect some sea change will soon befall from their grandee decision makers.This time, one must concur with the critics, maybe in light of a seriousness-bucking freshness wrought by Marvel's DEADPOOL (2016) into the ever-blasé superhero glut earlier this year, audience's surged expectancy towards SUICIDE SQUAD has reached a threshold of inevitable ricochet. There is something frustratingly by-the-numbers in this supposedly paradigm-shifting entertaining fare where a ragtag cluster of characteristic antiheroes are reluctantly mustered together - in this case, a bomb is implanted in their neck, which can be detonate by Colonel Red Flag (Kinnaman, looks impeccably high-minded, ) if they rebel or try to escape -, to work for the US government and save the world from an impending doom from a sorceress-deity Enchantress (Delevingne).Top hit-man Deadshot (Smith) and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Robbie) are among the expendables who predictably get the star treatment with a more generous story arc and screen- time, but Smith doesn't comes off so much a merciless mercenary than a traditionally valued family man who solely happens to be a marksman. As for Robbie, the current "it" girl in Hollywood, her over-merchandised impersonation of Quinn's bi-polar bearings patently stands out among the assembly, not because she is phenomenal, only the competition isn't challenging enough. Yet, the biggest disappointment is Jared Leto's Joker, short-changed in screen-time notwithstanding, his pompous performance is hammy to high heaven, menace and romantic vibes between Joker and Harley Quinn are both in dire dearth. Courtney's Captain Boomerang is the only member who betrays a whiff of unpredictability in his veins, whereas a penitent Diablo (Hernandez), being the only one who actually is bestowed with super power amongst the squad, follows a stock plot device, awakes from his shell of self-punishment (for his own sins) to embrace his power to battle the evil.A stony-faced Viola Davis plays Amanda Walker, a government agent abides by her own gray-area philosophy and wantonly overstays her welcome, and a long-standing villain problem in the superhero assembly-line doesn't ameliorate at all, numberless and faceless minions are basically weapon-less moving targets to boost the gang's close-combat dexterity, and motivation-aside, is Enchantress's swaggering portal-opening parade a blatant homage to the original GHOSTBUSTERS (1984)? Also the inundating score from Steven Price during the heightened battle is insufferable. Concisely, SUICIDE SQUAD is unintelligently oscillating between a costly cult caterer and a pulpy mainstream appeaser, and as it often turns out, it fial to reach both sides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>over-promoted but better than BvS, proving Ayer a better director than a writer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this unique conceptual but over-promoted film, we get to see the very first theatrical live-action portrayal of Harley Quinn done by talented Margot Robbie, it really a is nightmare to do a character which is entirely a crack-brain and psychotically sally, despite of Harley being one of the famous character in the comic world and the whole world expecting a metaphoric Life &amp; Death situation kind of a performance for a character with a scarce back-story, Robbie has done justice to the character, her performance is the only half which makes this movie vigorously enjoyable to watch, her performance makes Harley the female version of Joker with an additional touch of softness for the distressed ones, which reminds me of how fondly the character fell in love with psychotic Joker in the 1997 animated Series named 'The New Batman Adventures'(SPOILER ALERT) The most disheartening element of this execution for me was, the over-hyped, but less exhibited Joker, the character felt like shoehorned into the film, now imagine yourself wearing shoes smaller than your feet and running around feeling the pain, that might be the exact pain Jared Leto must have felt after watching the final piece, you just don't get to play with a character this big like an unprofessional, this is disappointingly deceptive to a man who is extremely talented and dedicated, Jared Leto as Joker has done a stunning job, creating a different torpid yet energetic ruthless vibe to the character, with a parlous yet grasping laugh, despite of the less screen time Leto succeeds in for you to have high hopes for the character in future productions.

		<fullReview>With all the hype over the net about this movie, 10 mins in and I was disappointed. Hoping it would improve but the story line is predictable and acting is pretty lame (even by Will Smith). Crocodile-man could've been a bit more witty and had more dialogue. Joker gets about 15 mins screen time, seriously WTF is with that? Harley is the most entertaining, albeit is crazy, bad role-model-type. Its too much poltergeist, alien, paranormal crap! If I were one of the star actors, I'd delete bit from my portfolio! Its a pity Batman couldn't be more part of the movie, might be its saving grace.

		<shortDescription>Caught in a landslide; no escape from banality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First: 2015's abominable Fantastic Four. Then, 2016's laughable Batman v. Superman. Now, we have Suicide Squad: the latest in a slew of big-budget train wrecks, resulting in an acrid cocktail of the wrong directors being given too much agency coupled with boneheaded, contradictory studio hand-holding. Still, it's hard to strictly call studio interference party foul here, as the film is so inherently muddy it's hard to imagine any iteration successfully coughing itself to life. It's hard to resist a spectral Queen chorus of "Is this the real life?" running through your head watching the shambolic mess unspool ? Suicide Squad wants desperately to strut, but stumbles on every step, before toppling into the void of being utter forgettable.We can excuse the embarrassingly gratuitous Justice League tie-ins (hey ? at least Ben Affleck's Batman acts somewhat more like Batman, saving villains from certain death rather than branding them in the face). We can **sort of** excuse the flagrant piggybacking plagiarism of Guardians of the Galaxy, from the hyperactive prison montage antihero character bios to the soundtrack, nonsensically cobbled together like a caffeine-high teen let loose with their dad's credit card in the iTunes store (and no, you're not mistaken - that Norman Greenbaum song is yanked straight out of the Guardians trailer. The theft is that blatant). We can even try to excuse director David Ayer's uncomfortable balance between dopey, wannabe slick humour and self-important wannabe 'darkness', even if it mostly manifests in the film's sickeningly, indiscernibly murky lighting. A film full of villains-turned- antiheroes must bring something original to the table. Right??And this is what we can't excuse: Suicide Squad is not only a bird's nest of content and tone, but also a fundamentally trashy, soulless, redundantly small-minded film. It loudly parades some of the worst nonlinear editing and pacing seen in a recent Hollywood film, to the point where its gossamer-thin plot (literally a lazy, boiled down version of The Raid - the entire conflict can be reduced to 'climb the building') becomes almost incomprehensible at times when really nothing is happening. There's so much daft flashiness (yes, including Ezra Miller), sense is thrown to the wind. But, lest we get confused, Ayer is sure to slop in massive exposition dumps every 10-15 minutes, which rudely bring the film to a screeching halt every time it starts to pick up steam. The tiny blips of action are so bland, they fade from consciousness and memory before they've even finished feebly sputtering on. Finally, the glut of action figures-sorry-characters is so unreasonably vast, several Squad members are given no introduction, and literally dispatched within minutes with no send-off. Several are so extraneous they could be trimmed without anyone even noticing (Katana, anyone?). Initially, there's hope for the effectively creepy uber-villains, but, after memorable introductions, they spend the majority of the film sulking in puffs of CGI, waiting for Ayer to remember they exist. Even worse: even some of the most iconic secondary players - Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's iconic Killer Croc, for one - are so underused, they're effectively there to snarl on command, and burp out unfunny "B.E.T." punchlines. Ouch. It's even more of a shame, as Ayer does scatter nuggets of genuinely compelling material to grapple with. Peel aware its slathering of smarm and gloom, and Suicide Squad is a film about characters struggling with bad relationships. Smith's Deadshot regrets his daughter being overly permissive of his career as an assassin. Jay Hernandez's Diablo spends the rest of his life owning up to his superpowered tantrum gruesomely murdering his girlfriend and children (the sole flashback which actually works, infusing the film with tragedy, scope, and as sombre a cinematic allegory for domestic abuse as we've seen lately, and Hernandez is unexpectedly moving). And let's not even start on whatever warped, emotionally abusive relationship the Joker and Harley Quinn share. These interludes may not propel the story, but when Ayer allows himself to linger in the darkness, he digs up the film's only real illumination. The film may have been transparently retrofitted to accommodate Will Smith, but he's worth it. Arguably the film's greatest asset, Smith warps his boundless, sassy charisma and badassery into the film's uneasy moral compass, supplying (the film's only) surprisingly compelling emotional arc. Margot Robbie, conversely, hits her marks, and is admittably hampered by an infuriatingly antifeminist subplot, but there's still an unshakeable sense of her performing Harley Quinn rather than getting under her skin. She's oodles of fun, but her crazy is as wobbly and vaguely forced as her accent. Thankfully, Viola Davis is steely perfection as the Machiavellian Amanda Waller, and Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang is funnier and more unpredictable than he has any right to be as such a boorish bogan stereotype. Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flagg is one of the most infuriating military grunts in recent cinematic memory (and this is a generation that survived Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Godzilla?). And then there's Jared Leto. Hoo boy. If 'forced' was already a shroud ensconcing the film, his blingy Joker is its bleating fog machine of artifice. He's loud and irritating, but embarrassingly far-removed from appropriate levels of sinister or unhinged, no matter how many rings of knives he lies in or pools of toxic waste he dives into. There's a bit near the end of Suicide Squad where Kinnaman's Flagg, suffering a change of heart, offers the Squad the chance to escape, and live their lives. Cliché dictates they will instead seek redemption, and stay to fight (yawn). Instead, Courtney's Boomerang prances up, and, without a word, jackrabbits out of the room. It's the film's biggest laugh, partially for its unexpectedness, but partially for being the single most sensible move in the entire production. Suicide Squad is a sinking ship, and the fact that all involved didn't follow Boomerang's example (and even he idiotically crawls back ? boo), makes the title exquisitely apt. -4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So whilst being more of a Marvel fan I in no way hate DC and, despite not really enjoying the past 2 DC films I still wanted to see this one, especially given the polar opposite reviews that it had been getting. And my feeling by the credits was "Meh, it was alright"..Whilst the film wasn't the worst one I've seen, there was nothing in it to amaze me. It is clear that the film has had a lot of re-shoots and the editing of the film is pretty poor, with scenes jumping from one to another without any thought to the flow of the story - half of scenes from the trailers aren't even in the film either?!The film seems to suffer in it's failure to deal with a big group of main characters, where the Avengers gave everyone similar screen time, only Harley and Deadshot get a lot, (And for some reason also have 2 intro's?) Will Smith is basically Mike Lowry as Deadshot and takes a lot of the screen time, but I guess he is the big name so you would expect so, whilst Margot Robbie also takes a lot of time, but is probably the most well known character so again you'd expect her to be in the foreground, and I enjoyed the flashbacks between her and the joker. But I did keep noticing that her voice/accent kept changing throughout the film though from the normal tone, to a randomly serious voice, to a "bubblegum" accent - but this might be down to her being crazy, which I thought was potryed well on screen. But aside from these two other team members just appear, Katana randomly gets on the helicopter before they leave and her back story is literally explained in 1 or 2 sentences by Rick Flag, whilst the other main culprit is Slipknot, who gets out of a van, punches a woman, then is tricked in to trying to escape and gets his head blown off?? What was the point in even putting him in the film? You just don't ever get to a point where you really care about any of the team. I would've like to have seen more of the other characters developed, Captain Boomerang is actually quite funny but isn't on a great deal, and you'd easily forget that Killer croc is in the film. El Diablo was an intriguing character who'd I'd have liked to have seen more of but they decide to kill him off no sooner than he starts fighting.The Joker doesn't really have a place in the film, he adds nothing to the plot really and is almost just an extended cameo to pay fan service - though again I guess you can't have Harley without him?? Interesting take on the character though, but just really appears to be a bog standard mob boss with green hair, nothing against Leto but I don't think the character is a patch on any of the previous incarnations.The Enchantress is a strange character, and by strange I mean rubbish. Amanda Waller makes a big deal about how she can control her as she has her heart but she basically turns as soon as the film starts and after resurrecting her brother he saves her from getting killed straight after when her heart is stabbed?! Then after complaining to her brother that they humans now worship machines, not magic she decides to kill them all...by building a machine?! But this is also never explained any further as to what this machine actually is or will do to the world?! Really poor bad guy, her brother is pretty awful too, in both substance and visually, with the special effects looking awful especially in this day and age - it reminded me of a cross between Tron Legacy and Lawnmower man?! (And I don't even know how that's possible?!). Amanda Waller is a much more fearsome villain in the movie and is played very well.Couple of other little annoyances/questions that I won't delve in to but which aren't explained.-Who shoots down the helicopters (every single one of them..!) and keeps shooting at the soldiers? They explain that the Enchantress is turning men, women &amp; children into mindless zombie kind of creatures so where are the guns?-After spending the entire film avoiding fighting, why when Diablo decides to fight does he have to ask permission from Deadshot?-How does Harley manage to cut out Enchantress's heart by just slashing her across the chest with a sword? Wouldn't she need to actually stab her and cut that out?-Why does Harley Quinn go back to prison afterwards despite having her nanobomb disabled by the Joker?All in all though not the worst film you'll see, but it's certainly not one of the best and don't expect it to make you any more excited about the Justice league films - DC has got a LOT of work to do to save the DCEU. Good luck Wonder woman!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie, Wasted opportunity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is not totally bad, and contained lots of nice scenes and characters in it. But, there was a very weak plot. Too many characters to be presented, some could have been left out of this movie (like Boomerang and Katana)...not because they're bad characters, but because they played such small parts that we cannot even begin to relate to them.I'm not going to extend my review, but what I really wanted to say is that this movie was a wasted opportunity. Photography was pretty good, some characters were very interesting, and the "dark" atmosphere of the movie were really good. I just hope they make a sequel to it, and do it right the next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a suicide concerning creativity? Or a squad beneath acting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Inflation. Inflation. Heard of it? That's when something is losing it's value and there is something too much out there to be appreciated. The first word comes to my mind in here... inflation. Building the story up, starting it out just laying it out there... trying to be "just so cool and, man, so awesome" with something serious over the top happening (with authorities, police officers, the government and something like that) and delivering it with some 70-80's music in the background and just so "cool" and smart dialogue (...hear it, man? Yo!), to give it the weird and twisted touch. Grasping to be "awesome in the cool-ness". Just watch the opening scenes. Well... inflation.Just seen "Stranger Things" and...wow, here he is again; David Harbour! Let's see if he delivers in the same way as in the stranger areas (pun? No...really?!)The Joker must have listened too much to Marilyn Manson. Sweet dreams are made of...? Well. Insanity, making the Joker looking like the rock star. And how...by the love of...by the love of...by the love of Robocop, how can Joel Kinnaman get these super roles in movies? Yes, he is a Swede, so am I. We are country men. Even so, I would strongly advice him to read the book by such of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for better knowledge about acting. I will go that far to even recommend the book of Sylvester Stallone (he got the nomination long time ago) and Arnold Schwarzenegger; they are way better actors than Mr. Kinnaman. He is often so bad that I can feel the directing through the screen. Where is the heart and soul of the characters? Gone. Joel Kinnaman made this production cave in. Just when the other actors have made it almost great a couple of minutes, in comes Mr. Kinnaman and... the house of cards is left in ruins.Inflation nr. 2: explosions, devastation, guns, bombs, ancient forces, "alien-like- enemies"... is it really that hard to write something more subtle and innovative? Or is the money right now in these kind of movies?Do you like super hero movies and all the new X-Men? Then I can almost recommend "Suicide Squad" as entertainment.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Kind of a modern film noir here and there. Twisted, crazy, weird and solid. - The actors : Did I mention Joel Kinnaman? (Otherwise, I have to say that Jared Leto created his own version of a modern new age Joker, and delivered... yeah, he actually delivered.) - Entertainment : Worth the watch. David Ayer got little water over his head here, both writing and directing. Too bad. - Age : 154,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst DCU Film So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So to start let me say that I kind of enjoyed Man of Steel and I REALLY enjoyed The Ultimate Edition of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The DCEU has had its ups and downs, but this is the worst in my opinion. On with the review! For one I'm going to talk about the technical aspect, what happened behind the camera. I absolutely adore David Ayer and his work. He is a very talented director and writer. I find him incredibly underrated and I love most of his films (Training Day, End of Watch, Fury, etc.). It's extremely apparent to me that there are multiple cuts of this film. Batman v Superman's Theatrical Cut had a very similar feel. This film is much worse in that category though. It has very conflicting tones with some scenes that are made to be extremely dark and others that are just there to be very light and funny. The soundtrack is another thing that I take issue with. I like the songs, but they conflict with the scenes playing over them so often that it just takes you out of the film. Eminem and The White Stripes are the two standouts in that area. It was by my interpretation just another attempt to make the film lighter after the freak reaction to BVS saying it was too dark. With a film like this you need to either embrace the darkness or embrace the light side of it, like Deadpool did brilliantly earlier this year. Also scenes are just cut together and obviously cut short in a very strange way. In my opinion much worse than BVS. The lesson Warner Bros. needs to learn is that just because a reaction to certain film was to make it lighter doesn't mean you need to take another film and just insert light things in there to satisfy the fans. They put these things in there and forget to step back and say is this a good and cohesive film? I hope that when Wonder Woman comes out it shows they are more concentrated on the quality of the film rather than editing it because of fan and critical reaction.To the actors! There is very little to talk about so I'll make it brief. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn gives a great performance and now every time I think of the character I picture Margot Robbie. I consider that a job well done. Will Smith actually did a MUCH better performance than I expected him to. He plays Deadshot with a great energy and flare that makes him so entertaining to watch. Cara Delevingne as the Enchantress I thought was laughable. She was so hip-wavy and cheesy. I couldn't take her performance seriously. There was no chemistry and it's not entirely her fault, but she definitely didn't make anything better. Finally Jared Leto as The Joker. I am a big fan of Jared Leto AND his interpretation of The Joker. He brought a serious brash and violent sexuality to him. I thought it was interesting and unique and I can't wait to see him again in something else.Finally, the plot. The plot is very, very, very, VERY bad. It's the same as the technical things I mentioned in my first major paragraph. It's obvious the studio went over it a million times to take out the dark parts and insert some light parts. There were so many flashbacks that it distracted me from the movie itself. They were mainly useless and they took up way too much time. Much time they could have used for developing all of the characters they barely used throughout the film. So many characters like Kitana, Killer Croc, Slipknot, and countless others are just blank slates to fill up the space. Countless films in the past have proved you can make characters interesting without introducing them from previous films. Guardians of the Galaxy and X-Men are clear examples of this. There was only partial character development for them and it was literally just told to the audience in a lazy and extremely conventional form of storytelling that required no creativity or effort to employ. After that they were just thrown into a throwaway city to destroy a faceless army. Nothing made me want them to accomplish their goals. I was just watching them fight in some really forgettable action scenes, and nothing was memorable at all. The villain was also every villain that we've seen in every comic book film for the past few years. Complete package with a bonus of convoluted evil plan that makes no logical sense and laser that blasts in the sky to make a big blue ring.So obviously I can't really recommend this. If you enjoy this I'm very happy for you and please don't let me change your opinion, but I just can't help but see these things while I'm watching. I hope the DCEU only gets better from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad far from painless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally walk out of movies but I did walk out of Suicide Squad. It was when I realized that I had missed a plot point and that instead of being enlisted to fight the supernatural villains of this movie, The Suicide Squad were actually rescuing a VIP. The prospect of another 40 minutes watching the Squad go through more fighting of blobby head transformed human soldiers was more than I was prepared to tolerate.This really is a mess of a movie. True, it begins with the formula proscribed by William Goldman - use the opening twenty minutes to introduce your characters back story because no one will care when you are rushing to your stories conclusion - although this doesn't stop Suicide Squad continuously flashing back to intimate moments of love and death between the Joker and Harley Quinn. The trouble is, the Squad are filled with characters that are unlikable, and unlikable in pretty much identical ways.The film has polarized audiences. Even fan critics hated it yet it has proved a box office hit. I think part of this is related to what kind of storytelling gives people pleasure. Conventions of storytelling in cinema change over time. As I have noted elsewhere, some Seventies mainstream movies are almost incomprehensible today. Television drama has changed even more dramatically. The careful spelling out of action, plot and motivation is becoming passe. For me Suicide Squad has the feel of Mad Max IV Fury Road in its breakneck story telling on the move. The two films are also market by a bleak emotional tone that I find hard to sit with in the cinema theater. There's an anger in Suicide Squad that says more about a section of America than the film's fictional world. The film has been praised for its ethnically diverse cast but I felt most of the characters aspired to be gangstas. I longed for Caesar Romero's Joker because Jared Leto's take (a soulless meth head gang boss) seemed to create a vacuum on screen where a character should be.The music score follows in the wake of Guardian's of the Galaxy. Like the latter, Suicide Squad relies heavily on rock music. At times I though that I was watching a 'best of' album in search of a plot. And the choppy editing gives the film an MTV feel. there's a loving recreation of the 'Mad Love' comic book cover by Alex Ross featuring Harley Quinn and the Joker dancing. It is just a throw away scene for those in the know but scenes like this, and the repetition of Diablo flaming down his enemies don't cohere in any conventional way. Montage is reborn as life style.I like the music, I like comics, i like cinema but this wasn't the combination for me. And perhaps that's for the best. I am in my fifties after all. Youth deserve their youth. I'm just not sure they deserve Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad. Probably one of the most anticipated blockbuster movies this summer.Due to mostly the great advertising, and that second trailer which was what dc fans wanted out of this movie.I am writing this review from the perspective of a big dc fan, comics, games, movies... EVERYTHING!!! So going in I saw more or less what I expected. A movie about a bunch of criminals forcibly brought together to carry out a mission that will most likely get them killed. Plus a villain who was basically Gozer from Ghostbusters. What I love about this movie are the characters (especially Deadshot and Harley) everyone is unique in their own way, I mean we have a guy on the team who uses boomerangs as a weapon!! So seeing the interactions between them creates a lot of interesting and funny dialogue. But it was disappointing seeing characters such as killer Croc only having about 3 lines. Along with that there wasn't much development for characters apart from Harley, Deadshot and El Diablo, sure we get brief exposition of the other squad members but it was very brief. OH, and lets not forget about the joker. He wasn't in it long but I liked him from what was shown. Sense of style; questionable. But he did have a very good joker voice and personality down.The overall quality of the film did lack some, there were cuts that didn't make that much sense. The action was overall good but at least we there wasn't much or any in fact shaky cam. Which I wouldn't really expect much of from David Ayer in the first place. However from the guy that made Fury I was expecting better film making than this, but I expect a lot of it was due to WB taking stuff out from the movie.Nonetheless it was very entertaining (to me at least) and was paired with an amazing soundtrack, tons of Easter eggs and great characters. So for me it was worth the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For starters I was super hyped about this movie coming out. I have been waiting the past year to see it. Pretty much every one is disappointed in some way, but I'd say it is one of the better. If you compare it to Jason Bourne, which shows everything exciting happening in the trailer, Suicide Squad were better. I did totally not see the witch trying to take over the world coming. In the trailer it was more like "The bad guys, trying to save the world for whatever is threatening them" However, all in all a good movie for those who aren't the most critic people in the world. The reviews haven't been all good, there is off course some things you are left to wonder about, but a good movie despite its flaws. The movie is not all serious, there are some great humor in it, and some great laughs. I even ended up feeling a little sorry for Harley. Cara Delevingne, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Will Smith and all the other actors/actresses did a great job, I was surprised by how good Cara could play the evil witch, I did not see that coming, as the trailer didn't reveal much of the content of the movie. It is definitely worth a watch, it is great and entertaining. If you like things blowing up, and great humor, here is a movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is between brilliance and a giant disaster. Before you go to watch it, really think about whether you want to watch it.First of all: The Enjoyment. The first 30-40 minute is pure sleep. The character introductions are good, but the plot and explaining is BORING and horrible. A lot just gone out to get some snacks. The middle part is well-done, it pulls your tension and things go more serious, interesting. Characters really show off, the trailer Joker+Harley is here. The end is very good. I really enjoyed as things clipped together, BECAUSE of the characters. Not plot or anything else. The actors really carried this movie.The plot. The plot is non-existent, gibberish. You can see it in the first part that it barely makes sense and nothing gets together. At all. It's pure mistake. The middle part proves this a 100%. It's not going to make sense, it's stupid and the writer or producer really - really - wronged this.The characters. Awesome. Loved them all. They all performed a 120%. The main act is carried by Will Smith(dead shot) and Jay Hernandez(The Satan - IMDb text filter) whom out-performed themselves. They were really good. The sideline is strongly carried by Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Jared Leto (Joker). The rest of the characters are without purpose. Their whole existence is a mistake in adaptation for either the animation or the comics. As such I can't say anything of whether are good or not, because they are just there. In comparison for the above, they don't have anything to do. Amanda Waller character (played by Viola Davis) was also really good.The cinematic. Awesome. The way the guys made this ~~ were really awesome. The scenes felt good, the slow-motion and lights brilliant. The cutting however was bad. The lightning also bad from time to time.I think as an adaptation.. this movie fails. As a standalone movie ~ okay.I would love it if they were to remake it with the SAME characters, so all the bad things would be worked out right away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the last two yet it lacks sometimes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concept:So the concept of assembling an all villain team of the worst criminals in the world to take on bigger threats is quite good and it was taken out of the comics and pretty well delivered.Plot:I always felt that Enchantress would turn bad at some point throughout the movie but never thought it would be the main villain do to Joker being heavily promoted.The plot was bland,a team of super-villains goes to stop the biggest threat,the witch, and her brother who now want to exterminate humanity because their kind is gone.The bait she used,their dreams becoming a reality was cliché.And I also did not understand why an all-powerful being needed to fight people who she could throw around using chants like a ninja.Characters(In the order the left an impact on me and had a good performance): 1)Amanda Waller:Viola Davis nailed the part and she represented an Amanda Waller that is intelligent,fierce and overall such a bitch to the extent that after you save her life she would blow you off.She was a strategist and paid no mind about who will die if the job gets done.2)Joker:Jared Leto did very well for the part he was given and while I feel sorry for him because his scenes were heavily cut off I need to point out what I liked and did not about him.His Joker was violent,obsessed with Harley,given the fact it was so early in their history and he was mad,he enjoyed a lot his lifestyle and he was a strategist,always knowing where to go and how to proceed in different situations.I did not like his laugh though and he lacked his jokes,he did not strike me as a particular funny Joker but I hope this will be addressed in the future.His look is modern and was inspired from various comics and from David Bowie and I must say he looked alright in my eyes.3)Dr. Harleen Quinzel/Harley Queen:Margot Robbie also nailed her part and she was given material to work with.She was crazy,a good fighter,unpredictable but with an anchor in the sane part.I did not agree with her being called crazier than the Joker because as we see later in her vision:She saw the Joker as a sane,cured man,deep down despite her love for her Puddin' she wanted a boring,fulfilled life.As for her doctor portrayal,she was pretty sexy that part,of course, we could say we found her like this because she was found of Mr. J and wanted to impress him.4)El Diablo:he was bland and boring to me until the third act where he really shined.His backstory in the bar scene really made me feel for him and I hope he will be back,he was one of the anchors of magic in the DCEU.His guilt is what saved the team, in the end,he accepted his fate and agreed to suffer the consequences.5)Katana:While a minor character,she was great.Her fighting style was on point and she displayed it well.I wanted to see her use the soul taker more and I felt bad when Warner Brothers decided to cut her two major supernatural based scenes:the soul taker display of power and her eyes turning pitch black.She had an emotional scene with Maseo though I would have wanted to hear him talk back.Karen's first role had a great impact for me and I want to see more of her in the future.6)Professor June Moon/The Enchantress:I must say they really went far to establish her as a dark,vicious witch from the ancient time.I liked Cara's portrayal,but I felt they should have gone with her third act look for the entire movie,the Mayan,Aztec goddess of magic.Her brother was added to the plot only to be her servant and save her from Amanda's threat because she almost killed her stabbing her heart.I wish we will see more of her and maybe next time they will let her unleash more spells.7)Deadshot:This was Will Smith as himself with a little twist in some scenes but this time he was enjoyable,he brought some of his fun and personality to the character and this made me like him more.His deep care for his daughter was kind of overused, though.Honorable Mentions:1)Captain Boomerang:He had a lot of potential but in the end felt as an untouched character,we could not feel for him,we could not see what made him come back,the only thing to be remembered by is his Pony.2)Killer Croc:While being King Shark's replacement he got the same treatment as Boomerang,his joke and overconfidence felt cringe and I hope he will be evolved into a more monstrous state in the future.3)Rick Flag:while a master strategist and an army pro his only purpose was to be a damsel in distress for the squad to save every time and his only connection was with June Moon.He felt really possessive to the extent where he would let the world end to save June.4)Slipknot:WAISTED CHARACTER.They should not introduce him just to use him as an example.Cameos: 1)Batman:It is always a delight to see Affleck's Batman in action and mostly to see him interact with more of his rogue gallery,not just the joker.My favorite cameo was nonetheless his chase after Joker and Harley.2)The Flash:I love the costume and he seems to start to embody Barry well,he can crack one or two jokes sometimes but he is serious and considered mostly. The editing:Warner Brothers seem to lack in confidence in their directors each time.Only because a select number of people did not like the darkness in the movie it doesn't mean it should have been funnier.As a side note, I must point out that to me it was not really funny.The third act was miserably edited and,to me it seemed it was re-shot completely and the cast looked tired and bored,just standing there,doing the stunts and delivering the lines,but some of the passion was gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to write this review, because I'm one of those people who actually read the reviews before deciding to watch the movie. Fortunately, based on one favorable review from a respected Croatian critic (who simply and correctly called the movie "fun") I decided to see it and was pleasantly surprised. Frankly, I'm baffled by the scathing reviews this movie got. Suicide Squad is definitely NOT, as Christopher Orr from the Atlantic (one of my favorite critics) called it, "the worst of the worst". It's actually pretty good and I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 in comparison to other superhero movies. In my opinion, Deadpool, the last Captain America and Ant-Man are better movies. Iron Man (especially the awful third part), Thor and The Avengers are not. I should probably mention that I'm not a fan of superhero movies, I watch them because I watch all movies regardless of the genre. Also, I couldn't care less about the whole Marvel vs DC Comics issue. A superhero movie should be entertaining and this movie definitely delivers on entertainment. Moreover, it has the best and the most original female character I've ever seen in a superhero movie: Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie is simply spectacular, her cute voice combined with psychotic stare and obvious deadliness are a must see. If there was nothing else good about this movie, her performance alone would be reason enough to see it. The rest of the cast were also great, especially Will Smith who was very convincing in his role of Deadshot (morally ambiguous, but still relatable). Most critics called the plot "a mess". I disagree yet again. The plot is solid and easy to follow. There are a lot of characters introduced, but you never lose track of them. One of the weak points of the movie is definitely Joker, who remained somewhat sketchy and most likely fell victim to vigorous editing. The main weakness, however, is probably the character of Enchantress who is neither formidable nor especially convincing. Having said that, I should probably add that a scary villain was not what the movie was focused on, because the heroes are the true villains. The classic villain is almost irrelevant in a movie whose whole premise is the question of bad guys doing good under the right circumstances. To sum up, if you're looking for a fun summer movie, go and see Suicide Squad, you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is quite cool. The crazy role of Harley Quinn keeps you till the end. Too much of co-incidence in the movie and too much of characters with very short roles is really disappointing. Graphics are good but not the best. Below Expectations. Also, they have missed many crucial things in the movie and left it unexplained. Joker's comeback in the film after being crashed and survival of June after destruction of Enchantress is still a suspense. This time DC has included post- credits in its movie for Justice League. That was a good one as it showed Aqua-Man and Flash. The overall movie was fun but could have been better. If you are a DC Comics fan, a must watch for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The draw for me to see this movie was Margot Robbie. I really enjoyed her performance in "The Wolf of Wall Street." In addition to her obvious physical attributes, she was funny, smart and engaging in that film. In "Suicide Squad," her posterior gets about the same amount of screen time as her face. Not that this is a bad thing from an aesthetic point of view, but her Harley Quinn was not nearly as dominant a presence as I was led to believe from the trailer and the press coverage. So I felt shortchanged. Other than that, Will Smith and Jay Hernandez really made the film for me. They overcame their typecasting to bring depth and humanity to their characters. I liked the film's take on trying to make "bad" people sympathetic by showing how they got that way. Otherwise, this movie was just plain weird. Its gritty realism was totally at odds with the more fantastical elements; it seemed to have a split personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five-Word Review: Often Enjoyable, Largely Disappointing &amp; Bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you're David Ayer and you wrote Training Day and directed Fury, bringing together a bunch of comic-book Batman villains that have never been in a live-action film along with a new iteration of The Joker was always going to be hard, and messy. With acclaimed actors like Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto, though, it should also be hard to mess up. I was really looking forward to Suicide Squad. Batman vs Superman: DoJ kick-started DC's cinematic universe in divisive fashion, with too many subplots and rocky direction that felt like it was too influenced by the studio. Suicide Squad, after some fantastic trailers, looked set to successfully navigate these problems. However. Its main problem, unfortunately, is feeling too much like a generic comic-book film, especially in the second half (the first half, however, is great - see below). Instead of going a unique route of having a team of morally ambiguous, blackly comic villains fight and work amongst themselves, perhaps uniting against a wild card like The Joker, we get a ham- fisted team up against some otherworldly entity (BvS anyone?) aided by faceless minions (Avengers anyone?). Comic book fatigue indeed. Another problem is the widely-advertised re-shoots that were ordered of Ayer after critical backlash in the spring targeted BvS's dull, mirthless mindlessness. Too often, the film feels choppily edited, with several portions of the film feeling like they were directed by different directors before all these sections were Frankensteined together. This seems a clear indication that there is too much 'higher up' involvement in the making of these cinematic universe films. Ayer's vision can be glimpsed through the mess, especially in the first half. His vision of The Joker as a tattooed, pimp-like, mob-boss gangster is commendable, but falls prey to reshuffling and the apparent removal of several of his scenes. Flashes of brilliance, such as viewing Batman through the eyes of Deadshot and Harley Quinn, are brilliant: the vigilante is seen as a terrifying, meddling threat who splits families apart and keeps true loves from each other. A lot, however, is lost as the film suffers from the curse of post-production reshuffles.But I digress, as Suicide Squad really isn't THAT bad. The first half especially is a joyful romp which unfortunately does not indicate the tone of the film overall. The character introductions could not have been done better, with tongue-in-cheek visual effects and on-screen writing giving a sens of the characters, and a great mix of flashback and scenes of the characters in prison providing excellent contrast. Most of the gags and humour hits (most, but definitely not all), though it would have been nice if the creators had more independence to target an older audience, perhaps focusing on why these guys are so bad. In a film that is a very, very soft 15 certificate, it is hard to display the remorseless murders and horrific crimes that they have done, and the film could have benefited from some good black comedy. The acting is a mixed bag - Robbie is simply superb, the stand-out with what is one of the only complicated roles in the film, whilst Viola Davis excels and Smith is a solid lead. Leto is alright, though nowhere near the heights reached by the likes of Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill. It often feels like he is trying too hard to be edgy and crazy, coming across as almost Jim Carrey-like at times. His screen-time is relegated to mostly token appearances, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it means more time devoted to the bland Joel Kinnaman and the eye-rollingly boring villain Enchantress, played by an over-the-top and possibly miscast Cara Delevingne (though who could sell this properly: http://tinyurl.com/zh4w52t). Basically, though, none of the characters are given enough time to bond like they say they are. Jai Courtney, doing his best Tom Hardy impression, is a promising side-character but is very underused, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc is basically useless. There are significant swathes of the film which are really enjoyable and fun, with the soundtrack simply wonderful, but there are just too many inherent problems. Uneven direction, often laughable dialogue, choppy last-minute editing, and a plot which just went in the wrong direction. It simply can't cut it at the top of the blockbuster world, and is unfortunately for me a large disappointment, especially due to all the promising signs I saw in the film.Maybe this is the comic-book film fatigue building up steam, but studios really need to change something in order to keep their cinematic universes being such reliable cash cows. Marvel's Doctor Strange looks intriguing - though if Suicide Squad proved anything, it was that trailers, however incredible they are, do not provide an indication of the film - and their Civil War was often refreshing, but there needs to be consistent adaptation. To quote Frank Underwood (fine, Winston Churchill), to improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often. If the Affleck- directed Batman film, the hopefully different Aquaman, and Justice League can learn from the mistakes of BvS and Suicide Squad, then DC will prosper. Until then, films such as this Suicide Squad are just not good enough. Mostly enjoyable, and probably worth a watch, but just not one to ever re-watch and unlikely to delight anyone over the age of 14. 55/100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing plot less movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was huge shocking surprise. I had high hopes for this, and I was extremely disappointed. The movie had its own style but it fell apart. The plot was almost absent. Very little story, and when there's one it felt a highlight of a story rather than a real one.Hence, the scenes felt rushed, it is kind of a collage of scenes and soundtracks and misplaced music.The actors are well cast, their portrayal of the iconic villains is spot-on but it's wasted in this movie. I respect the style of this movie and the risk they took, but the movie as a whole was surprisingly boring and poorly executed. The idea is there but the story isn't. I definitely didn't see this coming, but "Suicide Squad" is neither the movie we wanted nor the movie we deserved (pun intended).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was.... Okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I wasn't planning on seeing this movie until I was invited by some friends. I was skeptical after reading some harsh critic reviews. After watching, I was slightly disappointed by Suicide Squad. Being an action film with such a large budget, you really can't fully flop. Still, DC struggles to make movies with a good plot and good editing without relying completely on action scenes. But, this film is not without its positives. First of all, I think the first 30 minutes of the film were quite enjoyable. After that point, things got colluded. Second, the casting of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were excellent choices for their roles. Will Smith was the best choice for Deadshot, and his backstory was interesting and entertaining. Also, Margot Robbie nailed the role of Harley Quinn. Lastly, the bar scene was my favorite part of the movie. That scene helped me better understand each character. Now, the negatives. The pacing was the biggest issue for me. From the flashbacks to the rushed backstories, many things in this film didn't make sense. Specifically, the Joker's scenes were out of place. My second biggest issue is the setting. It seemed like the buildup to the "boss battle" took up 75% of the movie. It was just the same thing over and over. They run into bad guys, think about running away, save Captain Flag and then move on like nothing happened. This highlights the predictability of this movie. Another issue I had was some of jokes that everyone else in the theater thought were "laugh out loud" funny. The humor seemed kind of forced. Last but definitely not least, the ending was so campy it annoyed the hell out of me. The slow motion ending leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. Personally, I walked out of the theater thinking that this movie was just "okay". An "eh" villain, okay special effects and the waste of the Joker contributed to the overall lack of caring about this film. I'm not a Marvel fanboy by any means. But, Marvel leaves you feeling satisfied and DC leaves you feeling like something is missing. The critics were a little harsh in my opinion, but were pretty justified in their reviews. Suicide Squad was just average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some time ago, I abandoned the comic Suicide Squad (The New 52 version). I liked its premise, as well as its intention to humanize minor DC characters, who were typecast in "villain of the month" ungrateful roles for years, such as Deadshot and Black Spider; and even rescuing some traditionally ridiculous characters such as Captain Boomerang and King Shark from the "comic relief". But I think that the comic could never find the adequate creative team to take full advantage of that volatile combination. In fact, inside the "villians trying to do good" sub-sub-genre, I prefer Secret Six, mainly because of writer Gail Simone's talent to create intelligent and violent stories which didn't seem like "gimmicks" to resurrect some forgotten villain, or kill some classic character to prove that "things are for serious". What takes me to the film Suicide Squad, and the revelation that it wasn't able to find the proper creative team to take total advantage of the premise either. Nevertheless, I found it competent, and certainly better than many other DC Comics films. However, it could have gone much farther than "competent". One of the main pros of Suicide Squad is Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn; her work is credible, sparkling and charismatic. Viola Davis also brings a solid performance, bringing an adequately fiend attitude to her character, while Will Smith displays conviction and quite a presence as Deadshot. Unfortunately, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Adam Beach, Karen Fukuhara and Joel Kinnaman feel absolutely insipid and listless in their roles; they could have been replaced by cardboard cutouts, and no difference would have been noticed. Jay Hernández displays more energy and personality, and Jared Leto as Joker... was simply bland. I don't even need to compare him to Heath Ledger; on his own, I found Leto insipid and terribly affected in that character. And, well, I won't talk about the villain; but (possible SPOILER), I think it was a mistake to face the Suicide Squad against a metaphysical threat. This team's natural habitat are the "secret ops" and mundane missions of political assassination, ransom of hostages and demolition of governments detrimental for North American interests, not the magic or caricature semi-gods. On the positive side, the visual style of Suicide Squad is very attractive, appropriately complementing the characters while adding color and exuberance to the grey emotional panorama of the movie. And the soundtrack is excellent; they must have spent millions in the rights of such famous songs, but it was money well invested, specially when employing "Sympathy for the Devil" when Amanda Waller first shows up, or "Paranoid" when Harley has one of her... episodes. Suicide Squad is a film which was made to seem "cool", and even though that strategy usually obtains the opposite result, I have to admit it worked for most of the time in this movie. In summary, Suicide Squad has various cons and it could have been much better, but I found it entertaining, dynamic and a decent addition to the shaky film universe from DC Comics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD For anyone considering watching this film I would maybe wait for it to come on TV. You wont regret waiting when you see it. One thing this film makes you ask is where is the justice league, why are the suicide squad trying to stop someone far more powerful than any of them are? In comics you find them fighting jihad and going on different missions to what this movie had. All in all batman, flash, wonder women and aqua man seem a far better choice than a load of villains. I personally think one of the worse things this film did is humanise these villains. They are all baddies of the dc world so humanise them makes me think Batman is an arse**le. Either way now to the fact they are all in prison, all of the character are serving time for this or that and some stupid women decideds that she wants to start a team of villains. Entantress was most likely the best character for me. She was also the overall villain of the film. Releasing her brother from captivity in some kind of relic, they start laying havoc to the city and this is where the suicide squad steps in. They fight these strange zombie like rock creatures to make their way to some whole in the sky that is going to lay waste to the earth. Deadshot and co fight their way through, with corny jokes and a very hot margot robbie in tow. The most chesesy line of the film came from harley herself, "LADY YOU FORGOT ONE THINGS, THERE MY FRIENDS. Really silly ending. I was waiting for batman or the flash to turn up and whip some arse. The flash could have dealt with the issues with ease. POINTLESS FILM POINTLESS story and a pointless ending. I can be over critical of films sometimes but this is a film made for under 10 year olds. It was dark enough and it wasn't the suicide squad. They are supposed to be villains not super heroes and they went to much for the hero vibe. No wonder Tom Hardy turned this film down.The last bit i want to touch base on is the joker. Jared Leto just wasn't right, i like the actor but he just didn't seem to have any chemistry with the role. I didn't believe in harley and him i didn't believe he is the joker. So batman makers and dc film makers here is a way to save your hides. Make this joker the robin that joker tortured into joker and make a new joker casting for the next batman film. Personally i think william defoe would be a great joker</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie being superhero film centers around anti-heroes who are being manipulated to save the world.The ensemble cast featuring will smith,Jaret Leto, Margot Robbie has been able to garner much of attention in past two years, since it's launch has been announced. First 30 minutes of the movie focuses on introducing main anti-heroes going over all there unnatural powers just like the vibes one get while watching a typical south Indian movie. obviously it would be enjoyable for many as it induces the "ahan" feeling. From that moment plot starts turning a bit too fake or choppy with some audience complaining it to be a random compilation of pseudo random shots. The aerial plot of movie centres around the blunder of enchantress ( one of the initial ant-hero) gone wrong (right,given he was an anti-hero) and suicide squad standing against her in the temptation of reduced prison sentences and some perks. The movie was enjoyable due to it's spontaneous psycho humor,well timed soundtracks,and undeniably the presence of Harley Quin and her sultry psychotic demeanor.Jared Leto as Joker is devilishly charming but extremely psychotic .Kids would definitely enjoy it and teens would love it. So is it a chilling prospect? -- let's stick to enjoyable. Is it a badass?-- yup. Which comrades to accompany for this one? -- rebels, demagogue,easy going ones. Worth my 2 hours? --- yup if u don't have a girl to hangout with :)Still DC comics have a long way to go in seething it's comic books but suicide squad seems a promising start.</fullReview>

In no way it's perfect movie, however, you can't hit the Bulls eye always. The whole purpose of this movie is to build a greater DCEU and the squad does its task with finesse. The best thing about the movie was people were having fun in the theater. Will Smith is a gem of an actor and Harley runs the show here. Other than that Amanda Waller, Rick Flag and Diablo was really really good. Also the music was really good and I am surely buying the soundtrack as well.Go, have yourself a fun evening.</fullReview>

I found Age of Ultron to be disappointing. Civil war was a decent film and by all counts I find suicide squad to be as good as civil war. It has loads of humor, a brilliant star cast, and a pretty good soundtrack. Margot Robbie really steals the show as Harley Quinn. The expectations I set from the trailer were indeed met. Critics are trying to portray it as something bad as Fantastic Four which is extremely unfair. And then there are some who are apparently calling it sexist for Margot Robbie's character. Word to all those 'liberals' - kiss my a**. She's the best comic relief and glamour quotient in the film and she totally kills it! She actually appears to be in crazy love with joker. The only part that could have been better was Jared Leto's joker. It was more of an add-on footage rather than having any real functional value to the plot. I wouldn't mind watching this movie again and I very much look forward to a sequel.</fullReview>

The Joker and Harley Quinn would be a fantastic spin off for the future, I don't think they characters were explored as much as they could have beenIt wasn't what I was expecting at all, and thankfully I wasn't let down, I really enjoyed it and can not wait to see the deleted scenes</fullReview>

Usually when a movie is made from a comic or game or a simple book you have read you will be pi**ed off at all the changes they have made to suit the director and/or actors of the movie. Unfortunately they can't all be made to suit the fans like for example marvels Deadpool.That being said, they did a great job of what they made. Most of these characters are from another time that we know and love, and inserting them in a present day movie is usually hard if not impossible, And for once when making a 2016 version of the same characters they hit bulls-eye. The characters are fun and well made and all but... That is all there is to it.The story-line was paper-thin so the movie felt more like a prelude explaining the characters so they can make a second movie. I would see it again, and probably will, but I'd be more hyped about turning it into a trilogy with the 2th and 3th movie having more of a story-line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Suicide Squad" feels like DC trying to catch up to Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel has been developing major story lines across multiple arcs for almost 15 years: Spider Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, X Men, et al. Now they are developing a new arc on Netflix. Even "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." has the purpose of linking all the arcs. These multiple arcs have established characters and backstories to the point when they can be combined for huge stories (in comic book parlance: Cross over events).DC is late to the game and is using "Suicide Squad" to try and reverse engineer the concept. This movie, like "Batman vs. Superman" is overloaded with characters and foreshadowing of future stories until it becomes a sort of summary of what we the viewers don't but will need to know. And the truth is, summaries tend to be a bit dull.Fortunately "Suicide Squad" has Harley Quinn, probably DC's most unique and in her way, beloved, character. And fortunately Margot Robbie owns the hell out of the role. Harley is complicated and poses profound questions, most significantly; is she bad? Like Spike in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" she asks us to examine the importance of perspective in determining good from evil.Deadshot (to Harley): "Stay evil...". Is she? Does she? What is Harley's motivation for acting as she does at the movie's climax? She's lost Joker and Amanda Waller has no leverage on Harley, so why does Harley....? NO SPOILERS HERE FOLKS. MOVE ALONG.It is hopeful that after "Suicide Squad" DC will have established enough backstories with enough viewers (complain all you want, but "BvS" and "Suicide Squad" have and are being viewed by millions) that they can move forward with more focused stories. Both Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn have their own movies on the way and the "Easter Eggs" in "BvS" and at the end of "Suicide Squad" allude to future Justice League movies. This year's DC offerings have been dark, literally and tonally. But the future could be brighter and a lot more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am getting so sick of critics. I really want critics to prove that they actually watched a movie, before they are allowed to comment on it. All critics critique according to Oscars standards, Oscars who are Racist, sexist and judged by peers. Oscar movies are not block busters that make money. So why are movies judged according to those standards? I use to like the Oscars, but as long as they split awards by gender, and only nominate white people, I will not give it any credit.So back to Suicide Squad, it was a solid good movie. It wasn't epic. More like a really good episode of Arrow. But it was enjoyable, with one of the best music soundtracks ever. Margot Robbie and Will Smith are amazing. Without a doubt the main characters. They carry the movie, and they do it well. Scott Eastwood was wasted as supporting cast, and Cara Delevingne might be the worst part of the movie. She was all wrong. I honestly hated her acting choices. The way she moved, the way she spoke, the way she even kissed her BF. It was just bad. But luckily she is only in a small part of the movie, and you can totally overlook her total mediocre performance. The whole middle part of the movie was stupid, and the detour to save Amanda Waller was a mistake. but it did give the story time for the squad to bond, and create a relationship. I would put it in the same box as "Martha" (BvS).I think anybody looking for action, fun, and epic music will enjoy this movie. It won't linger in your mind, but sometimes you just want to get on a ride and have some fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a fun movie...stop putting it under a microscope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's probably easier to join the negative review club than it is to admit that the movie has many enjoyable elements. I've read reviews out there that bash this flick about straying from the comics. Well, so does Marvel, but we seem to appreciate it in that instance.I watched this movie on opening night with a couple of friends and one of them hated it while the other loved it and couldn't wait for the Blue-ray release. When I asked the 'hater' why he hated it, he quickly used the comics as an excuse and also pointed out that it sucked just as hard as Batman v Superman. I call bullsh*t.*spoilers ahead*Suicide Squad follows the same map that most superhero flicks do. A bunch of super-powered people put aside their differences to fight a monster that none of them can defeat alone. In this case it's exactly like Age of Ultron; a monster that they created themselves. The story is essentially the same.DC has chosen to take a darker approach in their story telling. It's not all laughs like Marvel. I mean, who wants to watch two comic giants try to out-tickle their audience? I like that I can easily tell them apart.I can't argue with the pick of actors either. Most of the roles were done superbly. We have the mopey yet very powerful Diablo, the witty and dangerous Deadshot, the sexy but scary Harley, and the dangerous and even scarier Amanda Waller.I'll admit that the movie seems to linger in some areas it shouldn't (like exposition) and rush through other areas that it shouldn't (like how did everyone survive all those helicopter crashes with absolutely zero injuries?). Also, the final fight at the end could have used a little more work and a lot less seductive dancing - or whatever the witch was doing. But that doesn't take away the fact that it's a fun movie.Forget the negative reviews for a couple of hours and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Answer to the negative reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie for your average movie goer. This is a movie for your comic book fans. People who actually know these characters, and don't expect them to act like their watered down Nolan counterparts (or how they'd behave if they had a Nolan counterpart). People who will actually get all the little references and easter eggs. Like the Alex Ross nod? That was brilliant. And amongst comic book fans, this movie is great. The Joker was, for the first time, the clown prince of crime. Harley was manipulative and cunning. Captain Boomerang was absolutely hilarious. Deadshot was greatly portrayed and had a ton of depth to him. Amanda Waller was probably the scariest character in the whole movie because she wasn't crazy and didn't have a motive, she was just cold. Even the small part Ben Affleck played, you got to see the softer side of Batman and his compassion for all life. All the characters were flushed out brilliantly and the movie was a great reward for comic book fans who want to see their favorite characters come to life</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers* The movie was great throughout with well done character development, smart organization and a good joining of multiple stories. Only downfall was the Incubus (Enchantress's brother) who looked like a video game villain and his sister who was great until he turned her into a ghostbusters villain. I liked how they were gods, but why eliminate life on earth? Also they just waited uselessly with their minions (I liked the way the bad minions worked just not their boss) but starting at where she gives them visions, through the slomo scene and getting to the final murder of her as she ask them to join her is when I feel the character is brought back. It's OK that June Moone came in. Slipknot and Katana...totally forgettable, but I believe in these odds, the goods outweigh the bads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie! But I also enjoyed the critical disappoint that was Batman V Superman. The soundtrack to this film is great like Guardains of the Galaxy not that, that is a reason to see a movie. But I felt that Will Smith gave a better performance in this film than he did in Concussion the film he and his wife felt he was cheated out of a nomination for but I feel he didn't earn it with his performance in that film. Also Margot Robbie as Harley I felt was great she called The Joker, Mister J and Puddin like she did in the animated series were she first came from there's also a flashback scene of her in her "original" outfit. I was worried they would just overalls sexualize her and reduce her to eye candy and while she is that both sexualized and eye candy she is also one of two characters were are given a backstory for and are more fully developed. Margot portrayal was inspired and she pulled off the quirky humor/insanity/love that are Harley. I don't know how I feel about Jared Leto's Joker as he looked so "thug" line in the film with all his tattoos and capped teeth. The way he acted as The Joker was good it's more of his appearance that I have some "issues" with I guess. Also he doesn't have much screen time as The Joker is a background character who pops up randomly through out the film much like he did in The Dark Knight only even less screen time in this film and his actions aren't as plot driving as the were in TDK. I don't know that I buy the conspiracy theory that Disney/Marvel is paying off critics to write bad reviews on DC films but I do feel they are criticized more heavily and far less favorably than their Marvel counterparts. One critic being that the DC films seem to have a darker tone than the lighthearted and more humorous Marvel films but DC characters that have been portrayed in recent films aren't known for their humor or wit and DC Comics tend to be darker in nature than Marvel ones so I feel that is an unfair critic considering the source material.At any rate go see the film and decide for yourself but as a fan of movies and comics I enjoyed it. It may not be the best "superhero" ever made but it is a good film with solid performances and the first female super villain and no I don't mean Harley but the actual "big bad" of the film. I hope they make more Squad films and that the DC universe continues to grow and get better and reach the success and quality of Marvel's films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so pumped up by the trailers &amp; ready to see this movie &amp; after this movie was finished all I thought was "what the heck did I just watch?" This movie had so much potential to be great &amp; it ended up being a horrible mess. I am very disappointed that the trailers made it seem like the joker had a huge role in the movie but he was maybe in the movie an entire 20 mins. So let down that they didn't utilize his character. It could've helped the entire movie. The movie has a few witty one liners &amp; wasn't too terrible but the witch taking over &amp; talking in tongue made me feel like i was watching a low budget remake of the mummy or waiting in line for the mummy ride at universal, I couldn't get over the ending scenes. (Eye roll) I could go on &amp; on about how let down I am but over all, I was not satisfied. I was let down &amp; expected more, it had so much potential to be good too. But once again it just proves that DC is not on the same level as marvel movies &amp; it's a shame. PS Harley Quinn was terribly annoying as well. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deserve the unfair treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I give away any spoilers, but I'll leave the tag on anyway. I really don't think this movie is deserving of all the bad reviews thus far. First of all, if you go into it thinking it's a movie about the Joker, Don't. Get that out of your head right now. It's not a movie about him, it's about the Suicide Squad. Leto maybe has 15 minutes of screen time. His Joker was alright but nothing to write home about. I'm a purist when it comes to the Joker, so maybe that's why his gangster persona didn't really take to me. Overall I thought it was a great popcorn flick, and anyone who is a DC fan will enjoy it. Robbie, and Smith steal the show as their respective characters. Delevigne (not sure about the spelling), also gives a good performance too. It's funny, it's got great action, and it shows some heart too. I understand how people can see that it was kind of piecemealed together, but I thought it flows fairly well. Seeing Affleck in it for those few short scenes has me licking my chops for his solo movie! If you're a fan of DC, go see it. If you're a fan of the actors, go see it. If you're looking for a good summer popcorn flick, go see it! Please don't let the initial poor reviews steer you away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So angry I got off my lazy arse and was compelled to write</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I am not intending to give the pretence that this is ranked at the bottom of the worst movie ever made. However, it is awful enough that combined with the complete disappointment I felt after watching, it deserves a novice review from me.(I would like to point out that I am a relapsed comic book enthusiast that has only taken up interest in recent years and while originally I liked Marvel I have a soft spot for DC especially the new 52 Joker concept so DC fans excuse any ignorance) I was originally excited for the release during the beginning of the marketing campaign. Although the Joker design had some questionable choices (tattoos etc) I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Aesthetically the characters looked spot on and I commend the costume designers and trailer editors which is as far as I can go.The first problem I have is with the character development. Whoever made the decision that they where going to develop the characters by having short background montages fit in awkwardly to a conversation between Waller and a Military Officer at the beginning of the film really doesn't understand how to effectively introduce characters. It is not always necessary to do origin flashbacks to introduce characters and even more so to do all of them. It was as if the studio felt like they had to give everyone the same screen time but not giving a single one enough. I have watched the Assault on Arkham anime and you can go into that not knowing anyone but still be entertained. Harley Quinn was the only character that you get a slight connection with but even that is stretching the definition. When I read in previous reviews about the irrelevance of the Joker narrative I now concur and can completely understand why Jared Leto was angry at the cuts. Whether he was good as the Joker is hard to even argue as you barely have time to judge and what was most annoying is a scene in the trailer where his face was burnt and that looked like a suitably promising scene was completely cut.That moves me on to my second grievance where I remember a moment the Joker introduced Harley Quinn with the line going something like "let me introduce...THE EXQUISITE... HARLEY QUINN!". It felt awkward, cringe-worthy and completely out of place. It was the sort of dialogue that made you feel as though you where being personally patronised. As others have mentioned it arouses much suspicion that the film was heavily edited after the cut by a studio intervention. Whether that is true is neither here-nor-there, but what is frustrating is the forced through lines such as the added comedic punch lines that where so misplaced they where no longer funny. I recall a line where a guard made a request when threatened with a gun that his colleague shoot his killer and "delete his browser history". Fair enough joke and would be funny in the right place but trust my word the juxtaposition of the mood, music and narrative was off by a mile.Following on was the music. My word, now I realise why this movie cost so much to make. For the first 40 minutes you are bombarded with every edgy hit song of the last 60 years. Half of which where introduced for less than 10 seconds at a time. This is possibly the biggest clue that some producer must have intervened. Someone must have watched Guardians of the Galaxy and thought "That mix tape was a hit, lets top it by dumping everything we can find in the first half of the film. It could look like one GIGANTIC music video. Yeah I remember MTV". If they didn't do it I can't imagine how the sound director got his job.Finally, the plot and this is the shortest paragraph I will write. There barely is one. As I mentioned previously the Joker narrative, which could have been developed on further, wasn't necessary and with the music video/character underdevelopment and a barely suspenseful finally that's pretty much it.There is more I could say but my anger is descending and I am back to being lazy but I will leave you on this note: DC needs to go at this project not trying to be Marvel. If they continue to do so they will lose patience with there potential audience and lose the big revenue they are seeing. It won't be a cash cow if it is meager imitation. Be f***ing original like you where with Nolan (that doesn't mean be Nolan again).</fullReview>

Where is all that heavy promotion, hiding him in the trailer just to pop up at the end to get us all excited. All those interviews and stuff. All for nothing, I'll tell ya. DC/Warner Bros. promoted The Joker so much that actually put a thought on people's head (even mine a little bit), that he actually might get close to Heath Ledger's performance. For a year we've been debating, me and my friends with me always insisting that LEDGER IS A GOD for the performance of Joker. And that has been proved now. The Joker has no more than 1-2 minute scenes and all romantic and stuff. That's not what Joker is. Joker is ruthless, psychopath, freaky, schizophrenic... not all this.

		<shortDescription>The good news: it's better than Batman V Superman, the bad news: only just.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Suicide Squad' was one of my most anticipated films of the year, a movie which I thought - alongside 'Deadpool' - had the potential to be truly great due to some unique and subversive aspects. Firstly, there was the actual premise: the Suicide Squad is one of DC's edgier super-teams, featuring some lesser known villains that deserve their time on the big screen. Secondly, the cast and crew was stellar. David Ayer, who has given us some fantastic films such as 'Training Day' and 'End Of Watch', was set to write and direct which made me think we were in for a gritty and violent ride. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Viola Davis were all interesting choices with several great performances already under their respective belts. But as the movie's production continued, it became clear that there was some trouble brewing: multiple re-shoots, several re-writes and a drastic change in the marketing all shook my confidence. After seeing the film, I can say that I'm pretty disappointed with it - though I'm glad that the warning signs showed themselves earlier so I could adjust my expectations. The movie is fun at times, but it is highly flawed and no-where near as good as it could - and frankly should - have been.The movie immediately feels choppy and unfocused. The scenes don't flow properly and frequent flashbacks feel fairly jarring. It seems as though certain scenes were ripped out and others spliced in, and the re-shoots are obvious. The first act is promising, and I started to get on board with the style and tone the film tries to create. This style does wear off eventually and the flick becomes a lot more generic, but initially it comes across as somewhat unique. The main issue with the first act is that it is mainly people telling you things, rather than you being shown them. In the moment it works, but upon reflection it is far too expositional. The tone rapidly changes throughout as well, going from serious and sadistic to light and dismissive in a second. This, again, seems due to the numerous re-shoots - the majority of which seem to have been attempting to inject humour or lighten the tone. The problem is that the tone doesn't feel consistent, and some attempts to edit it aren't successful: placing an 80s rock song over a serious scene doesn't make it cheerful. Speaking of which, the soundtrack - while it contains some great individual songs - is a jumble of snippets with little connecting them. It goes from one song to another just like that, and as such none of the songs have any impact.Behind the camera, most of it is good. David Ayer directs the film well, though his direction is far from outstanding. The writing is decent, too, even when some lines are contrived and forced. The main issues lie within the editing and the plot. The editing is choppy during the action scenes, so it's hard to follow the fighting at times. As I mentioned, the scenes don't naturally flow which is probably because of the changes late in production. The plot, after the first act, is insanely generic and ultimately bland. The second and third acts bleed together, taking place in an abandoned and uninteresting city. It culminates in a CGI extravaganza remarkably similar to many others in the genre. Speaking of CGI, the film features far too much of it. This makes the action mostly unbelievable and also very impersonal. It means that little tension is built and it's impact isn't felt.The characters aren't given equal attention, with a couple dominating while all of the others are severely side-lined. This issue means that the majority of them don't connect with the audience, leading to a lack of empathy and thus tension. By the end of the film, only a handful of characters have had sufficient development and even fewer have completed an arc. For an ensemble movie, this isn't acceptable as each member ought to have had at least some significant development or gone through some change. The acting from the main cast is mostly good, with decent performances across the board. The stand-outs are Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot. They make for entertaining and likable screen-presences, as well as being two of the most developed members of the squad. Smith plays it very similar to his other roles, but it works for his interpretation of the character. Jai Courtney remarkably isn't bad, though he isn't great either: at least this time he isn't putting on an accent. Joel Kinnaman is alright, but Rick Flag is bland and generally uninspired. Killer Croc, played admirably by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, is underused but is brought to life with amazing make-up effects. This version of The Joker is perhaps the worst in a live-action film, at least since Cesar Romero, even though you can tell Jared Leto is trying his best. He himself isn't bad, but the character doesn't fit with his comic-book counterpart and is actually quite unmemorable. He isn't in the picture for long, so perhaps extra scenes would've padded him out a little. The main villain is very weak too, aside from being visually interesting - at least, to start with. Their plan is just the generic 'take over the world or destroy it', which doesn't really work in the end as it has been done so many times and much better.In the end, 'Suicide Squad' is very disappointing and is actually a pretty bad/mediocre film. I enjoyed it at times though, even though it made me sigh at others, and had more fun with it than I did with 'Batman V Superman': 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to the critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing first: don't listen to the critics! Suicide Squad is a really fantastic and well rounded film. The film is thoroughly entertaining and does not disappoint. It has some really impressive action sequences and the writing combines a perfect blend of seriousness and humour. Jared Leto has completely nailed the Joker! The only real problem is that we don't get enough of him. Leto's performance is unlike any Joker we have seen before, acting as more of a crime lord. This is an inspired version of the Joker, one of which I am absolutely desperate to see come up against Ben Affleck's Batman. Harley Quinn portrayed by Margot Robbie is also something I have been waiting to see for a long time. She is the ultimate female bad-ass and at times really steals the whole show. When Harley is on screen with the Joker, magic happens and it is a welcome addition to the cinema screen. I can't wait to see more of this criminal couple. Other characters which are of note are Deadshot who is excellently played by Will Smith and Diablo who is played by Jay Hernandez. These two characters are truly brought to life by these great actors. The film lacks a little something in the antagonist department (a slight irony) but this does not bring the film down as there are such strong characters portrayed by such great actors/actresses. I would have personally loved to have seen Joker as the main antagonist. However, I can respect the choice made. Overall, I think David Ayer did a really fantastic job of bringing this team of colourful characters together. I would give Suicide Squad 8 out of 10 for its bold new take on the superhero genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is full of both positives and negatives. It has good humor, lots of fun, and awesome characters. Unfortunately, the movie lacks a good story and feels as if some scenes were cut short because the fear of a long run time. In this case, a long run time would not be so bad because it would flesh out the story better. The casting was great for this movie. Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn, Will Smith did a good job as Deadshot, and Jared Leto gave us a new and unique version of The Joker. The other characters were alright but those three were the ones that stood out the most. The biggest problems in this movie lie within the story and the editing. The movie would've been better had some of the scenes been longer and gave the audience more context. Despite the story and the editing, it doesn't stop the movie from being fun. The movie has lots of action and good humor and it made up for the poor story/editing. This movie was a total blast and really enjoyable. If you like a movie with a good story, this isn't for you. If you like a fun movie with lots of action, this is just that movie. It had exactly what Batman v Superman was lacking: fun. While Batman v Superman has a more in-depth and complex story, Suicide Squad has a weak story, but loads of fun to make up for it. If you like superhero movies, I recommend seeing this one. Another plus about seeing this movie is it helps set up Justice League which hits theaters November 2017.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's about 8.5 worth of a movie in my book, for some real good acting and well written roles. That is, some well written roles, had it been true with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a real masterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the quality performance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are a few other solid performances which didn't get their characters developed enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Davis who's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing but getting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional, and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtney and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, but it's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here to forever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly written were really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them great justice. This together with a reasonable plot and solid technical aspects of this production, make it a worth your while movie. But once again this could've been a lot better, and the fact it's not is plain shame.</fullReview>

Batman (hm. how can he complete Joker if Joker himself isn't needed in the movie in the first place?) 3. Slipknot (his contribution to the bomb test is appreciated anyway) 4. Boomerang (why do they need a thief in the first place?) 5. Killer Croc (thanks for the charisma you add to the squad but a Beauty and the Beast suits you better)6.Joker (his final scene can stay though) 7. El Diablo's every "I-won't-harm-people" dialog and flashbacks and the "I-gotta-protect-my- new-family" clichéNow you've got somewhat cooler squad than Sailormoon and friends!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I liked it a lot. For reference, I like Marvel and DC equally, and I loved BvS (and anything with Batman).The visuals were amazing, the characters were fun (although, I agree under developed), good use of music, and the fight scenes were cool.However, it was not without faults. Warner took some heat due to the run time of BvS, but the Extended Blu Ray was much better. I say, make the movie as long as it needs to be. I can deal with a 3-hour Saving Private Ryan. Also, the sub-villains, the mindless enemies they fought, just felt like they were there for target practice. They reminded me of the droids in Star Wars Episode 1. Also, I thought Leto's Joker was at times a copy of Heath. He even sounded like him a few times. I was not impressed. I've heard, however, many of his footage was cut, so I look forward to the Blu Ray. Great movie, go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Ayer brings something new for the DC Cinematic Universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HEY PUDDIN', THE JOKES ON YOU! IS SUICIDE SQUAD AS BAD AS EVERYONE IS MAKING IT OUT TO BE? Villains, come in many different shapes and sizes. Some iconic villains have even stolen the show from the hero, and are capable of winning fans over. After the outcome of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the U.S. Government is concerned about how they will deal with future threats. Bad ? ass babe Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis (The Help, Prisoners) sees the arrival of Superman as a wake-up call. She uses the fear of Superman's abilities to fight the U.S. Government into letting her unit Task Force X, a group of their worst imprisoned criminals. The intent is to send the team on suicide missions against super-powered threats in exchange for time off their rather lengthy sentences. This film has been receiving some bad reviews, and a lot of negativity. Do I think it's a perfect movie? No, far from it. However, I believe the film has an amazing cast, great soundtrack, it felt like a comic book on the big screen, well acted performances, colorful, it's fun, funny, and it felt like the DC Cinematic Universe is actually starting to connect more naturally. I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews, and hate this film has been receiving. Honestly, I like it a hell of a lot more than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Out of all the actors and actresses so far in the DC Cinematic Universe, the cast in Suicide Squad is easily the best. Will Smith, as Deadshot is the most well rounded character, with back-story, character development, and screen time. If anything, I consider this the Will Smith movie a.k.a. Mister July a.k.a. Big Willy Style has his career comeback. I do agree with what some critics and fans are saying though. I believe Will Smith is the main character, because he is the biggest selling point for this movie. Also, at times I believe he was acting like Will Smith instead of the character Deadshot from the comics. Viola Davis completely owns the role of Waller. She really is mean, fearless, intelligent, determined and as Will Smith said to her in the film, gangsta. She dominates everyone she shares a scene with and makes them look ten times as small. I'd love to see her character come back in the future."YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE CRAZY ONES." Another standout is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. If you're not familiar with comic books and or the character. You should know that Margot Robbie had a ton of pressure on her taking on this role. If you go to any comic convention, there are literally many women dressed as Harley Quinn (That's why I like those conventions ha-ha). In my opinion, Robbie will satisfy fans, newcomers who may not know the characters, and moviegoers. Robbie manages to capture the spirit of Quinn from the animated series as well as the newer version from the comics while still making the character work for movie audiences. If you talk about Harley Quinn, you also have to talk about Jared Leto as Mister J a.k.a. The Clown Prince of Crime, better known as The Joker! Leto had to face even bigger expectations. I'll admit, when I first saw the picture of Jared Leto as The Joker I wasn't feeling all that strong about it. I literally said, "He looks like what would happen if Lil Wayne and Marilyn Manson would have a baby together). Nevertheless, after seeing him here, Leto took on the role and I really feel like he delivered. His Joker brings a lot new to the character and is significantly different from the performances of Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Hamill. In my opinion, this Joker was a mix of various Jokers. Jared Leto's reminded me very much of the Joker from DC Comics The New 52 series Endgame story-line, Batman: The Killing Joke, Ledger, Nicholson, and the novel Joker by Brian Azzarello. Jared Leto is not trying to be Heath Ledger. He is trying to do something different, yet stay true to the character we love (or hate). I actually would love to see Jared Leto come back as The Joker. I heard many of his scenes were cut from the film, and personally, I'd love to see more. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Suicide Squad. Even though the director David Ayer (screenwriter for Training Day, Director of End of Watch) mentioned he is not the biggest comic book fan, I believe he constructed a well-done comic book movie. It has a good cast, music, and it feels like a comic book movie. I believe this film would have been even better if it were rated R, not trying to be as funny, and kept the tone of the very first trailer we saw. It's not a perfect movie, but I personally enjoyed it. For those who didn't enjoy it. I'm sorry you were all let down, and hopefully you didn't lose all your faith in the DC Cinematic Universe. I believe that Suicide Squad earns a?8/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. "Stay evil doll face." :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with the movie overall despite poor reviews. Nice short backstory on characters that mattered and well acted for the most part. Critics try to over analyze action sci-fi flicks instead of just enjoying a well done film and letting the people judge themselves. You are not watching Gone with the Wind or The Shawshank Redemption. It's a movie based on comic book characters made for adolescent adults to enjoy! Just be happy someone put this together and only hope for a sequel! If I never saw the story between Harley and The Joker continue it would be a real shame! Also the Will Smith performance was not as bad as reported! This isn't a role for Tom Hanks or he would have been cast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some spoilers in this but not many and this review is just my opinion. First the the bad the plot is messy and confusing at times that had a lot to do with editing, I fairly sure that there well be an extended cut on the DVD which will fill in some of the massive holes in the plot. Some of the dramatic pauses were unnecessary. The ending of the film was just bad and blatantly a set up for the next film. What this movie has got going for it is good characters, good special effects and great music and thankfully a 15 not a 12a. There is one member of the squad and (I think you can guess who that is) who was pointless and was the sacrifice to make a point. Margots performance as Harley Quinn was great, Jay as Diablo was pretty great as well. As for Will and viola his is not as bad as you think he is and she is just as bad as you think she is, I think killer croc and katana were unused, Joel as Rick flag was OK, first time for me seeing Cara acting I think she did a pretty good job more as the enchantress than June moone. The joker just out of his tree freaky I think Jared had fun playing the role, Jai a lot of the time in roles misses the mark but in this he really pulled it off. The action sequences and fight scenes were really cool. The suicide squad are not really against each other (apart from katana) but by the end they consider themselves friends and are even welling to help flag go up against his girlfriend because using her a weapon was a bad idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the previous DC movies, but still short of good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting awesomeness for about 10 minutes of this movie. It starts with an exciting bang, but it starts to get muddled, reportedly due to many re-shoots and edits. Then you start to realize you're mostly going to get pretty CGI.The film has no heart. There's a scene where one of the members refers to the Suicide Squad as "family", but that's the moment when I said to myself, we were never shown what makes these people feel like family. It's as empty as that Batman V Superman moment when Superman and Batman are suddenly friends because they realize their moms share the same first name.Marvel had another breakaway cult hit called "Guardians of the Galaxy", and DC rushed to have one just like it, and they fell short of a James Gunn thrill ride with living, beating heart.It's not bad, but it doesn't rise to "good".On the technical side, I see no reason to pay for 3D or IMAX. The 3D post processing is minimal and not convincing, and there are no must-see moments in IMAX.</fullReview>

A bit too love struck back. He is suave and has a crazy unpredictable mob boss aura to him which I liked. No one really knew what kind of response he wants when put in a position of choice.Will Smith although one of the enjoyable characters in the movie didn't really feel like a Deadshot to me.They smoothed it all in nicely with the odd jolt here and there.I'm not going to write too much as its early days and there are probably lots of people waiting to go see it who are skimming through reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts with Waller and ends with Waller, what i am trying to say that it is just a different take from what we got used to see in DC movies, a more like marvel way with no real superheroes(which is good). Filling the space between BvS and Justice League. Joker is bad enough to say he's more like sociopath crime mafia. I never imagine that joker will be so desperate to save his girl, Harley comes good in that way. All other characters just revolve around or kinda support staff with no other story line. Will smith is a standout performer in this movie. Well wait to see what that post credit scene is meant to be as it already been explained in Bvs. Finally fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie to introduce justice league</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally think that Suicide squad is a great movie to introduce justice league. The presence of flash and batman helps the viewer to understand justice league plot and explain what really happen when they lost superman in batman vs superman saga. Will smith's role is quite astonishing and I consider his role as alive. Amanda walker is so mean. Captain boomerang is a little bit wooden. The quality of the humors was fantastic. I enjoyed them so much. I think SC should have notable villain (bad guy) character. Personally I think Enchantress shouldn't be the villain. She didn't really portray the "bad side" of the movie. The main reason why Enchantress turns against Amanda is because she threatens her. She is not the bad side, Amanda is. It will be cool if Joker be the villain instead (lol). I love the new joker. Simplicity and elegant combined. He is totally will be the bad ass during the next DC movie. Can't wait to watch him. The flashbacks to introduce all the character were great. Simple and straight to the point. SC is able to show the good side of Harley despite she is totally the bad villain. Joker's helicopter accident was a great plot twist. In terms of general plot, I still didn't see the connection between SC and dark knight rises and the previous DC movies. I hope the next DC movie can provide the viewers with the connections</fullReview>

Now,I would like to say about the Joker. Of course Jared was great,he did a terrific job with his acting as the Joker but his lough,the Joker's lough was weird.But overall the movie is great.All comic book lovers will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average Summer Fun Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as super hero flicks go, this film did not reach the high water mark of the Defenders of the Galaxy, however it did not flop around for 2hrs in cringe worthy fashion like some super hero flicks (an example here would be fantastic 4). What you may enjoy in this film: really fun performances from Robbie, Leto, Kinnaman, and even Smith (I was able to suspend my disbelief and view Smith as his character most, but not all of the time); lots of action, fun interactions between the "evil ensemble". For me, the highlight was Leto as the joker, he was absolutely fantastic.What you probably won't like: somewhat choppy editing and a weak plot. What drives the characters from scene to scene in the second and third act is anyone's guess. Perhaps they felt a need to get to the end of the movie. The bad guys are there just for the good guys (who are also technically bad I guess) to beat up and kill. More needed to be done to develop the enemy in general and in turn, the conflict between the protagonists and antagonists. As a non-comic aficionado I perhaps had lower expectations going in (plus I had read a couple bad reviews). However, in the end, I definitely had a good time seeing this in the theater and would recommend it to anyone wanting a fun summer flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor studio made movie marginally saved by the glimpses of Ayer's direction and wonderful cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(contains LIGHT spoilers)In what has to be one of the most disappointing movie of the year, Suicide Squad fails to deliver the basics but ends up having more enjoyable moments than its preceding DC films. The biggest issue this film has is its narrative. Not only do they serve us such a thin and shallow plot &amp; story but also tell the thin narrative in such a disjointed way. The hot topic visuals only cover up for a complete lack of style (which is the complete opposite to BvS' stylistic gluttony but lack of substance). Substance in this movie exists but feels like it has been butchered, redone, and forced back in as plastic re-imagining. One of the greatest sins this movie has with its narrative is the poor handling of character development. Instead of staying true to their natures, all the villains of this movie have an inexplicable change of heart that is nowhere near convincing enough. There's great chemistry and performances but terrible bonding period. The team suddenly becomes a group of friends inexplicably as the film goes on. In Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the movie takes its time to bond the characters on-screen. None of that happens here bar the bar scene. We are meant to suddenly feel sympathetic to Deadshot as he refuses to kill someone important in the movie? For what reason does he decide to not pull the trigger?It's all a shame because the characters, the chemistry, and performances are separately good on their own but as a whole, in this mess of a set-up, fails to make up a good and competent movie. Will Smith and Robbie steal the show as Deadshot and Harley Quinn with great charisma and just general enthusiasm in their roles. El Diablo, Boomerang, and Waller also make up for some really nice scenes and moments (In all fairness, Diablo is probably the only character with good development and believable story-line; so thanks to whoever made the decision to not butcher his story up)! So the main squad and characters actually were good and had a lot of good potential. Every character has at least two good lines of dialogue and the interaction is generally fine. But all we see them do is talk smack and walk around a city participating in lame action scenes and an even lamer finale. Jared Leto as The Joker is a serious missed opportunity. He was great in his performance but there was definitely more of him which was cut out from the movie. He's more of a thug/gangster so that explains his lavish clothing and tattoos but still keeps a creepy and unpredictable vibe. Not much happens with the Joker except he crashes in the party much later than I hoped for.Ayer has done a great job getting the best out of his actors and making sure everything on-screen worked. So the scenes and individual footages themselves are actually not bad. Clearly, the man had a vision and story he wanted to tell. Yet the film ended up being anything but cohesive, footage after footage with no structure just the bare minimum. We're flashed into the introduction of the characters and how they got there which was lazily done. Deadshot and Quinn deserved entire sections of their own, not flash card introductions and brief scenes. The movie just starts randomly and ends abruptly. All of this just confirms what many of us have feared, that all the behind the scenes drama and panic in WB were true and that they have yet again butchered another movie.I sincerely hope they learn their lesson this time. Follow Disney's example by NOT interfering with the movies and letting a creative team produce and make the films ala Geoff Johns like Marvel Studios is to Disney. WB didn't even give Ayer enough time to come up with a proper story then script FFS! All because of marketing deals, panic, and test audience reactions.When will big studios learn? They keep on making these studio made films. They've been doing this forever as well. Most famously "The Other Side of Midnight". Seriously, when will they learn?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Suicide Squad" exist from bad guys. The group they'll send in when they can't afford losing anyone. To control them, they have a bomb in their neck and a gift to look forward to. If they succeed, they'll lose 10 years of their sentence. If they don't, they die. Now the squad has a mission. "Suicide Squad" is directed by the wonderful director David Ayer. I call him wonderful because of his previous films ("End of Watch" and "Fury), but this time I wouldn't call him wonderful. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy and a lot of his movies, but this time he just fell short. His directing wasn't in his style and felt forced for me. But he also made some bold choices that were probably demanded by the studios, throughout the review you'll know what I mean. The visual directing was fine, it was a bit to dark for me. It wasn't always clear what was going on. The cinematography also was a bit on the same level of the directing not great not horrible. This was done by Roman Vasyanov, who has worked with Ayer before in his best movies (The previous named ones). But let's change things up with something really good. The soundtrack. Man this was maybe the best part of the movie. I didn't expect to hear "Seven Nation Army", but now that I've heard it in the movie I realize that it kind of fits. Same goes with "Bohamian Rhapsody" of Queen, which we had heard before in the trailer. This song was very well chose; it was chaotic, which complimented the movie very well. But these weren't the only good songs, of course. The styles of music changed a lot, but this was only to accentuate the chaotic feel of the movie. If Ayer had any involvement in this, than he did a really good job. Now let's move on to something bad again. The editing. This wasn't always bad, but a lot of the time it was. The movie suffers from pacing issues and sometimes it feels like there was just edited a part out. For example: when Harley breaks the window and takes something, wherafter she walks away. After she has the little dialogue with Flag it seems that the scene ends, but it doesn't. There is just a brief shot of something else, but then moves on to Will Smith walking to the same thing to look at a jacket. This was obviously a re-shoot. That's also the reason why there was this editing mistake. I can't comprehend why you could let such a mistake slide in such a big budget movie. And this isn't the only editing mistake, but I'll quite there. I still have a minor issue to say and this involves the sound. This is just a detail, that I think could've easily been fixed. When The Joker and Harley are in the helicopter and are talking there is no sound whats-however of the helicopter, but in some scenes they thought of adding the helicopter sound. So why not here?The acting was very well done. I think that the actors were all well cast and fitted them well. I'll just talk about a few of them, due to the word limit. The first one I want to talk about is Will Smith. I was very skeptical when he got cast, because he is nothing like the character Deadshot, but he nailed it. He was good in the emotional scenes (where a lot of them were re-shoots I believe) and also in the other. Margot Robbie is next on my list. Her portrayal of Harley was really good. It was like she was ripped straight from the comic- book. The only thing that I have to say about her is that her accent sometimes went away, but that's just a minor detail. Jai Courntey is also someone I quickly want to mention. I can't believe I'm saying this, but he actually was good. This is the first movie I've seen of him where he is good. If you want to hear something about Jared Leto as The Joker... I can't really say yet. I haven't seen a lot of him, but judging on the things seen, I can say he over-acted a bit, but was fine overall. A thing that I disliked about his character was that he was completely useless in the movie. The writing is one of the bigger problems of the movie. The dialogue wasn't neccesairliy bad, but the story overall was. It was your cliché superhero movie, which ends with a generic bad guy and a laser beam pointing up in the sky. It's nothing new and it is told a billion times before. Almost all of the times it ended up with being bad, so why would it work now. The one-liners did work. They were funny and witty, but sometimes there were some cringe-worthy ones. The one- liners were mostly given to Deadshot and Harley: the stars of the movie. The characters were well developed, but how they were developed was not the greatest. They really push it in your face every time it happens they're like: 'Look sad things have happened to them. Now care about them.' But the only person that they kill of, where they want you to care about, wasn't well developed. So was the villain. There was no motivation for her to do these things, they don't even explain it. But how they introduced the characters was done in a fun way, but the editing was a bit sloppy there. And I don't know why they didn't introduce everyone of them. That didn't make any sense.In the end I have to say that this isn't Ayers best film. It has a lot of problems, but the acting and soundtrack do carry the movie for a big part. Thats why I'm giving this movie a 6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Disappointing Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who thinks this movie is excellent is either a kid or someone who doesn't know anything about movies.Let's start with the good things. The first act is very entertaining and promising. It begins with Amanda Waller talking about the Suicide Squad, their backstories and how they caught them. It might seem like lazy writing but it doesn't matter because of the good and entertaining execution. The best things about this film are the characters and the performances. Viola Davis is great, she really pulls off the scary, mean lady type. Will Smith is awesome as Deadshot, he was really cool and funny and he has a really good backstory involving his daughter, that you actually care about, and probably has the best action scene in the movie where he's on top of a car. He has very good chemistry with Harley Quinn and a very entertaining and developing relationship with Rick Flag, who was very good as well. Margot Robbie is also really good as Harley Quinn, she's funny but crazy, and like Deadshot her backstory is explored the most through flashbacks. Which brings me to Jared Leto as the Joker. I was really hyped for him and I wanted to see what he can do, but there's really nothing to say because the Joker is only in ten minutes of this movie. And the scenes that he's in are not scenes, there just moments of him mostly through flashbacks, and every one of them was shown in the trailer so you think he's going to be an important part of the movie and also the villain, which he is not, he's actually only in the movie for Harley and the other moments of him don't have anything to do with the rest of the movie or the plot. And those moments don't slow down so the Joker doesn't have any scenes where you can examine Leto's performance. And that was really disappointing. Which brings me to the fact that this movie is poorly edited and you just know that a lot of it was cut out. The scene where Joker is going to torture Harley Quinn is all in just a flashback full of cuts.The second and third act of this movie are just random and not memorable action scenes , in this city, between some scenes of dialogue and funny moments, which sometimes work and sometimes do not. Even though I have to admit that this movie was funny and I did laugh a lot.Some of the characters are completely wasted like Katana, Killer Croc and Slipknot who wasn't even shown a backstory and who dies in the first two minutes. The biggest problems of this movie are the plot and the villain. The villain is Enchantress who is this evil witch who wants to take over the world and shots a big beam in the sky to open portals or something. She also has a brother who's this big CGI monster who I don't care about enough to remember his name, by the way the CGI is actually very bad and it just looks ridiculous. So its a completely cliché villain plot with a cliché ending where they defeat the big magical monster by throwing a bomb at the middle of the beam and it explodes and everything is fine now. And we think June Moone is dead so it's a sad moment, but guess what, she's alive and were all happy now. A similar scene is where the Joker's helicopter crashes and Harley's sad because she thinks he's dead and it's supposed to be a sad moment but it isn't because we all know the Joker's not dead.And the last thing about this movie. Jai Courtney is surprisingly pretty good as Captain Boomerang, he's funny and enjoyable but his character is completely useless. And it makes you think, why would they sent a crazy girl with a bat, a guy who shoots people, a girl with a sword and a guy with a boomerang to go fight this magical creature. The only one who's actually useful and can do some damage is Diablo who's actually a really cool character.In the end, the movie was funny and entertaining, the characters were good, but the plot/story, the editing and the villain were trash.I liked Batman v Superman but I definitely don't love this movie. I give it a 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another mess from DC/WB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is with DC, but they haven't had a superhero film with a well-developed story since Nolan left the scene. Their latest movie, Suicide Squad, has too many characters, too many flashbacks, and a poorly written action plot, resulting in a pretty boring movie. Suicide Squad starts shortly after Batman v. Superman. Superman's death influenced ARGUS chief Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to assemble a team of super powered villains to fight against meta-human threats. Don't ask me why she doesn't just ask Batman, the Flash, and Wonder Woman.The team members consist of Deadshot (Will Smith), the best hit-man in the world; Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the Joker's deranged girlfriend and former psychiatrist; Diablo (Jay Hernandez), a super-villain who controls fire; Captain Boomerang, who literally just throws boomerangs really well; Killer Croc, (Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje) a super strong villain who is part man and part crocodile; and Slipknot, (Adam Beach), who can climb walls. The team is assembled to take out the super villainess Enchantress, a witch who wants to destroy the world. But the team is kept in the dark about the true nature of their mission, and they are just told to basically point and shoot at whatever they come across, until they learn the truth at the end. During the mission, the Joker (Jared Leto) intervenes to take Harley Quinn back, causing trouble for everyone.Developing all of these characters and delivering a good action movie seemed to be beyond the ability of the filmmakers. Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Amanda Waller are the only characters who really stand out. Will Smith gives a good performance ? his trademark personality doesn't overwhelm the character, which I was worried about. Margot Robbie nails it as Harley Quinn, her mannerisms, her humor, everything. Viola Davis is just chilling as Amanda Waller. The rest of the cast might as well have not been there. Jai Courtney is funny when he has something to say. Slipknot, Killer Croc, and Diablo disappear at times during the movie and you don't miss them. Slip Knot and Killer Croc in particular are given little to no character development. There's also a bodyguard named Katana whose only development comes from a few throwaway lines. These are some of the least memorable characters you'll meet in a blockbuster action film.Flashbacks are the primary mechanism for developing the characters and I just think that that's pretty lazy. It works well enough for Dead Shot and Harley, but it would have been better if we had seen these characters develop relationships with each other on screen in real time instead of diverting so much time from the plot at hand. By the end of the movie they're this big happy family and it doesn't feel convincing. As for Jared Leto's heavily promoted Joker performance, all I can say is "meh". I didn't think he was scary or funny and most of his scenes could have been cut. In fact they probably should have been cut to develop other characters better. So while the supporting characters are pretty forgettable, the plot is pretty forgettable too. The team just wanders around a city without much direction until they find Enchantress. The story is not well served by mediocre action scenes either. When Star Trek Beyond has better action scenes than a superhero (or in this case, a super-villain movie), that's pretty bad. All in all, this was a pretty dull movie, only marginally better than WB's previous outing (although I haven't seen the ultimate cut of BvS yet). This project seems to have suffered from a classic case of too many hands in the pot - studio micromanagers may have changed the movie so much that it didn't resemble Director David Ayer's original vision. WB employed the company that cut the trailer to make the movie funnier apparently. I've never heard of a major studio using a trailer company to recut their film. Plus, I heard the script was written in six weeks (not smart). Maybe we'll see a better cut on home video, but DC can't keep relying on director's cuts to save their projects. They have to shape up soon, or they will see disappointing box office returns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few months ago I went to see Antman..and I got the impression that Marvel were throwing too many movies at us...and were starting to take us for granted..stick a Marvel movie on and it will make big bucks..we are yet to see if that's true......after seeing this mess of a movie I'm starting to think this of D.C ...maybe too much too soon. Man Of Steel and S V B were stylish and darkly funny...but this is way..way..way off the mark. Badly scripted and acted with unlikable characters who nobody cares about.Badly directed...gets nothing out of the crew.Take Will Smith..he is just always will smith..no dimension...he harps on about black people not getting Oscars..then in a 12 month period in which we had Revanent..Danish Girl....Spotlight...he has the audacity to be in a load of mess like this..if you want an Oscar ..act better in good movies.Everybody else was also just there ,,never anything special...I think this will prove to be a loose wheel .I wont say don't see it because you probably will,,but chances are you won't enjoy it.....and..the new Joker is woefully pathetic...not a near patch on Ledger..Nothing here to be excited about ...at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad wasn't a film that was particularly on my radar, I intended on seeing the film solely to see Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker and Harley Quinn's cinematic debut. From a critical perspective, David Ayer's entry into the DCEU isn't very well made. The fact that he supposedly wrote the script in only six weeks may explain why there are glaring plot holes, weak characterization and a dull finale. What does work however is the chemistry between the cast and the enjoyment factor of the film, and that's where Suicide Squad shines and the general audience will likely get a kick out of the film as they did with Guardians of the Galaxy given that the two have the same vibe. The standout performances are Viola Davis' as Amanda Waller who just fits the character perfectly and is essentially ripped from her comic book incarnation. Will Smith as Deadshot is basically Will Smith which isn't necessarily a bad thing, besides Harley he had the most development out of the Squad and is more of a anti- hero than full on villain. Lastly Margot Robbie gives a decent performance, while it takes a while to get used to her interpretation of the character, it grows on you during the film and she has a couple of good lines and she has great chemistry with Jared Leto's Joker for the short time we see the two together. The villain (Enchantress) is sadly very underwhelming and fills out of place, her and her brother (who isn't even given a name) hardly do anything of relevance in the film. Her minions are basically zombies and seeing the Squad fight and shoot through them isn't very interesting and the final fight feels very anti climatic and oddly enough is sorta a rip off of the original Ghostbusters finale. Overall Suicide Squad is an enjoyable film with a few great performances and lines. After the mixed reception MoS and BvS garnered for their tone and treatment of beloved characters, this is a breath of fresh air for those who want something different from the DCEU and as long as you aren't expecting an Oscar worthy script or the most original plot you should be fairly pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm honestly a bit confused by all the Marvel vs. DC BS that seems to be trashing this movie. I'm not a particular fan of any particular comic. I don't own any comics. I just like good movies. I grew up with X-Men cartoons, and the Super Friends, Spiderman, Green Lantern. I could care less about some nerd rage about who's better. I just want some entertainment and Suicide Squad definitely delivered.I wasn't sure what to expect, other than some cheeky behavior from Harley Quinn, and some nice visuals. What I got was a great summer ride.Don't listen the hype and judge for yourself. Every one of these characters is fleshed out. I connected with each, although a few could have used a bit more back story. The visuals definitely didn't disappoint, and the action was non-stop once you got your ticket on the train ride. After the backstory was out of the way, it was game on.The Joker was 'uncomfortable' to watch, which is saying something. The insanity shown there was truly believable. Harley Quinn excelled as a total wacko, jokester, bad ass, and general flirt. This was oddly probably one of the best renditions of the joker I've seen. Heath Ledger was a believable villain for being cold and critical and deadly in the batman flicks. This Joker is different for a different reason. I wasn't sure Jared was a good choice for this .I left the theater not doubting. The joker and Harley are insane and the in love. The joker is evil, and Harley will do whatever he asks. I great recipe for disaster ;).Deadshot was awe inspiring, and still managed to be likable, and inhumanly human. Will Smith is the perfect mix of 'full of himself', 'a father', 'deadly', and 'plucky' at the same time. He and Harley Quinn had great chemistry on screen.Enchantress was a surprise for me, largely hidden in the previews, and fantastic in it's delivery. They could spawn an entire new movie off of that alone.El Diablo was fantastic as a thug turned spiritual initiate. His power is impressive. I only wish he had more on-screen time, because what they showed was jaw dropping. They should have spread that around a bit.Overall, a solid 8 out of 10. You won't find much better for summer fare. This is one that will have lasting power beyond the summer as well. It will go into my favorites along with Guardians, The Man of Steel, Star Trek, and the Thor films. Great entertainment. Tell the critics to shove it or check their batteries...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say up front that the critics are full of it; SUICIDE SQUAD is a fun movie, a good action film filled with great characters played by well cast actors. I think part of the problem is that for the past year we've been watching one great trailer after the other and really had very high expectations for the movie; as it is, SUICIDE SQUAD has a story filled with some well worn comic book tropes and a script that needed some revisions; I will say that SUICIDE SQUAD's script is not as clunky as the one for BATMANVSUPERMAN, but it is the same problem, and keeps the movie from knocking it out of the park.I must admit that I'm a big fan of the rag tag group of misfits coming together to perform an impossible mission story, be it THE DIRTY DOZEN or THE AVENGERS. As everyone knows from the comics, the SUICIDE SQUAD is one such group, made up of imprisoned super villains and under the control of the formidable Amanda Waller, who wants a team capable of going up against an evil meta human on the level of Superman if it should ever be necessary. One of the best things about the film is how it speeds through the back stories of Deadshot, Diablo, Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, Katana, The Enchantress, and even Harley Quinn, to get the action moving; it's good to have a super hero movie that doesn't spend the first hour on origins and exposition, and then rushing through main plot in the second half. The who and the what are quickly established, the principle threat arrives and the team goes into action and the movie heads toward the inevitable showdown with the Big Bad.That is when SUICIDE SQUAD nearly goes into a ditch, for there are some left turns in the third act that all but short circuit the story before it gets back on track just in time for a satisfying conclusion. We get one of those everybody fights everybody throw downs, where the anti social antiheroes must unite as one and take out the villain, using their powers for a good cause for a change. The special effects are fine, even if the lighting is too dark as it was in BvS. Of course there are some things that do make for head scratching, like how convenient for the plot that Waller has the entire world's defense secrets tucked away in her mind for the villain to read and how Harley Quinn is ready to die for her new friends only minutes after nearly deserting them for the Joker.And that is another problem with SUICIDE SQUAD: of the vast rogue's gallery in the DC universe, why go with the one they chose; especially when you've got the Joker already in the script. I would much rather have seen have seen a movie where Waller, Deadshot and company had squared off against the Joker and Harley; when you've already hauled out the big artillery, you might as well use it to its best advantage.Do we need yet another super hero movie where the villain is determined to take over the world by opening some portal that emits a beam of light into the sky, while debris swirls around in the air? I think GHOSTBUSTERS and THE AVENGERS have pretty much covered that territory.As I said, the cast is great, with Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and Will Smith's Deadshot coming of best. The rest of the crew is well played by Jay Hernandez as Diablo, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Karen Fukahara as Katana, Carla Delavigne as The Enchantress, while Joel Kinnaman is Rick Flagg, the hard case in charge of the Squad. The real draw is finally seeing Harley Quinn brought to life on the screen, and in Margot Robbie they couldn't have made a better choice, this is a star making performance. How good is Jared Leto as The Joker, to me it is a far different take than Jack Nicholson's evil clown or Heath Ledger's canny psycho; Leto brings a real sexual element to the villain as he clearly is in lust with Harley as much as he is in love with her. Whose Joker is best? Let the argument begin; let's just say they have to bring Leto and Robbie back and let them square off against the Big Bat in Gotham.For that matter, who made the best Amanda Waller? Davis is great, but I liked Pam Greir's version from SMALLVILLE a few years back.As for Batman, he does make a cameo, reminding us that Ben Affleck was one of the best things about BATMANVSUPERMAN; and I was intrigued by the brief appearance of Ezra Miller's The Flash. The DC movie universe still had a long way to go before it catches up with Marvel, but SUICIDE SQUAD is a step forward, not the giant leap we hoped it would be. There is a mid credits scene that gives me hope for JUSTICE LEAGUE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with the critics??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the few times where I'm just baffled at the reaction of the critics. Apparently Suicide Squad is getting mostly negative reviews, and having seen the movie in theater today, I still have no idea why many people seemingly dislike it.Right off the bat, this movie thankfully ditches that horrible overused "dark and grim" atmosphere that has plagued action and superhero movies ever since the first Dark Knight movie was released. Don't get me wrong; the Nolan Batman movies are great, and I love them in their own way, but they helped popularize this "dark and grim" tone that honestly I'm completely sick of seeing. This tone was also one of the factors that ruined Man of Steel for me, especially because it felt so out of place there. With Batman, you could argue that his character suits the dark atmosphere. With Superman however, the character is about hope and belonging and the tone of the movie needs to suit this.When the movie started, I was immediately surprised by the colourful opening cinematic. Colours... Actual colours! This doesn't mean that the movie is an all-out goof-fest like the Joel Schumacher Batman films though, but it's self-aware and it knows what it is. It's a comic-book adaption, and there is an obvious limit to how serious the audience can take this. That being said; the jokes are subtle enough to be noticed, but don't get in the way of the story. Whereas in something like Marvel's Thor movies for example, I thought the jokes were very cringe-worthy and were more distracting than funny.The acting overall is outstanding, and I don't think I can name a single actor in this flick who got on my nerves, or looked like they were not performing well. Harley Quinn stands-out, and it seems like the director knew this as well, since they do focus quite a bit on her character and her antics. The Joker is a different story... It seems like you either love or hate Jared Leto's performance, but I'm personally quite indifferent to it. It seems like he's trying to find the right balance for the character, and perhaps in a future Batman-movie he will achieve this. In Suicide Squad however, I didn't think his performance was particularly noteworthy. I will freely admit though, that this is most likely due to the previous great actors having played the Joker, so there are a lot of high expectations he has to live up to. I'm not writing him off just yet.Will Smith as Deadshot is hard to criticize for me, because it's very obvious that he's mainly just starring as himself here. He even has those typical Will Smith moments where he makes wise-cracking commentary, almost as if he's just improvising his lines on the spot. It's hard for me to criticize him, because I actually enjoy seeing him do what he does best. When I stepped out of the theater, my boyfriend and I actually caught ourselves calling Deadshot by Will Smith instead. This is by no means a bad thing though. His performance reminded me a lot of his role as Hancock, which I thought was the best part of that movie.There's a big focus on action (rightfully so), and most of it looks great. A lot of other action movies can often get kind of nauseating because of the motion-blur and the swirly CGI effects, but this was never the case in Suicide Squad. I do have to admit that the editing is a bit choppy at times. Just by the way this movie is edited, I have a feeling that there's a lot of unused footage on the editing-room's floor (or should I say hard-drive?). The choppy editing never distracts from the movie too much though.Another gripe that a lot of reviewers have is the music. Yeah, there are a handful of songs used in here (especially classic rock tunes), but they fit the tongue in cheek atmosphere and it never got to a point where I thought it was ridiculous. Of course this comes down to personal preference as well.One thing that I do agree on with the critics, is the fact that the plot gets very predictable and kind of loses the audience's interest near the end. I won't spoil any of it, but it's very cliché, which is a shame. It's an obvious and rightful criticism, but I don't feel this takes away from the great chemistry that the characters share, or the great acting performances in general. Suicide Squad trumps both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman in nearly every regard, and it's an example of how to do a comic-book adaption well. It's saddening to see a lot of critics willing to burn this movie at the stake for things that are pretty minor compared to the many things it does really well (especially for a super-hero movie).I for one hope that Suicide Squad performs well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel, which I will eagerly await. If you are a DC fan and still debating if you should see this: go watch it in theaters. I can't imagine you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all around good summer movie! Go see it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting a long time to see this, and I am glad that I finally saw the movie today. Was it worth the money, yes compared to other not so good flicks this summer, I won't mention any names.Now on to business then... Does this movie have a few problems? Sure it had a few issues, but what movie doesn't?The Bad: Some character introductions were not quite enough. Example: the Enchantress, a bit more intro/story needed. After the intros, the pacing was a bit off, choppy at times for the rest of the film. Seems the Editor was out to lunch, or the studio tied his hands. Some of the comedic one liners were not necessary at all, and a bit overdone. More action scenes with some of the lesser seen characters is needed, might have helped this movie quite a bit.The evil guys weren't evil enough, and there wasn't quite enough of the enemy to go around. We didn't really get any good backstory about the Big Bad, and where the Enchantress comes into it, and why they do what they do. I wont say any more about that, don't want to give anything away. And what's up with Slipknot? That is one character we didn't need.The Good: Margot Robbie shines as Harley Quinn in this film, and Will Smith's Deadshot is awesome as well. And Jay Hernandez as Diablo, totally Bad A$$! And Jared Leto's version of the Joker was Psychotically Off the Hook! Yes, although there are a lot of fans of Heath's Joker, and Jared does deliver a great performance IMHO, and I have seen all film incarnations of the Joker.Jai Courtney does a great job with Captain Boomerang! He had some funny moments in the film. Viola Davis, and Joel Kinnaman deliver solid performances as Amanda Waller and Rick Flag. I wouldn't want to be on the bad side of the Waller we see! She is more ruthless than the Suicide Squad. Most of the other minor characters did okay with the time allotted them.The music for this film was great, some older tunes, and newer a good mix. I also realize that this film is basically a setup for the characters for other movies that may or may not be happening. But I do hope to see more of Harley Quinn and the Joker, and Deadshot in future films. Who knows, maybe they can team up and take care of the Bat! LOLConclusion: Is it worth the time and money? Yes! Is it a solid 10 without fault? No! Is it a fun summer movie? Yes! Would I see it again? Yes! And it looks like Suicide Squad is kicking butt in the box office totals too! Don't believe me, go see Box Office Mojo!Side Note: And to all the paid critics out there, give it a rest already. Quit bashing the movie and acting like paid schills. Let people know your actual valid points of a film, whether good or bad, without your prejudices being involved. And let people form their own opinions about whether they should actually see the movie off solid intel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had a lot to do with very little time, did it do it all, nope. Was it fun, funny, in your face and exciting, yeah, the level of cajones on the characters and psycho was there. They underutilized some characters but it was due to needing to do so much so quickly. It was the disaster i expected, nothing going according to plan, middle fingers all around and margot robbie. Viola Davis as Waller, beautiful, i've never gone what a b**** and then gone, well that's Waller after all so many times so quickly. Margot, just all hail, all hail. Karen Fukuhara, i wish they would have let her loose on them in that first seen, she stood there like, you're all gonna die. That intensity, she needs way more time. Funny how the females in this one felt like they could kick the living **** out of everyone there. Jared Leto, you creeped me the hell out and it worked for me. Over all, not enough space, but this was great, I would watch it again, I walked in there with no expectations other than a movie that was meant to be a disaster, cause that's how the comics and animated movies always portrayed it. Jai Courtney, dude is funny as hell. It was wonderful, Viola Davis, you a gangsta.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most people I was sooo excited to see this movie ever since its announcement some few years ago. So, when I heard the critics reviews I became slightly concerned especially with those that rated it worse than BvS as I was one of many who thought that the film was a bit of a disaster. I'm more of a fan of Marvel than DC (please don't bash me for this!) but I appreciate a good superhero film when I see one despite the brand it belongs to and to be fair I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as much as i thought I would before the input of the critics.The characterisation in this film is brilliant. Margot Robbie as the wonderfully crazy Harley Quinn stole the show for me. All her scenes were interesting and she produced some good comedic moments as well as some great action scenes. It was fun just watching her do her thing. Will Smith was surprisingly good as Deadshot which I was a bit on the fence with when he was first announced. The rest of the cast play their roles well and the chemistry between them all is fantastic and it was fun to watch them interact with each other. Leto's joker is great from his laugh to his mannerism. I loved his and Harley's scenes together. I felt he brought justice to the role but he's not in the movie enough for me. Jay Hernandez is a treat as El Diablo and his backstory along with all the other characters backstories were well presented and one of my favourite parts of the film. The story is good but sometimes falls a bit flat, leading me to discuss some of the few minor problems with this movie..Firstly, the editing is too fast paced in some parts and is very jumpy in others. I think some scenes needed to be played out better without all the fast paced cross cutting in the action sequences and with some of the interactions between the characters. Some of it felt a bit rushed. Secondly, some of the characters are sold a little short. Slipknot and Boomerang feel a bit pointless at times and sometime you wonder what they're actually in the movie for. Finally, Jared Leto's Joker isn't in the movie enough for me. I happened to think he was a brilliant Joker and loved all of his scenes but a lot of what we, as an audience, were sold with his scenes in the trailers were not in the final cut of the film. Hopefully we see a lot more of him in the future.Despite the few flaws, this is a fun and very enjoyable film. A real enjoyable ride. If you go into the film with an open mind I think you'll enjoy it as I did, and this is coming from a MARVEL fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Comic Book Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never shying away from the fact that it was a comic book movie, Suicide Squad embodies the outrageous and unrealistic atmosphere that comic books are famous for. With heavy acting power behind the characters, you'll come to love each and every one of them for their own personal quirks that make this team the comedic loose cannon shown in the trailers. I am genuinely interested to see future movies featuring these characters, specifically Jared Leto's Joker as I felt he didn't have enough scenes to make a full impact, although he still did a terrific job. Hopefully we'll see more of him in the Batman standalone film. If I had one gripe with the movie, it would be that I think the villain wasn't the best choice for the first Suicide Squad film, and it added a risky element that could've been used in later films much better. However, it didn't do much to reduce my overall happiness with this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and think it's a great watch with a couple friends or family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is directed by David Ayer and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Cara Delevingne, Viola Davis, Karen Fukuhara and Jared Leto.Following the events of Batman V Superman, a secret government agency recruits a group of extremely high-profile super-villain prisoners to execute black ops missions in exchange for clemency.First off, this was hugely superior in contrast to Batman V Superman and ultimately worked a hell of a lot better. Margot Robbie is energetic and crazy as Harley Quinn, delivering one of my favourite performances of the movie. Will Smith is awesome as Deadshot, I loved his character. We get to see a little more of his back story than others, and at times I felt I could really side with his decisions. It's great to see Smith back at his best and looking like he's having the time of his life. Hernandez, Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Courtney and Davis were all casted well and gave us realistic performances throughout. Fukuhara takes her first movie role in style with a kick-ass persona and tightly choreographed action sequences. Delevingne was fairly average as Enchantress, often being great and other times not so much. However, she is still new to the acting world, and therefore needs time to settle. Overall, she was a beautiful and interesting character. Jared Leto's take on the Joker is very different to what we've seen before, and one of the most anticipated portrayals this year. Leto settles into the role brilliantly with his bright green hair and broken teeth, giving his unique take on the famous character. Although I enjoyed his scenes, he simply didn't get enough screen time to allow me to fully judge his portrayal. I can't comment on his story or overall characteristics other than the fact that he's a hard thinker and at times unpredictable. I look forward to seeing him in a bigger role, either in Harley's solo movie, or somewhere else in the DC universe. All of these characters have great chemistry with each other and share some genuinely touching moments, most notably Deadshot and Harley Quinn.The visuals are vibrant and eye-popping, especially during the introduction to the characters within the first 20 minutes. Ayer has taken this movie in a direction I wasn't quite expecting, but it was a really cool direction. The writing felt very consistent throughout, and although some of the characters failed to grab my attention, it seemed a lot more grounded than BvS was.The story was handled almost perfectly, I loved that the characters were introduced quickly and there wasn't a reliable origin story to fall back on whenever you needed to feel for a character. There were simply a few scenes tied together that essentially did the same thing an origin would have, but in less time. The pacing is constantly fast and rarely halts for a breath, which is exactly what you need with a movie such as this. The only thing I didn't really like was the main antagonist, which I won't spoil for you, but it felt a little overkill for me. However, with characters such as these facing the threat, it didn't really take away from the entertainment. Steven Price pairs up with Ayer again with another intricate and dramatic score that feeds through the story suitably well. In between this, you have a collection of tracks that are attached to certain key moments, mostly the introductory sequence at the beginning, which feels like it was greatly inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy. There's a moment where 'Spirit in the Sky' is used and this took me out of the experience for a moment, as I'm used to hearing that in Guardians. But apart from that, the soundtrack and score are really nicely weaved into this story and it serves as one of the most memorable things about the movie.Overall, I'm very pleased with how all this turned out. I could wish for more Joker screen time, but that was never majorly promoted, so why dwell on something so little? I think everyone involved has done a wonderful job bringing the world back to life after the disappointing BvS a few months ago.My verdict; Suicide Squad is one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years and David Ayer has delivered a truly unique experience for all to see. Highlighting Will Smith and Margot Robbie's performances, this is an awesome, fun and colourful look into some of the best characters in the DC universe.Suicide Squad, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***First off, Suicide Squad is not a mess. It was well-designed, from the introduction of all the characters to a climactic face-off. Of course it lacks the same kind of logical realism that all Marvel movies lack - the better to create a spectacular illusion. I've seen all of the Marvel stuff and this really is just as good. Will Smith makes a great Deadshot, Margot Robbie is cast perfectly as Harley Quinn, Croc's growling is a tad over-done but still an enjoyable character, El Diablo is bad-ass, and I even liked Leto's Joker. The cheesiest character in the flick is most definitely Delevigne's Enchantress, because her powers simply come from the kind of completely unrealistic fairy tale magic found in Harry Potter and the likes. But hey, it's just a movie, disbelief is suspended and anything is possible for a moment. I really enjoyed watching this on the big screen, it was a joyride; I don't understand why this is getting bashed so badly. Take the ride, see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PROS:background songs are well selected, actors are very good although some are no so famous, good theme music and sound engineering, very good video tricks. the scenes related to the joker are highly artistic, colourful, creative and inspiring, this part alone is worth the ticket. CONS:weak or almost no story and has a lot of discrepancies, and does not make sense in a few scenes. A few characters are redundant, whether they exist or removed from movie it will have ZERO effect on the movie. movie time can be cut a lot lot shorter, so you expect many scenes are made up and do not add anything to the story. Verdict:If were a shallow person looking for empty entertainment, this one is what you should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand all the harsh reviews! If you want to analyze the the movie itself (plots, character development, etc.), its not a great movie. However, the performances of the actors bringing these characters to life are amazing. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandez stand out. They all do an amazing job, and all killed their roles. Joel Kinnaman was good as well. I honestly can't rate Jared Leto's Joker performance. He definitely made the character his own, his portrayal is definitely different, and he was good, but you really don't get to see enough of him. The real problem with this movie is there is simply too much going on. The problem translates from DC itself, as it tries desperately to catch up/beat Marvel. Marvel built up their universe for years, developing their characters thoroughly before doing a team-up movie. DC simply jumped the gun on this one. It can't develop their numerous characters enough in only 2 hours. That being said, I honestly cannot wait to see a Batman/Deadshot or Batman/Joker movie. I think those two villains will be great in the DCEU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's suicide to waste your money on this overly hyped production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/Writer David Ayer's (Fury - 2014) takes his turn at yet another DC comic-book to film project. With the less than successful track record of this genre of films, one can only ponder why Hollywood keeps making them. Regardless, Ayer's cast a bevy of Hollywood personalities (Will Smith, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, Common, Jay Hernandez, Adele Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Margot Robbie and Robin Atkin Downes), all with their own corny DC comic-book names, to destroy a super entity that is in search of its heart - really? The only thing missing from this possibly plausible fantasy film is Spiderman swooping in to the rescue. Note: Batman is present in more ways than one. While the main characters are given a timestaking introduction of their vicious deeds to establish their greed, when gathered together they end up being nothing more than a bunch of semi-polite con- artists caught between a rock and a hard place, or in this case caught between guns and a killer cellphone App. Unfortunately, their is no need here to highlight who is the most exciting villain, because they are all equally boring, over acted, or just down right not interesting. Not helping matters is Ayer's dialogue, that comes across as nothing more than a bunch of one liners tied together to make plot. The special and visual effects are nothing new, and sometime the cinematography is too fake (look for the scene where the camera is behind a solider looking down on the city in the helicopter, or when Harley Quinn is making her escape, I could go on!). While "Suicide Squad" is a DC comic stable (so I heard), the excessive use of guns and violence in the film is far from child proof. It's suicide to waste your money on this overly hyped production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie and I went in the theater with low expectations, having heard it was not that good...There is no spoiler to be spoiled because the story is thinner than air. There is nothing to talk about on the story.To me, the worst part is the armature skills on the editing. There are just too many shots that felt out of place or down right confusing. They can't even handle a lot of the action sequences correctly. I have heard they went back to re-shoot for some scenes already but I am saying the re-shoot didn't really saved the movie.All in all a bad experience and I can't really remember the last time I felt bored 1/2 way thru.It is very unfortunate for the cast. They seemed trying hard to do a decent job. At the end they will suffer in their own careers because of this bad production.Katana's Japanese is also pretty bad. She didn't speak it well enough to cut it as a native speaker.David Ayer is sooooo fired. I won't watch any movie directed by him. Thanks but no thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senseless fun &amp; entertainment with all of its rebellious action sequences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the whimsical world and the flamboyant images mixed with the actual dour tone and the sense of fear coming right through you, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. But there's one person who mesmerized me and told me to stay put, it's no other than Joker only goddess lover, Harley Quinn who was played by the famous Margot Robbie. I love her all the way, even my first thought to play Harley would be Emma Roberts, due to her bitchiness in every movie she's acted in. Margot enlightened the mood by giving every shot, the most prominent acting over all the celebrities they had in play. The childish side of Harley was apparently there too, which the only thing I hesitant about when they certainly picked Margot. No need to say more, again she did it! Nevertheless, between all the scenes she had on screen, which was almost in every part of the movie, the most perfect moment in my opinion was when Amanda emphatically asked Deadshot to shoot her after Joker has taken her alive while tangling around the rope joyfully saying goodbye, Deadshot intentionally missed the shot and Harley was playing dead. After a few secs, she swirled around and gestured, 'Ta-da!'. Oh my, I want to marry her now. No kidding, please!Joker was the latter choice who stole the show last night. Unlike Heath Ledger's Joker who was extremely creepy and quiet, this new Joker was boisterous and fresh, giving audiences extra flavor to it. The best part about Jared Leto's performance as the new Joker would be the mischievous giggling. I don't know how he fortified his technique, but he managed to enhance the scariness in his mere giggling despite his 20 minutes screen time (He got cut, plenty of scenes, maybe to attract people to buy the extended edition in six months from now?).Will Smith was good as Deadshot, it's just that the way he talked reminded me of his past movies. I love Jai Courtney as Boomerang! Many have I talked to claim that he didn't deserve any recognition in the latest Terminator, but I guess he has proved it wrong this time. His character as jinx and bogan attitudes who liked to drink lots and lots of booze suit his acting well. The new girl who held the role as Katana should give a standing ovation. If not mistaken, this was her first acting in Hollywood. Joel Kinnaman played Rick Flag as the daddy of them all, he's like the more aggressive robocop this time, and the only person that he really had a faith of trust was Katana. Killer Croc was scary, El Diablo stole the show when his hands were on fire but was bland, a man with chained-pyro abilities but afraid to use his power seemed kinda irritating at times. Enchantress, the ancient witch with a malicious spirit would scare some pants off and Amanda Waller occasionally forgot to take her meds (Watch the movie). Slipknot was the least good, he could only play with ropes and I didn't even know why he was there in the first place! Batman was on screen for 4 and a half mins total whereas Flash was in a hurry, 5 seconds estimation. The talented Scoot Eastwood was apparently just a soldier. The computer-generated imagery was stunningly designed, just like the purple Lamborghini (C'mon Pudding, do it!). While all of this worked, they deliberately put an unforgivable plot. Most of the critics said was right, it's just too weak and unpolished. It put too many clichéd sci-fi in there, as a cinephile, I felt totally disappointed with it. No wonder most of the critics gave this movie rotten tomatoes. The action scenes began 10 minutes after they trekked into the city. I thought they saved it for the cool fight scenes, but I guess that also was intolerable as I was hoping more of 'em. But when there's Harley, there's action. The stunt was great, it's just that the pacing that wasn't. It's here and there, sometimes shaky even when it's supposed to be statically rigid. The non-stop soundtrack kinda stored most of the time, but a few of them were misplaced. The mid-credits gave a cliff hanger to the upcoming Justice League, a somber Bruce Wayne having an official chat with Amanda Waller.The ubiquitous posters seem to give attention to people, don't forget the trailers too. But the plot immensely failed to give people justice. The demanded DC/WB companies, 'We're a big family, PG-13's would be the best for every movie in DC Universe.' was just unbearable, leading to many people aggravated and infuriated including me as it should have been rated-R (18 and above). In that way, David Ayer (director) would just do some of his clever stunts, due to his other movies that were rated-R. It would promise gory, bloody violence, grisly images, pervasive language and strong crude content as well as disturbing behavior.The production of the film seems rushed with the questionable editing. As a whole, 7 minutes was cut proving from the initial 2 hours 10 minutes told by many reliable sources (IMdB, Wikipedia) but then was permanently said to be 2 hours 3 minutes. Even a few parts in the trailers failed to give extra trivial to the story such as the teaser trailer, when Harley Quinn offered the sentence, 'I hope we got insurance!' or when she's pointing horizontally her 'Good Night' tattooed baseball bat and mouthed her voice with the sound of a loading (Schuck-Schuck) shotgun or the play in the first official trailer when they were in the deserted bar and Harley said, 'I love this guy!'. There were so much of Harley and Joker's cut that shouldn't be done as it'd ruin the movie with the already weak plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be careful Reading Reviews From Non Comic Book Readers. Suicide Squad Is a Prime Example!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like with so many Superhero setting movies, I've noticed that there is a fair amount of supposed critics that rate these movies knowing nothing about the comic origins, including some of the canons of these great Characters. I wish these same critics would stop rating Superhero movies because they are giving it an unfair review with their murky at best knowledge (and I'm sure not all fall in this bracket but a fair amount do). I'd rather listen to comic reader's points of view when it comes to Superheroes and Supervillains coming to the big screen. That been said I'm not saying if you don't read comics and graphic novels not to go see these movies, all I'm trying to relay is if your reading reviews, try to focus from people who know these worlds and these characters over people who review almost everything just for the sake of conforming with current movie trends.And onto my quick burst review: As a comic reader myself I've decided to separate the Characters in the Suicide Squad from 'A' rated Superheroes/ Supervillains. You've got to remember that the characters in Suicide Squad are 'B' rated Characters (sometimes even 'C' rated). If you could do that then you will enjoy the movie more. For me it was a terrific ride full of action, a bit of comedy, and with a decent Character background story.The scenery was dark yet luminous which was perfect for this type of movie. All the actors and actresses played their parts quite nicely. From Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) to Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), and El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez). The Enchantress/Witch was supposed to be creepy and mysterious and Cara Delevingne delivered just that! And best of all were Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. You feel for Deadshot because you see what makes him tick and his background story bridges a bit of emotion with captivating intrigue. When it came to Harley Quinn, I didn't see how the Suicide Squad team could have valued anything from Harley Quinn's abilities (but of course they found a way to mix her in with the team). This I base on the type of mission the cast was given to undergo in this movie (I don't want to give any spoilers so you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean). That been said how Margot Robbie portrayed Harley Quinn as the actual standalone Character was done close to perfection! And as a Harley Quinn fan that was good enough for me!I found myself with conflicting viewpoints with Jarod Leto's rendition of the Joker. It almost felt like he tried to mimic and/or add Heath Ledger's Jokers antics into his Joker - for me a tattoo punk/gangster looking Joker to use those Characteristics (if that was the case) didn't really work for me. I can't really say that he was a poor adaptation of the Joker either, but I will say there was a lot of room for improvement - in correlation to the style and type of this Joker they tried to portray in this flick.Final verdict: As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the key point here is if you can recognize that these zany misfits called the Suicide Squad are not classified as 'A' list status Superheroes and should not be compared to them, then it's quite probable that you will enjoy this film, and to be fair that's how this movie should be looked at/reviewed. Would I recommend this movie? Yes I would, especially if you go into the movie not expecting empyrean like Superhero statuses. And finally, I would like to stress that if they decide to develop another installment of Suicide Squad that it really should be an R- rated film. Then it would truly be Suicide Squad personified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Hero Version of The Dirty Dozen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Suicide Squad", starring Will Smith-Focus, the Bad Boys movies, and #3 is coming in 2017 &amp; #4 in 2019; Margot Robbie-The Legend of Tarzan, Focus; Viola Davis-How to Get Away With Murder_tv, Madea Goes to Jail; Cara Delevingne-Paper Towns, Anna Karenina and Jared Leto-Dallas Buyers Club, Fight Club.This is based on a comic book but one that is not as well known as say, Batman or Superman. At least it used to be but it has gotten popular again in the last few years due to Harley Quinn-in fact, the comics just came out this week with a brand new first issue in a new series. For those unfamiliar with the books, a secret government agency uses incarcerated super villains on black ops missions in exchange for reduced time on their prison sentences. Think of it as a super hero version of the Dirty Dozen. Viola plays the government boss known as Amanda Waller. The Suicide Squad is also known as Task Force X. Super humans are called meta-humans and the basic idea is to use meta-humans to fight other meta-humans. Will plays Deadshot, an assassin who never misses a shot, hence his name. Margot plays Harley Quinn, former psychiatrist to inmates that became the Joker's girlfriend. Cara plays the Enchantress, a magical witch and Jared is the Joker. Cara &amp; Jared are not really members of the team; Cara is a failed recruit that goes bad and becomes the main bad guy the Squad has to try to stop and Jared spends most of his time trying to rescue Margot from the clutches of the trying-to-be-good team. You may wonder how Viola can keep the villains in check, why don't they just make a break for it on a mission. Well, Viola has planted tiny-but powerful-explosives in their brains, and yes, one of the team members finds out that she is not bluffing when his brains are scattered all over the pavement. There are two DC heroes that have cameos; one that you probably saw in the trailers and the other is a future JLA member that was glimpsed in the earlier Batman vs Superman movie. They used some classic rock songs in the soundtrack. I remember hearing songs by Norman Greenbaum, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Queen and Black Sabbath. As the end credits start, there is a scene that is a direct set up for the future JLA movie but nothing is at the very end. It's rated "PG-13" for violence, action, disturbing behavior and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 3 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

It doesn't take itself too seriously and while there are a few pacing issues that crop up, the story line is simple and was easy enough for me to follow. The acting is fine, and there are some great lines; The chemistry between the squad was amazing. It's worth it to see on the big screen for the action scenes (of which there are many). It was witty, cool, and even heart touching. I mean sure, the whole idea is sorta over the top, but man is it a fun summer movie.Ignore the critics on this one; even with some flaws, it's worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Mess Unfortunately (Contains Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who leans towards DC over Marvel I was extremely disappointed with what I just witnessed a couple of hours ago. A complete mess which ruins the spirit of the comics in my view. Will Smith is the lead. The latter says it all right there. Not good. Now I can see why Tom Hardy dropped out (few of us buy the scheduling conflicts excuse after Smiths role grew). So what we have here is a squad of supposed super villains who are anything but. B and C list actors playing villains nobody would really care about outside of Quinn and Joker who is not even in the squad (sorry guys). A couple supposedly bad ass sociopaths are crying in the film and are all about helping each other and smiling. Are you serious? That felt more Marvel there. Still, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is the only real redeemable thing about the film in my view. Leto's joker is not as terrible as one is lead to believe, but not very good either with what he's given to do. Take off the grills and ridiculous tattoos and a voice that doesn't seem to imitate Ledger at times and you have a pretty decent Joker. I went in thinking Quinn would steal the movie and to some she might. I found her annoying and over the top which on one hand makes sense, but also her ever changing accents (extremely painful to hear I might add) and mad skills fighting wise does not add up. The critical reviews are legit. I went in with no true opinion and left wanting my money back. If you are not in the 10-14 year old range I can't imagine you liking this, but then again I've seen weirder things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not just bad, it's absolutely terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start with something this bad? Honestly, what a crushing disappointment.When developing a story about the bad guys being the "heroes" why do it this way? This clearly isn't a very logical story so the best approach is to make it interesting and somewhat believable. That was non- existent.I honestly forgave the minimal character development because I thought the snippets of each person's background worked well enough. I also figured that the story would have told us more about each character's history, but that was also non-existent.As the filth before my eyes progressed on screen, I thought of ways that could have made the characters a bit more identifiable and the story a bit more interesting.First and foremost, remove the cut and dry approach and give the characters some life. Rather than dedicating two minutes or so to each character, show us how they were operating in their day to day affairs. Don't make some quick, cut montage that shows them captured and in prison. No one can identify with that and the audience has zero opportunities to attach themselves to anything and invest themselves in the story. Second, give the film a story. It's almost like Viola Davis' character walks into the office and says, "Ah suh dude, we're going to start putting the bad guys in charge of our government." Wait, what?! PRESENT THE CONCEPT TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. HAVE IT TURNED DOWN FOR A LOT OF PLAUSIBLE REASONS. DO SOMETHING TO THE STORY TO MAKE THEM THE LAST AVAILABLE OPTION. PUT THEM TO THE TEST.The film is literally the entire trailer. There is no purpose to it.The Joker is the most underdeveloped character of this film. Deadshot (I hate Will Smith but he steals the show) and Harley Quinn are the two highlights. Couldn't they have made Killer Croc mute so that every time he opened his mouth sewer trash wouldn't come spewing out?Why did they add that Native American criminal featured in the promotional material for a whopping one minute of screen time before killing him off?Why did Joel Kinnaman use the corniest southern accent possible?AND THOSE VILLAINS? I'm pretty sure ELECTRO FROM THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 (LOL) WAS BETTER THAN THESE VILLAINS. I LITERALLY burst out laughing when they showed doing some weird little voodoo dance to try to manipulate each character. SERIOUSLY WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE EDITING? THE CGI WAS SO BAD WITH THE VILLAIN.Instead of idiot fanboys petitioning for Rotten Tomatoes to be shut down, these people should be petitioning for David Ayer (who has made nothing worth mentioning) to never make a film again. The DCEU is in real trouble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this actually is the worst movie all year long.The introduction was horrific in that made 0 sense in the set up. I felt like the style that DC went with was close to Batman Forever when they went neon crazy.Only a few of the characters were done well, the rest were atrocious to the names they played. I don't blame the actors/actresses but the director and whoever wrote this movie. I am not sure how the actors weren't outraged by how complied the movie and left out (I am hoping left out) very important details about the story/characters.Random scenes will happen through out this movie that leave you in a confused state as to which why they were placed there. Other scenes in the movie cut out something that was crucial to the plot. Marvel does 1 thing well and that is the humor in the movies. DC almost completely left out humor. Most of the humor you already saw in the trailer and when you see it, its not that funny anymore. If you are a comic book reader or avid DC fan, you will not enjoy this movie. If you have no idea what is going on then you will most likely just see missed scenes and confusion.Deadshot, Joker, Harley Quinn really made this movie and truth be told...They needed more joker.</fullReview>

Having them in a squad is pointless with no relationship development and if you're going to make us sit for over two hours then you should have more than a tiny unsatisfying story arc. I can count the amount of actual scenes on one finger. Five minutes of development makes the conclusion of this movie was frustrating. Without us caring at all about these characters and their relationships why would we care about a conclusion. This easily fits into my worst movies ever made list.

		<fullReview>"Watchmen" was a respectable film adaptation of perhaps the greatest comic book and along with "Kick Ass" made the first moves towards a more adult orientated adaptation of a comic book. The first "Iron Man" movie (the horrible simpering Gwyneth Paltrow aside) was a terrific comic book adaptation that along with "Guardians of the Galaxy" showed just how much undiluted fun comic book films could be. Then "Deadpool" ramped up everyone's expectations of what could be delivered in a comic book adaptation. "Suicide Squad", if delivered properly, could have been the next step in liberating comic book adaptations from the world of cliché and the low expectations of the lowest common denominator consumer market. But sadly the film is a badly scripted and pedestrianly directed failure.What should have been a surrealistic kaleidoscope of chaotic, sexy violence is reduced to a tedious "buddy cop" type movie bonding between the characters of Flagg and Deadshot. Meanwhile the only real successes of the film, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Jared Leto's "Joker", are reduced to occasional side show carnival acts. Harley objectified and only justified psychologically as the Joker's lesser half which denies much of the complexity of the original character. The opportunities for caustic comedy dialogue are missed at almost every turn by the witless script which shows no respect for the intelligence of the audience or craftsmanship in its execution.Unimaginative direction reduces the film to head shot reactions of the various squad members and very obviously staged medium shot soap opera action scenes ? there's certainly nothing here to match the violent poetry and brilliant editing of the opening bridge scene in "Deadpool". The scene where "Deadshot" single-handedly and with lethal precision takes out the horde of rather uninspired pimple creatures could have been jaw dropping but in the hands of Ayer is reduced to formulaic blandly edited mediocrity.The basic structure of the film falls into two halves. The first is the inevitable and drawn out series of montages describing the origins of the Squad members. Not very well assembled and here, as throughout the film, the makers fail to make a clear decision on how to assign time to the various team members. We then we move into the second half with the core narrative during which the squad take on the character of The Enchantress and her Brother. The motivations and reasoning behind this conflict are muddled and there is no tension because we do not know properly what threat the "enemy" represent. There is no philosophical or ideological differences between the combatants so it's all just a performing puppet show staged between people we don't care about and there is no explanation as to why someone who has existed for 4,000+ years suddenly decides to act at this precise moment. As the film then plods along to it's inevitable conclusion we are reduced to something that closely approximates a poor copy of the original "Ghostbusters" movie, swirling tacky pyro-techniques above a tall building and a pay off of the "love interest" Cara Delevigne, pretty underwhelming in her central performance I'm afraid, being discovered, just like Sigourney Weaver in "Ghostbusters", inside the crust of a dead creature.I feel very sorry for Margot Robbie and Jared Leto because clearly they both tried their best to invest their characters with the inhabited personality and conviction that they need to bring Harley Quinn and the Joker to life but they may as well have been in another movie to the lumpen action tedium surrounding them. The scene showing Harley's fantasy ideal as being the life of a little housewife locked away in her own kitchen with a couple of kids shows the essentially reactionary nature of this movie, and is consistent with the largely negative representation of women in the rest of Ayer's output. Thus we are asked to believe that someone who started out as an intelligent medical professional, challenged by the idea of chaos and who was drawn to the complexities of the Joker's personality and who then transforms into a sexy super killing machine really only longs for bland domesticity?There are so many plot, motivation and character holes in the film that it comes across as being made up as it goes along. For example the head of the project Amanda Walker, played by Viola Davis in a thankless role, engages in many ruthless acts throughout the film such as cold heartedly shooting and killing her own FBI agents but then for no real reason allows Deadshot time off to visit his daughter - which bizarrely morphs into being yet another tedious bonding moment between Flagg and Deadshot rather than between Deadshot and his daughter!The box office may be the end that justifies the means for the clowns in suits who clearly felt this was adequate for public consumption but I'm afraid I don't like to be treated as if I'm stupid and I hate "by the numbers" consumer film making so I won't be returning for another episode of "Suicide Squad" unless the studio execs consign Mr Ayer back to the dumb macho movies that his CV is best suited to and then plead with the team behind "Deadpool" to get involved. But then whilst the cinema going public are all wasting their money on a lazily put together mess like this why would Warner Brothers bother to try and make an interesting, thought provoking quality film? Keep the masses sedated like the inmates of Arkham Asylum!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The government and Bad Guys team up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I might give this movie SOME points but I have to go lower to average out the 10/10 super fake reviews.The government scum, team up with the bad guys who aren't part of the government, so instantly I do not care what happens to either of them. Will Smith tries to act ghetto and runs his mouth. Harley Quinn is a crazy stripper who kills the pod people with a bat that somehow the automatic weapons cannot hit. The pod people are the generic and lazy attempt at working in some action before the ending.Jared Leto is SO bad as the joker, I mean give that guy a personality or something. He's only in the movie for a bit but he's such a bad replacement for Heath Ledger.All the others are really boring. They are supposedly the best of the worst. But they aren't interesting, they are not people forced into crime but people who really do kill and hurt average people for no reason. There's a generic "I do whatever the government wants me to do" soldier, who leads them but I couldn't care if he died or not either.And I KNEW that the generic "this guy can climb anything" guy was going to die as an example. I mean talk about a pathetic ability lol. This sort of soulless movie is classic corporate garbage pushing an amoral view of the world and hero-izing gangsters. The dialogue could have been written in a day and a day for rewrites, its so GENERIC. Don't pay to watch this movie PLEASE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Suicide Squad carries on from its trailers are the strong array of cast members and a delightfully bombastic soundtrack. If only they could spend half as much effort directing as they do on the marketing.As Suicide Squad began, I soon realised that the target audience are those with the mindset of a goldfish with attention deficit disorder, although this does help us part ways with the cringeworthy aspects of the film.The lively performances in Suicide Squad are what primarily save it from falling into the same bloated cesspool as Batman v Superman. Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, and Will Smith, all live up to my high expectations, although I was most surprised with Jai Courtney's performance, as he was able to act beyond the emotional range of wet dish cloth.I'm neither a comic fanatic or a teenager, so obviously this film isn't for me. However, seeing as DC are desperately trying to compete with Marvel, you would think that a good film with a broad appeal wouldn't be too much to ask for.Despite my criticisms, this is not the worst superhero film ever. However, if you have not been drafted into seeing this one with your friends, there are at least a dozen other DC films that are more worthy of your time.Your swiftly diminished expectations for Suicide Squad aren't going to kill you, but they just might hurt you really, really bad.I'll give this one a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was once excited to see what Mr.Ayer could do with Suicide Squad and the immense amount of talent it had on board. I was a young boy in those days and the sunset was just a bit more golden. David Ayer is a good director- which is why I was surprised at how atrocious this movie was. I don't entirely blame Mr. Ayer for this film though, as it seems the editors were in a competition to see how many scenes they could cut out. Not a single scene in this film flows into another. All the scenes are slapped next to each other seemingly without any thought. The pacing is completely off in this movie as well. The first act is a half hour introductory sequence that only half develops three of the seven main characters, and the next hour and and a half is a messy action sequence in a city at night. Dead shot and Harley Quinn are pretty much the only two characters in this movie that are interesting- all the other characters are either undeveloped, unsympathetic, or only have 4 lines of dialogue. Leto's Joker is barely in this film, and that is a good thing. The worst joker portrayal I have seen in film or television. A cringe worthy effort in a terrible film. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

This was some of the worst movies I have ever saw really. I was most annoyed because they tried to make some poor comedy between actions scenes. I can say that I only liked acting of Jared Leto.Please don't ever make this kind of movies anymore. This was only time I left cineplexx ever in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply too many characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is DC comics counterpart to Marvel universe. Unfortunately bad one. Movie tries to bring record amount of meta humans to one movie and that is it's biggest problem. There are simply too many characters to one movie. It has no time enough to concentrate any of it characters enough Even movie have great rock classics from Queen to Black Sabbath on it's soundtrack won' make any difference. Too much is simply too much. Best part of the movie are Jared Leto's Joker and his girlfriend Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). You almost hope that hole movie were focused on these two characters instead of what it tries to do. Suicide Squad also attempt to make DC comics movies darker and more violent movies than Marvel movies are. By doing that they ignorance bigger audience to close out of the audience younger peoples who normally are bigger audience for comic book too. Only Deadpool has succeed on that, but it was clearly targeted to more mature audience than this one. 3D on the movie feels just vain. They don't use it in any camera or cinematic effects at all. It just feels that they wanted to get that 3D added to movies name. If DC comics tries to compete to Marvel movies in any measures in the future they should focus more on story and characters than try to make their movie unnecessary noisy and violent. Suicide Squad is, unfortunately one of the worst comic book movies ever. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All that hype for such little delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was advertised as being the next big DC film. Unfortunately, it wasn't good. The editing was jarring, the music choices were inappropriate for the scenes (and it also was just playing back some of the most overplayed classic rock songs you hear every day on the radio), the acting was poor aside from Margot Robbie, and really the whole picture just felt like it was shot on a studio lot as a low budget movie. Unfortunately, the film falls flat in every area. Batman gets about 1 minute of screen time and Joker gets maybe 5. The trailers really misrepresented what the film was going to be and leaves you wishing you had spent your money on something else. For those who didn't like Batman vs. Superman, this movie is far worse. It's down there next to "Batman and Robin"... you know, the one with Mr. Freeze and all the horrible puns?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to love this movie so much, especially after watching the trailer that had Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. That was the best trailer I've seen in a long time. Which is why this movie was such a disappointment. How did this movie get a rating of 6.9? Everyone that voted high for this movie is insulting other movies that actually deserves a good rating. This movie reminded me of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. At least some people were fooled for awhile till some time passed for them to realize it was a mistake.Gave this two stars... one because I like Margot Robbie and two for the effort of trying to making a good DC movie, even though they failed miserably.Come on DC, you need to catch up to Marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh, what a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, as you may have already heard, this movie has gone through various edits and attempted reshoots which ultimately had left this movie an incoherent and jumbled mess. I was disappointed, but even then I had very low expectations going into this film. If you wanted to see this movie because of the Joker I'm sad to say he has ultimately no impact on the plot and we mostly see him through flash backs - and even then Leto's characterisation of the 'sinister' Joker was a flatline and oftentimes even came across as trying too hard or being cringy. The Joker, along with most other characters have no clear identity or sufficient back-story, and the entire premise of the film is very, very questionable - if this "Suicide Squad" is meant to combat threats the scale of Superman and Superman- like beings, why would you use Harley Quinn? What on earth can she do that a Marine with basic training couldn't? Or Dead Shot? What use is an assassin when bullets are useless against these alien threats? Or the Australian? Why on earth would you want an immoral, drunken bank robber who's only schstick is a boomerang knife?This movie has many flaws and lapses in logic and clear concise story telling and desperately wants to come across as funny and light hearted when it is clear watching the footage that it was not the original intention. Compared with a comic book movie of a similar nature - Guardians of the Galaxy - Suicide Squad is incoherent, confusing, and poorly edited. It will leave you wondering "why?" about many moments and frustrated that a movie with such potential to be good is simply not. The only award this movie deserves to get is for the trailer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The summer movie season has hedged it's bets on Suicide Squad as being the biggest, baddest film of them all. If ever there was a perfect formula for a summer hit, this was the one. A gritty DC movie, with Margot Robbie, a kick ass soundtrack, and the cinematic return of the Joker.. a character audiences have become entranced with since Heath Ledger's frightening portrayal just shy of a decade ago. It's the kind of film that generates hype and anticipation, even from a non- superhero lover as myself. Hollywood has found an angle to attract almost all audiences to this genre with films like this. I couldn't wait to see it.Suicide Squad, in reality, was an act of brilliant advertising. The film is a hot mess. The plot is entirely incoherent. More than once, I wasn't sure whether to burst out laughing, or sit in silence. I had no idea where this film was coming from. It's funny... at least when the characters want to be.. but Will Smith utters one line during the climax that almost made me fall out of my chair, and I know that wasn't the script's intention. When the film wants to be gritty, it comes across as desperate. Almost clinging to hope that they can capture the same genius as The Dark Knight. The soundtrack is fantastic, but it disappeared after the first act, perhaps they ran out of money to license it.The single worst aspect of the film was the villain, Enchantress. In a movie sold upon gritty DC misfits and the Joker, the film itself centers on a evil voodoo ghost woman thing that shimmies about and creates an army of mutant mud monsters to kill everything in sight, all the while promising the protagonists a false spell that will give them a domesticated family life that they always wanted. Now, If I told you all of this in the months prior to the release of the film, you'd call me insane. But yes, Enchantress makes up about 60% of the film, and you will be as speechless as I was watching this. At one point, I thought I was watching the sequel to Fantastic Four.But are there any positives? Yes, there are. This is far from an unwatchable film. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is a feat of casting genius. She was my favorite part. She is the best portrayal Harley Quinn since Arleen Sorkin voiced her in Batman: The Animated Series. Hilarious, sexy, spunky, badass.. It reminds you why we all love that crazy gal. Jared Leto's Joker is another thing that impressed me. He took the character in a direction that was quite new and quite familiar. To sum it up, it was a combination of Jack Nicholson's grandstanding Joker from the Tim Burton Batman, with Heath Ledger's Joker, plus a tiny hint of Mark Hamill's animated Joker. He's insanely creepy, he never breaks character (much like Ledger), and it works very well. It was a given that he would never in a million years reach the heights of Ledger, but this was a Joker that should be well appreciated for years to come. I suggest, if there ever is a live-acting Killing Joke movie, WHICH THERE TOTALLY SHOULD BE, cast Leto immediately.Other than that, Suicide Squad is a major disappointment. For what we were all expecting, and we were all expecting so much.. maybe this should've been a lesson to all of us.. just don't hype a movie. Scratch that, just don't hype a DC Cinematic Universe movie. You will always be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very little of value in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of superhero and super-villain movies in general, so I was naturally looking forward to this film. Now, I wish I had my 12.00 back. Will Smith was humanizing and wonderful, as he almost always is. Viola Davis was a bright spot in the film as well. What was most disappointing was every other thing about the movie. The script was filled with un-necessary events and even more un-necessary people. Had this been a Batman versus Deadshot film, I think this would have been excellent. But the director, screen writer, producer, and every other actor/actress on the screen got in the way of what could have been a really interesting story. Jared Leto's Joker got a lot of screen time for some reason, though he was not central to the plot and Leto's acting was not even of peripheral importance. Harley Quinn was nothing more than eye candy and practically all of her scenes were gratuitous to the point -- if there was one -- of this absolutely worthless film. This movie COULD have complicated the status of super-villain a little more, showing the complexity that exists within even the darkest of human hearts. It almost did so with Smith's Deadshot, but that was due only to Will Smith's incredible performance. As a master,he turned very few ingredients into something palatable; alas, the rest of the film disappointed sorely. I believe that Marvel Studios knows what to do with an all-star ensemble cast. The DC studios-- I think they're better off rebooting Batman every four or five years. That's what they're good at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bland movie that tries to appear otherwise by dropping great songs over it in order to camouflage its weaknesses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is not only jumbled but also full of inconsistencies, lacks originality and heavily focuses on some characters' backgrounds and inner thoughts while leaving the rest without any.There is some good acting namely from Viola Davis, Will Smith, Karen Fukuhara and Jay Hernandez, but there is also an unbalance as Margo Robbie tries too hard with Harley Quinn, often fluctuating between her voice and a Tara Strong impersonation, although her personality is right on the money. Joker on the other hand is horribly played by Jared Leto: not only is this the blandest Joker ever (a gang banger, not a gangster as some have described), Leto's Joker also tries a bit of Ledger's voice but fluctuates as well, but his personality in nowhere matches the comics - this Joker is dependendant, almost hooked on Harley, while in the comics he couldn't give a rat's ass if she dies or gets hurt. This isn't a chaotic and unpredictable maniac, but a rather common criminal that just dresses and tattoos himself as different from the norm to feel edgier. Cara Delevigne is just there as Enchantress to serve as the villain... and pretty much isn't given much to say. She must have uttered less than 15 sentences in English and like 7 or 8 in a mumbo jumbo language.Visually the movie is also a mess, particularly in the final fight where almost nothing is perceivable due to a mist effect poorly executed. The CGI was also pretty average and didn't integrate itself very well. The minions looked very bland as well and barely got any proper screen time (and are oddly missing from the final fight locale, although they were there earlier). The character characterizations are good, particularly Katana (best Katana characterization I have seen thus far) and El Diablo with the exception of Killer Croc, Joker and Harley, the last two due to an overabundant amount of useless and poorly done tattoos. Harley's outfit is also not very balanced and is very clearly based on the New 52 version (as well as 50% of her origin story, the other 50 being the classic far better version). The mallet and classic costume though were very cool... but not used other than as easter eggs.Very disappointing. DC continues to go down the drain with their 3rd movie of the Snyderverse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best part of the movie is the cast. Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and she steals the show. Will Smith as Deadshot gets close. Their characters get more screen time than the others. They havebetter and longer backstories, so there's more depth to the characters.Only character I didn't enjoy was Jared "douchebag" Letos Joker who just doesn't impress. He purrs and growls in a weird way and is not particularly menacing or intimidating. He is decent but c'mon, Joker is supposed to be so much more. Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson did it so much better.The storyline feels disjointed at parts and gives the movie a rushed feel. Biggest problem of the movie however are the antagonists that are quite boring and the third act that becomes a generic battle without any suspense. Overall Suicide Squad is not terrible, just quite mediocre. The cast is great but ultimately that is not enough as this movie should be amazing. At least the story doesn't jump around all over the place or drag along too much like Batman v Superman and it's a slightly better film than that good looking mess of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad boasts an evil minion army whose design is nifty. That's basically where the positives end. This bludgeoning anti-movie is a shockingly incompetent piece of film in the most basic senses (editing, casting, character building, coherency), who's complete disregard for storytelling in favor of barely-stylish messiness makes it play like a 2+ hour trailer. A garbage pile of frightful colors, unpleasant sexism, angry violence and desperately unfunny humor, Suicide Squad is the perfect embodiment of the axiom that there is nothing less cool than desperately trying to be cool. In case I'm not being clear enough, Suicide Squad is bad. Like, really bad. Like, Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern bad, only much worse. The writing and editing are unbelievably inept, with simple concepts like character motivation and story logic nowhere near the proceedings. Harley Quinn, the deranged love interest of an Insane Clown Posse reject (aka The Joker), and Deadshot, a constantly flip-flopping moralist who never follows any sort of personal rules, lead a team of big-dumb-villains to stop (yet another) big blue beam of light from destroying Earth. They are all evil (unless they aren't because?reasons), until ham-fisted and half-hearted moralizing hits them in a multitude of unearned fashions. Snyder and the whole team at DC / Warner Bros. headquarters really need to be stopped. Where Marvel seems to care about their fans, DC seems to almost disdain theirs with their sloppy excuses for movies. Any hope that director Ayer (Fury) would breathe some fresh style into this universe is gone, with Snyder clearly still driving the bus with his hodge-podge of uselessly indulgent visuals. Here's hoping Affleck can right this mind-numbing superhero series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With BvS I thought that the Dc Universe is set off to blast the superhero genre with some mind blowing movies but instead they end up making what can only be called as a fan's worst nightmare.Suicide squad is one of those movies ,where you think what the hell did i waste my money on.Jared Leto and Joker the two best things Hollywood can offer at the same time and they couldn't make him a proper sidekick let alone the main villain or should i say a hero as is the case with the other characters.Basically Dc just blew the character of Batman with Dawn of Justice and did the same with Joker's character in suicide squad.The movie lacks any convincement ,it lacks the faith and believe as to why the characters should be together.At a moment,everyone hates everyone suddenly everyone loves everyone without any reason or emotion attached.At one point the Witch's army is the best and at the same time it takes just a few punches to knock its soldiers out.The only thing that helped me to get through this two hours of torture was the music and soundtrack of the movie and "Harley Quinn" played by Margot Robbie who is the only person in the movie that does the justice to the character</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed film with characters that work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the wreck that was Batman v Superman happened I was rather extremely hopeful on this movie, and it was the one film I was anticipating more than Batman v Superman. I have always adored the Harley Quinn character and what Bruce Timm and Paul Dini did with her. I am also a huge Deadshot and while I didn't think Will Smith was the best choice for Deadshot I was still intrigued with what the actor could bring to the table. And then Batman v Superman came out and it was a huge disappointment and tampered my anticipation for Suicide Squad. Also the fact that in the marketing they were pushing all the musical cues my way also hurt my anticipation for the film overall. But with all the my hopes and dreams being dashed by a rocky start for DC and a bunch of trailers feeling more like music videos than actual trailers I did come out of this film liking it quite a lot. Now from top to bottom this movie is cliché. We get a really boring villain that you have seen in every Marvel film and you have a team of characters having to stop this villain from destroying the world. That piece of the movie is very standard and something we have seen being done over and over again endlessly. However this film makes up for those clichés with its characters that are really all quite something to fall in love with. Rather its Killer Croc's one liners, Deadshot's love for his daughter, Harley Quinn's love for the Joker, and the Joker's overall insanity everyone has something interesting to add to this film. This makes the film a lot more fun and a lot more easier to get through. The comedy is great as I found myself laughing a lot throughout my first screening of the film and it all just works on all cylinders. If you are a fan of these types of films with super powered characters then I think you will defiantly enjoy Suicide Squad quite a bit. It brings some light hearted enjoyment to the dark and gross DC cinematic universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Marvel movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Suicide Squad last night, expecting it to be terrible, but loved it. In fact, all of my friends really liked it. In fact, I heard more than a few strangers leaving the theater talking about how it was not nearly as terrible as the reviews. The movie was certainly not perfect, and some critics did point out its real flaws, but if comic book cannon and plot holes don't flip you out then you can really enjoy watching it. Seriously, the perception you get from Rotten Tomatoes does not match reality at all.I won't repeat what many other reviews here have already stated, but overall this is a really fun movie to see, despite the usual flaws. It is more adult, not because of any sex or violence, but because immature audiences wouldn't get the drama or ideas in the movie. I'm not saying it was great drama nor was it deep or complicated, just compared to other shallow cartoon-depth superhero movies. The action scenes were poorly filmed and not very fun, and while my 11 year old daughter loved it, I can easily see this going over the heads of most kids. The plot is not always clear, but that's not really the point or what you could be enjoying about the movie.I am not a comic book reader and have zero concern for the whole Marvel versus DC arguments; I only watch movies for their value as entertaining films. I absolutely loved Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel) and thought BvS (DC) was a confusing mess of a story. However, there is a clear trend with who loves or hates which comic book movies, usually mapping to DC vs Marvel. People who like (and apparently need) the traditional concept of unrealistically-good heroes and unrealistically-evil villains will like Marvel movies. MoS, BvS, and Suicide Squad all touched on concepts from Watchmen ? the very antithesis to the superhero concept. In Suicide Squad we are supposed to cheer for the exact same people that were portrayed as the evil villains in the first X-Men film: a government group whose purpose is to counter otherwise unstoppable superheroes. I'm not talking about who is a "good guy" or "bad guy", I'm talking about the concept of who watches the watchmen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes). I thought Avengers Civil War was going to approach this topic, until the lame Iron Man-Spiderman drivel about extreme power *not* corrupting someone.If you are a die-hard comic book reader who expects to see the typical hero defeating evil story then you will not like Suicide Squad. If you liked reading Watchmen (the book, NOT the movie) then you might like it. If you worship the concept of superheroes or liked any X-Men movie then you will hate this movie. If you are a Marvel devotee, then...why are you even reading this? Your mind was already made up long ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever sat around thinking &nbsp;- "I wish there was a movie that was part comic book, part THE DIRTY DOZEN, part ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK with a villain and finale straight outta GHOSTBUSTERS?" &nbsp;If so, then do I have a movie for you. &nbsp;SUICIDE SQUAD attempts to fill this void, it just doesn't do it successfully. &nbsp;There is a good movie in here somewhere, this version of SUICIDE SQUAD just isn't it. &nbsp;Based on the DC Comics, and set in the universe of Batman and Superman, Suicide Squad tells the story of a ragtag group of "bad guys" pressed into service. &nbsp;Do they become "good guys"? &nbsp;Can they work through their differences, band together and save the day? &nbsp;What do you think? &nbsp;Fanboy service and the Internet was all agog over what this movie would/should/might be and when DEADPOOL was a big hit last winter, expectations were raised even higher for this anti-hero Superhero movie. &nbsp;And it is under the weight of these expectations that this movie crumbles.Suicide Squad has all the earmarks of "studio executive interference". &nbsp;By bringing in Director David Ayer (End of Watch, Fury), this movie was going to be tough, dirty, gritty and R-Rated. &nbsp;But then, Warner/DC came under fire for the dark "un-fun" Batman v Superman film of earlier this year and campy, fun DEADPOOL was a hit, so I am sure notes came down to "put some fun in this thing" and that's where we have our problem. &nbsp;This film just doesn't know what it want's to be, so it tries to straddle a line between dark/gritty and light/campy, attempting to please all while all it really does is disappoint all.There are some bright spots - the performances of Will Smith and Margot Robbie standout, there are a few good action sequences and I &nbsp;actually enjoyed the BEGINNING of the final action sequence (though by the end I was expecting to hear the villain say "There is no Dana, only Zul") , but the problems of tone, style, fulfilling fan service, jamming way too many characters and backstories into too short of a movie and "by-the-numbers" plot sink this Suicide Squad before it starts. &nbsp;Add to this the much bally-hooed performance of Jared Leto as the Joker is not much more than an extended cameo and you have unmet expectations all around.If you are a "fanboy", you'll find plenty to like in this film. &nbsp;If you are anyone else, you'll be disappointed, confused and ultimately let down by this Suicide Squad.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even kids can see how bad movie this is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie last night with my friend. On my sad behalf I was the one who forced us to go watch this film. I don't even know where to start, I guess I'll go with Joker. Don't get me wrong, Jared Leto is great actor, and I believe he could be next big thing with Joker, but his lack of minutes and terrible script made him look poor and that's probably Ayer's guilt (I believe). The next sad thing about this film is that every so called humoristic scene was all but not funny (except those scenes you already have seen in trailer), and every serious or dramatic scene was all but not serious or dramatic. I have a feeling that they rushed this movie to those limits they just haven't got enough time to make it look better. Those are not bad actors, it's just one big messed up movie with bad screenplay. All I was doing throughout the whole movie is facepalming my face like Batman does to Robin in funny memes. Next thing, I was so disappointed with is "actress" Cara Delevingne, she is so beautiful and yet so bad in acting, and I don't know anything about acting, but I can tell this ain't for her... And they gave her such big role and that makes it all even worse. I would never recommend this movie, not even to a nemesis, which is so sad because I am big fan of DC world and that's just not enough to change my mind about it.The only good thing I saw is few action moments, but there was nothing to make you cower. Good choice of soundtrack for movie, but scenario made it all look so bad. And yeah, Harley Quinn is the only watchable character if you ignore the feminist thingy about her being half naked.I gave this movie 3 stars just because I'm DC fan, but otherwise it would be 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The anticipated Suicide Squad is in cinemas and is okay. Following the events of Dawn of Justice, Amanda Waller assembles a team of villains to work together to stop a supernatural threat. Directed by David Ayer (not Snyder) the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) continues to grow by introducing the DC equivalent of Guardians of the Galaxy (the only difference being that Guardians of the Galaxy is a masterpiece). The Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith) Haley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and some other character shoe horned inn, also the Joker Played by Jared Leto.So what is expected of the film on one hand is provided, as kick ass, cool, and loud action to make a real fun cinema experience. On the other hand what was also expected was an awesome strong film with consistency, but this is not quite the same film I saw in the trailers.So what happens to the film is a rushed pace, that goes wonky at the end, with some layered characters next to some very un-layered characters in a narrative with not much consistent direction. What holds the film together is Margot Robbie's performance which really carries everything with her pure insanity. Although Will Smith plays a pretty cool Deadshot, all I see is Smith being the same as he always is in every other film. So what should be a Squad becomes a duo as these two are the only real characters in the whole film. Which brings us to Jared Leto. We all know that no actor could beat the great Heath Ledger when it comes to playing the Joker, and Leto holds no candle at all, by providing a gangster Joker which no one asked for. What Leto does nail is the scary intimidation of the Joker, but struggles to be the Joker we all know and love.What is also a vital part to the film is the action sequences, which are enjoyable at first but end up getting more dramatic. This is also supported by a very strong use of CGI which pretty much invades the whole film. The film also provides entertainment with its humour which we were hoping to quite consistent, but it appears every line has to be delivered by Robbie or Smith as the scene is about to end.What I also found annoying was the narrative as it feels sloppy and does feel like its heading in the direction it should do, and with the consistent mad and fun atmosphere flowing through, but it does not quite match with what it concludes with at the end.The DCEU so far has not had a good start, but at the moment Suicide Squad is the lesser of three evils, with enjoyable action and fun. 7.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I have seen a lot of bad reviews. They must stop comparing DC and Marvel. DC has always been dark. No stupid jokes as Marvel. I never listen to the critics. I like to have my own opinion about any film. You do not like the film? Well, that's just like your opinion, man. Alas, some of those "critics" are only saying what they hear without even see the actual film. These critics needs and enema! As a DC fan, this film was wicked. There is some imagery I thought we had never see on the big screen. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Just incredible. I have heard a lot of people barking mad about "Harley being too sexy" Why so salty? She is wearing hot pants because they are sparkly and fun. She does not do it because she wants blokes to look at her arse. Jared Leto as The Joker was good. That whole thug-life/Lil Wayne/Ellen Degeneres on a rough day Joker look I was not keen on, but thankfully he was not like that all the time. In general, everyone played an excellent part.Only beef, Enchantress and Incubus. They are the worst comic book movie villains of all time. At least we know what the endlessly dull Malekith from Thor: The Dark World wants. At least Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze is a campy hoot to watch and quote. At least Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was weird enough to create conversation and at least Doomsday felt like a world-threatening force of nature (even thought he looked like Chet from Weird Science). These two want to destroy humanity just because. Alas, Cara Delevingne, she was not right for this part in my opinion. Whatever the whole "waving your arms around in slow motion" thing just looked silly. She was pretty bloody horrible. She cannot act.Good movie, just let down by weird editing and direction choices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad the highly anticipated movie of 2016 is out and not a lot of people are happy about it. Before I say what I liked, let me get what I didn't like out of the way. The main problem with this movie is the plot. The plot is awful and I am upset that they couldn't come up with anything better. My second problem was editing/cuts. The editing was very very weird at times and I could tell they cut out a lot of important scenes from the movie. My last problem with this movie was the VILLAIN, they really could't come up with any and I mean ANY other villain then who they picked in this movie. Now lets talk about some things I liked. One thing I liked was Margot Robbie. She was incredible. Well that's all I have for now I will finish this review later</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, too harshly criticised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's a good movie overall, I enjoyed it and could really relate to the characters, I get why it was criticised so much, and I am really disappointed at WB for deleting all the scenes. I get that it's a PG 13 movie, so they had to delete the abusive scenes so that they don't "glorify" the abusive relationship between HQ and Joker. But if you really don't want to mislead children and teenagers why do you glorify the villains? The whole movie is focused on villains and how cool they are, how is that not misleading? I want them to make an actual movie, follow the original storyline, actually put some real elements into it instead of just trying to make it appropriate, I think it's worth to make it R rated, although it might be risky for the box office... can't be worse than it already is right? Look at how much the box office has dropped and how much it is being criticised. DC was doing a good job until WB stepped in. I'm disappointed for that but then again overall, I still liked it as I really could relate to the characters. Hope to see more of Joker and Harley Quinn. Without Harley Quinn this movie would've had no point. I like that it is focused on the villains, but as I said, if that's what they wanted just go all the way! Don't cut the abusive scenes, that's just who they are and now the plot line is confusing and sends mixed messages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC delivers more fun to match it's darkness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a ton of fun! It's stylish, bad-ass, enjoyable, and like the characters that make up the titular team, is rough around the edges. There are flaws to be sure and some stick out like a sore thumb (lookin' at you totally out of place, eyeroll worthy, slow mo!)...but worse movies have been given better reviews for the same or worse sins. The final battle felt...off...in a lot of ways - perhaps it's because writer/director David Ayer has never really done a big, special effects driven, superhero film before. Perhaps the re-shoots/re-editing the BvS backlash caused did more harm than good? There are some awkward lines and poor deliveries...I can't really put my finger on what happened...there have been reports that there were competing cuts of the film - one more serious and somber and the more "turn off your brain and have fun" one we got - perhaps they should have stuck to the plan...although the final conflict did pull me out of the movie a great deal and the latter half is pretty predictable, the film as a whole is not the waste of space some critics or your "friend who knows film" might lead you to believe. The cast and their characters are spot on!! Will Smith and Margot Robbie absolutely steal the show as Deadshot and Harley Quinn and I thought Joel Kinnamen gave the usually forgettable Rick Flag quite a bit of depth. The one role no one seems to be talking about that deserves to be is Viola Davis as Amanda Waller; she is stone f-ing cold and totally perfect to the characters source material! Also; Jai Courtney! I actually liked Jai Courtney! I thought they did a good job of introducing this huge group of main DC players and showing us their back stories without getting bogged down. The plot as a whole is very by the numbers, but that's in keeping with the comics! The whole concept and the group assembled is such a cool idea, but what to do with them always seems to be a rough point. There are lots of by the numbers films that are still enjoyable and this is one of them. Oh! And that scene we've seen of them sitting in a bar and having drinks from the trailers? My god it's good! It is just such a damn good scene!!! Now, let's address the elephant in the room - Jared Leto's Joker... I thought he was awesome! For many audiences Jack Nicholson will always be The Joker and for others he will always be Heath Ledger...but for many, Leto will not be The Joker. But for me, he was! Seemingly based off Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo's JOKER graphic novel and Grant Morrison's BATMAN R.I.P. - he is less anarchist and gangster, and more professional psychopath. Also, I liked that he had consumed henchmen that were a part of his crew and not just expendable accessories. He actually reminded me of a modern meth and coke addled version of Cesar Romero's Joker from the 60's TV show...and I mean that in a very good way! I can't wait to see more of him! Like Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice before it, this will not be for everyone - but I continue to be very excited about what DC is doing over its peers. Namely; taking risks and not playing it safe. Much like Batman v Superman, my suspicion is there will be a directors cut on Blu-Ray and that will be the definitive version. Which to some might sound like a short coming - but I see it as more of a good thing! There is a vindictive side of me that would address the negativity for this movie by asking "But...is this not what you wanted though?" After the reception of the first two DCEU films, it's no surprise we were given a very "Marvel" feeling DC film...and yet that apparently still isn't good enough for critics and some audiences...which is all very disappointing on many levels. Suicide Squad does a great job of keeping DC's now trademark darker tone while lightening the mood considerably! My advice? It's definitely worth a watch, just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting a long time for this movie to come out, and as a comic book reader and fan, I was really excited about watching it with my girlfriend at the drive in! Long story short: the plot was so boring and uncompelling that we both ended up not caring about the movie anymore... Although some of the characters are very well played and interesting, the story simply did not deliver.So on the way there, I was excited to watch it, but about halfway through... I was kinda hoping it would end soon to watch the second movie... This is my honest personal opinion, but I would not recommend spending your hard earned money on this movie. It's still watchable if you're a fan of the genre but you should wait for it to come out on DVD and/or Netflix and such.That being said, Thank you for reading, and have a nice day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>trainwreck of ego battles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>with all of the hype generated around the commitment of the actors to their roles, this movie really boils down to a handful of actors all jockeying for a chance to steal the show and possibly launch a film franchise. you have will smith trying to steal the show with a lovable father/worlds greatest assassin (does he take her with him on his constant international travels? ya think?) with a heart of gold representation of deadshot. but the film maker also decided to really commit to the harley quinn narrative, and in order to introduce her to the audience as well, they needed an origin story to compel the new audience members to connect to her. which meant that the joker had to come along for the ride, and of course in order to play the joker you have to deal with the fact that the last guy knocked it out of the ballpark, and you will never live up to that. which seems to have motivated Jared Leto to latch on to an extremely undeserved ego trip over his character. he is a supporting character to a side narrative, and yet he battled to turn himself into a central character by "sacrificing" for the role so much the director felt compelled to shoe horn in some more screen time. when in all honesty, it would have been WAY more compelling and creepy if this movie had not even revealed who the next joker would be, by always playing the joker as a shadow figure. that way the obsession and devotion that harley gets to play with is projected on to a character that is unknowable and unrelatable to any of the audience. it would have really given room for her to explore the depths of harleys idol worship if the joker had essentially been "kaiser soze" for one film. but instead we got a hot topic die antwood and a cutesey bad boy crush. meanwhile a slew of lesser known actors are all desperately trying to get noticed by committing so hard to their characters they ended up making it all about themselves. what you end up with is a shallow caricature development movie with a bunch of off brand comic book characters who's backstory needs to be shoe horned in to a feature length film. on top of bad writing, and over over the top character choices. the look of the film was reminiscent of 1987's Masters of the Universe. for an action and visual effects driven story, there seems to have been given very little effort toward filming it in a visually interesting way. in fact the very few cinematically artistic moments that appear in the film are all devoted to the sub plot with harley and the joker. which is only supposed to be harleys origin story, not the main focus of the whole film. the rest of the film has lots of poorly lit battle sequences in city streets, with propane poofers back lighting rubber suited stunt men. oh, and there are a ton of random laser shots flying around for good measure....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie had a great premise and a good cast. The end result is a mediocre movie and the blame can be put on David Ayer. He wrote and directed the movie so there is nowhere to hide. There is no transition from the totally bad guys to the ?there is something decent inside me" characters at the end of the movie. The biggest disappointment is Jared Leto. His make up and acting blocks any real empathy and it made me long for the character played by Heath Ledger. Next on the disappointment scale is Cara Delevingne. After Paper Towns I was expecting more, but this movie showed she cannot play anything else than herself. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis manage to put life in the dead body of the movie and it only makes you sad that they were so little used in a movie that had so much potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fighting scenes won't make up for bad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was utterly disappointed by this movie. Story: I could totally picture the script-writer seeking for a good reason for bad guys to save the world &gt; didn't find any &gt; and just went: "Ok, what if they say 'let's save the world' (not a spoiler) despite being completely OFF CHARACTER? I think the public won't care".And the worst "WTF" part, for me, was when El Diablo said "they are my family"... (I'm not telling when or why he said that). Again, the script-writer was probably short on ideas and went for the most improbable action, thinking "the public won't care...", again...BUT I DO CARE...---------- Spoiler ON ---------- Same for the 'persuasion scene' where authorities just had ONE demo from the MOST POWERFUL of the "villains", and then just went "Ok, you can build your team"... dude, really? one demo is all it takes? knowing the others are not as good? You sure trust the script- writer, I mean... Amanda.And what about the almighty boss who mysteriously sucks when facing them... so infuriating.---------- Spoiler OFF ----------The humor: Good sometimes, but forced on us other times. Trying to look cool like Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy maybe?...The characters: Harley makes sense, the rest is still searching who they really are I guess? Bad or good? I personally think it should be the case. And the JOKER... is a joke. I couldn't find the "intelligence" I loved in him in previous movies/comics/animations. He was just crazy... and vapid.Conclusion: To me, the story is empty and has to many "shortcuts". It doesn't hold at all. The characters are undefined/unfinished. The action scenes are great, although unrealistic sometimes even for meta-humans. But not enough to reach the 5/10 note for me.In the end, I almost left the theater twice and the action scenes were the only things that made me stay. The last time this happened to me, was for Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003)...PS: I'm not judging the work or the opinions of other spectators, THIS IS ONLY MY PERSONAL OPINION/FEELING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So me watching this film was a spur of the moment kind of thing. I wasn't expecting it to be great but I was expecting at least some good aspects. I liked the Joker. I don't know why everyone is giving him so much hate, I thought he did fine. He took a more modern twist on the character which I thought worked with the tone of the movie. I looked forward to his scenes and wish he had more. I really liked Harley. Like the joker I was excited when she was in a scene and thought her character was very well done. She was cutesy, she was bad-ass and she was human. I also liked Deadshot. I liked that we had a backstory on him, I liked that he wasn't all bad; he had some snarky lines and I liked that. I would say the only problem is that when I looked at him I saw Will Smith, but then again I suppose it's hard not to see him considering he's such a well know guy. But besides those three characters, I didn't like anything else. I found the plot all to messy. I was an hour into the film and I had little to know clue what was going on. The Enchantess was rushed and her character was weirdly payed. I also though that June and the guy she was with didn't have any chemistry. All in all, some characters are good but it doesn't save the messy plot and the crummy editing.</fullReview>

I do tend to agree with some of the comments made, especially about the amount of screen time that they give to the Joker. But there was more than some reviews suggested so enough to keep you happy and wanting more. There's definitely potential for a Joker/Harley spin off movie (hope that happens!!)

		<fullReview>Saying this movie lost the plot would be inaccurate as it did NOT have a plot to begin with!The first hour is spent introducing the main characters as stand alone criminals that are now locked up in solitary.So half the movie, half the movie is just telling you that your "heroes" are the bad guys, they don't play well with others, they're only looking out for number one AND that they've had little to no contact with each other.Then they're in a team to defeat the villain that aims to... to... I think it was rule the world or destroy it, it was never made clear what the villain's aim was or how they would do it. it was just bad guy, that's their location, go!You know what, the avengers was a group of heroes with a common goal and even they had growing pains forming a team. the interactions made that movie. Here they pulled a my little pony friendship is magic stunt (not kidding regarding the pony, they actually throw a pink one at you in slow motion!) so the previous hour was wasted... the team is well coordinated and the members are willing to die for each other... the selfish criminals, who've only known each other for less then a day... and Kitana is somehow with them to for no reason what so ever, she just joined them!I really wanted to love this movie, Harley Quinn is my fav. DC character and Will Smith (playing Deadshot) is just so charming... and you love both in this movie but...The visuals are amazing though sometimes they make no sense, the character design is eye catching and the effects are nice.however plot wise they pretty much threw a few DC characters into a blender and hit the on the button hoping for hit.Overall it's a poor movie BUT still enjoyable because of the stand alone characters. I would recommend renting it if only for the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The DC Cinematic Universe has just committed cinematic suicide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was such an exciting idea. A round-up of villains having to be heroes in exchange for shorter prison sentences in the hands of a talented director and strong cast? It was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and it looked set to be the film which would save the DCEU following Batman Vs Superman. It only sent it further into darkness. SS is a total mess in every single way. The editing is incomprehensible, the action scenes are complete chaos and despite having such a colorful cast of characters the film is visually an endless pit of dark, gloomy CGI shapes getting beaten up by the characters. They're supposed to be villains, but if they are, then this cinematic universe has some of the loveliest bad guys ever. The plot is messy, confusing, lacking in depth and soul and every single underdeveloped element, especially Jared Leto's tragically wasted Joker, comes clashing and screaming together like an unruly crowd of brawling rioters with the subtlety of a machine gun helicopter blowing up a city block. Lacking in depth, soul and nuances of any kind, only an awesome soundtrack, some good performances and occasional moments where the excellence of the trailers comes to life are there to offer much satisfaction. None of that saves the film. It's pretty scary that I can't decide if it's worse than Batman Vs Superman. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Disappointing: A David Ayers film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in expecting the grit and realism of a David Ayers film. I mean of course! that's why the hired him! But unfortunately the film under-preformed and should not be called such. To be fair some scenes of the film do capture that realistic and serious tone that entices me to be a DC fan. To know these characters (Hero or Villain) can be as dysfunctional and as vulnerable as myself. Ultimately the film is buried somewhere underneath Character Cards, careless editing, and unnecessary CGI. A Golden David Ayer film is left somewhere on the cutting room floor.The film is cut only leave you to care for only three characters, Deadshot(Will Smith), Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), All who's stories I still feel weren't logically explained or flushed. The rest of the squad is left with little to no lines. (Poor Adewale in that mask for 12 to 14 hours of the day to do two sneers, a lick, and practically ONE line).The Joker is almost irrelevant, and only serves Harley Quinn's story purpose with no more than 7 min screen time, which would have been fine if I felt like he didn't try to serve a bigger purpose in the plot of the film. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) was unexplained entirely (Motivations, Backstory none of it) and in one scene literally made me facepalm thinking "What the F- -- just happened?...they cut it"Overall the cast performance is exemplary, leaving you feeling as though there was more than what you payed for. The shots and dialogue are both blunt and razor sharp keeping the film about VILLAINS intact, the action sequences are to rave about, so sincerely THANK YOU David AYER for giving these characters life. But It is on the editing floor that this film fails, like Batman V. Superman it leaves the audience thinking "Did I miss something?" "Is this the whole film?". All from having music where it shouldn't be and score where it shouldn't belong. So much story/ flashbacks are either missing or rushed through, It makes me wonder "Who greenlit this cut to hit theaters?". I payed for a film by David Ayer, NOT Trailer Park. I Pray for another Cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was great movie that even though they are villains, you can sympathize with them. Ayer did a fantastic job bringing them to the screen. It ultimately lived up to my expectations. This jaw dropping thriller will have you wanting more and more of it until the very end. All time favorite scenes were the chemistry throughout the squad near the end. The only thing I could take away from this film is at some points the plot was scattered, and some incomplete character arcs but it wasn't as noticeable as critics have said. I recommend you go and see this movie whenever you can because it sets up the future of the DCEU, Another reason to see it is Margot Robbie's excellent portrayal of the 'infamous Harley Quinn'. David Ayer brought these characters to life with a all star cast who didn't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad sets out to be different from any other "superhero" movie before it, with the obvious difference being that this really isn't a superhero movie at all. A team of villains brought together for exactly what their name implies, and it's a new and interesting take on comic book films, setting a brand new dynamic for story. characters and more; one step forward. However, while the premise is enticing, SS falls short in bringing these new dynamics to a high level, faltering in many aspects; two steps back.The beginnings of the film are done wonderfully, we're introduced to Amanda Waller, the creator of Task Force X (or the Suicide Squad) right away and get right into introducing the soon-to-be squad, providing great backstory to some of the characters, something the DCEU is desperate for. The mood of the film at the start is slick and bad- ass, and I quickly became anxious to see the whole team assembled. But that's basically where the film starts to fall apart, when the gang actually gets together. The pacing of the plot is set up to succeed, but then falls into a horrible pattern of repetition, loaded with some funny, but mostly unfunny one-liners and too many clichés to mention. It seemed as though director and writer David Ayer was scared to continue exploring the blank canvas he had in front of him, and opted to play it safe in the second half, going into unbearably played out "portal over the city to rule the world" villain plot instead of having the squad execute a more grounded task, which could have provided a much more engaging experience for what this team can do and what they stand for. Overall, the script became bland. The interaction between characters was strong and the continued backstory development was vital, but the absolute lack of continued originality (including the mid-credits scene) and terrible pacing leave Suicide Squad's story as another to be forgotten.There's plenty of action to talk about, both good and bad. There's some awesome action sequences highlighted by Will Smith's spectacularly played Deadshot, and we even get a couple cool moments from Batman himself in the form of flashbacks, especially when it involves the Joker. There's not an overuse of CGI, and each character's individual powers and traits are fun to watch. My beef with the film's action, is not that there was too much or too little, but how it was executed. Going back to my point earlier, the action was at its best at the gritty street levels, not a bunch of misfits taking down god-like beings. Marvel has a leg up on DC largely because of how closely their characters resemble their comic book roots, and are balanced accordingly during action scenes. But with DC, we have Harley Quinn and Captain Boomerang taking down an all-powerful entity like its nothing. The choreography needs lots of work, most hand-to-hand action was dull and lifeless, and the camera zoomed in heavily to try and offset the lack of said choreography. Casual fans might be thrilled with the action, but any true comic book fan should know that this isn't what SS action should look like.While the script falls short on many counts, the cast and their characters are the best part of an otherwise mediocre film. The aforementioned Will Smith is easily recognizable as the only Oscar- level actor in the cast, and his performance shows why. Margot Robbie was good, but not great as Harley Quinn. She was definitely fun, sexy and, especially in scenes involving the Joker, displayed that crazy Harley everyone knows. Then there's the unfortunate over- sexualization of her character, to almost extreme amounts. I almost couldn't enjoy the character because I had to get a booty shot every 5 minutes. Harley's backstory is fleshed out better than any other character, and for what Robbie was given, she performed well. Everyone else in the gang has promise, but the likes of Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc and more just couldn't get enough screen time to develop into more fleshed out characters. They're enjoyable on their own levels, but it's hard to invest in a character when there's nothing to invest in.Then there's the big guy. The Joker finally made his big screen return following Heath Ledger's legendary performance in 2008. Now played by Jared Leto, I am very much on the fence about him. This Joker is a completely brand new take on the character and Leto's very strange portrayal is both intriguing and yet underwhelming at the same time. The character's difference was good yes, but in some ways, Joker's more thug-like treatment and subsequent deliverance from Leto made him almost less intimidating, less of what I expect from the Joker, but again, this is not your traditional Joker. Leto didn't have nearly enough screen time to make a realistic judgment, but there was some great backstory provided in the film, and although I was not overall a fan of this Joker's personality or laugh, Leto's new take and his strong connection with Harley was enough not to make me hate this iteration. Without question, DC and Warner Bros. are still a very long way away from anything Marvel. SS shows a step in the right direction for DC, in that they're willing to try something new, that character arcs need to be built upon heavily, and that every casting into the DCEU continues to flourish. But SS, much like BvS, takes two steps back with a horribly constructed script, an awful slew of clichés, zero story originality, deficient pacing, unmeaningful action and more. Suicide Squad delivers some good fun, humor characters and action, but make no mistake; expectations were not met at all in this film, and with two critical failures in a row, DC better have some moves fast that can help the DCEU climb out of its current state, a state of uncertainty.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel little bit disappointment but i really have enjoyed the movie. I was waiting a long time for this, but i have disappointed for the fact that the most of good scenes appears in trailers and the other movie previews. I was expecting to see more information and more scenes about the characters. Especially from Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The story was predictable but i knew that, so i focused to the actor's performance. And that was i like more on the movie. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jay Hernandez and Jared Leto performance was great. Music, sound effects and direction is pretty good, and all that CGI scenes make the movie interesting and enjoyable. For sure it worth to watch it. I hope will soon see and the sequel of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not movie you need right now. This is the movie you deserve. Don't listen to anyone and go watch it decide yourself. Me I liked it. This is perfect setup for creating the need to form Justice League. There are so many practical approach with the characters which really makes you feel for it. For any movie there is so many naysayers who will say how better a movie can be. In this case also it may have been better but this is not at all a bad movie. Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn did a remarkable job of portraying the core values or the basic ideas for those characters. Rick Flag played by Joel Kinnaman was more of a pawn than a Patriot. Joker with very less screen time played by Jerard Leto is with lots of change than any of it's predecessors which I liked and can be explained how he gets all the resources to escape and retaliate with Batman. Overall good movie 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too many characters, too little development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad opens with a fast-paced sequence intended to cover a wide breadth of characters without going into any depth whatsoever. Oddly enough, this seems to be indicative of the movie as a whole: little depth of character among a large group of cast members. Following the introductory section where Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) introduces the future members of the "Suicide Squad," we are quickly thrust into the main plot of the movie. One of the "meta-humans," Enchantress (Cara Delevigne) begins a reign of terror upon Midway City. This action seems to be fine, but the sparse dialogue from Delevigne doesn't really give us a good reason as to why this is happening. Following this, the Suicide Squad comprised of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), and a host of other baddies spring into action, along with their boss, Special Forces guru Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman). However, their mission doesn't focus on defeating the threat but instead rescuing an unidentifiable VIP from the city. What ensues is a menagerie of choppy editing, adequate action scenes, strange flashbacks, and a lack of character development. The problem with Suicide Squad is that the screen feels all too overcrowded at all points in time. At many points in the movie I found myself forgetting that some of the other "villains" even existed, such as Katana (Karen Fukuhara), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney). However, the writers did reserve some decent motivation and development for Deadshot and Harley Quinn who were brought to life by Smith and Robbie, respectively. They seem to be the only redeeming pieces of a film that possesses a sub-par script and plot. The biggest disappointment in terms of characters came from The Joker (Jared Leto). The trailers seemed to make The Joker out to be a major part of the plot, but he hardly spends 7 minutes on screen. Leto's portrayal doesn't fall that flat, but the over-inflated PR campaign that focused on his presence could only lead to disappointment. "Suicide Squad" desperately tried to capitalize on what made Guardians of the Galaxy so great, but their lack of character development leaves the audience wondering why they should care about the characters on screen. This, mixed with flat jokes and a villain so bad that we yearn for Ledger's Joker or even Bane, inevitably leaves the viewer disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DC, what have you done? Following the "Dark Knight" trilogy this is beyond disappointing. This is just my personal opinion but I am by all means willing to explain why I feel this way.1. No time for character development. A vital moment in every film is when you give the audience reason to care about the main characters, what they do, the decisions they make, and how the characters themselves affect the overall story. The Suicide Squad members did not affect the story. Harley did everything pretty much on her own.2. 0 (zero) chemistry between characters. The body language and dialogue frequently clashed.3. The characters were not as they were hyped up to be. Deadshot and Joker specifically come to mind in this particular problem. Joker is a performer, he's a CLOWN. When Joker was not written to perform for the audience but is instead preoccupied with confusing displays of affection for Harley, you know you have a problem (Joker's not affectionate to begin with). Leto simply was not allowed to be Joker. Deadshot was worse. Will Smith is a phenomenal actor who was thrown into the same screen with mediocre and stiff co-stars who suffered from a bad case of... Both of these supposed major characters with serious hype from media turned out to be rather minor.4. HORRIFIC DIALOGUE Whoever wrote this screenplay needs to be spoken to harshly then fired. The lines were choppy. Situations were understated. Vernacular was outdated and conflicting.5. I don't need to see SAMSUNG pop up on the screen every 15 minutes. Product placement was blatant and crass.6. The whole movie was forced. Nothing felt natural. Gotham city is not a PG-13 city. Gotham is an R rated city with very dark and depressing themes. More than half the cast should never have been introduced. The movie wastes a lot of time rushing their intros and then has too little time in which they rush the plot.7. The plot hardly exists. Enchantress wants to annihilate humanity. Harley stops her. The end. Should take maybe an hour and a half (if you want slow and gradual buildup), but ends up taking two hours. So factor in at least 30 minutes of, "Hi, my name is ___________ and I won't be doing much. #YOLO" Dialogue is that bad, yes.8. Did I mention Joker + Social Media? That was painful to sit through. Painful. Fortunately it was quick. We didn't suffer long.9. It wasn't bad enough to be laughed at and it certainly wasn't good enough to be enjoyed. Suicide Squad was boring. I was bored almost to sleep. It's been a while since I fell asleep during a movie at the theater. I did not expect Suicide Squad to do that to me. I stayed awake only because I didn't want my friend to realize it had been a complete waste of time.How this movie could've been saved: 1. Follow the script and don't second guess yourself with multi-million dollar re-shoots. The first trailer was captivating, eerie, and exciting. The final trailer was messy, too exaggerated in all the wrong ways, and cliché.2. Spend that extra couple million on better cast, better editing, and better effects.3. Pick a genre.4. Pick an antagonist.5. Pick a protagonist.6. Plan to have antagonist and protagonist disagree on something.7. Have that something turn into a problem that needs to be fixed.8. Plan to have that problem addressed.9. Pat yourself on the back because you just discovered plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the kind of movie the "suicide squad" deserved. The last 30 minutes is so embarrassing! The movie had a good start and good plots to begin with. but soon it all came trembling down. the actors are good but the script is too bad that the actors efforts are pointless. the last fight scenes, i think anyone an average movie and TV series fan could've written better scenes.Some dialogues and scenes are too pretentious, there is a scene where Harley Quinn starts speaking philosophy, and the final scene where she kills the enchantress!!!!is too embarrassing, i think the crew should've watched some justice league comics. and the joker looked different, but the actions and mannerisms was almost like imitating heath ledger's. and in the comics Joker doesn't actually care about Harley, and that is the truth, but in the movie they are like in love and almost spoiled the character of joker! This movie made BVS look like a classic. with the hype and cast this movie made, it deserved more!! I cant believe DC accepted this script and very very disappointing!! A movie with DC logo and the title "suicide squad" on it, is supposed to be great. In no way are you guys a competition to marvel movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Hyped Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the announcement of the cast of Suicide Squad last summer, there has been nothing but excitement for this film. A star-studded cast that included my favourite actor Jared Leto, as the Joker alongside, Will Smith and Margot Robbie only rendered a movie that was to bound to impress. I had eagerly been anticipating the film for the past year however, my standards were soon crushed almost 20 minutes into the movie.I am not a huge comic book fan however, I do enjoy DC Comics and Marvel blockbusters, and this movie did not reach my expectations. The best part about Suicide Squad was the very many trailers that were released throughout the year. The trailers showed each of the characters that were to be portrayed and left fans questioning what the story-line would entail. The fact that there was such little known about the story-line was something I found to be extremely enticing as it brought up the hype even more.However, upon viewing the movie, I realised exactly why the emphasis was completely on the actors and their character portrayal and not the story-line. This was because the film literally had no story-line. The director David Ayers put all his focus into what A-list Hollywood actors he could get to star in his movie in order to grab the audiences attention rather than writing a good plot for a movie that had so much potential. The one positive aspect of Suicide Squad was the acting and I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of both Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as the Joker. In my opinion, this sub-plot carried the entire movie and it was easy to pick up on the emotional and physical abusive relationship deeply rooted between the two. It was disappointing that the Joker did not play a bigger part as it would have been interesting to see how far Jared Leto could take the character.It felt as if there was no build up to the final 'fight scene' and it all just happened at once with no breaks or relief in between. The plot development would have made the movie more realistic and empathetic if the turn of events did not take place all in one night and it was clear from the beginning what exactly the suicide squad were being rallied up for. From my understanding, Enchantress was also going to be part of the elite squad to take down evil terrorists, Amanda Waller continuously harked on about. However, Enchantress ended up becoming said terrorist alongside her brother, which I felt was a plot-hole. Did Waller know this was going to happen all along? Who were the original terrorists if Enchantress did not take over June Moon's body?Overall, Suicide Squad was a big disappointment mainly due to the story-line. With such a talented cast of some of the biggest names in Hollywood at the moment, it was obvious the movie was going to set itself up for failure if it did not reach the expectations of fans. The main reason I gave the movie 5 stars was solely based on the characters Harley Quinn, the Joker and the sub-plot of their relationship that was portrayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to see this movie without any bias or pre-conceived notions, so I do feel qualified to share my review. Not having read or even being aware of the DC Comics version, I did not know what to expect. I liked the movie as it had a lot of good action from the get go, so the 2 hours passed quickly. The movie helped build up the story giving each of the major characters a build up. It did feel like a little bit of 'Ghostbuster' but only fleetingly so.Critics may have panned the movie, but I enjoyed it. Lots of color, good CGI, did not feel fake. The sound effects were very good. The language and script, screenplay were alright for this sort of genre. Plenty of light direct humor, nothing too cerebral. Plenty of trippy and whacky badass characters to satisfy even the folks who wish for balance and gender diversity. A few parts did seem puzzling, but you can enjoy the movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not going to go into a long rant but I guess I have to due the guidelines. This movie was garbage and time wasting, I fell asleep. There was a lot of corny dialogue followed by corny violin music. Joel Kinnaman sucks and is corny, The only thing he is good in is the Killing. He feels award in and role he plays. He is a one dimensional cater. Movie didn't make any sense, the lame as corny fans who liked it and were waiting for it are retarded. I don't write reviews but i'm tired of people saying the movie for good. If you are corny then yes maybe its good. I can say one good thing, the joker was the best joker ever played. I grew up watching all the Batmans and he was the best what I wanted to see in a joker. He reminded me of the joker from Batman: the animated series. I get tired of people saying Health Ledger was the best Joker. Since when the Joker is depressing and dark. Then the stupid as makeup on his face ruined it. I didn't laugh not one time watching the dark knight with him playing the joker. Now to Jared Leto did a good job and I would like to see him in more roles as the joker. He had that sadistic, funny, psycho feeling as should the joker should be. One thing is that we wasn't crazy enough. The joker suppose to be a lunatic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Start, but Quickly Falls Apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had so much potential, with such a great cast, but the editing and 'movie climax' derailed it. I would give the first half of the movie a 7.5/10, but the last 1/3 or 1/4 a 3/10. WB needs to learn that every movie doesn't have to be about 'taking over the world'. This could just have been about the city, and the characters, without trying to cram 'saving the world' into all of their movies like BvS.The main villains in this movie, which you don't see in the trailers (very smart by the trailer editors so that people would come see the movie), are kind of goofy, and the "final battle" with them felt like I was watching Michael Bays TMNT or T4 slow motion fight scenes. If they would have cut the end villains out of this movie, and stuck with a the joker as the villain and gone a bit darker, it could have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the death of Superman, the world has become more aware, for better or worse, of the existence of metahumans and their potential threat to society. In case another powerful being shows up that doesn't exactly stands by Superman's moral code, the U.S. government wants to be prepared. This is why Officer Amanda Waller teams up a bunch of the best/worse criminals and forces them into a special ops mission in order to protect the world from evils even greater than themselves. Can Amanda trust the city's safety into a team of dangerous delinquents or will they try to turn against the government and run for their freedom?Suicide Squad is the 3rd movie in the current DCEU, directed by David Ayer and his vision of what an anti-hero DC movie looks like. As a casual superhero fan, I don't have much background knowledge on the Squad. So this movie overtime became an opportunity to learn more about the more the more obscure DC characters that the mainstream audience may ignore. When the movie was initially announced, it seemed to be another dark and gritty entry in the DC movie series, but sometime after the BvS backlash and the success of Deadpool there was word that some scenes were re-shot to make the movie "more fun". Whatever that means. Now I didn't want to make much of it at the time, but then the marketing for this movie shifted into what I like to call "unicorn puke" level of color and imagery. I had concerns about it as it seemed that they were forcing to make this movie seem 'funner' than it actually was. How did that turn out?Let's begin with the good stuff. I absolutely loved the characters, specially Amanda, The Joker, Harley Quinn in all her annoying punch line glory, Will Sm.. I mean Deadshot, Enchantress, El Diablo? I do think this movie's characters are very appealing and the cast certainly played their roles respectfully. I would love to see more of them in the future. Also the idea of an anti-hero team fighting a greater evil is pretty cool because that makes their motivations a lot more sensitive rather than just "doing what's right". The beginning scenes and the final battle were pretty exciting and loved every second of those. The cameos from the Justice League members were glorious. I admit I felt a sense of comfort and hype whenever Batffleck showed up in the movie. It really made this movie feel like a bridge to even greater things from the DC camp. I am from the crowd that does love the epicness Zack Snyder has brought to DC, so even though this movie was probably never meant to be as ambitious, I still had high standards for it. So that being said, there were things about it that certainly felt rough. Around the middle of the film particularly the pace is extremely slow, and I blame this on the fact that they started having deep conversations about the characters yet they spent very little time letting us get familiar enough with these characters. Their origin stories were literally reduced to a montage of 1 minute snippets each. It would have still been nice to have some extra context to them so we could relate more when the middle drama happened. Also, this made the movie feel like a 1 hour long "walk towards the building" scene were the only threat were putty-patrol looking baddies. The icing to the raw cake was that the "forced fun" was very blatant with the random mainstream songs shoved into the scenes and the non-funny cliché one-liners thrown almost every minute.Suicide Squad is a decent entry in the DCEU that while not my favorite, I still found enjoyable enough to celebrate and talk about. It does indeed help expand the lore of the DCEU and makes a better case for the Justice League than BvS did. Now after this movie we know how far society would go to embrace both the best side and the worse side of the metahumans war. It is a nice diversion until we get the upcoming more epic entries in this film series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think ultra fans will hate this film but I thought the film was entertaining. You sort of going to have to do you homework a bit if you don't know who these guys are. They are DC villains and since the rise of the anti-hero, DC decided that it would be fun to through a "what if" scenario. What if the villain becomes the hero and thus the Suicide Squad, named so because the government wouldn't care if they die. The movie does a brief introductions to each villain and assumes that the audience knows who they are.. and if you don't, if may be confusing. After that brief intro the movie just jumps right into it. Between the intro and "the mission".. there is a giant plot (or lack of plot) hole. Will Smith is the unofficial leader of the bad guys and Will Smith plays Will Smith in all his movies. Listen its not a clean movie. It is, truly like a live issue of a comic book. Lots of action. i wasn't bored. A lot of the other villains (outside of DeadShot and Harley Quinn) are kind of glossed over. Maybe I like it because Batman vs Superman was long and boring. This was short and to the point. If you want more, see another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film.. clearly retarded motivations works for the cast of It's Always Sunny in Philly (we need welfare money, time to smoke crack)..but here, no logic.I cringe at the generic villain of this film.. Flag, the team's babysitter. Has a babysitter for himself in Katana, which I kind of tossed in with the other SS members even though she traps souls in her sword which is a little too cool to dismiss so easily, but anywho.. Flag in a relationship with Enchantress' vessel June, was introduced at the time we were populating the squad with blocks of cheese as anti-heroes. So at the same time the SS was being assembled, the villain of our movie was farmed in house by Waller, This was sooooo lazy...soooo confusing.. I thought Enchantress was gonna be a team member because of the love for Flag.. the villain of this movie was farmed from the same boardroom meeting that was to green light the squad's members.WTF. I know, you could have spent those brain cells you just lost on something productive like taking drugs, but no.moving on.. I only liked El Diablo, as it was the only anti-hero that seemed like a human being you may know. His powers came with a terrible price, so his reluctance seemed like the only proper writing in the entire movie. That, and he could BBQ everything in the movie if he wanted which would destroy the need for a team to begin with.The Joker was not menacing, Jared Leto made him cartoon-ish and entirely laughable. Colorful, but even when him &amp; Harley kill Common's character..the taste of WTF in my mouth was never far. I remember Joker being annoyed by Harley, she was the Joker's tool-bag assistant. Why all the romance? the producers playing Chuck Woolry or something??? they want Jared &amp; Margot to hook up like the stars of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith??? I dunno..WTF. just wanted Joker to be as I love him (even though I'm a marvel &amp; Image guy) intensely homicidal in his psychosis. insta-ultra-violent clown, what is so hard to understand about that?!I just get the impression that I, a mortal, solo, could snatch the life out of every one of these characters like I was ordering a pizza delivered.. well, all of em' except El Diablo.Have plenty of respect for Ben Affleck's skills, but he looks like a hoe-cake in the Bat costume, this confuses me. No batman for me, for like a decade I guess. Perhaps it was his fight sequence with Jenn Garner's Electra in Daredevil, If it was a real world fight... I would have put twenty beanz on Jenn via KO in the 3rd. (/sigh)Evan Peter's Quicksilver sequences in both of the X-Men films he was in, are just waaaaaaaaay tighter and more entertaining than Suicide Squad was as a whole. Will Smith is still cooler than the other side of the pillow, but he couldn't save this tripe. There simply isn't any actual story telling going on with this film.Watch Ant-man again instead. A complete film with origin perfectly paced throughout the story. With Suicide Squad there can be no sequel.. only reboot.</fullReview>

Now here are some things you should probably know, the acting in this movie was awesome, everything else however was awful. Now here's what seems to have happen. They shot something like 4 hours worth of footage, combined it was possibly one of the best versions of suicide squad that could have been made. Now here's what happen after that, the director cut that movie to shreds, but it doesn't stop there, he actually rearranged the cut parts of the movie to make it seem like a completely different movie then was shot. So now you have a terrible movie that was once a good movie that is now a clutter of moments out of order that seems like absolute chaos. If you're wondering why I'm giving this movie a 5/10 it's because the acting was THAT good. They can very easily save this movie from itself, just release the directors cut on DVD, the full 4 hours, and pray that everyone forgets about the stitched together abomination of a movie you attempted to show in theaters.</fullReview>

I'll make it short. The dialogue is cliché The story is cliché The story at times didn't make sense There were too many ideas &amp; characters thrown together at the same time so it didn't make sense and really didn't do anything.. "Solid"- as if the movie is a few incomplete movies. Plus, they didn't need these many characters. Almost no character development. Cliché *Spoilers* The Joker (which I didn't really find this interesting. Yeah, here and there's a bit of a nice joke but that's it) did not contribute IN ANYTHING regarding to the plot except for the exposition. Hell, all he did in the movie is to make it a bit longer and a sad attempt in the end to show there will be a second movie or some kind of sequel.Another character is the climbing guy. I don't even remember his name. WHY THEY NEEDED HIM!? ALL HE DOES IS TO DIE. You can even tell he is not going to live because he is the only one in the s.squad to not have exposition. If he had one it would have made his death more surprising and interesting.The Australian and the Japanese girl added nothing. They made almost, if at all, no change in the plot. So did the croc-guy. And the human-torch had 1 thing to do in the movie - Become another super-powered being so he can stall the bad guy and get redemption.Do you realize that if the boss-woman hadn't made the suicide squad in the first place, the witch thingy wouldn't have happened? OH AND THE WITCH THINGY!The "Villain"(????). No actual motives except "yaarrggg I'm evil". She builds a weapon. OK. What the weapon does? NOBODY KNOWS AND ITS NOT EXPLAINED PROPERLY (If at all). The worst part- They had to have a happy ending so the girl that the witch took over still lived in the end.They should have taken "Civil War" as an example for a good movie with a huge ass cast. Throwing away un-eeded characters, cutting scenes that are repetitive or just un-needed and making a better and more realistic dialogue and a villain with a clearer motive. (Despite that the villain in civil war kinda sucked.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC's best movie so far, which isn't necessarily a good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that Suicide Squad is the most dividing movie to come from the DC universe yet and considering the last one was Batman vs Superman that says a lot. Despite what you may hear the film is not terrible however it is also not the greatest film ever, not by a long shot. This is inherently no ones fault, sometimes film makers can do everything right and the film still falls flat, the reason Suicide Squad isn't the masterpiece everyone thought it would be can be attributed to the fact that Warner Bros have no faith in their movies, while at the same time are rushing them out half baked.It's no secret that Suicide Squad featured heavy re-shoots and is rumoured to have around 25 deleted scenes, a decision made when Batman vs Superman began to receive the onslaught of negative reviews that now surround it. Not only this but Writer/director David Ayer wrote the script in just over three weeks. How ever despite this the movie manages to be a fun film, it has flaws yes but a lot of people seem to be blowing them way out of proportion.First things the first, the first half hour to 45 minutes of the movie are a hot mess. The editing is choppy, the pacing is all over the place and the less said about how the soundtrack fits in the better. The film bombards you with information on all the characters in such a way that you just feel overwhelmed. Some of the intros work well such as Deadshot's and Captain Boomerang's, however other characters like Killer Croc seem over and done with before you even know who they are. Sometimes it's the opposite, too much time is spent on one character when we already know all we need to. Most of the supposed deleted scenes are apparently from this part of the film and I think if they included these scenes or spent a little more time on polishing it could have been a fine introduction to the characters.Despite this the movie picks up after the team has been assembled, and thanks to good dialogue and a lot of chemistry between the actors the movie becomes a lot more entertaining. Action scenes are fun and engaging and while I do think a higher age rating would have benefited them they are still enjoyable to watch. All characters have a role to play with the exception of Katana who really doesn't bring anything to the film as a whole, she is by no means badly acted just unnecessary when time spent on her could have been spent on the other characters. Will Smith and Margot Robbie give it their all with Deadshot and Harley Quinn and their friendship is so refreshing to see on screen. Jai Courtney even brings the funny with Captain Boomerang and is a great addition to the ensemble. However the stand out is Jay Hernandez as Diablo who quite literally brings a fiery passion to his character and his story is the most interesting to see unfold as the movie progresses.Of course the film still has a few minor flaws such as generic villains (well villains of our villains) and certain mishaps in direction and writing. This could possibly be attributed to the fact the movie was rushed or just David Ayer trying to do something different, but these don't make the film unwatchable by any means. I do believe that if the other DC movies weren't as bad as they are people wouldn't have been so hard on Suicide Squad but that is not the case. In the end it's by no means a bad film but with the opening being as jarring as it is and the other minor flaws dotted around DC falls short of the bar yet again. However I do think that if the film does get an extended cut we will see a more clean and thought out version of the Squad, not like the underwhelming, so called "ultimate cut" of Batman vs Superman" For now it's just a fun and silly action movie.I will say this: oh boy does it get you excited for a Batman solo outing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are good bad movies, then there is suicide squad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By that I mean a bad movie can be enjoyable when it seems innocently bad. Like the room and such. Then there are movies that are the true definition of bad. Movies without heart, or charm, or the care that should be put into an art form such as a film. Suicide squad, is one of the truly bad bad movies. I'll highlight the things that bothered me most and try to keep this short. 1: none of the characters are the characters we know and love. None. They feel like cosplayers making a home movie about the characters they like. Except cosplayers are better actors. Especially Robbie. 2: none of these characters are relevant. Except for deadshot, and Harley. Everyone else takes a backseat. Boomerang is ignored. Croc is ignored. And diablo is sort of in between. 3: these characters are diminutive in comparison to their enemy. Suicide squad is made up of, loony girl with bat, sniper guy, crocodile person, fire spitter, and man with boomerang. Their enemy? Literal ancient gods with unbelievable power. Superman can battle something like that and it make sense. Not the suicide squad. They feel so out of place. The entire story is ruined by this oversight. 4: everyone uses urban slang. Literally, everyone. Even the ancient gods they are fighting use slang terms. Because its cool I guess? It really destroys the already messy feel of the film. 5: nothing is coherent. Everything is broken. The plot just kind of happens in front of you without explanation. What is that thing? Why is that person doing what they are doing? The movie never says, it just expects you to know. 6: rather than show the insanity of the movies main attraction, let's instead highlight it to you by having everyone say "damn bitch you crazy" on repeat. Throughout the film you never get any real insanity from Harley. Instead you are just reminded she's off her rocker by characters telling her she is. All. The. Time. 7: was this group assembled because of their abilities? What abilities? We never see them. The movie never makes use of any characters abilities which got them in suicide squad in the first place. The only who does is deadshot, who gets a couple decent scenes. Boomerang maybe throws a single boomerang, you hear Harleys bat crack, croc growls, and diablo is too scared to use his powers but once throughout the movie. That's it. Why create a movie with all these good characters then do nothing with them? 8: what's wrong with you people? In one scene flag, the army guy (that's all his character really is) that has been left in control of the squad gets triggered when Harley smashes a window to steal a purse. He then yells "what's wrong with you people?!" You have a team of known insane people and criminals. Who wrote this line? And there are others like it throughout the film! 9: Harleys butt. This is the only focus of her character. Her butt gets more screen time than her characters mental intricacies. Its clear that was the only reason she was involved with this film and this use of her butt is disgraceful and an embarrassment. There. That's a few highlights. I could go on for 1000 more lines. But I won't. Just don't waste money to see this. Don't let warner justify this films horrible existence. They don't deserve the right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go Watch Batman the animated series instead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie I went into expecting exactly what I came out with. And that was indifference. I love DC comics! But a lot of the comic book movies have be trying too hard to bring them into the real world. Special effects constantly and bland over all villains made this movie tedious to watch. Honestly Gotham should not feel like LA or New York to anyone, they are comic book worlds. So 'modernizing' characters with tattoos everywhere,gang banger tactics, show downs at clubs, making everything about sex is just disturbing. Why was it more appealing to make Harley wear underwear and a creepy t-shirt rather than her court jester outfit? Because you can only be the ultimate bad guy if you have skin showing and are a sex kitten? I don't think so, bad ash villains come with class, dignity and just a pinch of crazy! The army enchantress created was terribly weak...but somehow the millions of bullets the Gotham task force fired couldn't hit one of those guys. Then you see Harley Quinn is killing them with a wooden bat. Yep OK. The dialogue seemed to be made up on the spot,flat and dull and lewd with swears tsk tsk. Violence towards women is always a crowd pleaser and yet it's NOT! Superheros and even the villains use to live by a code it's sad they thought it'd be cooler without it. Another big uh-oh was the music in the movie.I know everyone has their own soundtracks to life but the constant changing of songs was pretty annoying honestly. Finally the biggest thing I could not look past was the Joker/Harley Quinn moments. There was too many back stories, they really should have just made their own movie about them if they wanted to go that way. The Joker never loved or cared about Harley, she loved him but he abandoned her. I heard they were going to go that way but test audiences didn't like it. But why even make a movie about any of these characters if you're just going to change them into new ones. And finally my last grudge against Suicide Squad, The Joker laughs like the Penguin but I have always liked the Penguin more. 5 stars because it could have been worse but it definitely could have been better! If you want the best DC comics stories I suggest (other than reading the comic books) watching Batman the animated series. All the same characters but none of the ridiculousness of this movie. The characters in the animated series stay true to the comics and the stories always the viewers coming back for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here Me out, cause I think I make a good point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a lot to say, but bare with me because I think you'll agree.This movie has such promise, and I was so excited to see it, but what happened?! The jump cuts were awful, there was no back story on some characters, too much on others, Joker wasn't even necessary in this film, I felt they gave Will Smith way too much of the story, the villains made no sense, the personality shifts from "You're my problem" to "*weeping* "Save my possessed Girlfriend" OR to Will Smith from *I'm an assassin for hire, I don't love" to *weeping* "Harley is my bff, I have to do it for my daughter!"...WHAT?! Speaking of which! Deadshot somehow SPEED READING a Top Secret Book he happened to find in a Closed Purse that it took Viola Davis half the first act to explain over steak?? Well Now I'm mad! Lets go drink Cocktails and shots slowly while said Davis gets her brain scrambled! It's not like the world is ending.....ALSO! You can't make a sacrifice of yourself for your "family" when the entire movie you sat in the background doing absolutely nothing, and refusing to interact with other characters establishing any sort of audience or character connection, then jump to "This is my family! I won't loose another!" Who are you, Vin Diesel!? It makes no sense! There were NO Establishing shots which makes a total disconnect from the viewing, Half the time I was thinking "...wait what" instead of "oh that's cool" and what was with the unnecessary slowdown at the end, which made the scene seem cheesy rather than heroic. As much as I love Maggie Roberts, what was with her accent coming in and out?! In the 3rd reel, she went from Harley Quinn to Jersey Shore! HOWEVER! the BIGGEST What the Balls moment was, THAT was NOT the mission she had planned for them. The Enchantress just went rogue in the first act. So what WAS the actual mission?! THAT'S what I want to know. It felt like this would have been the side mission, or the finale, but the entire movie is based on the fact that Enchantress busted out her brother and wants to build a machine to..kill everyone? Enslave everyone? Rule? WTF was her point?! But the biggest thing was that SHE was not the intended mission. They had one lined up.Joker wasn't even in this movie. He made no interaction with characters minus flashbacks and the one time he DOES interact it was with Harley for all of 3 minutes, but then he gets blown out of the sky, and she lands right back to the group, NONE of that need to happen!! You could have wrote the scene of him leaving her in prison via texts and still come to that moment in the rain on the cop car, and the movie still would have went on. IN FACT! IT would have made more sense, and been more of a surprise if at the end when he bursts into the prison that's the first time you see him! All in all, 5/10 Because to be fair, everything but the Villains graphically were awesome, the soundtrack was abrupt but well put together, and the acting from the big shots was excellent, and I actually did LIKE what they did to Joker and Harley.Not that anyone cares about my opinion, but tada.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most reviewers, I enjoyed the first 20 minutes. It had a fun tone. It felt like a movie that wasn't going to take itself too serious (like, dare I say it, Deadpool). But then... it does.It's hard to even begin where this movie goes wrong, but I'll give it a try. So many characters are shoehorned in that you don't really get to know any of them. They become one-dimensional characters with stupid one-liners. Especially Harley Quinn's sad attempts at being funny. It's cringe worthy. They try to rush the story forward, while also trying to build its characters. This is done with flashbacks that sometimes pop up so randomly and appear to hold no bearing on the story or the character for that matter(!). They're more like visual anecdotes, that contain stupid trivia. It's at this point that you realize things are only going downhill from here. The action is lackluster (and doesn't even get the chance to shine because the whole movie is set in a dark, rainy environment). The acting is downright bad (yes, even Leto's Joker and Robbie's Quinn). Only Will Smith's Deadshot and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller were great. They really carried this movie and made it bearable.As for the plot. There wasn't really any. I could go on about how big of a mess this movie is and how the villain was stupid, but frankly I don't want to waste any further time discussing this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically, I would give 10 stars for Jared Leto as Joker and the chemistry between Joker and Harley. And then give negative ratings script, displaced characters and the humor. Harley Quinn kicking butt of alien-like characters with a baseball bat!!!! Seriously?? Apart from every scene of The Joker, this movie had nothing to offer for me. I waited for the whole year for this piece of crap. Disclaimer: I am a huge DC comics fan, so I was easily turned off by this shoddy attempt.

		<shortDescription>An Avengers style movie with a bit of Deadpool but with bad guys instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the horrendous 'Batman V Superman: The Dawn of Justice' I was hoping that this movie would be better and to be honest. It was average. But there were some flaws, major ones too. One of the characters I hate would be Slipknot, while they introduce us to the characters they never mentioned about him once and he was just there for a few minutes and then they killed him. So why do they need to introduce him? Why do they if he's not going to have any importance to the plot. They never mentioned him again and they don't seem to care about it. Next time if you're going to introduce the character that will have no impact towards the plot just don't do it. Second of all I hate how The Joker is so minimal within the movie when he did nothing that was important. But he's better than Jesse Eisenberg as a comedic version of Lex Luthor. But he was hyped up throughout the trailer acting like he's part of the team as well. But no DC decided to cut all his scenes out. Is he going to be part of a standalone Batman movie? I don't know, but most likely he is, but next time don't hype him up if he's going to have any bare part in it at all! But also a person suing WB because of it for some reason.Also why does a government official think it would be great to have a league of villains to stop the 'next' Batman? Even the characters question it. Why couldn't it be better to hype up the Justice League movie by having the JL characters band together and work as a team? Call it, 'The Dawn of Justice' I think it works that way better rather then this considering it feels like filler ready for the Justice League movie. The government official didn't even have a reason why to do this sort of thing anyway. We didn't see her wanting power, wanting to be better than the rest or anything all we see her is that woman who band these villains together.To be honest the actress of Quinn was pretty good though more average in my opinion. She definitely plays a crazy Quinn but some her lines that she delivered were sort of meh but the scene when she defeated the villain was good reverse psychology as we see her reverting a bit back to her old self like psychologist. I also like Will Smith's role too. The character he played, Deadshot. I like how he cares for his daughter despite what he does as a job. It definitely shows he has a heart and a human when it comes to the people he loves. Plus some of his lines that he delivered were good too as they have that Will Smith charm to it as well, especially, 'Lady, you are evil!' The same applies to El Diablo he felt bad for what he had done to his family and become a pacifist and rather not to kill anybody else. I think those three characters deserve there own movie and they should've been built up for this one like Marvel did for the Avengers. It would've been better if we get to know the characters and see them battling together. Plus it feels like Deadpool with the dark humour but trying to be serious as well.The other characters were bland or not really funny. I don't think Captain Boomerang was funny. His humour feels very childish and annoying and he hardly had any development nor backstory and pretty much most of the other characters in the squad didn't really have enough focus or time. Since there are deleted scenes it's not really surprising considering that DC and Warner Bros. had ripped some of the fans off with the theatrical version of Batman V Superman.The villain, Enchantress in my opinion was pretty meh. She was not really threatening, her motivation was cliché and the whole flash thing that she did was not really anything and the CG, I think, for her was really bad. Her head stayed still but her body was shaking for some reason. In the end it was average but I don't think it's worth it for a moviegoer and since it's most likely this'll be down voted by DC Fanboys, bear in mind critics are people too and they too a movie fans as well. They have their own opinions like many things because like art, music etc. films are subjective, period and there's no such thing as a right or wrong opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't waste your money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is painful to watch. DC comics has no idea what it is doing. This was their answer to deadpool and it simply sucks. Harley Quinn is the only character in here that is even remotely entertaining. Jared Leto is the worst joker I have ever seen. He is terrible. His lines are terrible, his acting is terrible, it's an embarrassment to even associate the joker with him. Will Smith flops in another movie. His ego has seriously blown his head up way to big. He simply puts no effort into roles now. He just mails it in. I was expecting a whole lot more from this movie. It's the most pathetic group of "bad guys" I have ever seen. This whole movie should have been shelved day one. The script was awful, most of the casting was awful, most of the acting was awful, and the directing was horrible. DC is just having a very hard time in putting anything together. First Batman vs Superman was an epic failure now this. They both suffer from the same problems too. How can you not learn from your mistakes. I would suggest everyone else does and not waste their money on this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad is a meh movie saved by its cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad suffers from the same disease as last year's Fant4stic: it's a lackluster movie that had the potential to be mind-blowing. Although the visuals are great, the directing sucks. Much like Batman v. Superman, the first act is hilariously overedited, feeling awkward and disjointed, like a huge hour long trailer for the film. There's a bunch of montages to introduce all the members of the squad except for like two, who straight up appear out of nowhere. The second act feels generic and uninspiring, but the endgame finally feels kind of adequate, despite its' random use of slow-mo in the final battle. Other problems I had with the directing was that a major sacrifice really lacked weight to the point that I thought said character was going to come back in the end (so basically just like Quicksilver in Age of Ultron) and that the movie was just filled to the brim with flashbacks, sometimes even unnecessarily repeating them, like Batman v. Superman did, and puts them in some pretty weird places. That last problem might be very much a consequence of introducing a whole lot of characters with large backstories that haven't starred in previous films before.The plot was also pretty lame. Suicide Squad/Task Force X is supposed to go on deep cover black ops missions, but this film just put them on the generic "defeat the villain/save the city" type deal, which is highly disappointing. The villain was also pretty disappointing, and had no depth (despite the studio's desperate attempts to inject depth into it). Also there's a whole lot of scenes that would be kind of cool on their own, but feel completely out of place when inserted into the actual plot. Another problem with the writing in general is that this movie is one of those that tell all the good jokes in the trailers. The best thing about this movie by far is its cast, but like the X- Men franchise, not everyone gets a chance to shine. At some points, it just feels like the Harley/Deadshot show. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is fantastic, and gets the character really well. My only problem with her is her interactions with Joker, but I'll get to that later. Will Smith's Deadshot is also one of the best characters in the film, getting a lot of screen time and great lines but he feels just like your standard smartass Will Smith character, lacking the true moral grayness of Floyd from the comics. Other outstanding cast members are Jay Courtney's Captain Boomerang, who despite being utterly useless compared to the other members of the squad is a great source of comic relief and fantastic character in general, and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, who is probably the most comics-accurate character out of all the cast. The rest of the cast is either completely reduced to the background like Katana and Killer Croc, who gets only a couple of good lines in between the occasional snarl, or attempt to give the film some ethos but fall short due to mediocre storytelling, like El Diablo and Rick Flagg. The worst character by far is Cara Delevigne's Enchantress, who probably was the most inadequate out of all the main cast in terms of both acting and writing.Then, there's Jared Leto's Joker. I was honestly scared that he was going to steal the show away from the rest of the cast, but he literally does the complete opposite. He's featured so very little in the film, that I honestly can't get a good read on the performance. He also suffers the same problem Spider-Man has in Civil War as in he doesn't really need to be in the movie at all. Another problem I had with him was relationship with Harley is pretty problematic, seeing that it should be a mostly manipulative and screwed up with some occasional beautiful moments of "true love", but in the movie, it's 99% "true love". Jokley should NOT be relationship goals.Overall, this movie is arguably one of the biggest letdowns of 2016, but definitely still worth a watch. 6.5/10 stars; the best things about it were its cast, costume design, and marketing campaign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple Pros &amp; Cons List - No Spoilers - "What's with DC and Instant Friendships?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Just like the film, this review is NOT bound or subject to the original Suicide Squad comics. They are different, and that is okay.CONS:? A "Trailer Movie" - most of the film seems like it was made for the gazillions of trailers that were released. It's never good when 40%-50% of the film feels like something you've already seen in a commercial. Not only that, but it all felt as if it were just a trailer for upcoming solo films/Justice League. Marketing did a phenomenal job with this film.? Run-of-the-Mill Conflict/Story Arc - SOOOOOO yawn-worthy. A completely generic, factory-produced superhero conflict/story arc/antagonist in an already superhero-saturated Hollywood. They really need to start considering more creative angles with this stuff.? Sympathy for psychopaths? - the director definitely was trying to make the audience "feel bad" for Harley Quinn and the Joker. Anyone else find that strangely uncomfortable?? Corny/Immature Script - pretty self-explanatory. Movie lacked any intellectual conversation/humor, seemed like it was written to entertain a group of (PG-)13 year olds.? Diablo - an "eh" character who's actions are totally predictable.? What's with DC and Instant Friendships? - did anyone else notice that the characters had absolutely minimal personal interaction before they started saying dumb stuff like "no one hurts my friends!" (or whatever). Reminds me of another major DC movie that came out earlier this year... *sips tea*? Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Reigns Superior - this movie felt like DC's attempt to top GotG, by using 'grittiness' as the competitive factor. Unfortunately (if this were their true intention), only an R rated Suicide Squad would have had the potential to dethrone the group-superhero king.? Serious Pacing Issues - not that the pacing was fast, but it was disorganized. Fast then slow then flashback then action then flashback etc.PROS:? Harley Quinn's Portrayal, Motives &amp; Background - as expected, Margot Robbie nailed this performance. Not to mention, they actually did a spectacular job depicting Harley Quinn's involvement with the Joker and her true, deepest desires (that scene was SO good &amp; kinda sad).? The Joker - they succeeded in their quest to introduce a new, unique, spectacle of a Joker, and Jared Leto was envelopingly creepy. His new portrayal of being a 'gangster-ish' villain is a nice twist on the character, but they didn't demonstrate enough reasons for why people should actually FEAR him. I'm sure this will be addressed in future films, though.? Batman V Deadshot - okay maybe this is my wildcard, but I thought they set-up this inter-character conflict in a suspenseful, interesting manner. I'm definitely looking forward to future interactions between the two. ? Continues More Fluent Universe than Marvel CU - Suicide Squad was very fluent, in that it kept the continuity of the DC Universe more clean and organized than the muddled/permeated Marvel CU.? Good Soundtrack - a great mix of modern music with gritty twists/remixes; some sequences had a "Great Gatsby (2013)" feel to it, which is always a good thing.OVERALL:Suicide Squad was a marketing-based film. More effort/creativity went into the advertising rather than the production itself. Regardless, it was fun-to-watch and had its bright moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average movie with fun characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My honest word on Suicide Squad is that it is an average comic book movie, but with a roster of fun characters. The movie actually started really strong. It used a series of flashback scenes to fill the audience in on the character's backgrounds and the squad themselves were all brilliant, although they definitely focused on some of the characters more than others. For example; Deadshot and Harley Quinn definitely got more screen time and development than Captain Boomerang and Katana, but that didn't bother me too much as they actually added some emotional depth to the character of Deadshot by introducing you to his daughter. There were also some excellent cameos from other DC characters as well, including Batman's flashback scene from the trailer with Joker and Harley Quinn, which was great as you get to see the DCEU starting to develop its history.Unfortunately though, there were issues with the movie as well. The overall plot was quite weak and the reasoning for creating the Squad (to stop Superman or an alien like Superman if they attacked Earth) showed a lack of creativity. There is absolutely no one in the squad who could even scratch an alien like Superman and I hope DC come up with some more ideas for their movies going forward, instead of just falling back onto the events that took place in Man Of Steel. Also, I should mention that while I didn't mind some members of the Squad getting a bit more development than others, there were definitely at least a couple characters that while portrayed well, were completely wasted.The antagonists in this movie were okay, although you've seen their type before. There was nothing particularly interesting about them or their motives that made them memorable.The movie did contain an entertaining soundtrack, albeit slightly overused. You could tell they were going for a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe, but overall it worked in the movie's favour as it did add a little extra style.I'm glad to say that I enjoyed Leto's performance as The Joker. Most of his scenes were fantastic with only a few that came off a bit pretentious. It's unfortunate that the studio cut a few of his good scenes from the trailers but overall, I thought he gave us an interesting take on the character that differs from other recent on- screen incarnations.Overall, I had fun with the flashback scenes, the squad were portrayed perfectly and what I saw of Leto's Joker I was happy with. The actual characters are by far the best part of the movie. Unfortunately though, the movie does falter with its by-the-numbers story and villain, but I still enjoyed seeing it in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Step Up For DC, Which is Not Saying Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I have high hopes for 'Suicide Squad'? Not really. I had some low expectations, but after 'Dawn of Justice' I lost all faith in DC's new "extended universe". I sincerely wanted to like this movie, but it hasn't rekindled my hopes. The first 20-30 minutes is easily the best part. Despite being exposition-heavy, the characters each had their own little bits that made me interested in them. Unfortunately, I lost that interest not long after. Even the main characters in this film don't feel like main characters. Not one soul on screen is utilized to their full potential, or even half-way. How can I care about this new team of antiheroes when only three of them have more than five lines? Look, sometimes superhero movies get crowded, and they don't have time to explain weird things like why a Japanese ninja chick has a sword that traps people's souls. But could we get a little depth to these characters? The few characters that are used aren't spectacular, and I'm looking mainly at Deadshot. Will Smith's every line just felt cringe- worthy. One eye-rolling one-liner after another. Viola Davis played a character who may not ever be seen again, despite all the questions you'll have about her reasoning behind this. It's very unrealistic to think that this band of misfit criminals is who the government would choose to send after a mystical witch (who, by the way, is one of the worst supervillains I've seen in a long, long time). Simply put, the plot should have been completely different and the villain a much more grounded, realistic antagonist. Joel Kinnaman gets the worst actor award this go-round, but at least it doesn't go to Jai Courtney, who for once doesn't ruin his every scene.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn? Loved it. Jared Leto as the Joker? Loved it. While you can tell he did good with his part, you can't really tell what it is he did good because he has such a small amount of screen time (thus the answer to the question "is Heath Ledger still the best Joker?" goes unanswered for now). Hopefully an extended version boosts this up, because I was absolutely thrilled by every sequence with Joker and Harley Quinn, and what it made me realize is that these two need their own movie. What is this Suicide Squad? Who cares? Let's have a Bonnie-and-Clyde- style crime film with these two wreaking havoc in Gotham. I will pay my last ten dollars to see it. Until then, this film has only left me wanting something completely different. It's a giant, two-hour teaser trailer for what could be, but isn't and likely never will be. I don't know what really went on when they were doing reshoots, but this film wasn't funny (I don't have any sort of problem with that, mind you) and every bit of footage that was cut should have been kept. R rating or not. The soundtrack didn't help things, though it didn't necessarily hinder. They probably should have dialed it down a notch, given every scene virtually has its own theme song, but I wasn't distracted. This film had so much potential. Moreso than 'Batman v. Superman'. It's watchable, unlike the latter. But it's no more a keeper than its predecessor in the end. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a comic book fan (graphic novel?! Yeah, right!) so know nothing about the original story or characters.The trailer made the film look amazing! Great action, explosions, design etc. It turned out that the trailer contained all the best parts of the film and was enough for you to say you'd now seen 'Suicide Squad'.By far the highlight of the film was Margot Robbie. She continues to show shy she is a first class Hollywood draw and one of the most beautiful women in the World. Her performance as 'Harley Quinn' contained scenes of humour, fear, anger etc etc etc and all were brilliant. Her backside got plenty of screen time, probably more through design than luck.Well Smith played his usual role of Will Smith.Cara Delevingne, who I'd never heard of and was surprised to hear is a model, was very wooden. I'm sure a far better casting choice could have been made.A lot of the earlier scenes jumped around and made little sense. There were several lines of speech that were incoherent.The film did not live up to the trailer, the storyline was thin and short-lived. It wasn't a terrible film, but it's not great. In the long run it will be remembered as another edition to the long list of poor DC Comic films like the terrible 90's Batman films and all the awful Superman films. The future releases don't look good either. It was nowhere near as bad as Batman v Superman!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st Trailer - Awesome 2nd Trailer - Awesome 3rd Trailer - Showed too much of the film and a bunch of low budget effects from something out of a Universal Studios movie like Scorpion King.In the end there was a lot of scenes in the trailers that weren't in the movie. The plot was really different then it should have been. The "bad" boss" characters were poorly thought out. Effects were low budget, think SyFy channel. Sound was mixed too hot, think "Fury" with Brad Pitt.Either the studio pulled funding like "Deadpool" (which could have been even better then it already is) or someone decided the film needed a hack editing job and took out all the decent footage.Hopefully we'll see a much better re-cut version like "Salt" with Jolie which gives us a different and better version of the film then what ended up in theaters.I love Warner Brothers, and many of there other movies like Batman are done so much better. But someone really screwed up on this project. Sets could have been better. Special effects could have been way better. The whole "big boss" plot was stupid, the plot could have been so much better in so many ways. They didn't really use The Joker like they could have, or any other crazy villains.Felt like a low budget TV movie between The Mummy, Ghost-busters (original), and Avengers.PLEASE WB correct your mistake and give us a re-cut Suicide Squad version 1.5 !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing for what looked like such a good resurgence for DC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American government agency recruits a group of the worlds most dangerous super villains to destroy a huge threat that can only be stopped by this group of people.I was really looking forward to this film. So were many other people. It seems that critics ,not all but a fair majority, haven't been impressed by it. So does DC's newest film look as good as the trailers made it out to be? Unfortunately the answer is no. Suicide Squad is once again ,following on from March's Batman Vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice, disappointing. The film spends the first hour referring back to Batman Vs Superman, building up to next year's Justice League ,which is all Batman Vs Superman did, and introducing characters only to refer back to the points expressed in multiple backstories in constant flashbacks throughout the film. Then when the plot does finally kick in the pace and tone is literally Quiet Quiet Quiet... Enemies... BANG BANG BANG, GUNS GUNS GUNS, SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT, EXPLOSIONS, FLASH FLASH, BANG BANG BANG, KABOOM!!! All ended when a character says something like "That was fun" or "That was crazy". And while a quick filler scene is happening the crew reset the stage making it look a bit different and then the previous fight scene is done again. Back to the filler scene with the exact same basis then back to a fight and this is literally how the entirety of the entire second half of the film goes. It gets to the point where you've seen it once you've seen all of it you might as well leave because that's the next hour of the film. At certain points the script just seem to focus on the characters of Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) As they seem to be the most explored and developed characters just so you feel for them and so there is something else to show in the filler scenes and this leaves out the rest of the characters out and barely shown. One character that is affected most by this is Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang who stands out when he's actually in a scene and provides most of the small amount of comic relief that the film holds ,so much for re shoots to make the film lighter and funnier. As for Jared Leto's Joker he doesn't seem to do much and isn't as psychotic and twisted as the trailers promised and is as much ,if not more, of a disappointment than the film itself is. He spends most of the film doing things that don't have relevance to the plot and just there to fill in between some scenes so the main team of bad guys can get from one fight scene destination to another. He has no real relevance until one scene that supports the films finale, but unfortunately he's just there for flashbacks and filler as he doesn't really shine and deliver what was hoped. Jared Leto himself has said that most of the Joker's scenes have been cut from the film and this is believable as there does seem to be a lot of him missing and certain scenes he was in might have made more sense if there was more explanation to them, but just like the rest of the film the Joker's story line is a bit of a mess. Once again a film studio needs to learn that lot's of action and fights with millions of dollars of the 175 million dollar budget spent on God knows how much CGI doesn't distract from a clunky plot and a film filled with problems.Unfortunately Suicide Squad was mis-sold to audiences and a fun action packed film turns out to be references and build up to past a future films followed by tedious repetition of the same plot and fight scenes every 15-20 minutes. It's a big disappointment, and possibly more than Batman Vs Superman was.......** &lt;-- Two Stars (Out Of Five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Suicide" sounds more like a suggestion than a title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the worst comic book movie of all time. It has a few moments that seem promising. If it wasn't for Deadshot, Diablo, and Harley Quinn doing really well, I'd probably drop the score down even more. The biggest problems come from the stupid plot, the lack of scenes (there's about 3 locations they focus on), and the useless characters. Oh, and the totally out of place music. Whoever focused on the soundtrack did a horrible job. They went after Guardians of the Galaxy and added a few oddly selected songs such as Eminem's Without Me.Deadshot and Harley Quinn are the true stars of the film. If you expected to see the Joker in the movie since they made such a big deal about him, you're going to be disappointed. He makes a few appearances for a total of 7 minutes in the entire film. I bet it took Jared Leto a total of 30 minutes to memorize his lines. There's other members of Suicide Squad but they're useless. Diablo kicks in later and isn't as useless as they obviously want him to seem. Killer Croc looks stupid. His head is really big for the body size. He didn't even look much bigger than Will Smith.The plot is just a joke. I felt like they really made the anti- heroes into just basic heroes. The "good guys" are the "bad guys". It's not interesting and during most of the combat scenes, they just felt boring. Lots of dust all over the screen mixed with slow-mo that you expect from comic movies these days.The only way I could see rating this movie favorable is if you're a fanboy/fangirl for movie adaptions of comic films. It's a decent Netflix watch for a lazy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bohemian Rhapsody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are already too many superhero (a term used very generically) teams in the market so let us get right to it. The interesting thing here is the slight departure from the formulaic lining up of the team. The introduction of the six initially "recruited" by government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is formulaic, but good with comic-style wit: Deadshot the never-miss hit-man (Will Smith); Harley Quinn the crazy blond (Margot Robbie); Boomerang with an unimaginative name that nevertheless accurately describes his skillset (Jai Courtney); Diablo who with a Hulk persona i.e. can be the most powerful of them all BUT only if he loses his temple which he strives not to (Jay Her Hernandez); Killer Croc (Adewale ASkinnouye-Agbaje) who could have been Ben Grimm teleported directly from "The Fantastic Four"; and finally Enchantress, an ancient Egyptian witch that possesses the body of gentle June Moone (Cara Delevingne).Rather than having these six go out there and kick some ass and have it done with, a few other characters are thrown in, with some mildly interesting plot twist. The Enchantress gets out of control, joins his ancient Egyptian brother to become the chief villains. Harley Quinn also has her own agenda, being the girlfriend of The Joker (Jared Leto) who is always expected to come to her rescue. While not possessed by the Enchantress, June Moone has a devoted boyfriend Rick Flag, a top-notch army man engaged by Amanda Waller to lead this Death Squad. Thrown into the pool in the last minute, wielding a deadly samurai sword, is Katana (Karen Fukuhara), sort of Waller's loyal bodyguard. So there you have it, the line-up of characters.If you do not enjoy these characters, you are out of luck because plot line is non-existing and the villains, other than the Egyptian siblings, are unimpressive: disposable faceless zombies descending en masse, not unlike the clones in Star War's clone wars. Action sequences deserve some credit, looking not too bad after trillions you have seen in the proliferation of action flicks in the last couple of decades.The cast may be the strongest draw. Davis as formidable "mean lady" must be having a lot of fun herself although this of course doesn't show. The main attraction for me, not knowing anything about these comic characters (my generation is the JLA, back in the time when Wonder Women wore red high heel pumps), is Smith and Robbie who displayed such chemistry in "Focus" (2015). While there is no similar pairing here, they are individually and separately charismatic. Oscar calibre actor Jared Leto goes all the way in drawing out the eccentric Joker. Jai Courtney who made his mark as Jack McClane in "A good day to die hard" (2013) is something of a show-stealer here.My summary line serves no other purpose than register my nod for the use of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in the final scenes (albeit only the first movement).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I entered the theater with high hopes despite the bad reviews the movie was getting. I left with disappointment and sadness.To me the main flaws were that the characters were undeveloped, the plot predictable and boring and it was full of chishes. And i mean a lot of clishes. Everything from El Diablo sacrificing himself to save others to pretend to join the villain but end up betraying him to character thought dead not dead etc.And the characters, oh my. The only real development was given to Harley Quinn, Deadshot and El Diablo. Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc were there for the one liners. All we know about them is: Boomerang robs banks and uses boomerangs and Killer Corc is a monster and he lives underground. Enchantress as the villain is like the evil witch from princess stories the way she talks and moves.You can watch it as a mindless cheesy action flick. It's basically The Expendables. I don't recommend seeing it,just wait for the BluRay.</fullReview>

GHOSTBUSTERS (the original one)BUT yeah , its fun and kinda fresh coming from DC. Interesting flashbacks script, comes and goes, not a lineal story but at least there is no MARTHA kinda crap. Cant wait for DA director's cut or something like that. Its not BATMAN BEGINS nor THE DARK KNIGHT, but at least its not a pile of crap like BVS.Will smith its good, Harley Quinn its Awesome (very close to the animated character) and the rest of the guys well, they r OK. Batman only appear in flashbacks so i cant complain of affleck.Lotta shootings, explotions and fight scenes make this movie something to enjoy...of course if Ur not looking for superman having sex dressed in a bathup or batman crying for his mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this. Marketing did a great job and the movie looked like a lot of fun. It started out fun too. The characters got short introductions. Some would say too short but I thought it was just right. Margot Robbie's Harley is funny (and hot!) And Jai Courtney makes a very cool Captain Boomerang. Will Smith acts well but could have taken things a little less serious and a bit more comedy. But when the real 'story' got going, it became just another superhero movie. The villain seeks nothing less than world domination, has an army of followers (who looked really stupid and reminded me of '90s Power Ranger opponents). Worst of all, there's a great beam in the sky where the villain's weapon is charging up. AGAIN! Why?! Has Hollywood declared it mandatory in a superhero flick? It has been done sooo many times it really annoyed me.Anyway, the fun ended. In multiple scenes we're shown that the squad, who are labeled as bad guys, have a bit of heroism in them. Will Smith tries to be serious (succeeds) and Jay Hernandez tries to be emotional (fails).I guess I was hoping for another Deadpool but got another BvS. Could have been great but ended clichéd. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sucide Squad, directed by Zack Synder. Had everyone at the edge of their seats. From the hype action of the endless trailers and advertising. I was expecting the most amazing superhero/villain movie. Different from the others.But I got a mess. The movie was slow and the flashbacks were extremely confusing. Especially the Joker(Jared Leto)and Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie)scenes. The joker was deemed dead but came back at the end of the movie. That really irritated me. Also, the editing was off. In scenes. You can here the actors losing their accents. Example when the Joker threatens the man in the science lab. We hear the real Jared Leo voice. Not the maniac Joker voice. Then Harley Quinn seems to transition to Margot's Australian. I was highly disappointed and the trailers really made it look great. I waited eight months for this movie for a knock-off. The losing of villains and the unnecessary action. Jeez. DC is just making more movies, whilst not thinking of the current movie. Its like they just rush. I'm sorry to say this. But Batman vs Superman(which got bad reviews) looked kinda good compared to the shock of this.I mean, go see it. But I regret paying money to see this. It seems they only make these movies for the money. Not the passion. I am obsessed with the DC universe. I really didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Minimum Acceptable for a Watchable Comic Book Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start Suicide Squad has felt like the DC answer for some of the recent Marvel movies with at best questionable "heroes". The easy review for this movie is to call it a poor excuse for a rip off from Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's really not fair to compare the two. Not because they are actually different, but because Guardians is in an entirely different class from Suicide Squad. There are some things in this movie that can give viewers for the future of the DC cinematic universe, but this is not the movie that will truly bring the word "cinematic" to the cinematic universe.The real reason that this movie is even passable is the strong work of the actors, like all of them. There are some huge character problems in Suicide Squad which i will get more into later, but really none of this is the fault of the actors. Will Smith and Margot Robbie really stand out, as they should being the real star power here. Smith brings a level of humanity to the worlds most dangerous assassin and not only that but makes the character likable, possibly the only legitimately likable character in the movie. Robbie is not just here "for the plot", she is truly mesmerizing on screen. Even with a character that struggles from being basically a female version of a character that is just awful, Harley is certainly a bright spot even though the she is toned down compared to the traditional take.The plot is fairly dull for the most part, they do make a good effort to realistically explain how a team of super villains fighting for the good guys, but I still constantly found myself wondering why they would not just call Batman or the Flash and avoid a lot of trouble. The movie uses the excuse that if the plans fail, the villains can be blamed, but with the well being of the entire planet at stake I think its time to stop saving skin and call in the professionals.The biggest flaw of the movie is that it was advertised as a full cast of villains and even some of your favorite heroes, which is partially true, but in the least inspired way. There are basically 5 characters in this movie that get prime spotlight, out of those 2 of them are absolutely terrible misrepresentations of classic characters. If you are a Killer Croc, El Diablo, Enchantress, Slipknot, Captain Boomerang or Katana fan be prepared to feel pushed to the side. The few times that they actually try to flesh out these characters it feels so canned and genuine. Amanda Waller is an interesting character, but honestly in a Suicide Squad movie I have no patience for bureaucrats. Rick Flagg is stunningly dull and brings nothing really to the table other than to push the story forward.I'm going to give the Joker his own paragraph, because so many things went wrong here. For starters this is not entirely Jared Leto's fault, my only hard complaint with him was that his performance was far too close to Heath Ledgers. From the cadence of his speech to even some of his mannerisms, Leto fails to separate himself from a all time great performance. Other than that the character is fundamentally flawed. This Joker is covered head to toe in gold and tattoos, which I would not have a huge problem with except they were so concerned with showing him off on the outside they forgot to make him an interesting villain. He is constantly playing out of character, from hanging out at night clubs in a sort of drug induced state for apparently no reason to be there at all to crying when he finds Harley has been arrested. Any self respecting portrayal of the Joker would not have him weep over her being taken. The Joker is an established character, and while there is always room for him to be tweaked a bit, but this is not the Joker, at least the one who wants to watch the world burn, he seems much more concerned with the color of his suit jacket.(BTW when it comes to the Joker the answer is purple, always purple, not white, not gold, purple.) For all of its shortcomings Suicide Squad is actually paced pretty well. Things move slowly at times but these were mostly character moments that for the most part were welcomed. Suicide Squad gave me flashbacks to Batman Vs. Superman in two frustrating ways. Surprisingly the action sequences were incredibly average, and not surprisingly the editing is terrible. For some reason the last 2 DC movies have been way behind the times when it comes to action sequences. Characters stand around and watch a fight, no one works in unison with each other. The editing of this movie in my opinion is the dark mark. Not only is it ridiculously sloppy, but severely disjointing at times. I may be a bit of a stickler for these sorts of things but when you are so far behind your competitor these things add up.Suicide Squad could have been a really good movie. I know there were problems in development but I honestly think it was doomed from the start. This movie held the possible weight of an entire mega franchise on it's shoulders, and it is just not set up to be that movie. Given less pressure to make a blockbuster I think that we would have gotten a much better Suicide Squad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This squad brings the heat and they're the bad guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in March, there have been a lot of shock and awe from people that "Batman V Superman" was a bit of a disappointment. I didn't think so, but I was hoping that the DC Extended Universe was starting to get better because we have "Justice League" and "Wonder Woman" coming out next year. But right now, we'll make do with "Suicide Squad". This movie has also been on the negative end for critics, but I found it to be a stylish and thrilling comic adventure with some nice standout performances courtesy of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman. Now I'm not gonna reveal some of the secrets of this movie, but I'm willing to give you a heads up. Following the events of "BvS", Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) decides to come up with an idea to hire the worst of the worst villains in order to take down more evil bad guys. We actually get to meet them. First, there's Deadshot (Will Smith), a contract killer with a heart of gold. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), a man with a dark past and a power to shoot fire out of his hands. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who lives in the sewer of the prison and most definitely look like a crocodile. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), a goofy Australian schemer who uses his boomerangs. And, of course, my favorite, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), who has been under the spell of her favorite boy toy, the dangerous Joker (an underused but winning Jared Leto) and is not afraid to vex and irritate people. Along for the ride is soldier Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) and his bodyguard Katana (tough Karen Fukuhara) as they try to take down pure evil. I liked the energy, the dark humor, and the vivid colors of this wild and crazy film written and directed by David Ayer (writer of "Training Day", also written and directed "End of Watch" and "Fury"). But sometimes you get kind of confused as to where the story takes us and we don't get to know at least some of the characters including Slipknot (Adam Beach) and the Enchantress a.k.a. Dr. June Moone (Cara Delevingne). But in its own sloppy, choppy and messy way, I found it terrifically entertaining and funny as hell. Also if you loved or hated "BvS", you'll probably have the same reaction for this movie. Me, I liked it better than "BvS" and I also expect to see more of these DC characters and this extended universe. Plus, there are a lot of good surprises in there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the film suicide squad was intended to give a more relaxed and funny air to the DC universe, and he got a splendid way. &nbsp;The criticism around the film were made by people without impartial and inconsistent arguments, the site of tomatoes is at least fan of marvel to give such low notes; therefore I imagine nothing more than a boycott or fanboys act of marvel to denigrate the image of DC in theaters. &nbsp;If you are easily influenced by criticism, stop reading now, I will speak the simple truth that the film is. &nbsp;The first act of the film is exciting and informative at the same time, giving the origin story of the main characters, with a technical form, somewhat unnecessarily, but still stylish. The sound track married well with the film, giving a teen tone and still captivating the public in general. &nbsp;In the matter of history it contains no script hole, as usually critics say, a simple story that works from start to finish. &nbsp;Interesting characters, Deadshot and Harley queen are the main characters appear on screen longer and having more lines of dialogue, but everyone in the cast has its time. &nbsp;The villain of the film is good, even though cliché, but for a super- heroes film it works. &nbsp;The action scenes are fast, with several cuts, but without impairing the scene. Having total 3 important action scenes. &nbsp;The film's CGI works well, but it contains some parts that bother. The comics relief work well, there are not so many, but in most they work, entertainingIn the second act the tone changes a little, not interfering much in immersing the movie, the final battle is the same exciting, but it is interesting and can make a good closing of history. It is not a perfect film, far from it, but it delivers what it promised, as an anti-hero film that are recruited to defeat a villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wanted to be "Guardians of the Galaxy" so bad!As the most teased and advertised movie of the year, even with a tsunami of negative early reviews, the "Suicide Squad" hype train was not to be derailed; which meant: No matter what the reviews said, I was still going to see this movie. That said, does this film live up to the hype? Synopsis: Telling the story of a group of incarcerated supervillains who are rounded up (for reasons unknown) by the government (instead for recruiting actual soldiers; again, "for reasons unknown") and made to battle a villainous witch (who wasn't even a threat until after said villains were "rounded up"). Now if that sounds like a movie you want to see, then read on and let's see if I can't break your spirit. Director David Ayer's style (Training Day, End of Watch) is completely lost in a movie that looks like it was edited by producers into a mishmash of nonsensical cuts, flashbacks and one on-the-nose song after another. This outcome results in a lackluster plot jumble in conjunction with nonsensical character motivations, in equal amounts. I get why a supervillain would be forced to help the government, but (spoiler alert) there comes a point when they don't have to, BUT DO IT ANYWAY! (insert head-scratching emoji here). While Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) do work as entertaining leads, the Joker (played by Jared Leto in an absolutely forgettable performance) is made to look like a Juggalo electronic-dance DJ inspired pimp, whose motivations include wearing purple fur coats and running around the city with no shirt on, showing off his abs. The Joker I KNOW was all about chaos. That's what makes him scary; the fact that he isn't much for "feelings" and doesn't wear a frightening amount of bling-bling. But I guess it's 2016 and this is what we get; a Joker feat. Skrillex. As for all of the other B-side villains, they are complete throwaways. Final Thought: As much as I enjoyed "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" (I know I'm in the minority here) "Suicide Squad" may be looked back upon as the beginning of the end for this particular cinematic DC universe. So, let me be the first to say it: RIP, DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad was a jumbled mess. (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Suicide Squad felt very long and dragged out. There were too many parts trying to move and it made a 2 hour movie feel like a 3 hour one. In my opinion they could have easily thrown out the villain intros and made them short flashbacks of what happened. Katana (Karen Fukuhara) felt forced in and had a confusing background. Elaborating on her story could have improved the character. Also the whole Joker (Jared Leto) sideline was unnecessary and strange. Perhaps they could have changed that by alluding to him throughout the movie. Perhaps having Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) talking to a shadow building the Joker up to a Batman movie. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) had a complex character background and actually felt like a person who felt guilty for what he did. Killing him off felt unnecessary and strange. After he was defeating the Brother why did he not stay in that form and run away from the blast. All around the death felt like the director just wanted a death in the movie.In conclusion the movie Suicide Squad felt like it had a lot of missed opportunities whether with characters or with the plot itself. The movie felt like a bunch of mumbo jumbo and was all over the place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comic book movie review from a non-comic book guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review will possibly be long-winded and rambling. Sorry about that. I will also do my level best to NOT reveal anything about the plot in the way of spoilers, but I am not perfect, you have been warned. I am not a comic book reader. I have friends and co-workers who are so I know the general gist of the major comic heroes (Batman, Spiderman, etc.) but with SS, I really had no idea outside of the Joker.The challenge here with that, is most comic book movies are written for fans that have at least a passing knowledge of the character, and not for people like me who really don't. In that respect, SS failed to make me care about the characters because they spent too little time telling you not only *who* they are, but *why* they are. The *why* is as important as anything else, because if you don't care what happens to the characters, it becomes difficult to care about the film in general.This happened (to me anyway) with Age of Ultron, too many characters introduced with little development to them. I honestly thought Vision, when introduced, was Martian Manhunter, because that was the only hero I knew of that had red skin. I'd never heard of Vision and was totally confused as to why a DC character was in the Marvel movie.In any case, we have a number of "bad guys" whose motivations are highly unclear, whose background is murky, and when whatever happens to them occurs, I don't care.Sin number 1. You must develop your characters, unless you are aiming for fans only.Sin number 2. Keep an even keel. This film fluctuates between dark, and comedic. It's difficult to buy into a character's motivation(s) when you can't grasp their purpose. With Ms. Quinn, I got it, she's a loon, so she'll switch between the two extremes with ease, and it works (mostly) but for say, Killer Croc, it doesn't, because comedic doesn't seem to fit with what little the movie gives us about him.I understand these comedic elements were added after the fact, so they might not all be the director's fault, but it doesn't help the film.In any event, this film is bound to be (if not already) controversial. We know the critics hated it, the die hard fans loved it, but for the folks on the fence like me? Well I remain on the fence. The movie had great potential, and the actors did their level best with that they had to work with, but sadly that wasn't much and the film suffers greatly because of that.Two notable points: This is mainly a Wil Smith movie. If you don't like him, you've been warned, he's the lead character.The Joker is rarely seen, and is mostly a force of nature rather than a character in the movie, which adds a positive point to the film.So, final words? The film strove to be so much more, and yet failed to reach that goal. A tragedy. Maybe next time gang, maybe next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound and Fury. Signifying nothing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A talented cast suffers from poor writing and poor directing. This is pure superhero porn: set action pieces stitched together with incoherent bits of plot. You have seen this all before, and better, in older movies. They make the "good" guys almost as bad as the "bad" guys. I suppose this makes the latter seem not so bad. And, like many superhero flicks, the writers seem to feel compelled to try to flesh out their characters, to make them more, what...relatable? It doesn't work very well here. Again, the screen writing is to blame. That said, there is some fun to be had. A few good lines. Jared Leto's take on the Joker is enjoyable. Otherwise, it's the usual thing. All major roles are kick-ass because the script says so. They do all the killing, and all the extras drop like flies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun action movie in the DC cinematic universe starring the bad guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, let's get this out of the way first, this movie is NOT rotten or deserving of a 30% on Rotten tomatoes. In my opinion, it is a solid 8 out of 10 film.The movie is in the same universe as Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. It follows a group of super-villains employed by the government to perform potentially suicidal tasks in exchange for shorter prison terms. The movie focuses on Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), and Rick Flagg (Joe Kinnaman) as they are tasked by the government under the authority of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to stop a supernatural threat.They are assisted by Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, El Diablo, and Slipknot. The supporting cast has minimal back story, especially Slipknot, but you are informed all you need to know about them in their back story snippets. Surprisingly, El Diablo ended up being one of my favorite characters as he got a chance the develop as the movie went along.The Joker, played by Jared Leto, also makes an appearance, but he is a very minor character.Will Smith and Margo Robbie are the stars of the show here, and they carry the movie for the most part. The first third of the film sets up the characters and the threat they are facing. The middle has the Squad fighting their way into the city to collect a high value individual. The last part of the movie has the Squad confronting the threat.Overall, the first two thirds of the movie are great. Good humor and good action. The last third of the film is semi generic, but it is still enjoyable to watch, if unsurprising.Overall, this is a fun summer action movie with a few minor pacing and story issues. I highly suggest DC comics fans and action movie fans in general go see Suicide Squad.In summary, this movie is better than Batman vs Superman was when it initially released in theaters and is completely underwriting of the critical shellacking that it has endured. Go see it and have a fun time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you People? "We're critics, it's what we do."Well the critics are at it again. To the life of me I don't get why these critics have it in for DC Universe, tho one thing that does come to mind is, these reviews are being bank rolled by Disney. No doubt trying to catch up with decade's worth of hits and misses from Marvel Studios was never going to be easy. BvS was a step in the right direction, far from being the winning goal in the World Cup final but a great shot nevertheless. MoS and BvS were needed to build a foundation albeit to some a shaky one a foundation nevertheless.Anyho Suicide Squad is a good movie I mean so many things could have gone wrong, and some certain aspects of the movie did for some. For example having a new joker so soon after the late Heath Ledger immortalised the Joker, but Jared Leto did it proud. Yes DC and WB could have taken their time with introducing the squad and the cameos could have been done better, like BvS it all feels rushed, but it's far from being a bad movie. The fact that Will Smith was in this. Same Will Smith coming on to a so called "sinking ship" with a string of flops (apart from focus), with a character not so known or well established as the Joker, Harley Quinn. But it works Deadshot delivers. I liked the other Suicide Squad members they were spot on with there takes on the comic characters too, a deeper look in to them would have been better, so wouldn't mind to see them drop in to the DC extended Universe time to time.I do feel more of the Joker and Harley Quinn, better use of cameos, better narrative, tighter story, better foe would have turned this GOOD movie into a GREAT ONE. I've said before to my friends, I just think WB is rushing to establish a DC Universe and making mistakes along the way, but these mistake ain't that direr for critics to pan the first few DC Universe films far from it.So here's hoping Ben Affleck and WB are paying attention to the fans appreciation to the King and Queen of Gotham City. Give them a standalone or bring them in to the fold for the next Batman or Justice League movie. To be honest throw in Killer Croc and Deadshot as the foes for Bens first Batman won't be a bad idea either. Like I said in my review to BvS "DC Universe is truly and rightfully on its way" and Suicide Squad went a long way to establishing this fact. They need to start taking their time with story and script writing, they need to get one just one movie right with the critics and the fans alike and the rest will fall in place. I really believe Wonder Woman will change that and be that one movie to demand better for WB, not saying Wonder Woman will be the winning goal, but it'll surely level the playing field."Feeling the world go against us So we put the world on our shoulders". Loving the soundtrack to Suicide Squad. "Purple Lamborghini" by Skrillex &amp; Rick Ross and "Sucker for Pain" by Imagine Dragons and various artist are my favourites.Before I sign off, leave you with some wise words from Wreck Ralph "I am bad and that is good, I will never be good and that's not bad, there's no one I'd rather be than me". F**k Critics Obi out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with a fun cast and plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad opens up a lot of potential for future comic book movies. If you're a fan of the comic team then watch this movie and ignore the critics. I am all over the Joker man. That chase scene in the beginning made me so happy. Their origins completely showed the abuse of Harley by Joker during her origin and it also showed Joker's very sentimental side for Harley. Also, people may be more upset by how Joker is more of a pimp now but their characters are just like something off of one of the Arkham games, I'll use that as reference. Especially with Joker being a gangbanger because as we know, Penguin, Joker, and Black Mask own the biggest gangs in Gotham. He was clearly psychopathic and clearly different than other versions. Their love for one another felt exactly like something we should have seen. Deadshot was very well written. I'm going to keep it short though. The one thing I liked about his character is how his character and his daughter took a lot of inspiration from the comics. I'd say Will Smith brought the character more to life than the CW version. Speaking of bringing characters to life, let's talk about Captain Boomerang. Like this Digger Harkness has to be one of the best criminals I've seen to date, he tried to take every option to get out of the action as he could. He played the petty criminal who was all in it for the money and didn't give a damn about the plot. He was all in it for himself which is a very Captain Boomerang thing to do given he's apart of the rogues. PLUS WE GOT THE FLASH IN THAT ONE SCENE. THE EFFING FLASH. I'm sorry Grant Gustin, I love you but that was a monumental moment. Something I'll never forget is how well these movies are connected. Diablo's origin was so well written. They gave a lot of exposition for his character. The fight between him and Incubus had to be the best action sequence yet. It was so unexpected too. Slipknot had to be the most stupid character. He served only as a filler to give emphasis on the whole bomb implant, in other words...we knew he was going to die. Now, here's what I liked about the movie. I liked how the plot was something that no other big comic book movie has ever tackled before. Like in every Marvel movie you see, it always has to do with the main protagonist for example Thor and Loki in Avengers, Ultron and Stark, Captain America and Bucky, or Ant-Man and Yellowjacket. And it's always the same plot, "Oh, I'm going to wipe out humanity, destroy the world, cause wars, etc." It was never about ruling the world but it takes it to another extreme. It references largely on the Nightshade Odyssey, probably the most famous Suicide Squad comic. This movie wasn't afraid to even feature the Alex Ross scene. This movie wasn't afraid to go realllly deep in comic lore. I mean really deep. I am going to make one comparison is that it's a lot like Guardians of the Galaxy because all of these characters who aren't connected in anyway come together. Except in Guardians, you probably didn't know who most of them were. In this, you knew most of the characters. It was all about interpretation. I said it before but I really like how connected these movies are so far, even in the after credits scene you had Bruce Wayne which supports a lot of my original expectations. This movie wasn't a clone copy of Assault on Arkham and had the most unique plot line and casting of any movie I have scene. I feel like this is a huge evolution for movies that critics just don't see. Another thing I really liked was how the movie never gave any of the plot away in the trailers. They cut most of the scenes from the trailers out as well. Most people thought Enchantress was on the Squad's side but surprise, surprise it was completely different. That's what I loved about this movie is if it went one way, it'd go another. Like, we thought Diablo was going to get his ass kicked by the demon or whatever but he actually kicked ass with a new ability. Now, it's time for improvements. I personally think the movie had A LOT of pacing errors. I'm not trying to sound like I didn't like how it flowed, it flowed really nice for the most part. But the pacing is what got me. The backgrounds, the origins, they were very meaningful, very detailed, and made me like their characters but felt out of place with the current scenario. The directing was great but I felt like it could have done better. I speak that for all movies though. I feel like any amount of directing for any movie could always be better. But Ayers for the most part did great. What I originally thought was that Joker was going to be a completely different plot. He was however. Except he was a side plot who gave weight into some of the main plot. His main improvements could have been giving him more screen time even though he got enough. I thought in my own opinion after watching the movie was that Joker and Harley should escape and then the Taskforce is sent out again to imprison both of them which gives way to a new plot where we might get an Assault on Arkham plot which would really show the "spy" side of Taskforce X. It makes sense, especially with a lot of Joker scenes cut from the trailers. Though I think I'll leave it right there.. This movie gives a lot of potential for future comic book movies and I enjoyed this more than other films this year. You should definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative Re-imagining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time a new comic book inspired movie is announced the same things happen. 1. Announcement: Die hard fans rejoice and start blogging about what BETTER be included. 2. Actors are revealed: Die hard fans begin with the hypercritical BS 3. Costumes are revealed: If the designer strays from the iconic costumes at all or dates to completely re-imagine the character, people lose their minds! 4. Trailer Released: Vloggers and Bloggers dissect every freaking second of the trailer and break down their theories of what will be included in the movie. Since Vloggers and Bloggers are typically die hard fans themselves, this could get other fans' hopes up about certain story lines being included in the final product. 5. Movie is released: People flock to the theater even if they've been disappointed by the casting, costuming, and trailer. It's not surprise that those same people post all over social media "Sooo disappointed!" or "Don't waste your money!" The die hard fans turned super critics always use their fan status to backup why they're right about the movie being awful. They say things like "I really wanted to like it!" and "I grew up with these characters!" and of course "I've read ALL of the comics!" To these people I say, get over it. Characters and story lines are reinvented all the time! That's what keeps them relevant and attracts new fans. Stop setting yourself up for disappointment by creating a checklist of what you WANT to see out of a movie. Now, on with my actual review! I really enjoyed it! I didn't have any expectations going into the theater, but I left smiling, and isn't that what a good summer blockbuster is all about?! What I wasn't crazy about: I loved that all of the trailers made it seem as though Enchantress was going to be part of the squad, so when she ended up being the villain it automatically changed what I was planning on seeing. However, Enchantress was probably my least favorite character in the movie. Cara Delevingne's portrayal of the character was a bit odd. Her movements seemed more zombie-like than anything else and the different voice used didn't always match up with the actresses mouth. I also thought the CGI made Enchantress's brother a tad cheesy. What I Loved: I actually LOVED the fact that The Joker was NOT a driving presence in the entire film, as this was Suicide Squad and not a Joker movie. I am a fan of this version of the Joker and hope to see the version in future films, but I'm glad the iconic character didn't steal all of the screen time. Continuing on the topic, I was relieved that the couple of Harley and Joker was presented as more of co-dependent relationship, rather than her being hopelessly in love with a man who only uses her. This version of the pair still has all of the dysfunction you'd expect, but there's an added element of blind devotion from both parties. I mean, The Joker from the original animated series would've never gone through so much effort to get Harley back. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie really nailed the twisted bond between the characters and added an unexpectedly human and sincere element to the relationship I loved that Killer Croc got his moment to shine by swimming into the sewers. I was worried that he'd just be the token 'big ugly' member of the squad. I was also happy to see El Diablo be the one who really saves the day by sacrificing himself. I loved the transition from a disjointed group of villains and a reluctant Rick Flag to an actual team that cares about each other's welfare. Honestly though, one of my favorite elements of the movie was the soundtrack. The music of each scene sets the tone perfectly! In short: if you just want a live action version of the comic, stay home. If you can go to the theater was in open mind though, it's completely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining bunch that succumbs to familiar formulas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I think it is fair to say that Suicide Squad does not merit all the backlash it has received thus far, especially from critics. Certainly this film deserves a fate better than a 25% rotten tomatoes score that is akin to films like House of Wax and Howard the Duck. With such massive hype surrounding its release, DC was certainly hard-pressed to deliver. But alas, here we are and while this film isn't perfect, it does get some things right and provides its viewers with ample entertainment. One aspect of this film I felt it struggled to offer us was an adequate backstory for many of its main characters. As a result, we're left with a flurry of personalities that frankly feels a little messy and disorganized. But perhaps it is somewhat paradoxical to learn about the psyche of characters who are anything but human. With visually fantastical supervillains like Enchantress, Killer Croc and El Diablo, this film is certainly a treat for the eyes more than the brain. There are certainly many plot holes and the occasional cringy dialogue. Even come the film's end, you feel like you have witnessed an under-developed, completely rushed plot that is certainly difficult to genuinely buy into. It fails where films like the Dark Knight have succeeded in creating a believable, sinister atmosphere that transcends the realm of comic book and enters suspenseful thriller material.But if you temper your expectations a little, Suicide Squad presents itself as a fun, action- packed flick. Viola Davis, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto (among others) bring their A-game but unfortunately were given a sub-par script to work with. The story-line certainly tries to cram in many superfluous details, injecting Batman into the plot being one. I guess I felt with such a stunning array of characters at their disposal, S.S. left a lot to be desired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was another quintessential DC installment, trending to the strange, devoid of plot but with some interesting moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would almost recommend the ticket price for Suicide Squad just to see Harley Quinn alone..almost. But while Robbie's quirky and sexually charged take on the iconic character is worthy of your time, much of the rest of the film leaves you feeling largely unfulfilled.The plot is thin on the ground (when it exists at all) and for a large part the characters are more caricatures than characters. The first half of the movie involves an overburdening of backstory and the rest follows through a string of turbo charged action, which, whilst exciting, doesn't really have any sort of direction, as we are left to wonder exactly how these villains were ever let loose on this mission in the first place. Perhaps the government had misplaced Batman's phone number? There are some positives, Will Smith is excellent as the dry witted Deadshot and Jai Courtney's character had a number of enjoyable punchlines, for which we can almost forgive his hammed up Aussie accent. But the same can't be said for Jared Leto's joker. It was overacted, unnecessarily weird and devoid of purpose in this film. And then there's the stock standard and wooden villain from another dimension, Enchantress, who is really only there to give the squad something to shoot at to end the film. This was another quintessential DC installment, trending to the strange, devoid of plot but with some interesting moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie committed suicide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with the characters being introduced, with small clips with their own real-life pop songs playing in the background. It's heavy exposition, with the screen telling us who these characters are by giving us information about them. Deadshot gets a scene at a shooting range showing his shooting accuracy and speed, then he gets another pointless scene that again shows his accuracy, and later in the movie the same thing happens again. Yes, we understand who Deadshot is now, move on. Then some of the characters get another intro, making the whole introduction sequence overlong. After that, the movie starts actually getting the squad together, starting with a scene in a prison that shows the character of each of the characters. Eventually you get tired of it, as these sequences must have taken up about 30 minutes of the total run time.When the actual mission starts, it becomes clear that the characters won't actually get fleshed out and get character development. Many of the characters simply have a side that wants them to live as normal human beings and not do all kinds of bad stuff. I'm sorry, weren't you supposed to be evil? I would like this type of character ambivalence if there was actually any point to it, but there isn't. The characters at some point actually sit down at a bar and decide that 'hey, you know what, maybe we're just evil'. No explanation was given, it was just Harley making a simple point and suddenly everybody just goes on to the next scene. The characters don't get to know each other much, they don't have to learn to work together, they never clash, and their backstories could have come into play in the movie more than they did.Yes, the characters may constantly claim they're bad guys, but they do nothing interesting throughout the movie. They don't have the power to defy Amanda Waller in any way, they don't shock you by doing evil things or trying to throw the other members of the team under the bus, and they're never actually as ruthless as they claim to be. Many of the action scenes are pedestrian in their lack of high stakes. In fact, the most entertaining scene of the movie is one in which Deadshot (played by Will Smith) shoots enemy after enemy until there are none left. That may sound fun, but none of the enemies are dangerous. They just have no strong attacks, don't use any tactics, don't have any powers, and they die from a single hit from a baseball bat. These types of enemies don't require the suicide squad to actually work together, and so they don't. Each scene is one that focuses on set-pieces and on one particular protagonist - It's like a sterile show-and-tell or laboratory demonstration of superpowers. The action scenes are just bland, also because of the fact that the suicide squad doesn't really coordinate their attacks. Wouldn't it be fun to see Killer Croc throw somebody to Harley, who would then shoot them with her gun or hit them with her bat? Also, wouldn't it be nice to see these characters work together to go ballistic on their enemies? Yeah, that never happens.Harley Quinn claims to be psychotic, but all she ever is in this movie is 'quirky'. When somebody claims dourly that they want to go somewhere and do something serious, she just replies ''I'll come!'' She puts on a shirt in the prison that says ''daddy's little monster''. The idea behind Harley is simply that she is a sexualized and juvenile character that makes some silly quips. She never actually shows her insanity ? she never starts doing disturbing things. The Joker's role is mostly put on the sidelines for flashbacks, which try to establish how he managed to turn Harley insane, but it's never explained. The Joker is supposed to use mind games to play with people, and to bluff, to scare, and be otherwise nasty and cruel, but this is never shown. The movie basically just says Harley was in love with the Joker from the start (for no apparent reason), and that made her accede to his demands and somehow made her decide to jump into a vat of acid. At least the animated show added the information that Harley herself could relate to the Joker because of him supposedly having an abusive father. At least it explained that she thought the Joker was a tortured soul desperately trying to find his way in life. Every time the Joker comes in, the movie starts feeling completely different, as though it's trying to be more character-oriented, but then it fails to flesh these characters out. There's even a big plot-hole concerning the Joker at the end of the movie.When it comes to the jokes rather than the Joker, the movie also fumbles. It almost never manages to make you even crack a smile, as the jokes are very predictable. Maybe if the suicide squad actually functioned more like a team and managed to play off of each other, it could have been a funny movie. Of course, how funny you'll find the movie depends on your sense of humor, but I doubt it'll be very fulfilling.The final battle takes place in a thick fog, making it hard to even see what the characters are doing, and whether or not it's painful to them or the enemy. It also doesn't have any visual style ? it just feels like they're fighting in a steam room. Like I said, the action is repetitive and bland (hell, there are three helicopters that crash in separate scenes), so this scene did not help elevate the movie.Overall, this movie is mediocre. It would have deserved a 5/10 if the action were slightly more memorable, but even that was too much to ask for. Most of the critics were right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to Be Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say I'm not a DC Comics reader. That said, I was interested in seeing this movie, because Watchmen, although I was not familiar with the graphic novels, is my #2 favorite movie of all time after Casablanca - so you never know.Now, I have followed the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, which took about 10 years to build to what it is today (over several movies and TV shows), and obviously DC Comics is feeling the pressure and needs to come up with their own as quick as possible. So, they have the Superman movie, BvS, and now Suicide Squad. Here's the problem: DC is trying to make an entire universe with just these 3 movies, and it shows. The film starts out with the background of several of the characters, and takes up almost the entire first hour doing so. This is a fun show, propelled forward with a great soundtrack of pop songs, old and new.Then, the group is brought together to rescue an unnamed High-Value Target after some terrorist activity in the city. This is where the plot actually begins. They hop on a chopper, the soundtrack suddenly changes to just a score, and the helicopter crashes (it's in the commercial). In total there will be 3 helicopter crashes, but an hour into a movie, I should be caring about what happens to at least some of these characters. Since I don't read the comics, I don't have the already "built in" care that other viewers may, but this says something about the story itself and how it's failed to capture the viewer's interest. Also, there's a really silly thing that made me laugh out loud in a crowded theater: every time the Enchantress entered or left the screen, there was a woman whispering "Enchantress" like some perfume commercial. It's ridiculous.There's also a character who dies, and I knew it already because that character is the only one who didn't get the full treatment with a background scene. They also threw in some lady with a silly mask (named Katana), who has 1 line and 1 move in the entire movie, so I'm not sure what the point was in having her in there.Then, somewhere in between there, I guess the director / producers realized they needed a love component (or at least friendship type of love) and made a really awkward display between two people who had literally just met about an hour before when they got on the helicopter! The HVT was not a shocker at all, although the characters all seemed shocked, so I think the viewer was supposed to be, also. Confusion.Throw in some awkwardly-placed, forced one-liners, and suddenly the movie turns into the final scene of Ghostbusters for the last 20 minutes, with a whirlwind of smoke and lightning, and a witch in a skimpy dress dancing in the middle the whole time. I was waiting for Stay Puft, but he never came. The plot was so forced and weak, I wonder what the production meetings were like. Add in the weird (not artistic!) use of the soundtrack, poor character development, silly mistakes (The Diablo's tattoos change as regularly as Harley Quinn's accent Overall, this movie was a cluster of things that made it feel like they crammed a bunch of elements to create an entire universe in a single movie. And I have to say it failed at that. They could easily have introduced some of these characters in shows like Gotham or Flash, or in movies like Batman, Superman, or BvS. Then they wouldn't have to crunch in so much background stuff and could've actually had a great movie, but this failed in so many ways I think (sadly) the DC Cinematic Universe is doomed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film, better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film and was disappointed to see the critic scores of 29%. Still, I decided to go and watch the film for myself and make up my own mind ! The film is well acted and has quite a good story line. The world is rocked by the death of Superman and has woken up up the threat of meta-humans and the danger they pose to humanity. Cue Amanda Waller and her plan to form Task Force X, a.k.a. the Suicide Squad. The introductions of the characters takes a while but at least they are quite well done. Harley and Deadshot are clearly the stars of the film and take centre stage. Having said that, all of the cast do a really good job and deserve praise. The story may be basic and fairly straight forward but it is the journey that the characters take that is of interest. The bonds that the members start to form and the interactions between the characters. This is a good film for DC and if the upcoming films are this good then I will be a happy man !!!If you look superhero films then go watch this and make up your own mind !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first start off saying that Jared Leto is the worst adapted Joker I have ever seen. He was not as psychotic and scary as the Joker should be. And he only had about 10 minutes of screen time. This took off one star of the overall rating.But enough of that. I want to talk about the good side of this movie. David Ayer did a good job picking Robbie as Harley Quinn. He could not have picked a better actress for this role. During the promotions and adds for this film I thought that they were trying to shove captain boomerang down our throats, and I thought he was going to be horrible. But boy was I wrong, Jai Courtney had an amazing performance.Another downside of this movie were the villain and Slipknot. The villain was dead a** Weak. He had no point to the movie. I feel like the producers took only five minutes to put him there to have a point as to why the squad was together. And Slipknot, oh my god, he was the pussy of the month, Dying with only two minutes of overall screen time. He didn't even kill anyone! But to be honest, I had no idea he existed until I saw the movie. But I guess it's good not to build up all the hype only to kill him off two minutes after he's introduced.Another thing I want to add is the soundtrack. It is worth the price of admission itself. Just wait until you see the movie, then you'll understand.But overall, this is a pretty good movie. Good for date night, or just for some summer fun. Suicide Squad - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is set in DC universe.But has nothing to do with the batman(dark knight)movie series and the game(btw I played all the games)and the comics.Its a new story.1:the story:the story is stupid because the witch is the bad person butt the thing is that's he movie is rated 12+ ( in my country)so it can't be violent(the katana girl chopping the head off)so the heroes fight against some things that look like a human and they are made of some kind of black mud.2the heroes (or maybe bad people)are doing pretty well except dead shot he is too good for a killer.Harley Quinn is doing all the job in this movie to keep us exited.3 the dialogue in some cases funny butt killer crock saying "bro" I mean seriously! And one more thing the s Diablo (fire guy) is not even in the small cast you need to click on "see full cast" to see who is playing that personage.The movie is good it's like a comic book:action with funny moments.i recommend to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic-Book Wise. AMAZING. Some flaws. AMAZING CASTING. SUMMER FUN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to lie. I am a HUGE DC fanboy. But i will try to stay as unbiased as I can be. Lets start off with the soundtrack. It was amazing. Every song played was perfect for the scene and got your heart going. Casting was one of the best i've seen. Will Smith as Deadshot was perfect. Very intriguing backstory making you want to see him in a solo film. Perfect mixture of seriousness and jokes. Margot Robbie as Harley was perfect. Exactly like the comics. Perfectly portrayed. Everyone else was amazing Kinnaman's acting was really good as Rick Flag. Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang had me laughing for days. Now time for the one everyone wants to know about. Jared Leto's Joker. Fun. funny. evil. crazy. DIFFERENT. He adds this type of swagger that you've never seen in Mr. J before. He has aspects of both Nicholson and Ledger. But he also adds his own style which makes you want to see him more. The only problem with Joker was that you didn't see him enough. Wee need a Batman vs. Joker solo film ASAP. The main issue was the plot. It was very vague and seems as if it has a lot of scenes cut. Overall not the best but still good. I feel like critics are being so harsh because of the very high expectations it had. I would still recommend going to see it because at the end of the day a review is an opinion and you should see it for yourself. I had fun and am probably going to see it again in the coming days. PURE CRAZY ACTION PACKED FUN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not a perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on its premier, and there is no review so far that really seems to have the 100% same opinion as me so I'm making my own review. Every suicide squad member is likable in this film. That is something David Ayer did perfectly. But lets start with the issues of this movie. For a movie to be really really good you need an antagonist to be just as good as the hero (heros) and this movie completely failed the villain, I'm gonna say who the villain is because i came into the movie and knew who the villain was gonna be and i thought i ruined some of the movie by knowing it before i saw the movie. The villain of this movie is Enchantress. They did give us one reason to understand why this character did what she did and why we even should like her personality. So the 3th act of this film is really really bad, because of the villain and the effects. The effects was not great at all, it was almost like watching a game.The 1st and 2st act of this movie, was excellent if you ask me. The action was good the characters back story was great, the humor was good and it seemed like every member had a motivation to join this suicide squad even tho they didn't say it out loud (which is something good) Because i at least like to see things for my self instead of a character in the movie telling it to me. And when it comes to the Joker which is a character you guys are excited to see, at least i was. For me it seems like Jared Leto is the perfect actor for this role. You have no idea what this guy is gonna do next and i like that, it builds excitement. I also think he looks great as the joker. Im not going to mention every character, but a lot of reviews are saying Deadshoot and Harley quin ¨steals¨ the movie, i don't agree to that. Yes those two are given the most backstory, but i still liked every other character as well. They made Captain f**** boomerang seem like a cool guy that says something. But i have to say this thing tho, when Deadshoot jumps up on the car and starting shooting people (as you see in the trailer) this is the moment when you understand how good this Deadshoot guy is on what he is doing, you get so pulled into this scene. So anyway the 1st and 2st is great, really good actors and characters, the 3st act is really bad, you don't feel anything for the villain and you barley understand why she does what she does, as well as the cgi is bad. I will give this movie a 7/10 if this movie didn't have such a bad ending i would prob given it a 8,5/10. There is one thing I'm sort of mad about, and that is that David Ayer only had 6weeks on writing the script for this movie, i think they should have given him more time and not rushed the project so much. Sorry for all the words written wrong, i'm not from America or England so this is not my main language. Anyway let me hear your thoughts.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely not like Batman v. Superman, unlike what a lot of other reviews say. In fact, this movie is pretty much exactly what I thought it would be: Fun!The three characters that were the driving force behind this movie are: Harley Quinn (no surprise there), Deadshot, and surprisingly El Diablo. From the get go it was a given that Harley Quinn was going to be a major factor for this movie doing well. Because she has such a following with fans, her big screen debut is a major deciding factor in which way this movie could turn; either horribly bad, or amazingly awesome. Thankfully, the latter is how it turned out. Margot Robbie was so perfect in the roll it's almost scary. The main thing the three characters have in common is the emotional back story they bring: Harley Quinn and her extreme love and devotion to Mr. J; Deadshot's love for his daughter; and the tragic story behind El Diablo's family. You connect with them, and even though they're bad guys you actually want them to win in a way. Characters like Slipknot (very short screen time), Captain Boomerang, and Killer Croc, didn't really add much. I'm glad they were there because it added just a tiny more depth to the whole "team" thing, but if they were gone they wouldn't be missed. I love Jared Leto, but I have to say I am not a fan of his Joker. Sure he looked cool, but he just didn't feel like a good Joker to me. The Joker is supposed to be a fun villain that you enjoy watching on screen because you don't know what he's going to do. I did not feel that way about Leto's version. The fact that he didn't have a lot of screen time was a good thing. The small cameos made by certain Justice League members were done beautifully.Overall I really did enjoy this movie, and I think this is definitely a great step in bringing this universe together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad will give a new face to the cinematic universe of DC?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is one of the films I most expected in the year, even with the negative reviews in no time me discouraged, I watched yesterday Day 04, and fun enough, first is a totally different this cinematic universe of DC film, has a gloomy weather, more is a film that has a lot of jokes and a lot of funny, the cast is phenomenal, Will Smith is well Floyd Lawton, is the most well-developed character, Joel Kinnaman plays its part as Rick Flag, Jai Courtney and Jay Hernandez are and Captain Boomerang and El Diablo, the Cara Delevingne is the weak point in terms of performance, it is not even a little expressive, Viola Davis is great as Amanda Waller, most who steals the film is Belle Margot Robbie, he makes a Harley impeccable Quinn, just like the comics, flashbacks are good, the participation of Batman is very good, the villain is very bad, left to be desired, the direction begins well, then lost, the script has many flaws, and is very confusing, the edition is very weak , it noted had a remake of some scenes and many cuts to give an air more comical, the special effects are good, the action scenes are good too, the picture is cool, the first act is much, the second is very tiring, and the third round to be good, Suicide Squad is the worst movie-based comics in the year, more does not mean it is bad, has very funny moments, even with a problematic script and a villain without charisma and forgettable. Note 7.7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joke's on you, critics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an average superhero fan, but ever more a DC fan than Marvel (sorry Stan...) and I had been waiting weeks for this release. And so in last minute readiness I had viewed the previous two films within a seemingly very long 24 hours before heading off for the packed midnight premiere screening of the third installment in DC's latest big-screen franchise, kick started by '300' director Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel' in 2013. We've met the good guys (a few only briefly of course) and now, at the hands of 'End of Watch' director David Ayer, we get to meet the bad guys in possibly the fastest arriving blockbuster sequel ever, following on from the events of this year's Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. First of all... Jared Leto - let's go straight there. After all, the Joker is the one character most of us have looked forward to witnessing more than the others in this movie, with scepticism over his very different demeanour to any other take on Batman's arch-nemesis, and how Leto had frighteningly stayed in character on set. And though this new take on the Joker certainly has him portrayed - and very well, no doubt to Leto's extreme method acting, having reportedly posted bullets and dead animal parts to his fellow cast members - as a psychopathic megalomaniac, I didn't find him as threatening or scary as I was hoping him to be. Whether that is due to lack of screen time or Heath Ledger's legendary portrayal still carrying an impact eight years on is up for speculation. But if it's anything to go by, many of Leto's scenes apparently having been cut will no doubt find themselves re-edited in the DVD/Blu Ray release to come, as had been done with Batman V Superman also (which added an additional 30 minutes onto its already 2 1/2 hour standard running time with its 'Ultimate Edition' release this week!) Nevertheless though, Leto gave a fine performance in every of his moments. Margot Robbie... Just wow! Harley Quinn blew me away. The ex-Neighbours actress has come a long way, proving she can play a villain as well as any role she has so far. Noticeably she loses the Brooklyn accent a little in certain moments throughout the movie, but that doesn't stop an overall fun villainous performance. Jai Courtney, I've long realised, has been under a fair (or more accurately, 'unfair') amount of scrutiny as an actor primarily over the not so great blockbusters he's appeared in in recent years, labelled a 'franchise killer' by some after his leading roles in 2013's 'A Good Day to Die Hard' and last years 'Terminator Genysis'. Well he surely doesn't kill this entry into the franchise as I found him one of the funniest and most entertaining characters in the group. Will Smith is as amazing as expected, delivering most of the lines I found funny and executing his shots within the explosive action scenes brilliantly, also teaming with Margot again after last years 'Focus'. There is little fault in the rest of the group as well; in Jay Hernandez's (in some moments, touching) performance as Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's (who I'd best known for his role in 'Lost' and couldn't identify him at all beneath the scales) Killer Croc, and Cara Delevigne in, for me, her most interesting performance yet as Enchantress-possessed June Moon. This film is well worth seeing in 3D. There is more than enough flying out of the screen at you and in one moment I remember I actually felt myself close to flinching like I was trying to dodge something. I have been disappointed with this newest franchise, which worries me with Snyder (who's films have mainly been deemed average in their criticism, and I find his best feature to date is still his 2004 remake of Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead') helming the Justice League movies as well as Man of Steel and it's first sequel, but Ayer has undoubtedly brought to us the best installment yet, and hopefully 'Monster' director Patty Jenkins will do as well a job, if not better, with next year's 'Wonder Woman'. Suicide Squad is messy in some moments, and I had slightly lost interest in the last third-to-quarter of the 2 hour running time until the ending, but throughout I had notably loved the choice of music tracks (including those from the trailers) and the very many action scenes that dominate the majority of the feature (which still acquire much CGI in their execution - though the film is definitely not as rinsed with it as its predecessors' overdone action sequences) and I think it will generally please more than not, and I expect, looking by how many turned up at midnight to see it, it will be a roaring success and may well set a record for its opening weekend grossing. Of the summer blockbusters this year, this is to me the best of them. Hardly Oscar bait - as most blockbusters nowadays aren't - but still great fun. I'd like to note lastly (as most people had missed it...) don't be so quick to walk out at the end, there is a mid-credits scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie doesn't waste anytime getting to the point, which does leave a few characters undeveloped but the fan favourites such as Harley Quinn and Deadshot with amazing stories. Although Cara (Enchantress) doesn't deliver the rest of the cast make up for her lack of acting ability. Leto's Joker is fresh and his relationship with Harley is strong and will fans ship them even more every moment they share. Although their is a dip in the action mid way through, it does allow the character development to take place and for fans to fall in love with the characters humour and craziness! This movie does make up for Batman vs Superman and is easily DC/ Warner Bros. finest movie to date allowing the cinematic universe to open many doors to possible solo movies and a possible Suicide Squad 2!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film is Full of Many Flaws But If You Treat It Like A Regular Summer Blockbuster Movie You Can Have Fun With It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, I don't think that I've been more pumped for a film since Star Wars Episode VII. Most of the marketing for Suicide Squad has been extremely good and has kept me pumped since 2015. Now the big question is, is it any good? Well, overall it's enjoyable, but it does not exceed expectations in many ways. I really hoped that this film would make up for the disappointing and very flawed film Batman V Superman, and all though it is better than it, it didn't prove to me that the DCEU is trying it's absolute best. Now before I get into the negatives about the film, I'm going to talk about the pros about this film. First or all let me get this out of the way, Jared Leto as the Joker was absolutely great. I loved his performance he wasn't trying to copy Heath Ledger or Nicholson he was his own unique gangster, mob Joker that really caught my interest. Now this does lead me into one con that I will talk about towards the end of this review.&nbsp; Deadshot and Harley Quinn, my gosh were probably the best characters in the film. I loved seeing these two on screen they were portrayed perfectly especially Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Diablo, Captain Boomerang, and Rick Flag were also great characters. Killer Croc, Katana, and Slipknot were on and off characters to me, sometimes they had fine moments and sometimes they didn't. Amanda Waller I believe would've been a great character if she didn't make some certain choices in the film that honestly made no sense or were never explained. Now the action in the film was pretty fun for the most part. I liked the fighting I like the flashback character origin stories that all happen at the beginning of the film which are by far the most entertaining aspects of the film. I also liked how there was a lot of really funny humor in the film as well which was definitely a plus.&nbsp;The films first two acts are pretty entertaining for the most part I enjoyed them. Oh Yah, Batman killed it once again in the film like he did in BVS. Now that I've got most of the Pros out of the way it's time to get into the negatives of the film. This films editing honestly was pretty bad. I know the film had to do last minute film shootings and editing and I think that might have made the film take a turn for the worst. The film is pretty fast paced which may seem like a good thing, but it really wasn't cause the editing was so choppy that there was no breathing time for me to process what was happening on screen. The editing sometimes really confused and took me out of this film. Also, the soundtrack is a great soundtrack but most of the music interjected into the film was so loud and so out of place that it distracted me from many scenes, one in particular which I will not spoil which contains the Joker that really threw me off. Also another con is the main finale battle of the film was extremely terrible. It almost reminded me of the ending of the new Fantastic Four, it was obviously not as bad but it was extremely lazily made. Also there is so much scenes that felt like they were missing from the film that the plot became extremely confusing and stupid at times and almost made no sense at all which really told me that the people working on the plot of the film did a poor job. There's also some over- dubbing for the voices of the characters that you can tell were voice-overs which really took me out of the film one in particular with the Joker that almost made me laugh cause it was so badly dubbed. Also, no spoilers of course Enchantress and the villain of this film were done very poorly. Enchantress was a fine character at the beginning but slowly morphed into a cheesy character and the villain was so cliché and lame which really bugged me. Some of the line delivery in this film was sometimes extremely out of place and truly cringe- worthy even though the majority of the film does have decent dialogue. Its just that some of the poorly done dialogue probably had to due with the factor of the editing that made it seem poorly done. And a huge disappointing factor of the film is that the Joker is barely even in the film. He's literally interjected into 30 second mini scenes throughout the entire runtime of the film. My final flaw with this film is the emotional levels they try to present in this film. There is so many scenes in this movie that try to be emotional and try to touch your heart when really it just comes out as either confusing or extremely messy. I do enjoy how they tried to bring heart into this film, but some of it was done very strangely, and not in a positive way for sure. Overall though I think if you go into this film with an open mind knowing that this film is going to be an average fun blockbuster film you really will enjoy it. If you're going to go into it thinking its going to be the DC film that saves the DCEU and "Oh this is going to be the best film ever," you will be very extremely with the film. To me this film is overall a disappointment but it is still a somewhat enjoyable film which I think Batman V Superman really had trouble being. Suicide Squad is a film with an extreme amount of editing problems and flaws, but it has just enough action and likable characters that it can be enjoyed as a decent summer blockbuster popcorn-flick. Overall Grade: C+ IMDb Score: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not have many expectations to that movie when i went to watch it, but im so very glad for that.. i would have been more disappointed.I try to be as objective as possible and making it short. I love super hero movies! This movie had all the potential to be awesome but the poor script just ruined it completely even tho the beginning was promising. Sadly, there was no story! It was also very confusing at times what the whole point is and also it had many unnecessary side roles that were there to try to make it funny. There was nothing new or original about the movie.. it looked more like a poor sci-fy comedy than a serious super hero movie. It's more like a movie with a low intelligence humor; i would not recommend it to under 16 y. old audience because of foul language but also not for over 17+ thinking audience because low intelligence humor and poor story. So in my opinion it really does not have a target group at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the worst film which I have seen in an awful long time. I can't understand how anyone could call this good as the story-line is rubbish, the action is the same as the action in every other good guys v bad guys film ever made with shooting and big explosions. There is nobody in the story who we could care for let alone get behind in a fight. I seriously wish I hadn't made the effort to see it as I thought the trailers looked rubbish but two young friends said it was good, two people whom I will never speak to again. The film makers knew this was a dud as they had to resort to putting in some awesome music tracks from Queen and the Rolling Stones to hide the fact there was no story here. There is not a single character who stood out except for Diablo who showed a bit of common decency, The Joker was a sad and overdone character, the Viola Davis character was terrible, what government official would get away with killing their employees, Deadshot was boring and the 'baddie' Enchantress was like a spitting witch from a Disney film. And I really enjoyed the touching moment Deadshot had with his daughter explaining how to shot someone, very moving!! And what I can't understand is how the squad became close as it appears in this film they only knew each other for 5 minutes which is a pretty speedy bonding process. All in all this should be consigned to the dung heap.</fullReview>

On the trailer I find it funny they advertise the joker being such a mean head guy when he isn't. Its some silly witch. The trailer is all joker coming in the scenes. Far from that. In those 10 mins hes in the movie, its almost all flashbacks.90% of the movie is Will Smith and Harley. Oh and they keep saying how Harley is craziest because shes a woman like the Hollywood trying to advertise pro woman crap. Most of the movie shes just giggling, saying "what" or her lines or just so out of place it doesn't fit the movie. Also, her accent is going in and out of the film.Fighting scenes- very boring also camera shots bouncing every half second.Plot - useless. At least put some twists in it(not very hard) bad person escapes and wants to blow up the world. gather will smith and harley to stop it. Oh, diablo crying how he cant do his power anymore half the movie besides Harley giggling... thats 95 percent of the movie.This movie is just flat out bad and so boring.

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad: A Fable about Shared Universes and Studio Interference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very early into Suicide Squad, I had the nagging feeling that everything was about to fall off the rails. As the film continued, some small moments hinted at what could have been. Unfortunately, by the time this bloated CGI disaster had concluded, the extent of the damage was clear. This is a colossal misfire from Warner Brothers, and is another step towards the end of DC's Extended Universe. Before I get into my review, let's travel back to a more optimistic time for this franchise. 13 months ago, Suicide Squad's first trailer premiered at Comic-Con, and immediately it was pegged as one of 2016's most anticipated movies. More than that, it appeared to be a potential antidote for super-hero fatigue. An original concept, a talented cast, and a strong directing and writing presence in David Ayer justifiably substantiated people's excitement. Then, Batman v. Superman happened, and if the rumors are to be believed, that's when everything changed behind the scenes. One of the film's dumber lines has Amanda Waller muse about throwing somebody in a hole and throwing away the hole. Hilariously, I am almost positive that this is what Warner Brothers did to David Ayer. Save for a few brief moments where a darker (and better) version of the film shines through, most of the movie plays like an extended trailer. An incredibly obnoxious soundtrack, seemingly random cuts, sudden shifts in tone, and a complete lack of character depth plague large segments of Suicide Squad. Nothing here has Ayer's signature on it, and it's shockingly disjointed and unfocused for the man behind films like Training Day and End of Watch. There is an unintentionally hilarious scene in the middle of the film that perfectly illustrates its baffling script and deranged editing. Leading up to this scene, we see Amanda Waller working closely with her team of SWAT units to contain the city-wide destruction being caused by Enchantress. Then, our main characters arrive, and Waller suddenly decides to murder every member of her SWAT team. She grabs the nearest weapon, and summarily executes everybody in the room in seconds. This is meant to show the audience how ruthless and cold Amanda Waller is, but it's so random that it winds up being funny, like a scene from a dark comedy that just strolled in for a visit. The film offers no understandable reason for her actions, and one can only assume that some vitally important scenes were cut. The only person who keeps Suicide Squad watchable is Will Smith. He plays his patented style of action hero in classic fashion, and as always, gives every scene his all. His character, Deadshot, is also one of the few characters who is given any meaningful backstory. The all-too-brief scenes with Deadshot and his young daughter are easily the film's best moments. Jai Courtney also deserves some credit as Captain Boomerang, offering up some of Suicide Squad's only laughs. Margot Robbie swings for the fences but misses as Harley Quinn, but I honestly felt this was more a result of bad editing and poor dialogue than her actual performance. The rest of the characters are dull and lifeless. There is some attempted backstory for Rick Flag, Enchantress, and El Diablo, but each of these attempts are half-hearted and obviously shoehorned in. Katana, Killer Croc, and Slipknot's backstories are relegated to throw-away lines. Slipknot's treatment by the script is particularly hysterical. He is introduced as a man who is "good at climbing" and then ten minutes later his character is done away with completely. On the other hand, Katana's backstory actually sounds rather interesting. We hear mentions of a soul-stealing sword and some lingering grief for her character but this leads absolutely nowhere. I nearly forgot to mention the Joker. Jared Leto is completely forgettable here, and most of his scenes are just plain boring. This is easily the worst rendition of the Joker to date. Also, as most people are aware by now, he's barely in the movie. This is pretty disappointing, not because Jared Leto brings anything new or exciting to the character, but because his absence severely hampers Harley Quinn's character development. Hopefully, their relationship is more thoughtfully fleshed out in later instalments, should they actually happen.Lastly, the cameo appearances for the other members of the Justice League, namely Batman and the Flash, are wholly unnecessary. The presence of their characters adds nothing to their respective scenes, and serve only to remind us that these movies all exist in the same universe. Some of Marvel's movies suffer from the same problem, and hopefully it's a habit that both of these studios can start avoiding in the future. This is not a criticism at the concept of shared universes, but merely a complaint that throwing in characters that serve no purpose to the script just muddles the plot and makes each individual movie feel less cohesive. Suicide Squad is plainly and simply, a terrible movie. It should serve as a lesson to studios around the world that shared universe movies can fail, and that studio interference can easily destroy a film's vision. If there is any truth to the rumors that have been swirling this past week, Warner Brothers is deserving of the criticism it is receiving. Hopefully the producers will lock themselves out of the editing room for the next few instalments. It certainly would have helped this movie. RATING: 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had quite high expectations for this film when the trailer came out a year ago- Who doesn't like a good DC Film? You see, Up until now, i felt quite strongly that DC made better films then Marvel. Heck, I even liked Batman vs Superman. But to be honest, this film made Ang Lees Hulk or Ghost Rider look like Oscar winners. The Dialogue is extremely sloppy- Unflowing, unnatural and weird sounding conversations continue throughout the movie. The script is a complete mess, and if a Classic like Taxi Driver was written in a few days, this was probably written in ten seconds. The Actors are trying far too hard, and their performances come out as awkward and sloppy. Especially Jared Leto who seemed like he was trying to do a demonic impersonation of Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean. I know it's not fair to compare anyone to Heath Ledger, but this wasn't even near what Ledger pulled off, or Nicholson. I think Cesar Romero was even a better joker.....But the joker and the other characters formation wasn't even slightly the actors fault. They were given a dud script from a guy who shouldn't be making films at such a high budget. I don't know what Warner Bros saw in hiring David Ayer to Direct and write a script of this calibre, and i don't think they even know why they did it. But hey, its an action movie right? I at least could enjoy some dumb but cool action sequences. Well sadly, this film didn't even give me that much. Not only were the Action Sequences boring and pointless, the humour was also a mess. More cliché annoying jokes attempting to appeal to 12 year olds make up a cringeworthy ride. My Faith in DC films has been lost, Now that Christopher Nolan is gone and Zack Snyder is wearing out. R.I.P DC Films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They took what should have been great characters and villains and wrote a crappy script as if they have never seen or read anything with the actual characters before. It's like some big shot movie money investor gave them a one page description to sum up all the characters and that's what they went with. The Joker was horrible, Jared Leto was the worst Joker ever. Shaved eyebrows and tattoos?? And his smile was not a crazy grin like it should have been. He looked like Macauley Culkin from home alone and he sucked. And the relationship between The Joker and Harley was completely wrong. He manipulates her and couldn't care if she died in the least, but in this movie he's all about her. And even though Harley Quinn is a great character they couldn't get that right either. She is the Joker's sidekick. She is supposed to be Joker/card themed. That's why she has spades (like from a deck of cards) as part of her look. But in this she has some whored out baseball player theme?? So lame. And they tried to make her funny, but her one liners just fell short of the mark. Although she was one of the better parts of the movie. The plot was complete garbage. The final villain battle "climax" was pathetic. Just another of many poor choices and ruined opportunities. The DC universe has soooo many awesome villains they could have worked with and they put together this complete waste of time. Even all the members of The Suicide Squad (other than Harley) was basically changed into the same cookie cutter generic character of a goth, dark leather, tattoo, punk, biker wanna be, lame-ass. Deadshot, Harley and Waller were the only things that kept me from giving it a one star. But they were by no means great, or saved the movie in any way. And now this pathetic, lame, annoying, weak ass version of the Joker, with Jared Leto's shitty, method-acting bullshit is going to be in the Justice League. This studio needs to fire a lot of people and start over. I don't know how DC can make all their animated movies with such awesome plots and stay true to the characters, and then they just throw that all out the window and make a complete toilet clogging dump for the big screen movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are one of those fanboys who spam-voted 10/10's on this site, please leave and never come back. Somehow, this film still sits at a 7/10 which is wildly out of its reach.The characters in this movie are awful. The first half of this movie is dedicated towards developing them and setting them up, but it's entirely useless, making it really boring. Everything that has to do with characterization is done through exposition. You rarely see the characters actually exhibit the traits they're supposed to have, and when they do, it's really forced. Will Smith's character is pretty much the main character, and he suffers from this the most. His character revolves around his care for his daughter. Instead of us viewers actually being able to see their relationship and understand it, this vital piece of information is literally given through another character's voice over in which they state, "(Will Smith's character's) weakness is his daughter." For the rest of the movie, we're just expected to accept this and it feels really artificial. There is no real characterization, only shoehorned exposition. Margot Robbie's character is in the movie because she's attractive. She does nothing except annoy me and her characterization is even worse than Will Smith's. And oh my God, the Joker. Now, it'd be unfair to compare him to Heath Ledger, but Jared Leto's Joker is definitely the worst part of this movie. He's only in the movie to provide exposition for Margot Robbie's character and to give her any character at all. He provides nothing else for the movie except just making it worse every time he steps into the frame with his godawful performance. He's just bland, uninteresting, and completely useless, and every time he's in a scene, you're desperately waiting for it to end. There is also barely any plot. If the story had centered around one of the characters it may have been the slightest bit interesting, but as I mentioned before, any emphasis given to the characters is really bad. Instead, the entire movie is about beating all the generic enemies in the room and then advancing to the next level until you reach the really boring final boss. Everything else in the movie is just leading up to these final moments, and it's very dissatisfying. The ending battles of this movie are pretty much the ending battles of the Avengers movies, except much worse because all the characters suck, too. If I have to say anything good about this movie, I'll say that a small percentage of things going on looked cool and somewhat satisfying, and I laughed at a lot of the jokes. While Margot Robbie's character was awful, her performance was pretty entertaining to watch when it wasn't annoying. There are obviously movies far worse than Suicide Squad, which is why Im going to let it sit on a 3/10. But this was definitely the least enjoyable and most forgettable superhero movie I've seen in the recent wave of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You've Watched The Trailers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen any of the trailers for this movie, then you've already seen the best parts. There are so many things wrong with this film, I don't know where to begin. Horrible dialogue, mediocre effects, baffling cinematography, confusing editing, even the sound effects and music made one cringe. Then there are some moments in the film that make you want to slink down in your seat in shame. When The Enchantress started doing her belly dance I forgot all about her threat to humanity and instead struggled to keep from laughing out loud. The dialogue from all of the characters, except The Joker, was downright shameful. Margo Robbie probably had it worst of all. The "what is everyone looking at" attitude and "yes, I'm crazy, so deal with it" repetitiveness wore thin quickly. And you would think that an actor that can command the bucks like Will Smith can, well, there's simply no excuse. Here come the spoilers: The Joker is NOT part of the Suicide Squad. The villain IS, but instead of participating in their mission, she's the reason for it. One of the previously unmentioned members (Slipknot) shows up out of a clear blue sky and is promptly decapitated for his good deed. Boomerang turns out to be one of those guys that privately likes to talk OTHER people into resisting authority figures, but publicly he either backs down or screws the pooch for those that are really serious. Diablo has become a pacifist, but is the one who finally defeats the villain in the end. We're supposed to believe that Deadshot's weakness is his love for his daughter and yet, when he's given a choice between killing Harley Quinn or his daughter, he chooses his daughter. What? Yes, you heard it right. Literally or figuratively, it makes no difference. No one thought of this, or if they did, it never made it to the screen: Deadshot shoots the rope, thereby freeing Harley to plummet to her own fate , AND convincing authority figures that he at least tried. Or, when The Joker suddenly realizes that Deadshot is about to blow his girlfriend away, he flips a switch and the rope she's dangling from suddenly becomes a Bungee cord that smoothly extends and gently lowers Harley safely to the ground. Of course this causes The Joker to laugh hysterically. The scene in the trailers where The Joker says "I'm not gonna kill ya, I'm just gonna hurt ya really, really bad." is NOT being said to some helpless kidnapped victim (you know what I mean), but to his one and only true love Harley Quinn herself. I suppose it's to make her more dateable? The Joker's car is cool. For about 30 seconds before it plummets into the water. And where are all of the counter-Batman gadgets located in said car? And why does The Joker leave Harley for dead after said plummet, but can't brace himself (in a flashback) to leave her for dead after she plummets into another unwholesome body of water? Are those perpetual tattooed tears real or not? The military commander's bodyguard. If the time ever comes when she has to defend herself or the commander from the unsavory characters they are both forced to share company with, and who are all mostly heavily armed or "gifted" in some extreme way, she will have to do so with...a sword. In one scene we're shown that several if not All of the nano explosives implanted in the necks of the Squad members have been deactivated by The Joker, but at the end their "Boss" threatens to explode said explosives if they don't continue to obey her orders.All of this nonsense goes on for about 2 hours, from beginning to end, and at no point is the viewer allowed to identify with or "get to know" any of the characters in any meaningful way. It's not that they don't try, the attempt simply fails. What one is left with is a great title, some talented actors strangled by a disastrous script, and a slow but building anger and frustration at the realization that everyone involved in this fiasco simply "blew it". Marvel, pass Go and collect 200 dollars. DC, take two steps back and pay the hotel owners each 2 thousand dollars. Or at least refund the cost of the ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to really like this movie, but it falls short in too many areas. First let me say the movie is mostly entertaining. Will Smith did a better job than anyone imho. I really enjoyed his performance and his costume looked pretty awesome. The very first action sequence was very well done. Again, Will Smith stole the show in that scene, especially near the end. Now on to the bad:90% of the "funny" lines just didn't deliver, meaning no one in the theater laughed. The 10% that were actually funny were delivered by Will Smith. The attempt at humor was just kind of lame for all the others, especially Harley (no matter how easy she is on the eyes).Special effects changed here and there, enough to be distracting. They looked amazing at times and disappointing at others. I find that annoying in any movie.I found the bar scene to be just stupid. I was watching it and couldn't get The Breakfast Club out of my head since its what it reminded me of. I found it really pathetic and it should have been omitted from the film.The Joker looked cool and was portrayed well, he just needed more screen time in order to make the movie better.I found myself laughing at Katana the whole time. The character just wasn't portrayed well and the costume looked kinda stupid to me.Amanda Waller in this movie is nothing but Mrs. Frederick from Warehouse 13 on the SyFy channel. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but I found Waller to be an unoriginal character anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some excellent performances mired in a meaningless story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad Movie ReviewA 'movie' can mean many things to many people. Some people see a 'film', consisting of characters engaged in stories that describe a plot. Some people see a massive spectacle of shiny things and loud sounds. Some people just want to smile a little for two hours.No one is 'right' or 'wrong'. You pay your money, and either you get something you enjoy, or you don't.If you're looking for a 'film', this is not it. There is no plot. The stories are flimsy at best, and non existent for long stretches. Some characters appear to have some depth once in a while, but not much, and not for long. Plenty of others are even shallower.If you're looking for a spectacle of shiny things and loud sounds, there's plenty of those, but Suicide isn't chocked full of them. There are bigger spectacles if that's what you want.If you just want to smile for a couple hours, then you may well be in luck. Will Smith (as Deadshot) is a Movie Star (capital M, capital S). He oozes charm. He gives his full effort and can pull off gravitas when needed, and timing for when comic relief is needed. Margot Robbie (as Harly Quinn) is his on screen equal, providing a demented gravitas and delivering her lines and actions with perfection. Between the two of them, they form an unlikely couple that at no point ever feels likely, yet doesn't feel forced. The movie rests on their shoulders entirely, but they are up to the task. While Smith and Robbie form the twin pillars supporting this movie, Viola Davis (as Amanda Waller) and Jared Leto (as The Joker) both put in fantastic performances. Davis plays the stock government agent who isn't afraid to bend the rules to get things done. It is an effortless performance, if anyone could run a shadow world government, it's Davis. The problem is the character simply has an arc that implodes. Davis's character feels worse than wasted, but rather deliberately turned into something useless.Similarly Leto's Joker is amazing? and entirely pointless. My own 'idea' of the Joker is the Mark Hamill version from the Batman cartoons of the 90s. He's psychotic, but ultimately a crime lord. He wants to be rich. Jack Nicholson's Joker touched on this, but didn't really capture it. Heath Ledger's Joker is, a master performance, but still diminishes the character itself. Leto has captured the same energy that Ledger has tapped into, while grounding the Joker into the world as the psychotic crime lord. The thing is, there is no room in the plot of Suicide Squad for a psychotic crime lord, so Leto makes the most of his screen time, but, the time is not time well spent.There are other characters and actors in the movie. I don't remember who they are or what they do. Something about killing innocent people. The 'good' guys have a much higher body count than the 'bad' guys, although I'm starting to think that might be the go to move for DC comics movies. There are a LOT of bad things that I can say about this movie, but honestly, I liked it. Smith, Robbie, Leto and Davis bring it, and their performances deserve to be appreciated. If everyone else was cut out, and we focused on just these four, we might have something truly special.Instead, we just get something pretty good.I'm willing to spend 2 hours watching something pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A laughing matter it is not. Suicide Squad has some colorful baddies, but gives little for them to do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney seems to have the market down on superhero movies ever since they bought Marvel. With the numerous Iron Man, Captain America, and Avengers movies, mostly all receiving positive phrase from critics and audiences, how is it that the idea of a cinematic universe is so hard to do in another fashion. Disney is about to do the same with the Star Wars stories, and yet Warner Brothers seems to be having trouble with the DC comics' stories. Man of Steel started with a well- intended Superman, but fell due to story issues and regard with simple logic. Batman V Superman made even bigger mistakes when it tried to combine five or six movie ideas into one. One of the biggest problems is that director Zack Snyder had set up those previous film as so dark and brooding, that they lack much fun. The action scenes are good, but both movies had an identity crisis of it's own by not knowing how take it's dark tone and make it more fun. Warner Brothers was smart enough to understand just how colorful the villains are. Batman, Superman, The Flash, and the rest of the Justice League are full of baddies that have worked with each other in the comics. Suicide Squad seems like a proper step to take to try and give DC fans something different. Set after the events of Batman V Superman, intelligence operative Amanda Walker (played by Viola Davis) is worried that the next "Superman" being could be a force of evil rather then good. Knowing that most military would not be a match for powerful beings, she proposes a team of villain and criminals to be used as a disposable asset in high risk missions. When an archaeologist Dr. June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne) becomes possessed by a witch called the "Enchantress" and sets on destroying the world, the team is brought out of the prison and into the streets.This Suicide Squad consists of assassin/marksmen Deadshot (played by Will Smith), crazy Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie), mouthy Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), pacifist but fiery El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez), cannibalistic Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and sword wielding Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara). Their all being led by Army officer Rick Flag as they make their way closer into the center of the city to stop the Enchantress. If that wasn't enough, the Joker (played by Jared Leto) is coming in to take Harley Quinn back to Gotham. The good news is that Suicide Squad is better then Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. The bad news is that it's not by much. I'll say that I'm glad the this DC movie finally tried to evoke more fun into it's universe. That idea shows a lot within it's players. The best here are Will Smith and Margot Robbie who sport out the best one liners and really embrace the insanity that I wanted more of. Jai Courtney actually found a role that works to his advantage. Viola Davis does well with the material given. Jared Leto manages to bring a new and unique Joker, though we see very little of him.I liked the team and the movie does a fine job setting things up in the first thirty minutes. What Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel's equivalent to this) got right was they allowed their party members to go nuts and interact with each other. There's not much of that in Suicide Squad as the dialogue between each player is minimal in favor of action scenes that are alright, but nothing to brag about. One of the bigger problems is that the villain is incredibly bland and uninteresting. With the talent available, why couldn't these guys be fighting Joker? The Enchantress gives little more then "I'm Evil!". Warner Brothers may have the bad guys ready to go, but the story doesn't give them a place exciting to go. I'll give this five Harley Quinn mallets out of ten. If Warner Brothers expects a big cinematic universe with the DC characters, they really need to make some management changes to those behind this creatively. These are good ideas, but they need more madness then what Suicide Squad has to offer. A laughing matter this is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad: Bad Guys or Nice Guys, I'm Confused?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner brother's Suicide Squad hit the theaters this past weekend and to say I was enthusiastically anticipating this film would be putting it lightly. After all the Avengers assembling, Guardians of the Galaxy guarding and Fantastic Four flopping, I was ready for a super hero film a little on the opaque side. The Dark Knight seemed years ago, and after the disappointment of Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, I just had the feeling DC was going to get this one right. I was wrong.Before I get into everything that's wrong with Suicide Squad, let's cover what's right about this movie. Thumbs up number one: Will Smith. It's been a long time since the old "Big Willy" from the Independence Day and Bad Boys days has been on screen, but it was good to see that Will still has some street swagger left in him. His Deadshot is just the right mixture of gangster bravado mixed with family sentimentality to make him a likable man whose life work just happens to be murdering people.The scene stealer in this movie however, is Margot Robbie. Everything that's this film was suppose to be is summed up in her part as Harley Quinn. She's messed up in the head, but she's really very intelligent. She is in love, but it's fatalistic. She's crazy, but insanely beautiful, a serious paradox for most men to grasp and she uses that as her ace in the hole brilliantly. Now, what's wrong with Suicide Squad; it's too nice. This movie should be the super hero version of Apocalypse Now, and it actually starts off like that's what the audience is going to get. We're introduced first to Amanda Waller (played by the always perfect Viola Davis). She's conceived a plan to protect the people of Earth from Superman type meta-humans who don't share the big guy's love for the planet. She wants a team of some of the worst criminals on the planet, expendables, who if they can't repel these super threats, then they die in the process, and no one will care. The trip through the mega-maximum security prison where Waller's Suicide Squad will be drafted is the best part of the movie. With an awesome shadowy soundtrack featuring the likes of The Animal's House of the Rising Sun and the Stones' Sympathy for the Devil, we get a grand tour of the facility and see the atrocious and inhumane way that these meta-menaces to society are held captive. Beaten, prodded, electrocuted and starved this should guarantee that a healthy dose of hate and rage towards the system has been installed in each of Waller's chosen few. But that doesn't happen.Instead, these heinous criminal, once taken from their respective cages and dungeon pits, and put together for the first time, and get along better than a jamboree of boy scouts. I kid you not, this psychotic group of low lives jell together better than the Avengers, X-Men and Fantastic Four combined. And for this type of movie, that's not a good thing. There is no internal fighting, no trying to be the top guy, no indignity of being told what to do. When they find out that the mission they thought they were on was bogus, do they tear up the city? No, they just take it in stride and even buddy up with Colonel Flagg (the unimpressive Joel Kinnaman), the man who has lied to them and threaten to kill them if they don't cooperate.The jovial "cheerfulness's of this "Suicide Squad" is symptomatic of this movie's problems. Nothing works the way it should beginning with Jared Leto's Joker. Leto's take on the pasty- faced madman isn't bad as much as it's misplaced. His story and involvement with Harley Quinn seem to be some kind of "bonus movie" added to this film to give it some extra spice. Unfortunately, it just adds to the confusion. The film's focal villain, The Enchantress (the equally unimpressive Cara Delevingne), may be the worst super villain since Richard Pryor's Gus Gorman in Superman III back in the day. The totally unbelievable love story between The Enchantress' alter ego, Dr. June Moone and Colonel Flagg is completely forgotten when the movie hit's its anti-climatic ending (which is a second rate CGI rip-off of the Avengers). While Smith and Robbie give top-notch performances, the rest of the cast just seem to be there marking time, ready to give whatever uninteresting scrap of dialog they've been tossed to fill screen time.Writer/Director David Ayer, who successfully pulled off such grim thrillers as Training Day, and Fury, appeared to be a great choice for making DC's first gritty super hero film outside the Batman trilogy. However, he seriously drops the ball on this one. This isn't the grim, anti-hero vessel we were promised. This is just a cookie-cuter super hero film with no substance; no cohesiveness and nothing left to savior once the credits begin to roll. The cinematography was spot on and it appeared that DP Roman Vasyanov followed his own vision about how this film should look despite what was happening with the script and direction. Overall, Suicide Squad fails to deliver in much the same way that Batman Vs. Superman hit the wall. Both film seemed to lack vision or direction and didn't do enough to take advantage of potentially powerful and fascinating characters. What should have been DC's finest hour turned out to be nothing more than a big fat lie wrapped in a pretty box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Rival to Catwoman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wannabe blockbuster will leave you feeling pretty neutral. They do the most boring thing possible to introduce the characters, they give you small flashbacks and talk about them all to typically cliché ridden rock songs. The end result? you really don't care about any of them. They're supposed to be bad guys but the worst you see them do is steal a purse. Strangely, that was one of the highlights of the film. So the story can pretty much be summed up in 10 words: Criminals are let out of prison to stop a villain. There, I just saved you $15. 90% of the cast is disposable, they fight some terribly rendered, faceless lump heads then fight some guy that I swear was in Tron from the 80's. There's really not much to say about the film because that's pretty much it. While sitting through the first half hour of introductions and talking I had to lean over to the person next to me and ask if I'd missed the six more interesting movies that should've preceded this hot mess. No, she replied. It's too bad, some of them looked like they may be slightly more interesting than what I was watching. There was really nothing remarkable about this piece of fluff. It seems to be designed for 14-year- old boys who haven't ever read an actual book or seen any decent films. At one point in the movie they actually gave us a flashback of an event that happened only 20-minutes earlier, and not to introduce new information but to just reiterate something that was bad enough viewing once. At the end of the movie, I felt more intrigued by the buttons that moved my seat back and forth than by anything I'd seen. Hopefully this will end the vacuous reign of Zac Snyder and comic book movies. If it doesn't, then maybe they just need to hear that comic book movies are only a step above video game movies. Give us a story that doesn't rely on the protagonists standing around the bad guy in a rough circle while hitting them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man.....I was so hyped for this movie, I watched the trailer every week waiting and waiting.And the day arrived. First Half hour it was a good movie with a nice soundtrack, Beginning with Viola Davis introducing each member of the squad. Then the mess start....Will Smith being his charismatic self except charisma does not mean good acting. The actor had the most cringe worth performances and lines of the movie, trying to bring a big name to draw the crowd, with little to none performance to add, in a movie this hyped, is pure stupidity.Margot Robbie, although I still don't think she's that good of an actress, she is surprising the high part of the movie with her antics, comedy and seductive nature.Jared Leto is one of the low points of the movie, completely unnecessary for the movie, BUT all trainer used him as the huge high point every interview was about Leto, every video, photo was about the new Joker who was to top every single one being Nicholson, Ledger or Hamil. Should have cutted all of him and focused more on the plot of the filmCroc and Boomerang got left on the sidetracks while the director( or the studio) forced the movie solely on Smith and Robbie, wasted potential. Katana with almost no screen time does steal the scene mainly because her outfit draws attention, explaining the power of her sword was used a very corny line and that was it, better left unsaid. And the last member of the squad Diablo.....he was to be the highest point of the film, great arc, great background but that ending......destroyed all the good he has done on the filmViola Davis shines as a great Amanda Waller, but her Amanda is a terrible at her job, thanks to a horrible script. won't say more to not spoil things but when acting is concern she was the highest point of the movie.Finally, who smoke the weed that allowed Cara Delevingne be casted as enchantress? Smith in my opinion was bad on it, but she makes him looks like Heath Ledger on the Dark Knight, the excess of CGI didn't help, but it made even worse, First rule of movie making, ALWAYS cast a great actor/actress for the villain. because that's where it's going to be needed, the motivations, the rage everything must be passed to the audience, if doesn't get a good actor/actress for that part most of the times the audience won't connect. There were a lot of technical problems with the editing, and when I read that materials were taken from the joker, katana, boomerang and others off the picture, I have no choice but to believe because of the poor editing that makes scenes don't look connected and brutally cutted, the soundtrack was good, but you can't stop comparing to Guardins of the Galaxy, that was much better in comparison( despite having a poor villain as well), some songs seems to be putted there only because of the trailer, not because it fitted on the mood, I kind of enjoyed but it is important to point that out).And the ending......Ahhhh the ending...... So cliché, so much slow motion, so much cliché, so much slow motion( that was on purpose).....I never watched but every single person that has compared this ending with the final act of Fantisc 4(2015) with better CGI, might be just exaggeration, but that's how they felt on the level of horrible that ending was.I paid the ticket because I am a fan and practically had an orgarms at each trailer they release, if you aren't run away from this. A voted for a 6 because I'm a fan, and because the first half was good, but it wouldn't be overkill to but it as a 5 or 4 because of the way the second and third act went.P.S.: I'm incredible rusted on my English, if you read and saw a mistake fell free to correct me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that it is usually quite easy to forgive the flaws in these superhero movies - you go and watch what is always going to be a fanciful movie with characters and plots that defy sense, and CGI stunts that blow your mind. This movie however does all of this without any semblance of a sensible plot, and with the distraction of the worst 'Joker' performance ever, in a plot stream that is irrelevant to the main movie scenario. I, like many others, have been waiting for this movie for a while, but overall I was extremely disappointed. I did quite like the performance of the prolific Margot Robbie - I seem to have seen her in 3 movies in the last 6 weeks - and Will Smith was passable as Deadshot, but the others were pretty poor. Of course people have to make up their own minds, but Don't say you haven't been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was a mess to say the least. I give it a score of 5 (or maybe 1 more only for the performance of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn) There are so many plot holes in the movie and the plot device is extremely weak (almost none existent). Just give an example (there are many): there is one scene that Harley Quinn was saved by Joker by deactivating the device in her body that would kill her if she did not obey government orders. Later Harley rejoined the squad to finish their mission. And in the end, the government claimed that they were still not free and threaten them yet again using this killing device and successfully put her back into the jail. The writer seems to totally forget the device had already been DEACTIVATED for Harley Quinn. I had high hope for this movie based on its trailers but I was so wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying to do a little too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the annoying things about travelling overseas is that it can be quite difficult getting to see a movie that one wants to see. For instance this film opened later in Singapore and Germany than it did on Australia, however in the Netherlands and Belgium it was playing, and fortunately for me it was playing in English (with French and Flemish subtitles ? which can be annoying as when the characters are speaking in another language you don't get the English translation, and unfortunately I don't speak Latin).Anyway, the film is set after the events in Batman vs Superman and forms another of the DC Extended Universe films (and Batman does make the occasional appearance). However, unlike the previous films what we have are basically a bunch of criminals, or should I say super villains, who are thrown together and made to go and save the day against some even more powerful supervillians. The idea is that now Superman has gone, but his enemies remain, then we are going to need some pretty impressive people to save the world.The problem that I found with this film, and it is a pretty big problem, is that the story seems to be way too rushed. In fact they not only rush through the section where all of the characters are introduced, but they then rush through the section where the bad guy is introduced, and there is little in the way of building up as to why this happened ? it is implied but this isn't the sort of movie where things should be implied.They also introduce the Joker into this film and the problem with that is that it is going to be incredibly hard to be able to top Heath Ledger's performance ? okay maybe they weren't even trying but the problem is that Ledger's shadow will always be hanging over the character and it is going to be a very hard act to follow. In my opinion I was never all that impressed with the original Batman movie, so outdoing Jack Nicholson (if that is even possible) was never going to be a huge task, not so much because of Nicholson but because of the material that he had to work with. However, Ledger defined the character in a way that it feels as if nobody can effectively follow in his footsteps.The other problematic thing that I found, which is generally the case in a lot of films like this, is that there are so many characters it is quite hard to give them the air time that they need, to the point that Deadshot and Harley Quinn literally dominated the screen and everybody else was simply there to make up the numbers. As such, with the film being rushed, and the attempt to create as much detail with the characters in the limited time available sort of resulted in a movie with a lot of ambition, but an execution that simply didn't work out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific start but slowly turned into a bland and terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: Basic superhero plot with literally nothing special. Started out pretty decent with the character's introduction sequence but then dragged it out for 1 hour making it terribly boring. Not to mention, you don't make a movie with a "SUICIDE" in the title but ends up making it comedic and not one moment of tension. Furthermore, the editor screws it up, showing the plot twist way before its moment, and it's not even a hard to guess one. 4/10Soundtrack: Best part of the movie with classics ranging from The Rolling Stones to Queen to Slim Shady to RadioheadHowever, really bad timing and editing, you don't put "Without Me" and then cut the rapping, you don't put on "Bohemian Rhapsody" then cut abruptly 30 seconds after the intro. And so on9/10 for bad timingVisual: While the fighting scenes have some decent CGI and Killer Croc is pretty real, it felt like they've used up all the money so everything else like the background city or the practical effects are very simple and basic, making 40% of the movie look fake as hell, which in the kind of movies like this, doesn't show the seriousness of the situation.Usually use medium shot to close up to get a feel of the character yet only focus on Harley Quinn, which is annoying6/10Characters:Good acting, however, the screen writing sucks, Joker is a sociopath who don't care for anything except making the Bat suffers, Harley Quinn barely can fight, Deadshot is the head of the squad, not just some guy who can shoot and so on. And there are no team chemistry + Not just that, they made characters act so suddenly that it doesn't even coincide with their feelings in the same film5/10Overall: 6.0/10. Suicide Squad but doesn't have the "Suicide" part or even the "Squad" part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Film - Silly Ratings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first post because I cannot understand why people rate films so stupidly. Suicide Squad must be one of the most varied reviewed films I have seen. I have no idea how people can rate this 10/10 or 1/10. Is this the best or worse film ever made. - No!Pick your best film you've ever watched - this is 10/10. Pick your worst - this is 1/10. Rate this film by comparing it to best and worst.Take away all the hype and this is just an average 'superhero' film - 5/10. I expected a lot more but it wasn't the case.My only other comment is the lack of humour: There must be approx 10 times in the film, when a comment is said or situation happens and the camera pans to one of the other cast (mainly Harley) for the punchline. Each time this happened, not a single person in the packed cinema laughed. Obviously the script writers thought the one-liner response was funny but not the audience when I watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie today and I must say its a very good movie. I had some minor issues with the movie, like the lack of a theme, and some illogical short scenes but nothing important. The action is good, the editing is good, the movie is not to dark. Its NOT a Zack Snyder movie, and the art and action style kind of reminded me of Watchmen from time to time. This deserves a 7 star rating, however I gave it 8 for "saving" the DC movies and bringing its fans good entertainment. Its a better movie than the Zack Snyder superman movies and better than the amazing spiderman 2. Its worth your time and money.Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well were do I begin. I was so excited to finally see this movie, so when my friends offered to go to the movies I was ecstatic. Popcorn in my hands and here the fun begins or so I thought. Sadly this was one of the most disappointing films I have seen in a while. First of all the story line is chaotic, mixed and unclear. There's no start to movie, beginning up until middle is just a mess and only from the middle the story some what makes sense. The end is sooooo over due. The slow motion was good in some parts but the final of the movie was so long that I was ready to leave not even waiting until the slow motion will end. Second of all who the hell decided to cast Cara Delavigne for this part?! This is beyond me. Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of Cara's but her acting skills are surely not up to part compared to so many other people in the movie. She should stick to modeling where she's awesome at. The only well played character was Harley Quinn. Loved her, the humor was on point she was the only one who got me trough the movie sane. Other actors (even Will Smith) were so mediocre it was painful to watch. Definitely not worth the hype and definitely not worth the money to go and see it in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No love out there for DC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one who buys in to conspiracy theories. I'm really not. I'm not a "fanboy." I'm 42 years old and am still learning which characters belong to Marvel or DC. Having said that, I just find it really bizarre how the DC movies are getting destroyed by critics and Marvel is always highly regarded. Of the three big comic book movies this year: BvS, Civil War, and now Suicide Squad - I felt all three were close in quality and would have a hard time ranking them. So to see the brutal reviews for Suicide Squad, I felt it was time to write another review. The movie is well paced with great action scenes. The characters aren't especially deep and the acting isn't that great but are adequate. Harley Quinn is the only character who I felt they really put effort into and works quite well. The Joker is good enough. They were wise to re-imagine the Joker after Ledger's performance and death. It was better to go in a new direction than try to recreate his performance. I especially enjoyed the introduction of each character with their background and abilities. Though the relationship between Flag and Moone/Enchantress felt hollow. Overall, I had a good time with it. I just can't fathom how it sits at 26% on Rotten Tomatoes. That's ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, that was awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a lot of hope for this movie. The commercials made it look so good that I really wanted to like it, but I can't achieve the impossible. It starts off getting a feel for the character and an introduction to them. This is all good and helps set a basic idea of what's going on and what will happen. You see Viola Davis pitch the whole Suicide Squad idea and it's all set up. When the squad is sent out you think they are going to accomplish one thing (that I won't say for the spoilers), but then towards the end it get's weird and unclear. Also they started to throw in random character that we didn't know about like the lady from Japan and the one guy with the cornrows. The Joker was such a random character. I understand to know Harley Quinn's background we need to know about him, but like he was so irrelevant. I feel like the writing was just really bad in general because the second half of the movie was a hot mess and the cheesy one liners. Then the acting was awful. I love Margot Robbie, but she and Jared Leto were terrible. Like really, really bad. I think the director/writer was just so excited about being able to go so many different ways with this movie, that he wanted to do them all (that wasn't a good idea). If they had a different writer/director this could be a great movie. Too bad they didn't.</fullReview>

An alternate title to this movie could be "Plot where?", considering not a spec of this script spoke of originality. This was very clearly a mixup of every superhero movie stereotype possible, and it didn't work. It could have worked, but it didn't, and I'm as disappointed as the next guy. It was a complete mess of tropes, misused plot devices and characters with no depth. The most disappointing thing about this movie, honestly, is how bad it is. It's not funny bad. It's pitifully bad. It's an uninspired mess who's only light is it's characters, none of who are given enough screen time or good writing to make completely work, despite great acting by Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandes, among others. Great idea. Terrible execution. The result? A movie not worth spending your time or money on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't watch this film.Right, that said, here's what I attacked my arm with a sharpie with whilst watching this awful, awful, film. I have pictorial evidence of this which I'm happy to DM or something here, I was going to link to a tinypic, but that seemed a little dodgy. Here's what I 'memento'd' my arm with: intro ... actors ... Expoition ... A-Team intro ... pacing ... Enchantress Good ... not convincing ... violence too old / humour too young ... no drama for Joker despite good performance ... incomprehensible dark fight ... comic beats all miss ... ---censored quote from end of film--- ...So, three things up front: Firstly, because of how I wrote my arm comments, the reaction here will be mostly (but not obviously) chronologically based on what happened, but there are no spoilers here. Secondly, I've not exposed myself to hype or reaction to the film, so thoughts and feelings are my own, uninfluenced by media, social media, or friends. Then finally (related to number two) I go in to a film straight, meaning that even if I love the trailer I'll not go in thinking it'll be great. This works the other way, too ... I really found Sisters quite hilarious.OK, I've given my 'intro', so why not look at theirs ... theirs being the first, painful, forty minutes of a film this year, which basically boils down to "The A-Team". So, yeah, I'm not sure that I've seen more exposition so obviously spelled out for me on screen in years ... sometimes literally. But there's more expository nonsense that just keeps flooding, and flooding, your ears and eyes. I have a theory that if you remove 90% of the flashbacks you might have a shorter film buy the performances would actually have some subtlety to them. Harley's craziness would be ... CRAZY ... Joker's motivations (as I believe they should be) would be indecipherable ... Laton's few genuine emotions would be sold so hard. I do feel like this over usage of flashback (without overtly fetishising it for irony-lolz) is just more heavy literal thinking and expository pointlessness. The actors on show here can *perform* and most of that is lost if you spell out all of that to the viewer.That's probably the only issue with the performances, I think. They all seem to be doing a relatively good job with what was written the horrible pacing and structure just bury emotion, humour, and subtlety which basically kills any effective character development. Although I'll focus minutely on Robbie's performance which I just couldn't get anything from, I do put that down to editorial interference though, it just feels like your fringe friend that is pretending a little too hard. She does, though, like every other player, get given one decent emotional moment to sell (you'll know them when they come because of the massive sign on the screen saying "BIG EMOTIONAL MOMENT"), and these are all handled well enough, but are completely buried by the overwrought stylings of the film.I guess that can nicely lead in to my one large positive from this complete mess of a film; Cara Delavigne's performance and most of the handling of The Enchantress in general. This said, I didn't feel that she was super threatening, but that's neither here nor there in this part of the analysis. The character really did fit the GRIMDARK aesthetic of the DC films thus far, and I think she'd have worked very well in any of the other properties that they have, so I'd like to see her kept around for when they get to magic in their Universe. I think the lack of threat probably came from it looking much like a weaker version of the planet smasher from MOS. Anyway, I digress, Delavigne is using those peepers perfectly, and really holds the screen and your thoughts well. It feels very much like the only decent, real, emotional, character building that happens, and when it does it's so sparse that I think that it's good that we got what we did out of it.Let's salute the GRIMDARK again, and take a quick snigger at the poor attempts to bring humour in to the fray. There is only one really good line that actually lands throughout the whole thing and it's Killer Croc that gets it. Otherwise the unfortunate literal nature of the film meant that I actually laughed more at one of Rick Flagg's last lines as an extremely helpful indicator of what was actually occurring for the characters... Tommy Wiseau level stuff. It's a sad time when you're laughing *at* a film rather than with it, it's sad because they could have cut some of the violence and aimed this solely at kids (it's a 15 in the UK) and lose some level of the 'bad guy' device, or ramp that up, and lose the Nickleodeon level "humour." So amongst the usual things that have plagued the Snyder films (he's EP on this, Ayer wrote and directed everything apart from a Boomerang Flashback) like the grimdark, the bad storytelling, the grimdark, the lack of humour, the gri... ... this just doesn't work on nearly every level. Poorly scripted, presented, directed, and ultimately this all ruining performances, it just all points to an unfortunate vision from Ayer.I'm actually lowering my score having read back what I'd written here, which puts it level with 'The Room' ... maybe I'll have a think about that.</fullReview>

Also, I read a lot about Suicide Squad being targeted unfairly with unfavorable reviews and wanted to do my part to support it. Unfortunately, I found that the poor reviews were actually well on point. The humor is cheesy and awkward, the story has glaring inconsistencies and plot holes you could drive a truck through, and the acting is terrible (save a couple of exceptions). Arguably the main attraction of the movie, the Joker gets minimal screen time as well. I don't remember the last time it happened, but I actually face-palmed at some of the "plot twists" and the extremely cheesy one-liners. It just doesn't seem like Ayer sees his viewers like people with a brain and capable of thinking for themselves. I really did feel insulted by the shallowness of it all, so much so that I felt compelled to leave a review for my fellow movie-buffs. Don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

Not one likable character to root for and they are not bad villains as they are in the comic, often rather teary eyed and snuggly with each other. I can't believe that the creators of this movie could be so irresponsible as to mislead people about a subject that still struggles to be heard and understood in our society. Throw in Will Smith being the annoying, unrealistic lead with Harley Quinn's ever changing accent and you have the mess that is Suicide Squad. Despite all this, the vampire looking Joker is not terrible. He is not good either, but if you take away the ghetto look with the grills and tattoos and not imitating Ledgers voice, you might have had a somewhat decent performance. Sadly, the look ruins anything good. A plot that is severely lacking just like any of the characters who you honestly do not care if they live or die. DC failed again which disappoints me to no end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a fun movie. Honestly, the characters are way more interesting than superheroes. I'm not sure why the critics are hating on it so much. It is a little messy, and there is one sequence with the witch that is a little goofy. Compared to what is out right now, it's better than Jason Bourne and Ghostbusters. Comparing it to other superhero movies it's far better than Iron Man 3, the first Thor, both Hulk movies and the first Captain America. And isn't anyone getting tired of the same story line in both Avengers movies and Captain America Civil war. I wonder how Tony Stark will undermine the team in the 3rd Avengers movie. The only better superhero movie I've seen this year was Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as Wild, Wild West overall, CGI, story, and acting are though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a waste of time, in bad way. Like Batman versus Superman, the CGi is dark and appears to be created using the least cost. Will Smith plays Deadpool better than let's say, James West in Wild, Wild, West, but doesn't earn his paycheck. Harley Quinn is like the psycho ex girlfriend in an abusive relationship who you would like to see do better, but will hit you with a bat. Overall the movie hardly reaches the fun that some of the Marvel Movies achieve. The CGI is about the same as what was used in Green Latern, not good, and the quality of the overall writing was about the same as Green Latern. If you like Batman versus Superman, then you will like this. Otherwise, wait and watch at home, the CGI might look better on your LED display than on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I really blame the director. What we saw is such a mess. At the beginning you will feel that you are going to watch a very good movie when they started to show everyone's story. But after that its getting worse every minute pass. We saw these actors in a lot of movies making such a hell of acting. We saw them drive us into emotions and feelings , but here ? you wish you are a 5 years kid so you can ignore all the stupid conversations and the strange things they do. I really don't blame them coz the main problem is that DC started while ago spending less money on there movies to get a higher profit Superman vs Batman was the beginning , suicide squad and also we can know exactly what we will see in League of justice that its not better than these two Please stop ruin everything we love coz of your greed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DC is in a bit of a bad spot right now. After the colossal backlash to 'Batman V Superman' they decided to put all their eggs into one basket. That basket being 'Suicide Squad'. I'm gonna say it right now. If this movie represents the DC movies we are going to get in the next few years, they need to quit now. Because this film is quite honestly one of the worst comic book movies I have seen in the last decade. Now, I have something of a rep for hating on the Marvel films. But nothing they have made even comes close to the garbage fire that is this movie. But lets start at the beginning. The film opens with Viola Davis at a meeting with a couple of expendable government dude bros.She sits them down and tells them that she wants to gather a group of bad guys together as a silver bullet just in cause something really really bad happens. And what do ya know? Something really really bad happens. The rest of this movie. I'm not joking when I say that this is on the same level as last years 'Fant4stic'.There is so much wrong with this film that it physically hurt to sit through it. Unfortunately I didn't realize this earlier or I would have walked out of the theater. And I have never walked out of a movie in my life. But I should've seen it coming. Because right away, it's bad. The first twenty minutes of the film are filled with exposition dumps the likes of which I have never seen.Viola Davis's character literally sits at a table and tells a couple dudes the names, abilities, and backstories of almost all the villains featured in the movie. Twenty minutes of nothing. Twenty minutes of time wasted on something that can effortlessly be written into conversation through out the movie. And that's the biggest issue with this film. &#x200b; The writing is so incredibly awful. Not only can Ayer seemingly not write a convincing character but he can't even write a coherent story. This movie is all over the freaking place. First they get the bad guys together to stop some glowing Egyptian dudes but not really. They actually go into some rando building to do a thing that makes no sense. And along the way they get into slow mo fights between literal piles of trash.Then they have to go do something else and then something else. Completely ignoring the orbital drill plunging into the sky, which may as well have spelled doom in mid air. As they went about doing nothing the film attempts to give them some shred of personality by force feeding us through flash backs. At completely random times someone would just have some stupid flash back that was irrelevant to anything happening.It was moments like these that made the films re-shoots glaringly obvious. There are scenes that come out of no where and as soon as they finish the movie gets going again. Like a scene with Harley Quin fighting trash guys in an elevator. She fights these nothings and then an actual story scene happens. Or in the subway scene when army man gives creepy girl a bomb and she arms it and takes off. The army man said it had a 2 second timer but it doesn't go off. She arms it, leaves, the timer shows one, and the scene cuts away. Everyone is fine and it's never brought up again.This happens so much through out the film it's painful. They just have flash backs and fight scenes for no reason at all. And whenever one of these fights comes up it's impossible to tell what is going on. The direction and editing is so choppy that things and people seemingly appear out of no where and sometimes just disappear again. Without the excessive use of slow-mo these scenes would be nothing more than shapes and colors moving around on a screen.I have so many problems with this film that it's impossible to put them all into a short review like this. The only reason I don't give this film the lowest score I can possibly give is because the cast gives solid performances. That is it. Every other aspect of this movie is utter nonsense. The story is all over the place, the characters are flat as boards, it's horribly unfunny, the direction and cinematography is by the numbers, and every ounce of logic seems stripped away. Not to mention how bad the soundtrack is. It cuts from pop song to cookie cutter nonsense from scene to scene, not caring about what the context of the scene is. 'Suicide Squad' wastes it's talented cast and will waste two hours of your life if you bother to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was REALLY looking forward to this film despite the trend of awful movies DC keeps pushing out into theaters. I really thought they may redeem themselves with this film but that is far from the case. The story is terrible. Walking out of the theater I am left pondering a million different ways the story could have gone. Millions of questions like "why didn't they just do this..." or "why did they have to bother doing that....?" It was a VERY weak story that wasn't all that interesting. But what really REALLY killed the movie for me personally was how choppy the whole thing felt. There were scenes that honestly felt like the editing team was just like "lets just put this scene right here cause its already been filmed... so yeah... why not." The fights were poorly shot and didn't really pull me in. I NEVER look at the time when watching a movie, but this film had me checking my watch every 15 minutes wondering how much longer it was going to go. The continuity from scene to scene was terrible, moments in the film that one would think should matter were underplayed, and moments in the film that had no build up were then tried to be made important with slow motion or a certain score that just didn't fit. Some of the scripting was just so beyond horrible that sitting in that movie theater seat was tormenting. Seriously, I was so angry walking out of that theater! I really wanted this movie to be amazing and it was easily one of the worst films I'd seen in a long time. (maybe my expectations were too high...)Some good notes: the actors tried their best, or at least I want to pretend that they did. Some of the jokes were actually funny even though they were interjected at the most random of moments (not all the time of course). The jokes helped alleviate some of the building depression that I was feeling from how awful a movie this was. And the first 30 minutes of back story to the villains were interesting. So I'll give it 4 out of 10 on those points and I'm being generous. Needless to say, I don't recommend this movie. I don't recommend watching it at full price in theaters. And I honestly think DC needs to get their act together or just stick to comic books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey DC, are you trying to f**k this up on purpose? Seriously! What the hell is going on over there. "Suicide Squad" was your chance to redeem yourself from the last critical failures. This movie should have been the one that saved DC and get it back on it's feet, but I guess not. I wanted this to be good or at least surprise me. There are some pros and plenty of cons in this. So lets kick it off. Will Smith and Viola Davis are easily the best parts of this movie. Smith brings the humility to his character and Davis brings the fear. Will Smith is the only character in this group that has any characterization as we get to know more about his past. Will Smith is basically playing Will Smith, but he was still good as the character. To be honest, I thought Voila Davis was more of a real threat then the actual threat itself. Margot Robbie was pretty good as Harley Quinn, but wasn't the show stealer as I thought she would be. She did a great job capturing the character and there was little peaks of humility as well. Her accent dose keep changing in a few scenes, but I can easily look pass that. I was one of those people who was against Jared Leto new look as the Joker. I know he's trying a different take on the character, but with all the stupid tattoo's all over him with the word 'damaged' on his forehead and the gangster grill teeth just wasn't the Joker. But I give Leto this, it's a bold move to take on the character after Ledger's unforgettable performance. I was being a bit too harsh at the time and Leto is a very method actor, so what's there's nothing to complain with the casting (besides the new look). After seeing the movie, Leto doesn't do a bad job as the Joker. He doesn't have that much screen time and every time he's on it screen, he kinda chews up the scenery. He was enjoyable to watch and I will make a full judgment when we have a movie where he has more screen time. Coming to think of it, The Joker should have been the main villain of the movie and not Enchantress (I'll get to her in a minute). Oh and I can't be the only one who thinks he looks like some manic you'll see in a Purge movie. Cara Delevingne not only gives the worst performance in the movie, but also the most laughable one as well. I mean, what is up with that hip moves and twirling her arms around? It's like the director gave up. Enchantress is right up there with Dr. Doom from "Fant4stic" as the worst villain in comic book movie. Enchantress is the basic villain who wants to shoot a giant blue lazier in the sky to destroy the world. Oh and please stop it with the blue lazier thing, it's in every comic book movie now and it's so stupid. Here's my question: Why would you sent these crazy and dangerous people on a mission to stop Enchantress. Yeah I really hope that doesn't back fire at all. I mean sure, send a guy who calls himself Captain Boomerang who's an insane person that throws boomerangs that never comes back to him to save us from giant portals from other worlds. Is it because they are expendable? It would have made a lot more sense if Wonder Women or The Flash or just anyone with god like powers to go on this mission. This really is a suicide mission. The rest of the Squad members were pretty forgettable and just didn't do anything. Katana was just kinda there. Slipknot is in it for a few minutes. Killer Croc just stands around going "mmmm" or "yeah", they didn't do anything with that character. The third act was this gigantic action scene that takes place in the city and the scene itself was just a mess. It was so muddled together and the editing was so poor that it sadly did remind me of "Fant4stic" climax. Some of the music choices didn't really fit well during a couple of scenes. It felt out of place and was only thrown at the last minute to make it a little light at heart. This is because of the heavy criticism for "Batman V Superman" for being too dark. I think DC biggest problem is that they are literally rushing the movies out just to catch up with Marvel. Take your time DC. But of course, many will be angry that I said that and will go to terrifying lengths to defend it. Fan boys seem to choose to deny any flaws from these movies and praise it for it's non-existing efforts. I'm not a DC hater. I'm not a Marvel fan boy. I only want a freaking good movie, is that hard to ask for. Just because it tried something new doesn't always mean it will bring great results. Everyone has an opinion, that's a no-brainier. Agree or disagree, just please don't act like a cry baby when some has a different opinion to you. Overall rating: "Suicide Squad" was a huge disappointment in a lackluster year for summer movies. The more I think about this, the more I hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent casting, pitiful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freshly watched the movie right after it is aired in France. I have to admit that it turned out to be a disappointment.Good:The casting is excellent. Led by Will Smith, the principal actors have all delivered remarkable job. This is the only thing that made me stay the whole length of it.Bad:The story is so badly done. I don't want to comment on the exact story line since it would be too nice to say that it contains a story. However, I get it, for a super hero movie, we don't necessarily need a kick-ass story to appreciate it. The thing that annoyed me the most is the hypocrisy in the marketing campaign of the movie. Let me put it in a separate paragraph:If you claim that this is a different super hero movie, and there's no classic characters and they are all villains, YOU HAVE TO HONOR YOUR WORDS!The whole movie was filled with a classical mentality of ex-villains repenting his wrongs. I'm sorry but this is nothing near "evilness" and craziness you claimed in the ads.There's NO ONE in this movie that is just evil or bad in this story. Joker and Harley are both quite impressive, but they are more of a symbol of craziness than evilness. All the other guys are dumb and optional. There's so much wasted potential. Maybe some of you will not like this review and feel that I'm against something abstract like "A classical American Righteous Mentality". For people that are so used to this, let me point out one thing explicitly: Having done something bad at some point of one's life then repenting it over a long period of time is simply called LIFE. The actual evilness starts from the moment you decide that you are NOT sorry about what you did and you'll continue to do so. The moment you repent, it certainly won't make you innocent nor free of the consequences, the evilness is gone.If you are expecting a movie that delivers the actually human struggle and evilness, I'd say don't waste your time on this one. If you are just into special effects and like those actors, you might give it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supervillains unite for plenty of action, but not enough wit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the Marvel Cinematic Universe skyrocketing in the popularity, the DC Universe has been subject to various attempts to get caught up on their path. DC was up to a fairly good start in the summer of 2013 when they rebooted the Superman franchise with 'Man of Steel', a spectacular cinematic representation of the one of the most iconic superheroes in store. Their progress however, fell short after the disappointing release of 'Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice', the film that failed to bring nuance and justice tot the portrayal of our heroes. DC Universe's second chance is then lied into the hands of this dark supervillain flick directed and written by David Ayer (Fury, End of Watch). Though this movie glorifies great creative autonomy in the portrayal of DC's notorious individuals, the heart of this cinematic piece finds itself plagued in the sea of mediocre writing and a lack of substance; though there is some fun to offered here. Following the events of Batman V. Superman, the film enters Viola Davis as intelligence operative Amanda Waller who recruits a gang of notorious villains on a mission to stop the evil Enchantress, who is possessed the body of archaeologist Dr. June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne, from taking over the world. Under the supervision Black Ops Colonel Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman), the team includes gun-totting Deadshot (played by Will Smith), the sexy but deranged Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) who is more interested in reuniting with the Joker (played by Jared Leto), the slick thief Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), the monstrous green creature Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the flame wielding El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez, master assassin Slipknot (played by Adam Beach), and expert swordsman Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara).For a film as highly anticipated as this, this one may have the fun and humor to make up for an okay experience, but it definitely falls short of expectations, especially for the fanboys those who read the comics; and there a plenty of flaws that taint this highly anticipated vehicle. The first twenty minutes began with Viola Davis's character and her plan on assembling team. During this point, we are given spoon-fed introductions on each villain including their tragic backstory and their paths that lead them to the sadistic criminals they are. Out of all of them, only Harley Quinn and Deadshot's story truly stand out, and their character arcs speak more than volumes; the rest of the gang is left as two-dimensional figures with much more to speculate. The romance and partnership between Harley and The Joker is beautifully told, capturing the true image of the two iconic villains; and the same can said about Deadshot's story of his journey to the darkside and his eagerness to return to his daughter who witnessed the grim change in her father's character. Other than this, the character development remains less than seldom. And the worse part is that the most disappointing character (ironically) happens to be The Joker who is sadly reduced to just only eight minutes of time on screen, making him feel more of a guest character than a true villain of the story. It's quite dispiriting considering the maniacal vibe Jared Leto delivers as the iconic villain. Of course, this performance is far leveling up to what Heath Ledger brought in 'The Dark Knight' or even Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's adaptation. Arguably the most charismatic performance here would Margot Robbie who brings plenty of dark humor and pure insanity as the criminally insane Harley Quinn, and by her side is Will Smith who deliver right on the spot as Deadshot. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney in what is easily his most charismatic role show off some credible performances, but nothing entirely memorable.As the plot revolves around the team's mission to defeat the Evil Enchantress, it descends into silly incoherent mess that favors a long stretch of visually compelling action sequences with plenty of special effects and explosive visuals to please the eyes, but not enough plot development. Through the antiheroes' battle against constant hordes of monstrous, zombie-like creatures lead by the Evil Enchantress, the story spends a great amount of time going almost nowhere. Don't get me wrong, these sequences are fun as the characters treat us to some clever (and occasionally crude) one-liners and some solid chemistry. After awhile, it's grows a little repetitive. And it certainly doesn't help that the scenes undergo some choppy editing with plenty of scenes cut out by the wishes of Warner Bros studios who wanted the story to go for a more "humorous" tone than a less dark approach, despite the fact that the Dark Knight Trilogy (centering on a hero) captured a pretty dark and gritty feel. If you are gonna edit out some scenes, it would probably look better if it wasn't so obvious.Suicide Squad may have the fun and humor to make for a darkly funny ride, but it fails to capture the spirit of it's critically acclaimed source material or bring proper nuance to it's likable villains. In the end, it only further pushes the DC Cinematic Universe away from reaching the road to popular ranks of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting for this movie for almost a year and it was an incredible let down. The plot of the movie was nonexistent. Context and story lines were built from insufficient flashbacks. The trailer for the movie was better than the actual movie. The soundtrack was miserable. The movie was full of Will Smith one liners, which fell short most of the time. Rick Flagg sounded ridiculous with his forced accent. Harley Quinn was portrayed as just a sex symbol and not a real character. The relationship of the Suicide Squad team forms without any build up. Most of the dialogue occurred with just close up camera shots and there was no actual setting to the dialogue. Meaning there was no other feel to the shot besides the characters faces. Jared Leto sounded like a grunting animal for most of the movie. He and Batman were forced into the plot unnecessarily. If you ask me, the Joker didn't even need to be in the movie. Overall this movie was disjointed and the acting was mediocre. The plot was not cohesive at all. This just goes to show how Marvel has super hero movies down to an exact science.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like any DC fan boy, I was waiting for this with bated breaths. But stepping in and seeing the way it starts, kills you. The film falls apart right from the beginning: The witch and her brother who come without much background, decide to go for a demolition plan, again in a massive scale without a lot of depth to their motivation to build a machine to destroy all of mankind. We have only been introduced to how the unconventional Task Force X have a difficulty getting through, against all the restrictions from the government and just when we expect to see more of a slow elation towards the build up: finally gelling together and hitting it off, they're brought together, just like that and made to fight against the opposite forces. Harley Quin was only as good as the trailers while the Joker disappointed and don't pin this on the benchmark Heath set, even if we see this as an independent performance, this is shallow. It is clichéd beyond understanding, it almost makes you wonder whether this is an English language Bollywood film: the daughter issue, the boy friend issue, the brother issue, the girl friend issue, you have it all, the only thing I missed was an "aaa aa aaa" sung in chorus by a Karan-Johar-regular orchestra that I am used to with so much drama. Are they really the villains we were looking forward to? Not Me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best D.C. film, yet not the worst, it's different and unique hey let the bad guys be the showcase and do the dirty work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a "Batman" and D.C. comics fan since I watch all the movies and read the comics the latest entry "Suicide Squad" had to be a must see. And this picture is different and unique as anytime you have the villains and the bay guys shining and doing the dirty work it's a showcase, really it's wild, wicked, and fun chaos! The plot is pretty simple Amanda Waller(Viola Davis)heads up a secret government agency and all of a sudden a black ops mission has come up. And the plan is to get a group of super villains to come out of prison and help with the mission, for in return an exchange for all reduced sentences! Yet the job is fun, wild, wicked, and crazy, to watch the bad boys and oh yes bad girl(Harley Quinn)mop up and do the dirty work is pure pleasure! The film has plenty of action and the super villains most remembered are Deadshot(Will Smith)a guy who's lethal with a bullet and the beast and monster of the underground Gotham sewer Killer Croc is a fright of a joy to watch. And the best eye candy treat is the watching of Harley Quinn(in a sexy performance from Margot Robbie)who's a devious girl who swings hard with the big boys and in a subplot her romance with "The Joker"(Jared Leto)entertains and spices the film it's like a little extra icing on the cake. Overall this D.C. film is different still it's fun watching the bad guys work as deep down they feel some guilt and dream of a normal better life before facing the real picture, "Suicide Squad" blends raw aggressive sex appeal with Harley Quinn and the use of "The Joker" is somewhat of a wild card still it's a good look at the other side of the D.C. universe that exist showing the different way of life that many live.</fullReview>

I really liked her acting though. Some other characters seemed utterly useless.The villains and the plot was so poorly written that I was thinking are these guys really this short of creativity!This movie was the least engaging movie that I have seen in a while.

		<fullReview>The number 1 rule of screen writing 101 is probably, "show, don't tell". But Suicide Squad thinks its audience doesn't need things like showing a characters personality, so the film opens with a woman telling us exactly who the main characters are and what they are like. Then they are immediately thrown into situations one music montage after another. The music serves as an excuse for good storytelling and relating to the characters as it puts in songs because it worked in Guardians of the Galaxy. But in that film, the songs corresponded with certain emotions the characters are feeling or something that was going on with the story. This film tries so hard to be fun in the way Guardians of the Galaxy was but fails to see why that film was fun in the first place; the jokes came naturally, it was well directed, and had a cohesive story. Suicide Squad almost tries to avoid those. There are no character arcs, the action scenes choppily edited, and the story is so stuffed that it feels non-existent. The first ten minutes feel like the first 40 minutes of a regular film. The film tries to give and equal amount of attention to all it's characters, but there's so much story that it has no time to make you care about the characters. This film is an absolute mess that fails on every level. Poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly written and poorly acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the cool factors like the hot casts, great comic book characters and pop culture went into the marketing for this film. For a year, we hung on to the breadcrumbs of snippets like the awesome trailers and Instagram posts from the casts. Then the movie finally comes out and it's just MEH...Just Okay. Not nearly as terrible as the critics say but it wasn't great as expected. The GOOD: Awesome Casts of Actors Interesting. Hardcore comic book characters each with their own personal origin storyThe BAD that made the movie mediocre:-CHEESY Final Fight Scene - The main villain, enchantress is a lot like Gozer in the 1984 Ghostbusters. A creepy ancient cult supernatural being that was worshipped with magical powers with the desire to rule the world. That was the 80's and it worked back then because it fit the cheesy style of the classic Ghostbusters comedy.But for Suicide Squad, it's more raw and edgy with DEADLY hardcore villains as the main characters. David Ayers could have picked a better enemy out of all the characters in the comic book world. That was lazy writing. - If Cara's Enchantress knew what everyone wanted in their hearts, then how could she not predict or see Harley's motive to attack her with the sword. Clarity - There was a scene were Enchantress showed us what each character in the squad wanted in their hearts through a mental fantasy.- Lame action scenes - The slave servants of Enchantress looked like a PILE OF Black Rocks or Gobs. They had no faces. They only existed to die to see the Suicide Squad in action. THE SQUAD NEEDED BETTER COMPETITION. The things were so dark you couldn't really see them and they were boring. Deadshot (Will Smith) was great though.- A Lack of action. I think there was only like 1 or 2 fight parts before the final show down.If David Ayers had the Suicide Squad to fight against another team of comic book villains like Deathstroke or hundreds of other choices that were plotting to take government information or the cliché take over the world, this movie would have been way better. It would have been cool to see Lex Luthor in the mix betraying Amanda Waller or something.By the squad fighting other hardcore villains with abilities and known identities, we would see their different fighting skills and abilities better rather than them fighting faceless black gobs. So Suicide Squad was MEH. A WASTE of a great cast of actors and awesome comic book characters.- I didn't care about Rick Flag's love motive with Cara's character. Cliché and corny! Rick's actions and stupid simpleton mistake thinking he can control an ancient demon supernatural being to get rid of the bomb was so stupid.- Corny happy ending. Rick Flag gets his boring girl back. No sacrifice or risk. PG13.- The most pointless slow motion ending scene in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rest in Peace DCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was an immense disappointment; I enjoyed the trailers leading up to the film's release and was hoping that this would be the first DC Comics movie to actually good or even great, or at least be watchable... Unfortunately, this was not the case. This movie was so terrible that it was embarrassing. Every aspect from the writing, to the editing, to the performances were all absolutely horrible. Starting with the writing, I literally cringed when some of the characters spoke, namely Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, and the Joker. I have no clue if the actors had any input on their character's dialogue or if the blame completely rests with David Ayer. Killer Croc made me feel like I was watching a Tyler Perry movie, Jared Leto's Joker sounded like he was trying to be Christian Bale's batman crossed with some other version of the Joker. Lastly there's Harley Quinn... She seemed to serve no purpose other than to spit out garbage one liners, give the movie sex appeal, and she was there so there was a female on the squad that actually spoke*cough* Katana*cough*. I really had hopes that this movie would have funny, exciting dialogue like other projects that David Ayer wrote, but I guess he lost his mind or the producers shot his ideas down (more on the producers later). Moving on to the editing, it was shocking how poorly edited this film was. I cannot believe that John Gilroy did this seeing how he worked on good movies in the past. The quick cuts they used in fight scenes and the ridiculous neon sign like overlays that would introduce characters were so distracting and completely took me out of the movie. I think this movie shines as an example of what happens when producers have their hands where they shouldn't. Earlier this year we all heard that this movie had large re-writes/re-shoots to make the movie seem funnier, or some crap like that. Those re-shoots did not work; all they did was cause confusion and plot holes that were once again embarrassing. To finish, this movie was not funny or enjoyable in any way at all; it was cringe-worthy, lame, and cliché. It looks like this will be the last DC Comics movie i'll ever watch... Such a shame because I am a huge fan of the comics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost like a 2-hour long music video collection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know nothing about Suicide Squad as a property, so I can only compare it to other movies in the genre and of course movies in general. Zero emotional investment beforehand can sometimes reward you."Suicide Squad" feels like a movie that could've been many things, but ended up being almost nothing. There are many glimpses of engaging and good ideas or moments, but they all seem to drown under meaningless noise, montages, flashbacks and a playlist consisting of some classic rock songs along with some more modern stuff. I thought I would like the soundtrack and the score based on the trailers and some songs choices, but I ended up hating it. It's used in all the wrong ways and it took me out of the movie more than anything else. One song ends, another starts, and it's not organic or skillfully woven to the story. It feels like a cynical effort to be a part of some trend instead of serving any real creative purpose.Tones can shift and that's alright, it keeps things interesting. But here, almost everything is forced. You can be in the middle of a scene, and out of the blue you get a cheap, emotionally manipulative tonal shift that breaks the focus. It doesn't feel natural. Every time this movie tries to make you care, it tries really hard. You can ever hear it: If it tries to make you sad, the music goes to ULTIMATE SAD. If it tries to make you excited over a boring action scene where faceless demon cronies get bullets and fists to their face, the music goes to ULTIMATE HEAVENLY BATTLE MUSIC. Absolute overkill. Sometimes the score doesn't even seem to know what the movie is showing. The composed score in itself would be alright, possibly even very good if used differently or in a whole other movie.Technically, for a PG-13 action fantasy movie, "Suicide Squad" is decent. It's shot well enough, and it's fluid in its own way. It's mostly dark, shot at night or in dark locations, which is fitting but executed in an almost dull way. At some points the cinematography looks nice. Many stylized "cool shots" are there. Special effects are good at some parts, and the camera held its own in action scenes. Still, I felt nothing watching the action. It was competent and visually not horrible, but there was an emotional disconnect like in a music video; something technically good might be happening, but it feels vacuous and empty. It didn't have weight to it, no matter how many shots were fired. I liked watching the other stuff more. It's hard to say anything about the writing. They had tons of material, some good ideas and a few interesting character moments but nothing connected into an exciting, tight story. A few times when there was a flashback, I wanted to see those stories instead of the one I got. It wasn't that hard to follow, but it was scattered. I failed to see the beating heart of the story. The villain didn't get me excited, and many lines were just "lines" instead of real dialogue. It's hard to say anything about Ayer's directing either, because I don't know how much control he had over this movie. I'll give him this though: the movie was very fast-paced and economical in the way all of the information was dumped on the audience. It's bound to be that way with so many montages and snippets, but at least it didn't all fall apart. I can only imagine what the result would have been with little to no intervention from studio execs who just have to have their slimy hands all over these movies. Margot Robbie and Will Smith are the leads. Will Smith is charismatic enough that he didn't even need to act, he was just casually throwing lines around, and that was enough. Robbie is the one who put up a performance, becoming Harley Quinn. She is just the right kind of mixture of sexy, cute, crazy, quirky, dangerous and vulnerable. She even sold me on one of those emotionally manipulative scenes, when everything around her didn't. She had plenty of horrible lines, but managed to rise over her material. Her outfit is the most colourful of the entire cast too, so naturally the camera loves her in a movie where everything is dark. Take Robbie out of the movie, and you got nothing. Kinnaman, Davis and Hernandez were decent, I guess. The "Killer Croc" made me cringe a couple of times. They wasted a really charismatic actor for that?About performances, I didn't like Jared Leto's Joker. Almost every moment felt pretentious, forced and the wrong kind of insane. As if he was playing a drug addict doing crazy villain impressions. I like Jared Leto, but if this was his idea, then someone should have said something. I doubt Leto was in control though. I know that the Joker was supposed to be just a side character, and he was. Nevertheless, it felt like a poker game where they didn't have much of a hand, but they still wanted to overplay their hand each time he was on screen. To summarize, "Suicide Squad" tried too hard. If it ever had a voice of its own, it was butchered by studio executives and a scattered structure. It felt like a collection of music videos. Not only because of its soundtrack, but also how the story was handled. You get glimpses of something, then it's over, and another tune begins. In the end, almost nothing stuck with me and I felt quite numb, bored and exhausted. That said, this can still work as a popcorn movie, especially if you care about this property and characters. It's technically sound, fast-paced, packing some good short moments and Margot Robbie is good in it. That much you'll get, but not anything beyond that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts well and gets progressively worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this after hearing a few bad reviews, I was always going to see it at the cinema anyway in the hope that I would enjoy it as I have most of the comic book films. When it started they built up the characters well and it had a good mix of humour and action, but it went down hill quickly after the start. I thought Margot Robbie stole the show with Will Smith not far behind they were true to their characters in the comics and without them I would have left the cinema early. I hated the version of the Joker that Jarrard Leto portrayed, what he was trying to do was nothing like the vision I have ever had for the Joker, I have always been sceptical when a different actor takes on this role but have always been impressed until now. I hope there are no more of these films, but it would be good to get Margot Robbie playing Harlequin again in a Batman film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one word: Bad Movie. The worst movie, Will Smith has ever made.To be honest, first half of the movie is good but the next half is really bad.There are a lot of clichés.How can a villain who can manipulate other minds and senses their presence, is not able to know that Harley is going to kill her which appears so easy kill. And Harley is not so special to kill some type of spirit or old god, whatever is it.All villains have the worst mentality and killed and stole a lot, but in just one situation, all of them decided to be the good guys and face the worst villain.The other strong villain who can destroy Helicopters from a distance of more than 500 meters, just decides to just girly kick the villains who became good guys and decided to face him.The black lady was under the water, and just appeared so alive to others with a phone in her hand threatening to kill them. So, the phone was not lost or destroyed under water. And the villains were not able to take the phone of her.there are a lot of ridiculous scenes.I won't advice anyone to watch it, you will bore yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi everybody. Why awful? Let's think about people like these. 1) If killer/psycho/terrorist is alive ? he easily tears you or your fingers apart, depends on how stupid you are with range. 2) If he hurts/kills (whatever) some guardians and still alive ? maniac will continue to do this. 3) You make 1 mistake ? he destroys you and runs away. There are 3 simple (!) rules about people like these. And nothing is remembered. A bit spoiler, but it's clear from trailers: wanna test legendary murderer? No problem, free him and ask to show abilities. Oh, he killed everybody, how suddenly! Spoiler: no. Logic... There is no logic in this film. But it's still good enough for 10-12-yo. DC and WB, they can't understand ? jokes don't make movie great, they... Hm, don't know. But when they decide to add some funny moments 'cause of failure Batman vs. Superman (c'mon, that scenario...), it seems like the movie was remade completely, 1st version scenes replaced with funny versions, that's why movie looks ripped. Finally, very bad. I can't write more. don't watch, burn posters and listen to critics. Nolan makes movie, Ayer makes cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of a good concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dumb, dumb, dumb. How do you start with this terrific premise and end with a movie this stupid? It's as lazy, plodding, predictable and improbable as Batman V Superman, although slightly more entertaining.Margot Robbie is an actress with a lot of natural screen presence, but it was squandered in her over-the-top kittenish performance. We get no real look into her thoughts or motivations, just her "crazy act."And Will Smith, arrrrrgh! It's like he has an al a carte menu for acting. One wisecrack, check. One in-your-face staredown, check. One "slap dat bitch ona ass," check. He just Will Smiths around, only it's not cute anymore. Totally phoned it in.Jared Leto's Joker was very good, but has the same problem as all super villains who kill off their henchmen with abandon: who would work for this guy? Only El Diablo had even rudimentary character development, everyone else was forgettable, and there were too damn many of them! The movie starts off on the wrong foot, with painfully inept exposition. There are no likable characters. The plot is completely inbred and circular--the problem the Squad is trying to solve would not exist if not for the Squad, and when they achieve their target and find out who they have rescued, their disappointment is equal to the viewers'. The super villains want to rule or destroy the world, whatever. It's all clichés from start to finish. Then at the end they try to pass the Squad off as some kind of zany family that just needed a chance to prove themselves, as if they weren't mostly homicidal maniacs. The GGI overwhelms what story there is, and it's the dirty gray CGI of ten years ago. There is nothing original about the character design or sets, and all the action is in a depopulated city at night. Worst of all, the movie doesn't address its own premise. The Avengers did a masterful job of showing how different levels of beings, from skilled human to enhanced human to super being, might interact. Suicide Squad attempts the same thing, but blows it. Every character seems capable of surviving things like fiery helicopter crashes, although the pilots invariably die. It's not even clear what powers some of these guys have--the movie has to go out of its way to give Killer Croc a job to do--swimming--to help the team. "What if Superman became a terrorist?" asks one character. "Who would stop him?" Apparently, the answer is a guy with a lot of guns, a crazy chick in F--- Me hot pants, and a chubby guy who throws boomerangs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts off by failing in its attempts to adequately introduce the characters, their backstories, their motivations and their loosely-entangled love interests. From here the plot fails to enjoyably progress as a consequence of dreadful acting, problematic and inorganic dialogue and the introduction of one of the lamest super- villains I've ever had the displeasure of watching on screen. Throughout the film the characters fail to go through any sort of meaningful arc or development, leading to one-dimension and clichéd personalities - the result of which is zero emotional attachment from the viewer to anything that is happening at all. The movie is visually boring, featuring stale cinematography, dull colours and tedious action sequences.Overall it was dire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, it's not as bad as Batman vs Superman. And Will Smith and Margot Robbie are good, although the latter isn't helped by a manchild director who shamelessly objectifies her at every turn ("how many shots do we have of Margot's butt? That's not enough! Put more in. And more guns. Butts and guns. The fanboys love that stuff!'). Every so often we catch a glimpse of what this movie could have been, most of those moments involving Robbie's awesome Harley Quinn, but otherwise this is a complete mess, with terrible pacing, struggling along under the weight of too many characters and the need to set up spin off movies, and a weird mish mash of styles (Suicide Squad can't decide if it wants to be off kilter and knowing like Deadpool or bleak and thudding like Batman vs Superman). Jared Leto's Joker is a massive letdown and we also get one of the worst comic book movie villains of all time. Cara Delevingne cannot act to save her life, that much is obvious, but even Brie Larson would have struggled with Enchantress, who is lumbered with some truly dreadful dialogue and an unintentionally amusing CGI big brother. You could analyse this movie's faults to death but ultimately it's just not very good, cynical, shoddy and forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations and had August 4th marked on my calendar for months. Also, I'm a big DC fan but also like Marvel too (especially X-Men). I like Margot Robbie and of course Will Smith. I went into a sold out auditorium of 150+ fans. I just ate Chipotle. I was excited. Despite RT reviews and word of mouth disappointment, I was READY! Zzz...Zzz...Zzz...What happened? The movie started off OK, but the plot is absolutely terrible. Who approved of this script? It appears they spent more time and money on the trailers and the text color effects than actually developing a script that fans and casual fans would want to sit 2 hours through.This movie is a complete mess. While the cast is decent, the character development isn't. While the soundtrack is decent, the dialogue wasn't. And what is up with the villain? Overall, this movie has too many unfamiliar characters within a far too short movie length, a confusing villain most DC fans don't even know much about, and stars that almost seem miscast. As a DC fan, I can only dream of what it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is like a "mixed grill": some scenes you will adore, others serve as a side-dish and among them there are things that are a little harder to get through! But don't let the critics fool you... they made it for the fans. And fans of the franchise won't mind spending 2 hours long on this upbeat adventure that sometimes does get a little messy. But why would we expect a suicide squad to be anything less than messy?Directed by David Ayer the audience is quickly introduced to the squad. Here the DC fans might just nod a long, but for the common folks, this is necessary built-up. They take time to explain each character but there's no denying that Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn intend to steal the show from the very beginning. They bring a nice mixture of charismatic and crazy on to the screen and together with Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag they carry this movie.Viola Davis is perfectly cast and she definitely shows how to get away with murder but here is hoping that next time she stares in the DC universe, she shows how 'mean' she really is; waving around with a phone never hurt nobody. The same goes for Jared Leto's the joker, who of course has some very big shoes to fill but whom shouldn't be judged to hard because of his little screen time. Those who watched the trailers will be surprised that he might just be the most romantic guy in the movie and that his role really isn't that bad!Batman's and Flash appearance in the movie are fun, and it really shows how quickly DC wants to move forward in to the universe. But sometimes it's better to take it slow... mold it, so it becomes perfect. Only few characters get time to shine, others can be tolerated because they were previously introduced in DC movies. But the character's Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang, who should be shining as they are 'the' squad, are bland and could easily be ignored. Let's not even bring up Katana, who I almost forgot to mention.The plot isn't all that good either.. you don't need a crew of misfits to walk around with knives and guns, smashing heads and pulling hearts. If the Flash is really that fast he could take the Enchantress out by himself. Speaking off her, while Cara Delevingne isn't to bad in her human scenes - it's the obnoxious faces she pulls while trying to rule the world that make your skin crawl. It's uncomfortable to look at and it makes you wish they ripped her heart out sooner.As a fan I enjoyed it. But it takes time to get used to the theme and all the information comes with such speed you wish to just hit the pause button every other scene. Fans understand, to the rest it might be to overwhelming. DC should take a mental note that it has taken years for Marvel to get where they are and just because they are doing well now doesn't mean they won't make mistakes in the future. But DC isn't even remotely out there yet. If they start running before they learn how to walk, they might break their necks. Yes there should be more of Suicide Squad, but a little extra personality would be appreciated. This could've been created easily when it was made a full-on origins story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always, RT nonsense score and reviews aside, I went in with no expectations. I love my comic books (DC &amp; Marvel) both. Both publishing houses have created some of the best fictional characters out there. Suicide Squad has always been a side project of sorts including in the comic books. The movie for me was taken as such. That is exactly what I got. A 7/10 comic book action flick which had some great action sequences with Deadshot. Harley and Joker didn't do much for me and neither did the rest of the 'squad'. We are lucky to be living in such wonderful times where comic book film adaptations are a plenty. In my days, we were lucky to get one film in years. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. I would say do not believe RT, IMDb ratings or Marvel fanboys. Go in with an open mind and enjoy a decent action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Actors Save A Very Flawed, Yet Fun Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to describe 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman' with one word only, it would be "divisive." SUICIDE SQUAD falls into the same category. Even though I liked both MoS and BvS, one could say that those 2 films tried too hard to please critics. The admirable thing about SUICIDE SQUAD is that it disregards the critics altogether, and makes it an entirely fan experience, for better or worse depending on who you ask. The audience I saw it with was electrifying; it's, without a doubt, the most fun I've had all year since 'Deadpool' back in February. In my humble opinion, SUICIDE SQUAD is exactly what this lacklustre summer movie season needed to spice things up. Director David Ayer has his mark all over this; it's unlike any superhero movie I've ever seen. Sure, you have some of your typical superhero tropes, mostly in the 3rd act. But then you have the antithesis of what the genre entails, breaking just about every single rule and convention. This ain't good versus bad; this, my friends, is bad versus evil. This movie is the living personification of its own characters: absolute, bat sh*t insanity! It's uneven, character motivations get a little wonky, and the story is a hot, sexy, mess. Word of advice? Double down on the absurdity of it all; it gets pretty weird. But within all the madness, I couldn't help myself guys... I kind of loved this movie. It's by no means perfect, but I also feel like critics are over exaggerating the film's faults. I was never bored, not once. The film moves at a killer pace. There's quite a bit of exposition near the beginning, but after that the film kicks into high gear. Steven Prince's score, which was reminiscent of 'Pacific Rim' and the first 'Iron Man,' infused such infectious energy into the movie. The use of hit song after hit song got a bit overwhelming however, making the movie feel more like a music video at times.Filmed mostly in my home of Toronto, this was quite the surreal experience; I have walked through those streets before, and I have stood in those subway stations before. I was even an extra in the film. Did I make the cut? Well, that's a whole other story... but I ain't mad.I was genuinely shocked by how incredible Will Smith was in the role of Deadshot. Going in, I thought he'd be adequate but not too memorable. I was wrong; he is the best thing this movie has going for it. Scratch that. He comes real close to taking that title, but it's Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn that this movie will be long remembered for. She nails it. Absolutely nails it. Robbie is to Harley Quinn what RDJ is to Tony Stark: perfection. Joel Kinnaman was another standout for me. While the writing for his character felt the most forced out of everyone, his actual performance sells it well and makes me feel for a character I could, otherwise, care less for. The film is juggling a lot of characters, and that's never an easy task. Characters such as Killer Croc, Katana, and Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney was great?!) aren't given much backstory at all, but they were all given at least one great character moment: just one scene to make you fall in love with them. But if there's one obscure character that'll emerge as a fan favourite, it's definitely El Diablo. He's given a thoughtful backstory, an emotional character arc, and some kick ass action sequences. In fact, most of the action in the film was executed well. But there wasn't that one moment, like the 'warehouse scene' we got in BvS, that made me go "holy sh*t". if you ask me, Jared Leto had the toughest job of them all; he had to follow Heath Ledger's timeless performance as The Joker, which is an impossible feat. So, the best thing Leto could've done is something completely different; he should make it his own. Which is exactly what he did. Whenever he's on screen you can't help but be captivated by him. He's not in the movie all that much, but just enough to wet our appetites for this whole new incarnation of 'The Clown Prince of Crime,' while still honouring the name of the film. This is a Suicide Squad movie after all, not a Joker movie. It's ironic that in a movie about bad guys the worst part turned out to be the villain itself. The 'evil' in bad versus evil, if you will. I would've preferred a different antagonist altogether as the one we got here was pretty forgettable. Without giving any spoilers, the whole 'brother' angle was by far the worst thing in this movie. That's all I will say. People comparing this movie to last year's catastrophe 'Fantastic Four' need to drop whatever it is they're smoking. SUICIDE SQUAD has something that film didn't: personality. It has soul. There's a great deal of heart. The characters are dynamic. The team chemistry between all the actors was fantastic; even if you don't like the movie they're in, you'll still end up liking the Suicide Squad themselves. Am I saying you're gonna love this film? No. Am I saying you're wrong for having a different opinion than me? No. Am I saying that I had a great time at the theatre watching Suicide Squad? You're damn right I am.

		<fullReview>...i was 1 of the few who enjoyed "Batman Vs. Superman" (was not such a huge fan of "Man of Steel"), so I was interested in seeing the next step in this new DC theatrical universe..For the most part it was okay. Decently entertaining. Margot Robbie predictably steals the movie, but Viola Davis is quite good playing a very cool and efficient Amanda Waller. Will Smith is serviceable as Deadshot. The eye-opener for me was Cara Delevingne. Her Enchantress character, in the early going, was very intriguing. I think the most disappointing performance in the movie was Jared Leto's Joker. Maybe it is because he didn't really have much to work with, but he was really kind of a non-entity for me. I didn't find him interesting in the slightest, which is about the worst thing i think you could say about a character like The Joker. The movie itself is stronger in its first half then it is in its second. I preferred the DIRTY DOZEN-esque recruitment scenes, when you didn't really know who you could trust, or when Amanda would kill someone. The second half of the film becomes a paint by numbers "Everyone comes together to save the day" super hero flick. That was disappointing. Still, most of the characters were colourful and interesting, and it leaves off at a point where i am interested in seeing what comes next for the DCU.I'm still in for the long haul.</fullReview>

The action wasn't anything special and there was plenty of cheesy superhero moments (i.e. Diablo's line "I already lost one family, I'm not losing another!"). Most members of the Suicide Squad are just down right uninteresting. Save for Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Will Smith's Deadshot. Although Deadshot turned out to be a cliché, it was still a good performance by Will Smith and by no means boring to watch. However this movie truly shines when The Joker, played by Jared Leto, and Harley Quinn are on screen. Especially when the two of them are on screen together. The two characters have an absolutely insane relationship and feed off of each other's craziness/creepiness making them a blast to watch on screen together. The only problem is there's not enough of that in this movie. I realize that this movie isn't solely focused on those two, but it should be. They are by far the most entertaining part of this movie and really carry this other wise unremarkable movie. If you are expecting a Heath Ledger type of Joker then you will be disappointed. Where as Ledger's Joker is more of an anarchist who wants to cause chaos in the criminal underworld, Leto's Joker dominates it. This version of the Joker is a very accomplished criminal and basically an underworld kingpin. But yet he still manages to maintain just the right amount of insanity in every scene he's in. Another problem with this movie is the director and writers seem to have forgotten that the members of the Suicide Squad are supposed to be bad guys. None of them really feel like villains. My only gripe with Harley Quinn was she wasn't as ruthless as she should have been, especially when compared to the Joker. As far as setting up more events in the DC universe, this movie pretty much does what you expect. Overall if you really wanted to see this movie, I still would, but if your'e on the fence maybe wait for a cheap showing or rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comical climax, muddled screenplay, under-cooked character arcs pull down an otherwise better attempt from DC in recent times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put together a fantastic cast: Check; Bring in fan favorite cameos: Check; Get an entertaining and not so gloomy script: Sort of; Create a terrifying and terrific antagonist: Meh!!; While it gets some things right in comparison to recent DC offerings (apart from the Batman Trilogy), to see it in the bigger scheme of things in terms of re- watchability, scope for a sequel etc., it doesn't seem promising especially with a contrived script, disconnected sequences, uninterested Will Smith (save for some witty one-liners). Saving grace in the form of Margot Robbie carries the entire movie on her shoulders for a while, but there is only so much one can do when it is weighed down by poor editing, generic script and uninventive plot. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), a clandestine Government agent puts together a team of imprisoned supervillians to participate in dangerous covert missions in exchange for lenient prison terms. When one of the recruit June Moone a.k.a. the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) goes rogue and threatens to destroy the Earth (Duh!), the team comprising of Deadshot (a bored Will Smith), Harley Quinn (an excellent Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) dubbed Task Force X led by decorated Commander Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). Once off the leash, will they resort to their evil ways or fight as a team they were hoped to?There are definitely some positives compared to the dull and gloomy Batman vs. Superman debacle - cheeky one-liners, a very original and different take on Joker by Jared Leto, a superb rendition of Harley Quinn by Margot Robbie, par visual effects and not too many dull phases. There were two main failures and a number of sub-failures - a run-of-the- mill plot, sub-par villain, under-cooked backstories and farce of a climax. It could have had a slightly positive effect had it released 5 years ago, but that's not the case and it already looks dated. The charismatic superstar Will Smith is reduced to a side-kick and doesn't even have as much screen time or presence as Margot Robbie which is surprising but not out of place. Comical climax, muddled screenplay, under-cooked character arcs pull down an otherwise better attempt from DC in recent times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am so, so, so, so disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So. This film. What do I even say about this film? Possibly the most disappointing film I've ever seen? First of all, let's talk about the pros (there aren't many.) The first pro is the first 30 minutes of this film was good. It was gritty, and brutal and I was rather surprised at the critics reviews at that point. The scenes of torture are great, and very stomach- turning. However, after 30 minutes, the film becomes the most generic action superhero movie ever to exist.Another pro are the performances. Everyone was committed to their role, especially Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. Cara Delevingne's character Enchantress was a great villain.I guess the last pro I can find is the movie was consistently funny and had me laughing. Sometimes accidentally (the slow motion scenes in fights? Really?) had me laughing like crazy, and sometimes Harley Quinn had me in stitches.Now the cons.WHERE THE HELL WAS THE JOKER? He was probably in this movie for about 5 minutes, and all his scenes were in the trailers for the film. His performance was good (I think? I couldn't judge due to the fact that he basically makes cameo appearances scattered throughout the film for no apparent reason that doesn't add to the story-line one bit. Wait, did I say story-line? Sorry, there is no story-line!) The story. What story? The first 30 minutes of the film is force-fed character development, and the rest of the film is the team trying to get from one end of the street to another without being attacked by these giant CGI blackberry thingies. Unfortunately; they stop every twenty seconds to either deliver a cheesy one-liner or stop to drink. Like, what?Also THE EDITING. The flashback sequences with Harley Quinn and the Joker feel so, so, so out of place (especially the torture sequence,) and the editing makes the film so confusing and hard to follow. The film tries to cram way too much source material into one film, and the film just feels like a massive build up for the standalone Harley Quinn film coming in 2019. Also, Batman was hardly in the movie but Ben Affleck even looked like he didn't care anymore. Also Slipknot. I'm not even going to get into this character as I can't without giving spoilers, but what the hell were the writers thinking? Why was he even in the film?And so, so, so much more is wrong with this film. The writing is confusing; the film is overlong; the film barely has any story and the character development feels so forced. It is so obvious that the film was dark, and gritty (proved by the film's first act,) but the studio decided it should be more light with poor editing. So, now you have a tonally confused movie (some scenes are very dark, some are very light, some are gory, some are G-level violence) with choppy editing. I mean, what?I'm giving 2 stars for this film. One star for the film's first 30 minutes; and one star for the performance of Enchantress. Even though she looked like she was hula dancing for all the film; she provided a consistently good performance throughout. Overall, a great start, but then dumbs down into a tonally weird, laughably bad film with some good performances. It's a shame the talent was completely wasted on the poor film. I really wanted to like it; and I did for 30 minutes!Then I got bored. Sorry DCEU, I've officially given up with you after the convoluted messy pile of dog poop you called BvS, and this poorly editing light/dark film Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly directed and awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. The movie had too much music. They started playing a Black Sabbath song, then White Stripes, Queen, and then an Eminem song? How can anyone take a movie seriously when it has an Eminem song in it? Horrible choice of song! 2. A lot of the scenes tried too hard to be funny but came off awkward instead. Many times when Harley Quinn made a joke, it wasn't funny, I felt like cringing. Also, the ending where Killer Croc was watching a rap music video that showed girls twerking was just childishly stupid.3. No logic was in this movie. When the military was shooting Enchantress' minions, none of their bullets could kill them but somehow Deadshot and Harley Quinn could kill Enchantress' minions with their guns, as if their guns had some kind of special rounds or something. And the fact that Harley was able to kill Enchantress' minions by using a baseball bat was also dumb. When Deadshot found out Amanda Waller was in some kind of a safehouse, Amanda shot some people in that safehouse in cold blood. Everyone acted like it was nothing. Wtf? And when Harley Quinn was about to bow to Enchantress to trick Enchantress into thinking Harley would join her, Harley was reaching for a blade that was RIGHT between Harley and Enchantress and for some stupid reason, Enchantress was blind she didn't see Harley reaching for that blade! 4. I could not stand how they portrayed Katana. Of course, Hollywood only hires Asian actors if the Asian actors will play as these stereotypical characters like they're masters of martial arts/katanas and they hardly speak any English. The actress who played as Katana was an American but they made her speak Japanese most of the time. She probably had like one English line in that entire movie and she hardly spoke at all! Jesus this movie was better off without Katana! If you're going to portray a character in a racially stereotypical way, then don't have them in the fvcking movie! 5. Not enough Joker. Joker probably had total of 10 minutes of screen time. What a disappointment, I was looking forward to seeing Joker in this film but he was hardly in it.Overall, this movie's worse than Batman v Superman. At least BvS was much more serious of a movie than this pile of junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie with good moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had time to think about this movie for a week now I now feel I know what I have to say. Suicide Squad is a bad movie with good moments. This movie is a complete mess. But it is a fun mess. The first act is the messiest part of the whole film. It consists of a lot of exposition about the characters, with "scenes" (It's hard to call them scenes, as they are more like 10 - 20 second clips with no context what so ever, and have no beginning or end) about some of the main characters. It all feels very rushed and does not flow at all. Some parts of the second act were also like this, and when any flash backs happened a lot seemed to be missing. The editing of the film is very poorly done. The action sequences were underwhelming too, with the finale being very cliché and uninventive. The villain was nothing special, and their motivation was unclear. I have no opinion of the Joker as he was not even in a full scene. I know nothing about the character and Jared Leto was hugely wasted. Finally, a lot of the characters were not fully fleshed out.The best part of this film were the squad, more specifically Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Diablo, Captain Boomerang and Rick Flag. Although Captain Boomerang was not very fleshed out, he had some funny and memorable moments, and was portrayed excellently. Will Smith as Deadshot was nothing we haven't seen Will Smith do before, but that is not a bad thing. We see a humane side to him too, which makes us care for him more. Harley Quinn was exactly what she needed to be. She was almost sort of a Wild Card, and was portrayed wonderfully by Margot Robbie. She had great chemistry with Will Smith too. The whole cast had great chemistry. Diablo and Rick Flag were also portrayed well, with clear motivations and were semi- fleshed out, so we cared a bit for them. The writing was also okay, with believable dialogue for the most part. Some of the jokes felt forced and some were rather cringe worthy, but for the most part it worked.To conclude, I think this movie is worth seeing as it has a lot of good moments, but is still a huge mess. You will enjoy it because of the characters, even though it is still a mess. Warner Brothers, sort it out mate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not "Suicide Squad" but "Deadshot" !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Suicide Squad is not a bad movie but it's just not a good movie. The movie is entitled "Suicide Squad" while it must be "Deadshot". After 20 minutes watching the movie I was fed up by watching Will Smith playing only what Will Smith can play. It was as the movie was written by him and for him. You're not watching Suicide Squad you're watching a photo shooting of Will Smith in a cosplay of Deadshot. Margot Robbie is a good actress and I find her well chosen for Harley Queen but HQ is my favorite character from all comics and here, she's sexy but not mad : she's just trying to be mad without success. The story is really insipid ... all the money was spent for the actors and it remains no money for the scenario ? For the next one, send me an email and I'll give you a free scenario hundred times better. The bad guys have been replaced by Care Bears. And is someone able to tell me why the Joker have been replaced by an ersatz of Maryline Manson ? To conclude : You can watch action scenes not bad with Will Smith always at the foreground even when it's not interesting, good special effects, some fun and a really sexy Harley Queen ... but that's all you can have !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, sorry to those who are fans of this movieNow that being said,I know that you people have mastered the graphics and no one can compete you guys so yaay. About the movie, what was the writer/director thinking when making this movie? Other than just showing some scary faces, what else is vivid in this movie? In the past, the bf and gf don't care about anything and instead of turning into a monster she helps the same army who just killed her bf. The scary monster who would kill everyone in its way just listens like a 3rd grade student when instructions are given? so why would he even care for his own life. And the villain girl who can bring nuclear plans of a country in a split second and who can get into people's minds doesn't know how to stop someone who has been fighting against her? This movie is the dumbest I have ever seen or watched. If you people had to make a movie, just put it in two parts rather than trying to squeeze everything in a two hour movie Next time when you think of making money, go and buy some company shares and that will make you money or lose as you will in this movie In short, I would not recommend this movie to those who might have high hope, instead, go and watch some cartoon with your children and probably you will have some joy rather than spending money on it</fullReview>

We are introduced to the villains or heroes or whatever label you want to put on these sociopaths then it starts to wear out it's welcome. The characters are never fully developed. To me,it's just a game of who can one up each other with one liners and zingers. I didn't laugh. I did not find the humor in it's constant sarcasm and over the top plot. The Joker seemed to be on bath salts and Harley Quinn just wanted a Manwich meal (her libido was on hyperdrive) No movie needs to be over two hours and the ending credits I'd have to say was the best part of the film.

		<fullReview>After much anticipation, and after a long wait, it pains me to say that this movie is disappointing to say the least.From start to finish - the script is an absolute mess. Too many characters are introduced and subsequently under-used, and the soundtrack, which was actually the best part, was scattered all over the place, placing one greatest hit after the other in a very short space of time. Harley Quinn and Deadshot seemed to be the protagonists of the film (Smith and Robbie doing a great job of it) but even they didn't have enough character development. The Joker was hardly in it at all - and Harley Quinn's backstory was simply glossed over, when it could have been a hell of a lot more interesting. And half the scenes in the trailers don't even make it into the movie. A real shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's... an interesting lesson in failing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a year's worth of trailers, after months of teasing on the storyline, characters and general vibe and with a heightened sense of expectation after that dog's dinner that was B vs. S, Suicide Squad comes out in the heat of Summer, with a relatively clear August to bust box-office records and run amuck in theaters worldwide. After that pleasing introduction of the climate in which this movie was released, now comes the verdict: how does it hold up to its premise, and how does it fare in general? Sadly, not that well. Putting aside the mashup of a plot, which does not really know when to be either serious or funny (something its obvious inspiration, Guardians of the Galaxy, was able to do with a sense of gusto), there is a major problem with the casting and its general layout:-First and foremost, the Headshot/Will Smith-Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie duo, though with some chemistry, has been placed front and center in the movie, and it is depressing to say that they cannot hold it. Placing Smith in the obligation to play the role of a ruthless assassin cum well meaning but challenged father was a ballsy move, most specifically when the "ruthless assassin" part is skimmed-through and the father part is overplayed to try and get some emotions from the public. -Robbie, on the other hand, has been given the role of a manic/submissive bomb of debauchery, and needless to say, she nails that role, though with a sense of abandon that can verge on the careless. Oh, and let's thank Warner for reminding us that this duo had their own movie beforehand, a little thing called "Focus". -And as for the rest of the crew? It is a mixed bag, and no one really gets the glory of a breakout performance. Joel Kinnaman does a decent job as Rick Flagg, although too decent to really make a mark, Jai Courtney can be funny here and there, Viola Davis, as Amanda Weller, could be considered as one of the only really good performances of the movie, but it seems to be done with such boredom that we can only see a sense of it being phoned in. As for the rest of the Squad? Absolutely forgettable. Even El Diablo, though backed-up with an interesting backstory, does not really deliver. -Last but not least, the two most mesmerizing performances of the movie: Jared Leto as a downtrodden, coked-up, kitschy Joker, with no psychological depth or clearly fleshed-out motives, and no real place in the movie, since he is not the antagonist. Oh no. This is left to the other mesmerizing performance of the movie: Cara Delevingne. Yes, SHE is the villain (something called Enchantress). In the first part of the movie, she goes from your typical shy scientist to summoning the evil spirit she discovered in some lost jungle somewhere and changing into the otherworldly figure (in a half-assed allusion to Jekyll and Hyde). Then, after possessing the heart of the spirit which had been under the possession of Weller (for some reason), she transforms into something that could only be described as a porno version of a Greek goddess, complete with sensual dancing that would do a killing if accompanied with a suitable porn soundtrack, but not in a superhero movie with an epic score. On top of having the ocular expression of a dead fish, she does not manage the shift from shy and quaint to frightening and progressively camps her performance up to becoming simply hilarious. As for the rest of the movie, nothing can be salvaged. The pacing is wrong, the music is forgettable, some story elements have been shamelessly pumped from other movies (going through a building to save/eliminate elements residing at the top of it? "The Raid" demands an apology) and a general sense of being forced to compromise in order to fast-track the DCEU. In short, a COMPLETE mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a lot of the harshness that this movie has received from critics is justified. However, it is not a terrible movie; it's just mediocre in every way imaginable. From a cast of characters that are generally contrived and uninteresting (Joker, Harley, and Deadshot being exceptions for the most part), to a predicable plot that struggles to build any sense of tension, Suicide Squad is a movie that is very difficult to feel emotionally invested in. This is made worse by a villain whose only purpose is to summon bad guys (basically zombies) for the characters to kill, making the central conflict of the movie along with the entire third act impossible to care about. Suicide Squad has its moments, which are usually found in scenes focusing on the Joker and Harley, but you could honestly leave after the first act and not miss much. Suicide Squad's saving grace could be found in its presentation and action scenes, but even these aren't exceptional. If you want a painfully average super hero movie with zero re-watch-ability, then Suicide Squad is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the DC universe depicted by this movie, bad guys like to tattoo descriptions of themselves on their faces. That alone is emblematic of the entire movie. The whole thing feels like it was written and designed by an edgy 13 year-old.Amanda Waller is trying to pitch a super villain suicide squad to some pentagon types for military funding. She explains how they have contingency plans for everything, like Nukes and Anthrax and mentions that we put "fluoride in the water."Come on, Amanda. Everyone knows fluoridation is a communist plot to destroy our precious fluids.Let's talk about the joker! They really blew him up in the promotions for this movie. You'd think he'd actually have kind of significance in the plot. No.He shows up in a helicopter to save Harley Quinn from captivity. The helicopter is immediately shot down. She promptly returns to the group to finish the mission. That's it. That's Joker's role in this movie. No contribution to the story, just a shameless cameo to serve as filler.Maybe this movie is supposed to be a collection of really bad Kubrick homages? I mean, the black guy in the Shining had more purpose than the Joker in this movie. Anyway, this movie sucks. Unless you're 13, then it's probably brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'SUICIDE SQUAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)The highly anticipated superhero flick, based on the DC comics antihero team (of the same name). It's also the third movie in the DC Extended Universe film franchise (following 'MAN OF STEEL' and 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'), and Ben Affleck even reprises his role as Batman in it. The film stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Karen Fukuhara, Cara Delevingne, Ike Barinholtz and Scott Eastwood. It was written and directed by David Ayer. The story revolves around an unlikely team of formerly imprisoned supervillains, that are recruited by a secret government agency; to go on a special black ops mission to save the world. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, but (most) fans of the comic book insist it's a masterpiece. I absolutely loved it! The story focuses around a government program, conceived and executed by U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Davis), in which imprisoned dangerous criminals are selected to be a part of a special black ops team. They're promised a reward of clemency, if they succeed; and threatened with immediate execution, if they try to escape. They're mission is to stop a powerful mystic force, and it's lethal army. The 'bad guys' that make up the team, surprisingly bond in the process.The movie is undeniably fun! It's dark, violent, and sometimes quite disturbing (much like 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'); but it's also hilarious, and highly entertaining. There's some really interesting character development (throughout), and the performances are outstanding (especially Robbie and Leto). The action scenes are kind of by-the-numbers, but they're also involving (because the characters are so likable). My only real compliant with the film, is that's it's too quickly edited; probably due to studio demands (to make the movie shorter and faster-paced). I'm sure an extended director's cut would make it nearly perfect (like the extended cut of 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN')!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom Menacing Syndrome again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to not talk about drama clouding this movie but it is unavoidable, it just is. So I'll cover that first and then go to the movie directly. RT and score aggregators should usually be considered as guide only and not as the final sentence of movie's success/goodness. That being said, I've watched couple of (too) positive reviews of Suicide Squad, for example Kevin Smith's and Angry Joe's, and I had to think about few things and ask some hard questions:1. Have we really saw the same movie? Even if it wasn't pile of garbage, it still doesn't warrant that much praise.2. "This one is for the fans, not the critics" bull. In 2016, have we forgotten the crucial role of the critics? And I mean really thoughtful ones, not all, but people that really know what they're doing when they're criticizing a movie, not just some random but loud fanboys. If the director has to defend his movie like that, you can bet there is something fishy going on. Do you (DC) think your fans are idiots? Critics mainly pointed out the problems that maybe a DC fan(atic) would not be able to because they're "too much of a fan" to admit to themselves that this movie was trash (Phantom Menace Syndrome)? I mean, yeah, movie references a bunch of stuff, we get to see a lot of new stuff, never seen before in live action but it doesn't mean it's good. Is the bar so low that if the movie just references stuff and has easter eggs aplenty, no matter the actual content and quality and substance, is a great (or just - good) movie? No, people, no. References for the sake of references does not equal quality. Also, why do you regard it as "Hot Topic goes alive" as a good thing?3. I am a DC fan and I think this movie is garbage. Now what? "Well you're not A TRUE fan!". Well you're wrong, I'm a decades long fan that is sad that the characters and the stories he love are adapted so poorly to the point of ruination and that I'll have to wait next wave of DC reboots to enjoy them. Because this as it is now is just fan maltreatment. Three movies in and DC just can't get it right.I don't want to write about this anymore, let's go over the movie quickly.Is it any good? No. But it's not a total catastrophe as well, because there is a good movie somewhere in there. Only the direction, editing and the script itself are bad.Yes, the cool elements are there, the characters mainly but if you have all the toys and you don't do anything meaningful with them, what's the point of them then?Movie has no stakes, editing is horrible and there's a fu_kton of cringe moments. Joker is disappointing at the best and the visual style of him is least of the problems he has as a character. Despite some good performances from the cast, it does not outweigh the sum of other bad parts. So much potential and some much of it wasted. If you really believe in that "this is for the fans" speech, and you think this movie is awesome there's really nothing I can say to make you think a bit otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any good screenwriter gets suicidal after seeing this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin I just want to all to know that I neither a Marvel fanboy nor a DC one. I enjoyed superhero movies for most of the time till they began to spread out like - I don't think of another better comparison - cancer with all the sequels, prequels, reboots and stuff. But moviegoers still seem to enjoy most of these films. IMHO this genre peaked with the Nolan/Batman trilogy and had some great other ones like Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians, Deadpool i.e.The whole concept of the story behind Suicide Squad seems like a farce. The filmmakers are throwing names, characters, resume's towards us like there is no tomorrow. I asked myself in the first half hour if I forgot to watch the one before. There is not an elaborated background story at all except for the Joker/Harley part. There isn't a plausible reason why the Squad is formed to a squad. There isn't any logic behind any decision of the members of the Squad. So if any movie of his magnitude hasn't got a decent story, you began to watch out for flaws - and there are many of them.First one, casting. Cara Delevingne is the miscast of the century. Although she was really okay in Paper Towns and The Face Of An Angel - this one is a total fail. It was like watching the villain in the Stargate movie all over again. Jared Leto's Joker is of course not comparable to Heath Ledger's Joker. But he fails to deliver badly, mainly because of his voice, hairdo and mask - he is like Jim Carrey as The Riddler in a bad way.Than, the soundtrack. I like most of the songs. The Rain from Orange "Juice" Jones - just great to hear this one again. But the whole "let's take some of the known hits of the last 25 years" doesn't fall in place, it's like a mash-up gone wrong. They are playing The White Stripes and you are thinking "really? this one?".On the plus side you have Margot Robbie who is the best character and she steals almost every scene in this. She has the best one-liners and gags of all the Squad members. Will Smith played well - he was back in acting shape. So why went this wrong? I think that the filmmakers wanted to avoid comparisons to Guardians or Watchmen. And they wanted too much. A superhero saga with seven (or even more?) characters yet unknown to the moviegoers. So they hadn't got time and place for character development.Now comes the spoiler part: I would have started with the Flag/Moone relationship as Moone is the key element of the story. Starting with this, they could've blended into the whole government Squad building program. Maybe thrown in some other members or army people, just to have some kind of a solid backstory. Well, they didn't.So it gets a very unfulfilled 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a crushing feeling you have when your most anticipated movie of the year ends up sucking. I don't even know where to start. Suicide Squad is not good at all. It's bad. It's very, very bad. So, so messy. I guess I could start with the performances and characters.Margot Robbie was as perfect as you can get with Harley Quinn and she also had the most interesting backstory, but that's a credit to the creators of the character, not the film. I was a fan of her casting from the moment it was announced. Jai Courtney was surprisingly good as Captain Boomerang. Unfortunately, he was given nothing to work with, aside from being funny sometimes. Nobody else was given anything either. Will Smith played Will Smith in a Deadshot costume and he was given some backstory, but it was the regular 'dad-wanting-to-do-right-by-his- daughter' type stuff. El Diablo had the second-most interesting backstory and character. Notice how I keep saying "backstory." This is because that's all it is -- simple characterization. No development for anybody. Every other team member is completely disposable, and one is actually disposed of very early on. Killer Croc was given nothing other than really great makeup. Katana had a dead husband, which is referenced for about 30 seconds. She also randomly shows up out of nowhere, even after all the important characters have been established. Same goes for Slipknot who is brought out of a car and placed in the team out of nowhere with zero previous acknowledgment (he's the one who gets disposed of very early and nobody cares). And I almost forgot Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag, who is a clichéd G.I. Joe soldier with a heavy southern accent. He is romantically involved with Enchantress, the villain, to help create some drama. The standout was easily Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. She was impeccably casted and nailed the character. The fact that she was the reason for everything made it that much more ironic and perfect.Oh, and Jared Leto as the Joker is in the movie too.The story is uh, well Enchantress is some ancient being and witch with weak motivation who wants to take over the world or something. She resurrects her brother to act as the secondary villain and muscle while she dances awkwardly. For most of the action, the team fight a bunch of faceless henchmen. Amanda Waller is also manipulative and bad, sort of. For a while you think they're mission is to stop Enchantress, even though it's never said and I guess the team doesn't care that they don't know what they're doing. Then it's revealed that they were rescuing Waller the whole time and everyone is mad for reasons I don't understand. Then they have to go stop Enchatress and her big brother (btw these two are worthy of being in the top 5 worst comic book movie villains list). Also the Joker is in the movie as well for some reason. He is trying to rescue Harley Quinn from the team, but when he gets her in the helicopter, it is quickly brought down and explodes and he dies but not really (obviously).The editing and pacing are also god awful. From the get-go I could tell the movie was going to be rushed and underdeveloped (which are the main problems with Batman v Superman, coincidentally). It starts with Amanda Waller sitting at a dinner table with some guys as she explains the characters to the audience as flashbacks are shown, because we don't have time for them to be introduced on their own throughout the film. The editing for these flashbacks are horrific, as well. The editing was also choppy throughout the whole film, which is probably because of all the extensive reshoots that apparently took place. But I also have a feeling that there are many, many deleted scenes (just like Batman v Superman), because so much felt left out. The soundtrack was weird. I like the individual songs they used and it was admittedly nice to hear Seven Nation Army, Black Skinhead, Sympathy For The Devil, and Bohemian Rhapsody. But they felt out of place and crammed in many scenes, just to make the movie more quirky and lighthearted.In conclusion, I was mildly entertained whenever there was some kind of characterization, such as the scene in the bar. That was probably the only scene I liked. Some moments were good (such as whenever Margot Robbie walked away from the camera), but the only full scene I liked was that one. I enjoyed Margot Robbie's, Viola Davis', and, unbelievably, Jai Courtney's performances. In terms of filmmaking, it is nothing short of a DISASTER. My guess is the studio held test screenings, and people thought it wasn't funny and too dark. So the studio scrambled to add in music that didn't fit to make it quirky, and sent all the footage through a wood chipper, ruining everything trying to find the balance of light and dark. Such an enormous shame. 3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad review:I went into this extremely skeptical, but optimistic.Margot Robbie as Harley did not disappoint at all, fantastic acting and script-writing, DC can really go places with this version of Harley Quinn. One thing that bugged me about Harley was the way she dressed, not a major thing, but did annoy me slightly.Will smith's acting was on point as usual, and really fit into this role. Deadshot is another fantastic character and I hope to see more of him in future endeavors by DC. Killer Croc had potential to be a great main character in Suicide Squad, but due to awful scripting and scenes, Croc was wasted.Jared Leto's acting was amazing from what I saw, but I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed with the amount of stuff that had to be cut, but I live in hope that the deleted scenes will make it onto the home-video release. Cara Delevingne was great, probably the best acting I've personally seen from her. The Enchantress is a great character and Cara played her heart out and brought her to life.The overall storytelling and plot line of Suicide Squad was good, but left a lot to be desired, very fast moving in terms of story, which cut back on the backgrounds of the characters, but the profiles of which were done excellently. The text and graphics that were partnered when introducing the characters was a great touch, really attractively layout and logos for each character. When trying to conserve time in the film, this was definitely the best choice to introduce the characters.Conclusion:Suicide Squad was a good movie, with a lot to niggle at, and plot holes that were left unfilled. The acting was outstanding from Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Will Smith and Jai Courtney. I was impressed with the choice of songs that were used in the soundtrack, some great older tunes that really fit the feel of the movie. The overall feel of the film wasn't as colonel or edgy as it seemed, but the gritty, dark nature of DC films lately fit the Suicide Squad just right. I would love to see these characters in movies of their own films / in a future DC movie. Final score: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It lacks substance/spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the good: it looks OK, has good music, beautiful women wearing very little, at times some shirtless hunky men, a lot of mostly decent action, a few good jokes... There are much worse movies.But...About 2/3 of the movie is pretty formulaic "Dirty Dozen" clone, but with much less spirit. There are a few good jokes, but just a few. Otherwise, it's pretty boring and/or not interesting.Then it finally starts going somewhere, but quickly turns into a bunch of formulas, "a bad man being good for his daughter", "good man sacrificing his love for the higher good", etc.That is the movie's biggest flaw - it just doesn't have any life in it. Music is great, but, doesn't work well with the movie. Women are beautiful, but somehow not appealing. Guys are tough, yet have no charisma. Joker is different than most you've seen before, but, feels like a shot at doing the Joker "Captain Jack Sparrow style", which doesn't work. Since the plot is the usual comic-book nonsense, there's not much left, really.While Will Smith and Margot Robbie do their best to try to give some spirit to the movie, it feels forced and doesn't work. There is some chemistry between them, a "big brother / little sister" kind of thing, but, it's not explored. Since they are the actual main characters of the movie, for us to really get to know them, they needed much more screen time, preferably together. As is, the whole thing feels like another shot at making an "Avengers" clone, which fails. One hopes this trend will soon stop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never once got excited. The whole time I'm just watching, waiting for something interesting. When Diablo, the fire guy, is getting worked up by Will Smith I thought it would get interesting finally. Nope. Just super anticlimactic. Even when he dies I was bored. The Marine guy was so mean I really wish he did die. He was so awful. Also, they never felt like a team. Just a bunch of people who happen to be in the same place. Harley Quin was good and Will Smith was good as well. They were the only people who grew a connection. Hardly but something. All the other characters were wasted as background noise and decorations. The movie was hardly funny. Over all the theater laugh like 5 times. I'm summary, it was boring, the Marin in awful, they weren't a team, and characters were wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let down by DC Comics again! An impressive start followed by a dull ending. Poor script!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expectation: Gee! I was desperately waiting for this movie ever since the trailer was released and it was really SOLID. Hell, who can resist a good dose of Jared Leto (remember his Oscar winning role in "The Dallas Buyers Club") and Will Smith. So it's prudent to say that the expectation was really high. After the last DC Comic's disastrous "Batman vs Superman", this movie was supposed to be the Redemption. Plot: Viola Davis ("How to get away with murder"), an U.S Intelligence Officer forms a highly volatile yet "talented" misfit team of sorts to fight the next Supernatural Force. So Task Force X is born with criminals who are already serving multiple life sentences and hence the name "Suicide Squad". Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney as Boomerang, Jay Hernandez as Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana fight together, despite their wishes, against the evil duo aka Enchantress (Cara Delevigne) and Incubus (Alain Chanoine). As far as the characters go, Boomerang (who?) was totally unnecessary with no skills to speak of. The main villain could have been better - Enchantress is more laughable (performs a tribal dance to create the biggest machine of mass destruction) than scary. Performance: Performance wise, Smith is good enough, Joel Kinnanan ("House of Cards") is fine, Hernandez as a meta-human exhibits zero personality, Viola shows unnecessary attitude. The best expressions were that of Adewale (Croc) and he has scales on his face (I hope you can guess how annoyed I am at DC comics for ruining this one too)But the reason why this movie is endurable is due to the magnificent reproduction of character of Harley Quinn from comic strip to screen by Margot Robbie (to be honest, never realized that this actress from "Focus" had so much caliber). The resemblance is uncanny. She hits all the right notes and provides the much needed comic relief in this otherwise dull movie. The parallel love story between Joker played by Jared Leto and Harley Quinn is weirdly good. Leto is good but the moment you compare with Heath Ledger, you start getting sweaty handing over compliments. Ledger has spoiled the scene for the next generation of actors who will play the Batman Villain with an extremely high performance bar. Verdict: The first half of the movie is enjoyable with great songs selection (my brain made an immediate comparison with the wonderful "Guardians of the Galaxy") and fun introductions of each character. The second half drags with a predictable end. If you are a Harley Quinn fan, go and watch it. Otherwise you can give this one a miss. P.S: Listen to the brilliant title song: Heathens (Twenty One Pilots)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Batman: Assault on Arkham, I had a high hope for Suicide Squad which is being shuttered down to a place where I will be in fear of worse from DC movies for the upcoming years. There were so many characters to tune in but none was tuned in.So many plots could be break out from a single plot but none came out. I thought that Waller might had some bigger and darker purpose behind that Task Force X which was not even hinted. the Joker was totally wasted. And worst of the worst was the villain. Who is writing these plots? Can not they hire the writers from comics or animated movies? It is a not recommended movie for theater goers.You can watch it on Blu-ray without any effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad has a horrible script. First, there was the story--such as it was--itself: A super villain with the power to end the world goes to work in a universe that has established Batman and Wonder Woman. So what do the authorities do? Call up Batman and Wonder Woman? Of course not! Hire a bunch of criminals to save the world.It would be like if the U.S. was invaded by China, and we went and got the Taliban to protect us.So, from the very bones of the story, the movie fails. Add in a tell-and-don't-show approach to characterization, and horrendous dialogue, and this film was doomed before it got off the printed page. I really wanted to like this film, but I just couldn't.So, let's go back to the tell-and-don't-show approach to the characters. Instead of seeing and experiencing anything, we're told what such-and-such is all about. It's an incredibly boring and lazy style of writing. Look at he scene where the principal characters all sit around and tell stories while they have a drink. But that's the thing: They shouldn't be telling us anything. Everything that is told to us as if we're a classroom of elementary school students instead of adults who can put two and two together, should be revealed through each character's dialogue and actions. But that would require some actual writing. This movie seems like it simply filmed the first draft of the screenplay. And then there's the dialogue itself. "I've already killed one family; I won't kill another." Who wrote this? A high school kid who thought he was being deep? Flagg refers to the love of his life as the girl he "was sleeping with." Serious? You're risking your life to save some broad you're banging? And then after two hours of watching Harley pine for Joker and reject the rest of the members of her "squad", she's finally given the chance to be with the Joker and live happily ever after. Well, despite everything we've seen for the past two hours alluding to the fact that that is exactly what she wants, she rejects that for "her friends." She's never shown any sort of friendship so far in this movie. But, dialogue. It's typical fill-in-the-blank writing. So, Harley didn't show any love for her "friends" but did for Joker. And then chose her "friends" over the Joker. So, I guess it's up to the audience to "fill in the blank" and decide what Harley's change of heart was all about? It shouldn't be the audience's responsibility to do the writer's job.The characters themselves were boring and uninteresting. Despite wasting the first 20 or so minutes on the film trying to make us love the psychotic Harley Quinn and mass murdering Deadshot, I didn't care. I just couldn't care for anyone or anything happening. It was like there was an invisible barrier between me and the screen. I just couldn't get into the movie. And since no one other than Harley, Deadshot, and Flagg got a pointless backstory introduction, the audience feels, subconsciously, that these are the characters that will carry the story. They don't. The only character that was even remotely interesting was Katana. And despite a few flashes here and there of decent martial arts and kenjutsu action, the character is wasted.And speaking of wasted characters, let's talk Joker. Jared Leto was upset how much of the Joker was cut from the film. If you can cut such a big name and charismatic character down to the point where the actor playing him complains, and still get away with a finished film, the problems with the script become apparent. Joker was wasted in this film. You cut him out entirely, the overall story doesn't change. So, why include him in the first place? Because shared universe...maybe? Or something? I don't know. And neither do the filmmakers.And while I know almost everyone on the planet--including those who despise the movie--praise Margot Robbie's Harley, I found her shtick getting old rather quickly. And then to top that off, she reneges on her established motive, thus making her a totally pointless character.And, before we move on from the topic of bad characterization, what was with Amanda Waller (a good guy...I guess?) executing FBI agents? I feel like I missed the most important scene in the movie--the one that shows something that makes the entire movie make sense. But then again, Amanda Waller doesn't make good choices. She has a folder, inside of which is a list of the upcoming DCEU characters: Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg, etc. She actually has dinner with Batman. But she puts the world's fate in the hands of Diablo, Boomerang, Harley Quinn and Deadshot. It's like calling the police because of a problem, and then scouring death row for the people who will actually solve this problem. Yeah, I'm confused too.But let's go to the ending. Because the ending shows us one thing: That the Suicide Squad's involvement in all of this was totally pointless. Simple bombs end up saving the day. Bombs. Man made, average, everyday bombs. Satchel charges. Any idiot in a uniform can detonate a bomb. So, why let out a bunch of mass murderers to save the world, if saving the world only involves setting off satchel charges? I mean, why not call the Air Force in, have them drop a couple of bombs, and send a guaranteed-to-be-disappointed-audience-anyway home early? One phone call to the Pentagon, and the ENTIRE MOVIE is UNNECESSARY. But, DC.In the end, this movie was a total disaster.</fullReview>

How come they can create a decent Joker in cartoons, but cant find anyone that can play this role correctly? Also nothing crazy on Harley besides some sexual suggestions from time to time. Maybe the director can find better career in porno industry from the 90's. Those 'touching feeling sharing' time are just long awkward moments. Retarded stunt coordinator too, and they call this close to real life military operations? I like DC, but Marvel just can make much better movies than DC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, Suicide Squad was a below average movie. 4/10.The GOOD: Visually appealing. I was really impressed with how spot on the effects and stylized scenes were. Soundtrack comprised of already established popular songs worked well with these scenes in the beginning of the movie, despite their frequency. Delivery of all lines of dialogue (even the terrible ones) were great and well-acted.Will Smith as Deadshot was the most entertaining character on screen... and Margot Robbie as Harley was the hottest thing under the sun (and I really mean that) as you had to admit it out loud, sometimes. Her mannerisms went well with her overall acting performance despite flat writing. El Diablo was the most engaging and most developed out of the lot of supporting, less popular characters. A few overall chuckles and short scenes of some really cool moments. Little nods to the already established DC lore were there.The BAD: Jared Leto's Joker was one of the most unconvincing performances I've ever seen in any sort of film in a long time. Not once did I ever feel like his Joker could be realistically intimidating or hold enough bravado to impress any of his criminal cohorts and right-minded female viewers, alike - with such unconvincing 'tough guy' acting. His makeup and costume wasn't half bad but I couldn't help but feel he was trying WAY too hard and his face way too smooth and gentle looking to be Joker. Croc also sucked for the most part. Every other character just seemed pretty average as they got left behind in Deadshot's huge shadow nearly every other scene, for better or for worse.Character clichés were here and there, alongside frequent cringe-tastical writing. I shook my head during some lines, even though the performance of the respected actors were more often than not, perfect, but when the dialogue was bad... it was BAD. The overall story could've been done better. There's some nonsensical plot elements for what was provided and better writing could've been made for a movie with such an interesting premise. I feel like a lot more could've been done with it - and if the events of the plot were on a smaller, tight-knit, more behind-the-scenes scale rather than another "the world is doomed plot", I think I would've believed it to be more of an interesting movie. By the time it was over, I didn't feel invested and just wanted to leave.Yeah, the movie kinda sucked. Wouldn't watch it again. Thanks for that, DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want DC to do well, but I will not support poor movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into 'Suicide Squad' with hope.Hope to see a story that the characters deserve, and a movie that us fans deserve. Unfortunately we got neither.The movie seemed poorly edited. The scenes felt they were hastily pasted together, with no real flow and making the viewing experience uneven.The characters felt poorly thought out. The only person that comes out with some credibility would be Will Smith, but the others not so much. Jared's Joker was confusion. Maggie's Harley was trying too hard to be 'crazy'. As crazy as a crazy straw. And the rest was a dime a dozen.The humour felt forced on, as though they had to re-shoot scenes after the criticism of Batman V Superman being too dark.One of the most disappointing aspects was that a movie about some of the most twisted and interesting characters in DC were reduced to fighting CGI canon fodder. (I love how they were happy to blow up the 'male' bad guy but were willing to try anything to save Cara's character...).I wanted this to be a good movie, I really did. I wanted to like it but after BvS and now this, I now want them to stop and start over and find out what makes DC DC.Unfortunately I feel the poor quality will continue.By the way, can people explain to me how a movie that makes a ton of movie equals to a good quality product? It's basically saying to the movie studios that it's OK to make poor quality as they will still make tons of movie. You almost become the problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many years ago, the characters, Jack and Karen, from TV's Will &amp; Grace, jokingly agreed with audiences (including me) that the show should've been about them. THIS movie should've just been about Joker and Harley. Those two in a movie filled with lifeless, useless and boring characters *almost* serves as a recommendation. But, when all you have is two wonderful villains in a sea of misfires that should've been at least cool, it's too much of a letdown film to spread good word-of-mouth.And the lack of a fun time you would've had with a bunch of misfits gone good is nothing in comparison to how bad the script was. The whole movie was so far all over the place, it always felt like there was another movie with an extra hour of footage that was cut out making the overall picture a completely incomprehensible mess. Suicide Squad's own premise makes no sense whatsoever, just to begin with. After (too) many flashbacks and backstories that also continue throughout the film, a plan is hatched to use the vilest baddies to, um, uh, I guess help keep people safe? All-but midstream of the planning stages, a mission so convoluted gets the "we won't sign on" team ready to go fight?whatever.In one of the many subplots, a slave to the "good-guys" causes Man of Steel-sized havoc in a downtown city. Superheroes are mentioned, used and are actively fighting crime, and yet? Never was there a thought of asking for help, nor did the actual righteous heroes even notice the city under attack or hundreds dying. Yeah, this is the same argument in the Marvel Universe, such as: In Thor's movies, where's Iron Man when he's totally needed. That's a huge hole in both Marvel and DC Universe films and I guess they just ask us to accept it. Whatever.The movie had pretty subpar special effects and nothing to view on the big screen. The actors kept trying to give emotional speeches but always strayed away from their character build-ups. And the plot holes and editing was so shoddy, it lead me to believe this wasn't the movie we were supposed to see.Again, that all said, man did I like Harley and this version of Joker. I've heard complaints about Jared Leto's take and I didn't have one problem with it. I've seen so many incarnations of him, I'm used to new visions of "J." From Cesar Romero's to Jack Nicholson's to my person favorite, Heath Ledger's, The Joker has many faces and motivations. So, I was cool with him.Overall, with Joker and the absolutely fabulous Harley Quinn, the movie barely squeaks to a star over the lowest rating. MAYBE, you can watch this at home, for free, like on Netflix or a free Redbox rental, but only to see them. Everything else is incidental. And bad.***Final thoughts: Shame on you DC. Sadly, there's a post-credit scene (NOT A FAN) and it's a hundred percent rip-off of the Marvel film's post- credit scenes. Almost verbatim. Not to mention, it's something we already know about, so it was pointless. IF you see this movie, you can stay through the first part of the end credits to see this, but be warned: It's just melted icing on an already spoiled cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My thoughts of this movie are swimming a such a large pool of failure it's hard to point out the specifics. For, example if I start to think about how bad the character development was for a specific person, it gets overshadowed by the plot holes. Or the overall pace, and script, or just about anything else. I just saw the movie 10 min ago and it's literally painful to think about again. Maybe after I let the wounds heal for a while I'll be able to think more straight about it.I will say that the villain and her special effects were about the only entertaining thing in this whole movie. They did 1 thing right.I only went for free tickets from T-Mobile, so I'm not in as bad of as mood as I would have been if I had actually paid to waste my time.</fullReview>

I forgot what i was going in for..In my personal opinion, movie started with a regular pace, again, i wasn't expecting much. But boy did things got turned up real quick. Everything unveils quickly and you will be sucked in before even realizing. I would recommend this movie to everyone who is able to see it. Margot Robbie did exceptional, everyone fell in love with her, Will Smith was just being him which is the best he could do for the role of Deadshot. Cara had an important roll, great again. But that's not the point of my review. Everyone felt that the soundtrack, actors, mentions, everything was great. But it's just something amazing about this movie and i just can't put my finger on it. Watch it and maybe you could tell me what it is, but it just delivers so good.It's just one of those movies, you know?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with only one major disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I think it was a good movie. Could it have been better? Yes. Does it deserve the critic hate on rotten tomatoes? No. For the most part all the characters played their parts well. Harley Quinn was particularly exceptional. Deadshot's personality was nearly spot on as well. Unlike Batman v Superman this movie has some comical moments, so it's not always shrouded in doom and gloom. They pulled it off good, making it more like a comic book without making the fights feel too unreal to be able to get into them. The only real letdown was the Joker. I personally thought he lacked luster and his character was not portrayed well. He was less psychotic and was more of a crime lord. Instead of being a careless psychopath that gets giggles out of causing chaos, the only two things it seemed like he cared about was money and Harley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Funny, and Fierce. Suicide's journey i as crazy as the cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's here, it's here, the long awaited antihero movie has finally reared its rather odd looking head into theaters tonight. With all the justice filled men and women in sparkling underwear, Hollywood's superhero sea needed a little color added to it. Suicide Squad looks to be just the ticket to provide that color and the trailers only fueled my excitement. But one always wonders if the movie will be as good as the trailers, or if it will bite the big one. Hi, Robbie K here, and I'm here to share my opinions on the latest movie. Let's get started. The GOOD ? Comedy is spot on ? Decent action/antihero theme ? Margot Robbie is awesomeThere is so much to say about this movie, and I wish to start with the comedy. If there is one thing superhero movies deliver on (outside of flashy outfits) it is usually a good comedic kick. Suicide Squad ups that factor as the band of rogues provide their views on life, often in a pessimistic jab. The lines are well written filled with a combination of whit and pizazz that are blended into a potpourri of themes that are very entertaining to hear. Our writers were also able to balance these lines throughout the movie, and mix in some additional comedic styles to further blend in the mix. And he delivery, alongside the timing, maximized the punch and delivered the intended relief in this rather somber tale.But you didn't come for comedy alone (this isn't Bad Moms). No?you came for action with an antihero twist. Once again, the movie delivers as our assorted criminals tear through the CGI generated villains with their various gadgets and styles. These moments are exciting, giving a decent balance of everyone's abilities from Quinn's use of a baseball bat or Diablo's computer animated fire. The first battle in particular was my favorite of the bunch, but the other fights weren't bad and provided some exciting (often explosive) fun. And it's all nicely packaged with that living on the edge, careless joy that bad guys seem to enjoy and we expected. It's dark, it's vicious, and it certainly is fun?at parts (more on that later).Yet one of the biggest positives of this movie both my friend and I agree on is Margot Robbie. The beautiful actress certainly brings the sex appeal, which is highlighted by the trailers, and she certainly got a response by the audience members in the stage. Outside of looks though, she nails the role of the psychotic Harley Quinn. Her high pitched screams, the ecstatic enjoyment of danger, and the devoted passion for violence were all captured by her and she certainly brought the edge we longed for. In addition, the movies performed by Quinn matched her personality and completed the deadliness of Mr. J's assistant. She was a major carrier of the film and certainly a well-casted member of the crew. The BAD ? Story was kind of lacking ? Action crosses into cheesy and unbalanced territory ? Emphasis on only a few characters One thing that a lot of movies can't seem to get is the balance of story with action. Suicide Squad's tale doesn't feel much like a comic book tale, and fell short on some levels for me. A random opening that drops into a long winded origin tale whose pace became very erratic. From their the tale rushed at parts and then dragged at others and prolonged dialogue prior to the fight didn't help things along. The "twists" behind their missions were kind of lame (and somewhat random) and was not impressive despite the buildup of the trailer (I was hoping more Joker and less gargantuan beast). It wasn't the worst story of a hero flick, but this reviewer thinks it needed some tightening up. Something else that didn't stay consistent was the action. Remember I said the first battle was exciting, fast, and truly rocked. Well that momentum gradually gets lost as the movie progresses. Exciting romps become quick skirmishes where overdramatic theatrics are the weapon of choice instead of choreographed numbers. The exciting conclusion at the end is probably the least engaging of the fights, and dropped into the uber theatrical, symphony driven sequences that Hollywood loves. In addition some of the comedic irony in the film made the battle almost pointless and only further took away from the action. And finally the balance on the characters was a little skewed considering the trailers announcing the line up. Deadshot and Harley Quinn took center stage in both story and action, and although they portrayed it well kind of robbed the involvement of the other characters. Pyro and Sorceress had their own contributions to tale, but even those were a cheesy subplot that fit awkwardly in this tale. As for Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, and other members of the team, they fell into comedic relief positions that either started a laugh riot or fell on deaf ears. Again, everyone played their parts well, but the disproportionate representation of the characters and the unorganized tale robbed us of potential magic. So much for teamwork I guess.The VerdictDespite the cheesiness, uncouth, and disproportionate aspects of the movie, Suicide Squad is certainly a fun movie to kick August off with. I feel you many will certainly enjoy the laughs that the gang will provide and the action sequences are sure to get some applause until they fall into corny territory. Again it doesn't seem like they could decide on the route to go, but DC studios is getting closer to getting the formula right. Is this movie worth a trip to the theater? I think it certainly is, but not in 3-D if I do say so myself. My scores: Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As A Normal Movie Fan My Review On Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really good movie it didn't disappoint me like batman v superman the cast is amazing especially Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Will Smith (Deadshot) they are both great actors (the others where really good to but these really stand out) they bring their roles to life. as a normal movie fan and not knowing a lot about the dc universe. i still enjoy the movie with what people call "forced jokes" where really good. I read a lot of the reviews to see what others think of the movie. first of bad CGi?? i Had Not a single problem with the CGI as a normal movie fan you wouldn't even see it so for the people who haven't seen it no problem there ill guarantee it. but at last you need to see the movie yourself to give you're own opinion on it. so if you're gonna watch it or not i recommend it but you don't need to if you don't want to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun. But there is so much more potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its a fun movie. But there is so much more potential. I saw it at the midnight premiere in my local IMAX theater. Full house, big screen, high volume. Yes, I had a great time. The characters are the best thing. They're awesome, especially Margot Robbie and Viola Davis who are killing it. And Jared Leto's Joker is as creepy as expected. But sadly, the script is a bit predictable. The first hour is great fun with lots of dark humor and bad-ass music. But the final hour is just standard (although there is a very good scene near the end of the film I won't spoil here). It feels like bad guys who are just playing superheroes. what they aren't. A missed opportunity because you can do many different things with bad guys you can't do with heroes. I'm missing original, creative scenes and ideas. So its the same story as with the other DC films; Awesome style, great characters. But the script is dull and the story is a mess. I think this would've been better with a comedy director like Edgar Wright or Matthew Vaughn. So I really hope there will be a sequel with a better director. This movie needs to be bat-sh*t crazy with weird people and insane, original scenes. And it can be. This franchise is on the right track, but not just there yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale imitation of Guardians of the Galaxy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So lets go through the main factors of this film one at a time. We'll start with the cast. They were brilliant. The saving grace of this film. The main reason I'm not giving it lower than a 5. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is exceptional. And I greatly look forward to seeing her in action in the future. Will Smith plays Deadshot well (despite the fact that the writers clearly don't know who Deadshot is). Jared Leto plays a great (if unfortunately useless) Joker. So the film was cast perfectly. Unfortunately not every character gets an appropriate amount of screen time. The majority of this film is dull, sappy scenes with Deadshot and Harley Quinn which pry deeper into the emotions of their characters than it should. I'm all for breaking into new areas of classic characters. But not in a way that detracts from the enjoyment of these characters. Deadshot is never fun in this film. He's supposed to be a heartless, psychopath who will kill anyone for money. Yet in this film he's a sweet, caring, goody. That's the main problem I have with this film. What they've done to the characters. They've taken some of the greatest, evilest DC characters and turned them into heroes. Now I understand that's the premise of the film, 'the badguys save the day'. And I like that idea. But they need to be badguys. And for the most part they're not. Talk about underwhelming characters. Say hello to the Joker. My favourite villain of all time. Who does LITERALLY nothing in this film. He's absolutely useless. If he wasn't in this film it would play out exactly the same way. He's only here to con people into buying a ticket. I think the director (David Ayer) was trying to channel Guardians of the Galaxy, but for DC, and unfortunately failed. Its nowhere near as funny, has boring action scenes. And where GOTG actually had heart, this film tries to hard to do the same. Which doesn't work with these characters! I've written quite a bit and its time I went to sleep, I was going to talk about the plot but since its so stupid, and uninspired I'd better not. I'm still trying to figure out these characters intentions. Please try and look past beyond the acting, and the explosions when you see this movie. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film it had a cool and colorful vibe to it and while I don't like to jump on the 3D bandwagon, I watched it at a session where it was in 3D and I have to say the 3D looked fantastic and had a great visual. The cast did a awesome job with their characters and even though I don't think Leto's version of The Joker isn't one of my favorites, he still played the part really well. The highlight for me in the movie is Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn, she was fantastic. Every time she said a line I had a smile on my face. And for those of you who did like the movie and are upset from all the hate that its got?, I would just like to say who cares what other people think?, its just people's personal opinions and its called an "opinion" for a reason regardless whether its from an audience or a critic so whether you liked it or not, leave it at that and don't worry about what other people have to say about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedy/action/sci fi films of the 2016 year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is really, really amazing I've been waiting for this movie to be released since February. I've would've thought hey this movie is an action movie with science fiction, what if you know who would've directed this. We all know who I'm talking about, Michael Bay. I could tell he didn't because no so much you know what, explosions. But anyway I do say this is one of the best films of the 2016 year and better than any other combination. we should've seen more of the Joker, he is a type of person to be crazy and do suicide things, but with Jared Letos performance it is pretty good. It was really amazing and nice to bring Harley Quinn, into the live screen action I mean she should have her own movie. Will Smith's first villain performance and I do have to say I am very satisfied with this movie. My hunger for a good movie this year has been starving, and now I'm fed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic suicide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping that Warcraft would be the last movie I see which made me want to choke on my own popcorn rather than sit through the rest of the film within 20 minutes. However, the team around Suicide Squad displayed a level of shameless disregard of people's viewing pleasure I haven't witnessed since Gawker decided to publish Hulk Hogan's sex tape. Not that I watched it but I can't imagine the dialog, acting and story line being worse. First of all, I have seldom seen such blatant casting mistakes before, besides every movie with Jack Black after School of Rock. Will Smith was so obviously playing Will Smith, I doubt he was aware he was even being filmed. And he undoubtedly gave the best performance. Cara Delevingne is forgiven for her ridiculous attempts at evoking some kind of feeling other than vicarious shame from the viewer, although just narrowly. What are you supposed to expect of somebody who is famous for wearing H&amp;M rags and having aggressively unkempt eyebrows. The joker was a whiny, overdrawn caricature of the brilliant performance by Heath Ledger, who must be spinning in his grave right now. They might as well have simply used Mark Hamill, gave him the exact same script of Star Wars and made him wear the same robe, it would have been less painful to watch than Jared Leto's continued attempts at "acting". At least people would be pleasantly reminded of Mark's former voice acting days as the joker. Even the 10 seconds of Batman and the Flash was like a terrible foreshadowing of the inevitable Justice League disaster to come. But worst of all, by a mile and a million, was Margot Robbie's performance. I have seen more believable acting from my cat after it threw up on the kitchen floor and tried to casually walk off as though nothing happened. Her terrible dialect and completely over the top impression of a mentally deranged teenager made me cringe at every second. I'm not going to mention the croc, the sergeant and the woman with the single, constipated facial expression because I'm afraid my nose might start bleeding from high blood pressure. Not to mention Captain Boomerang, what the effing eff was that about!The acting alone would have been enough to make me want to question the sanity of the production team. The script was the cherry on top of the chocolate cyanide sundae. The conversations consisted of the main actors vomiting one liners at each other which would have made Arnold Schwarzenegger's ears bleed. You can physically feel the panic of the director who is pressured to make sense out of this terrible mistake by half heatedly cramming in background stories. By the time it's "el diablo"'s turn, he obviously has completely given up. Out of absolutely nowhere the guy who hasn't spoken an intelligible word for the whole movie feels the need to spill his guts about why he's not the bad ass gangbanger he used to be anymore. He might as well have yelled it at a dish washer. I swear I could hear Will Smith mentally face palming in the background. The Joker's role in the whole movie is another, completely random event and part of the greatest deception in movie trailer history. Up until the last second, there is no reason for him to even be in the whole movie, leaving aside his abysmal performance. It feels like they noticed early enough that Margot's performance as Harlequin was ruining the whole movie so they had to invent a ridiculously exaggerated backstory, which only ended up ruining the reputation of one of the best movie villains ever. Ultimately, the whole movie is just a giant mistake of a prequel for worse to come. Btw., if anybody does go to see it, make sure to resist the urge to run out of the cinema and drink until you forgot what you just endured. You might miss Ben Afflek, aka Bruce Wayne, aka Beefcake Batman's final scene. Sorry for the "spoiler". I gave an extra star for Harlequin's hotpants. At least the costume designers knew what they were doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the trailers had me believe that this is actually a great film. David Ayer had me believe that as well with his career. So what happened? Well, DC decided to screw things up in the editing, not realizing, the movie wasn't any good either while it was still being written. I am not putting the blame on Ayer, he apparently was trying to make something better, but I am, however, dumping all the blame on DC and also Warners who probably did not care as much. I know a rant like this won't help but I really wanted to like the movie and...they disappointed me with the final product. Also, I don't understand how can people be so blind about the film's quality. I did not really care about the characters. I don't see what is so awesome about Harley. Most importantly - I don't understand the lack of criticism from fans. This film is supposed to be connecting some of the other DCEU films and it sucks. Why are praising it so much???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, that was bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did we come from 'The Dark Knight' released 8 years ago to this???? And, before I get heckled, I am 100% open to new takes on characters and story lines. Heck, if this revitalization of these franchises didn't occur, things would get stale pretty quickly.However, having just seen this, I am in complete disbelief as to how DC has managed to steer themselves this far downhill. This movie is miles away from the storytelling and character development that was on show in Nolans Superhero masterpiece.It started off OK - a fun and colorful take on character introduction, but it was clear that there were only two characters in this squad that this movie really wanted to focus on, namely the two big names headlining the film. Deadpool was portrayed well, though it would have been great to introduce him with a bit more of a showcase on his skills. I didn't like the whole Harley / Joker thing however. I think Margot Robbie was perfectly cast but the Joker was a big misfire for me. This surprised me, as going by the general gist of these reviews on IMDb, it seems that a lot of people actually liked this casting and the subsequent character interaction. Personally, I felt the Joker was a little too..... normal?; almost like a typical mobster with some makeup and hair dye. He didn't have that maniacal essence that Heath Ledger and even Jack Nicholson portrayed so effectively.Rounding out the other characters - Killer Croc was too small (why are they intent on reducing the size of these characters? - just like they did with Apocalypse in X-Men) and his impact was not menacing enough. Diablo was fine until the end - what the hell happened there! Slipknot was the sacrificial lamb as anyone who knew anything about Suicide Squad could tell from a mile away. Captain Boomerang has so much more potential than was shown, and I actually could tolerate Jai Courtenay, which amazed me. Rick Flag was terrible - Joel Kinnaman is a real hit and miss actor and at times in this he resembled a drug addict more than a super soldier. Kitana was a real background character, and her choreography in the film was terrible.However, all in all, it was the storytelling and the poor action that really let this film down. There was a need for characters to constantly remind each other what to do, just to keep the idea of the plot flowing. "Harley! If he dies, we die". The antagonists in both this film and BvS have turned this franchise too much towards a reliance on CG - something that done well can be game changing (as Marvel has shown), however this was not done well and does not do the movie any favors.I walked out of the film deflated. Batman v Superman had its OK parts, but this film was the nail in the coffin for DC as far as I am concerned. This saddens me deeply. Batman is my world. It is my screen name on Playstation and Boom Beach (to name but a few), and I have lived and breathed this character since I was a 5 year old stepping into Tim Burtons first take on the caped crusader. To see his 'house' collapsing around him is killing me. DC has to take a step back on this one and think what they are doing. This is not the way</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is convinced that after the arrival on earth of Superman and the discovery of meta-humans, the only way to fight the potential menace of the next threat is to assemble a team of the worst and most powerful criminals in custody and use them as, fittingly, a 'Suicide Squad'. That is when elements like Deadshot, the best killer on earth, (Will Smith), the mad Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) amongst other come in.The reasons to be excited were many, for one the premise and the way it was pitched by Ayer and Warner Bros. to the public sounded really intriguing. The end result is a totally messy film, falling short on many of its promises, a film which even in its ideological statement doesn't know what it's saying, yet that has enough fresh material and good details to not prove to be the disaster it could seem.What Ayer achieves here is managing to make many extravagant characters fit on screen. The fact of making this coherent is both a gargantuan task and one that isn't fulfilled by the movie, but we'll come back to that. You at least have to admire the bravery in trying to bring all of this craziness together and you do because when the film is working, it is working great, the problem is that tonal shifts happen so abruptly and so often there is simply no time to enjoy a film that I think is, for the majority, really enjoyable, but made less so, many many times, by terrible pace, sloppy editing and again, tonal shifts that even make for unpleasant ideology at times.The movie tries to be a serious drama, but its inner core, which is that of a black comedy, is so powerfully clear is struggles to get out and fails to be relevant. A part of this I have to admit has to be blamed on the unnecessary inclusion of the Joker character here. He is completely misused for many reasons, but the worst part is the fact that he takes away a big chunk of time from the flow of the film and disrupts the tone of it. Having a cameo would have been more than fine because he does work in the few flashback scene has, yet his integration into the plot is simply boring. Not to mention the fact that Leto's portrayal is absolutely out of control and does not leave you with anything consistent, proving that the Joker isn't just some mad idiot you pull off by playing crazy and laughing mad on screen, He is a deep character with a serious set of traits that has to be understood and studied.Far less boring is his counterpart: Harley Quinn. Brilliantly portrayed by Robbie, Harley represents everything about what is good in the film. The comedic undertones, the savage nature, the overall arc with the Squad and the chemistry with her companions, especially Will Smith. Those are all the elements that I really enjoyed and grasped from the film. Ayer had a real eye for detail and he managed to pepper the script with thousands of little touches that were gold character beats and proper development of story.Yet then you are reminded of the plot going on and you can't help but frown. The villains in this film are pathetic, both in execution, but even worse in basic set-up. Did anyone of the thousands of people reading the script wonder if another fuc*ing beam creating a portal into the sky was what we needed? And even worse why is the Suicide Squad fighting such a threat in a world where Wonder Woman, Flash and Batman exists. It is beyond me. You had the possibility of doing something really fresh and new, lowering the stakes and making the character conflict come to the forefront and what we end up is another beam in the sky? As much as I was enjoying the little moments I just couldn't believe it, it got me out of the film too many times and the way the resolution works was probably the dullest element of it all, failing to make any of the characters relevant in the scenario...ahem..Captain Boomerang.I was laughing and enjoying myself, there was some real, clever and original banter going on. The sarcasm and dark nature of the characters was working brilliantly, Jai Courtney was stealing the show from Robbie and then Smith would come in and steal it from both of them. And then Amanda Plummer (minor spoiler) shoots four members of her staff. And then suddenly it is OK to be a assassin as long as you love your daughter. The thematic and ideological points are so chaotic I had no idea which way to tackle them.Whilst a definite improvement over Snyder's underwhelming work in the DCU and having some truly remarkable elements and redeemable qualities, "Suicide Squad" has too messy of a message and a story to really manage to be the fresh take it promised to deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched Suicide Squad okay it was bloody terrible. Cara (love her but) like needs to stop they should of let her character die cause she was trash and so we don't have to put up with that awfulness again, if they do make a sequel, which I hope they do. Like I mean you had to introduce the characters with their backgrounds I mean it took like forever but it had to be done. I would of liked to see Katana's background because she is so freaking cool! So it kind of sets us up for a sequel, but oh my god the "villain" enchantress and her weird Cersie/ Jamie relationship with her brother going on was absolutely terrible like there are so many more better villains they could of used! All in all it needed a better story line and the music needed to stop changing every time the camera moved to a bloody different angle but I think they need a round two to improve themselves and I think they'll do much better. Props to the rest of the cast who I thought were great in. Their characters worked well, Will and Margot mesh well. Jared Leto was the bloody highlight as the joker he saved the movie as much as he could with the stupid 5 seconds of cameo he had they need to make Suicide Squad because of him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just bad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets do this, as Will Smith's character Deadshot said; So I saw Suicide Squad tonight and as I predicted a long time ago, it was bad and it was actually worse than I thought it was going to be. I'm going to focus on each character individually to focus the rant. DEADSHOT, played by Will Smith, was the murderer for hire / father of the year / hero / villain with the heart of gold, but really he was just plain old Will Smith so he ends up being the main guy in the movie which is pretty lame because that's not what Deadshot would ever be. Killer Croc is now a, very stereotypical, black criminal, that smacks of Michael Bay's 2 urban Transformers that spoke in a ridiculous Ebonics dialect. In addition, to his thick "inner city speak", Croc growls like a Lion a little too often but the really weird thing about Killer Croc is that he seems to actually shrink over the course of the movie, having been massive during most of the flick and by the end, Croc seems oddly small?? Captain Boomerang's superpower is complete uselessness. Amanda Waller, played by the great Viola Davis is simply a weaker version of the completely "unshakeable" Waller that I know from comics and cartoons. Katana, a character I really wanted to like more, partially because that's my daughter's name, but no, I did not name her after the DC character. Katana's character bio was right out of the comics but we didn't get enough of anything else to make her any more than forgettable. El Diablo is the fire guy / children and wife murdering Latin gang member / reformed bad guy / the villain that doesn't want to use his powers because it's not his fight guy / the guy that could end every fight in 2 seconds but only uses it during the final fight character, so basically, fire/cliché' guy? Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, who looks like her character without much effort, so that's a big plus! Robbie's portrayal is fun but I expected her to be THE comic relief of this film and she was, but most, if not all the humor was chuckle worthy at best. I loved the casting of Robbie from the start but they Warner Bros. never seems to deliver with the characters that matter the most. The Enchantress is a character that I know absolutely nothing about but that really doesn't matter because she was solely used as the focal point of a terrible story. After the "god- like" Enchantress mows down dozens or hundreds of soldiers and takes over a section of the city she capture Amanda Waller and asks Waller, "How she can destroy the army" or something like that? Nonsensical on ANY level, just like most everything else. I thought Jared Leto was a good call for the Joker but sadly, the Joker doesn't appear in this movie. However there is a white faced, green haired, tattooed idiot that is nearly incomprehensible in every scene? Rick Flag, who cares.... Now that the characters are out of the way, I'm going to reveal the dreaded "Martha" moment in this stupid movie: Rick Flag is the military company man who leads this group of bad guys for Waller so he's the guy they all hate. So near the end of the movie when they're all about to throw in the towel, Flag pulls out a bunch of letters from Deadshot's daughter and says, "she writes you every day" and BOOM, turning point, now they're buddies and Deadshot says, "lets do this" or "lets go save the world", doesn't matter because it's just bad. I could go on and on about every terrible detail but why bother when I can simply say that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it really does make BvS: Dong of Justice seem good, because at least Wonder Woman was awesome and we got a pretty solid cinematic Batman for the first time ever. Suicide Squad is poorly written and cringe worthy throughout the entire movie and from where I sit the future still looks bleak for the Warner Bros/DC universe. The answer is simple, be true to your characters and it almost always works out for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic book movies this year have been very hit and miss and while Marvel and Fox delivered solid movies if not groundbreaking DC and WB have for the second fallen well below the standard expected. I had such high expectations and a lot anticipation following such a pitch perfect marketing campaign. So when I went in to view the film on Friday night I was devastated to find that this movie was a big old messQuick Pros:1. Viola Davis.2. The team chemistry overall.Cons:1. The flow and editing of the film shocked me. It felt so jarring sitting watching this film as it constantly jumped and jerked around in short bursts. It felt like there were no extended or even normal length scenes just short bits of film stuck together as they tried to piece together a film. 2. The soundtrack was tiring and intrusive especially at the beginning of the film. At the beginning of the film we are given short introductions to each character and rather than dialogue each character is given a pop song that 'describes' them played over images of them almost video game style. For me got in the way of the film and a better script would negated the need for this.3. Speaking of the characters I was disappointed with the treatment of Harley Quinn and The Joker. As two of my favourite DC characters I was excited to see them portrayed here and while i can accept a new take on the characters I was not pleased with these iterations. Throughout the film they act like teenagers in puppy love and each of their personalities is simply defined by the other. I also don't feel enough justice was down to their origin story, or their origin scene to be frank. Harley goes from respected doctor to insane fan girl in literally 30 seconds with no real explanation. My biggest issue however stems from the premonition the villain gives to Harley which is supposed to show her ultimate fantasy and dream. In this dream she pictures herself as a stay at home wife in curlers with two kids kissing a non joker Jared Leto off to work. While I have no issue with women wanting to be a stay at home wife, it is every women decision as to what path they wasn't to follow, never has Harley Quinn in any publication or iteration I am aware of wanted to be 'normal'. She mocks 'normal' herself in the film!!! Harley and The Joker are both unapologetic in their craziness and they are in love with each others craziness. This was a huge insult to the character in my opinion.4. The film lacked a cohesive story. It seemed almost as though the script was written as they went and they almost had no idea how it was going to finish when they started filming. Obviously this isn't true Ayer wrote in in just sic weeks and honestly, it shows. It is simply a film about getting from point A to point B and even in this simple task they leave huge plot-holes and question marks. 5. Although I said I liked the team chemistry, which I do, I didn't not like the development of the team. I'll give a little break down of some character below but the team to me didn't make sense. Waller says she wants a team of meta-humans to fight for her as the 'next war will be fought with them' but out of her team only two are meta humans, the other are just skilled criminals and even then some aren't that skilled.Harley Quinn - She is fun in the film but not funny as Margot Robbie constantly tried to make her. None of the actors can improvise so please write their jokes next time. thanks.Deadshot - Typical Will Smith character bad guy with a heart of gold. Boring predictable and again like Harley not a meta-human who will win you wars.Killer Croc - One of two actual meta-humans and to be fair he delivered the only funny line in the film.Diablo - The most powerful of the team and the only one deserving member.My biggest problem with the team however was that we did not get the 'bad guys' we were promised. Each character has to remind us that they are a team of criminals as they act nothing like the most dangerous criminals in the World. A typical example is Deadshots refusal to kill Harley Quinn after Waller offers him what he wants. After developing the relationship between him and his daughter, they only relationship that gets that luxury, if he truly was a bad guy it would have been a very different film. (They tried to play this off with him claiming not kill women or children but it falls flat.)6. If you think Marvel has bad villains the Enchantress in this film makes even Thanos seem like a Loki. Cara Delevigne works out with an invisible hula hoop throughout her laboured performance showing that if you are going to hire a model for a super hero film, follow Bryan Singers lead and don't give her any lines. Despite her acting her characters motive are even worse. We are told she abilities beyond anything we know yet spends the entire film building a weapon that she only completes just as the team finally reach her then rather than use her 'amazing' powers she decides to engage in a knife fight with the team. This in itself was just o ludicrous that I couldn't help laugh out loud at such sloppy writing.7. The biggest flaw in my opinion is that this film fails completely to move the DCEU move forward at all.If anyone can save this sinking ship it most definitely is Wonder Woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to the critics, Screw the haters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I never write reviews for movies, just because I'm not professional and not very good at it. But I did want to share my opinion this time because there were such mixed reactions to the film. Yesterday this film got it's premiere in my country. And must say my expectations were quite high, to be honest after all those amazing trailers. I'm a fan of DC since CW's the Flash so I'm still kind of new to it all. But this movie is not as bad as the critics say. It is way better than Fantastic Four.Of course this film has flaws, like every film does. The editing in the film, mainly at the start wasn't very good. When the film continued it got a little better, but it could have been much better. Sometimes the story is a little bit of a chaos but not very much.. It still has a great story, and the director did a solid job of telling the story although it was a little bit of a chaos. The performances in the film was the best thing about it. Everyone did such an amazing job and were so close to there characters from the comics. Though Jared Leto isn't really my joker, he had his good moments. Personally I loved Margot Robbie's performance the most in the film. She really was so good playing Harley Quinn and I really want to see more of her in the DCEU.Overall I think this movie was very good, very enjoyable. I was one of the fans who liked Man of Steel and BVS, but Suicide Squad is certainly better than BvS and certainly as good as Man of Steel. I rate this film 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Heroes Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the whirlwind that was Batman v Superman, DC needed a hit to restore faith in their product going forward. While Suicide Squad is far from the darling that I think fans were hoping for, it's also far from the disaster some predicted.Although I'm not the Zack Snyder hater that a lot of people are, I welcomed a change of pace in directing in the choice of David Ayer. His style didn't overpower the action or story like some of Snyder's choices do, but I also don't think he made a particularly fond impression on me either. Suicide Squad is an ensemble piece at its core, and I loved the way Ayer directed each and every one of these actors, but he allowed the plot around them to meander a little bit too much.Speaking of the wonderful cast, pretty much everyone came to play. Of course, there were expectedly great performances from Margot Robbie and Will Smith as Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively, but supporting performances by Jai Courtney and Viola Davis nearly stole the show. Courtney, who's never sold me in any role, ended up being a nice comedic foil for the team. Davis' turn as the uncompromising Amanda Waller is just about as picture perfect casting as you can get.As for those aforementioned performances from Robbie and Smith, who already starred in a film together, they carry the bulk of the character depth from Ayer's script. Though the fear of Smith's ego taking over the majority of the screen time seemed legit; make no mistake, he proved to me he's still a huge movie star who can lead a film based on his charisma alone, even if he is a hit-man. Robbie on the other-hand, does her best at trying to make the case for a Harley Quinn led Birds of Prey film or even a prominent role in the upcoming Batman solo film. Either way, I want to see more of these characters.Sadly, its characters are the single most (and perhaps the only truly) compelling thing about Suicide Squad. Ayer gets off to an exciting start by seamlessly introducing all of the "worst heroes ever" in the first 30 minutes, but the film's plot becomes less interesting as it progresses. There's no question Ayer creates a more fun world than what was set up in BvS, but the execution was just as messy. With that said, the humor is much more earned in Squad, and it hits way more than not.With all the good, there's always some bad. With Suicide Squad, they completely botched the villain. The trailers didn't give much away at all in terms of the villain, besides the Joker, so I won't go into detail, but it was poorly handled. The villain reveal is nothing special, and we once again aren't really given any details on the villain's motivations at all. It's a common mistake some comic book films make, and Suicide Squad was no different.I guess I have to at least address Jared Leto's version of Joker. I have to admit, I'm actually not totally sure how I feel yet. He's completely different from Ledger's iconic turn in 2008, but he also doesn't really have enough screen time for me to form an opinion on him just yet. So for now, I want to see more of him.As a whole, Suicide Squad is a fun time at the movies, but it's nowhere near the film I wanted it to be. Besides the cast, it doesn't have a whole lot going for it. There's a bit too much meandering in storytelling along with a disappointingly botched villain. Here's hoping DC can right the ship with Wonder Woman next summer.+Robbie is a revelation+Smith kills it+Humor and fun tone is realized +First 30 minutes is a blast-Plot meanders-Villain is a big miss7.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an amazing movie. I watched it last night (premier show in Australia) and take my word for it!Stop reading reviews and what critics have to say about it! Please go and watch it for yourselves.As for a review, I agree that the plot could have been better (not by much though). It is definitely miles ahead of BVS.The cast had good chemistry and this spawned amazing performances by Viola, Jared, Margot and Will, in that specific order. For those who claim that Jared ruined Ledger's joker, know that in the comics, joker's behaviour is by no means uniform! In other words, there is no need for those two portrayals to be the same...Special effects are amazing as expected and music was spot on!It is difficult to write a lot without including spoilers! Let me reiterate, go watch the movie in theatres! What you spend will definitely be worth it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but utterly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what seems like a lifetime we have been getting some of the best trailers for this movie, the images shown and perfectly sewn in soundtracks promised something new from the DCU, something fresh and relevant and while the final product could be called entertaining in a music video kind of way the bland plot, terrible villain and some of the secondary characters drag it down to an utterly mediocre, if not bad, levels.It's one saving grace is that most of the Suicide Squad themselves have some real chemistry and while controversial Jered Leto's Joker is captivating if not completely in line with what is expected of the titular 'mad man'.Is it worth paying to go see it, that is completely up to the viewer, I don't think any fan of super hero movies will feel ripped off by it as it hits the mark with a few one liners and set pieces but don't expect a DC version of Guardians of the Galaxy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bad movie. Don't watch it. I heard and read bad reviews about it and still I decided to watch it. Big mistake.All the main characters of the squad (that were in jail) are meticulously described in the first part of the movie, it's so boring you can't wait for all of them to be introduced, after that you expect them to be the only people joining the team, but then two other characters appear out of nowhere, with a 5 seconds introduction each, they are combating the same monsters and part of the same squad but apparently not as important... It's nonsense.That's just one small thing that really annoyed me at first but then everything else was bad.If you know the series Power Rangers... That is the Spoiler right there. The fighting moves and the enemies were just as stupid. There was so much kicking and punching you question the "power" of the witch that released them.I could go on and on about all the things I didn't like about this movie, which would include the TERRIBLY thought out plot, HORRIBLE acting from "the joker" and POOR dialogues.This is not a movie to watch, don't do this to yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't wrote a review here in at least 10 years now. Dusted off my account to do it because of this movie. This is SPOILER FREE review, so no worries.I don't usually complain about anything thats made into a movie from somewhere else. But this trailer REALLY made the movie look good. But it turned out to be pretty bad.They tried to fit a massive story into one small movie. It felt rushed and badly edited. Didn't really give you time to think about anything and no real character development. Mind you I know the story, but it didn't well how they put it on screen. Batman v Superman was better sadly. The Joker seems terrible. His tattoos were a bad idea as were the silver dental work and overall "over board" insane level. His persona not like the Joker we've seen so much in the past. It felt like Leto was trying to hard to make the Joker different. Harley wasn't to badly done. The rest of the people were close enough to their comic book selves.And I'm glad they tied in the other DC movies into this. Stay past the end credits to see why. The CGI was really nice in the movie, better then I thought it would be. I can tell though they reedited the movie like the said they did. Originally the movie did not have the music it did. Movie also felt all over the place at times. Thankfully as I said I know about the story, but I can see why many who don't know it would feel a bit lost and bored.Overall I'd say its a 5.5 out of 10. Its sad that this broke Guardians of the Galaxy's record in terms of money earned. All this goes to show you can't always go by a movies trailer. This is a rental at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad movie, but a guilty pleasure?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is how I encapsulate Suicide Squad in one scene in a movie. Not in any of the plot elements, the way the dialogue exchange, or the abundant gun-toting action scenes, but in the end credits. Yes, the end credits ? where, after the world is saved by our "heroes", we see them back to square one in their cells in the prison in the typical "gritty reboot" Warner Bros aesthetic. Then, out of nowhere, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, who is by far the best part of the movie) escapes from prison via a jarring raid led by her methhead puppy-face Leto Joker. Then after that, the credits roll in a bombastic, colorful blend of purple and green vape gas while a rap song called "Sucker For Pain" plays with Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, and Ty Dolla $ign. It's not a particularly good song and the credits look phony and obnoxious, but it looks cool and based on my short range of crowd that I sort of hang around with. That's the whole summary of Suicide Squad in my viewpoint. Suicide Squad is - both objectively and inescapably - garbage. Scriptwise, the story makes no sense, plot points get repeated for no reason, backstories serve no purpose other than to rush character development, and most of the characters don't serve anything to the plot at all. Aesthetically, the direction defines choppy, the world in which the cast share isn't cohesive ? one character looks straight out of a Grudge movie while another one looks like those S&amp;M clowns that might fit in Spring Breakers ? the tone has "schizophrenic" written all over its face, (no thanks to those reshoots, because that always works!) and the CGI looks distractingly bad. Taken as a whole, it's the cinematic equivalent of the modern, lazy, pandering rap song made cynically by the intent of establishing a name rather than making good products. BUT?even considering how much I actually listen to those same bad rap songs, I still like it? Yes, the movie sucks and has no right to be overrated by those against the "biased Rotten Tomatoes" , but I still find joy and guilty pleasure in this cluster of a movie.The story, for the record, is far too convoluted to summarize. After the events of Batman V Superman, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) for some reason comes to the conclusion that the world needs the help of Gotham's rowdiest criminals. So she recruits Killer Croc, Boomerang, Harley Quinn, El Diablo, Deadshot, and? some other guy, under the help of Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg and Katana to do some rescue mission. Oh, and Davis comes to terms with Enchantress ? who looks like she was pulled straight out of a Troma-esque Grudge ripoff ? in order to persuade the officials to use the Squad, only to eventually be held hostage for the film to set up a rather questionable twist. Oh, and Enchantress is controlling Flagg's boring girlfriend as she controls the city via a sky wormhole and a strangely crappy-looking demon brother who serves nothing other than a mini-boss. Oh, and the Joker shows up for no reason for both a flashback and in act 2 and literally drives and/or flies by the screen without any point.So yeah, like Batman V Superman, the movie suffers greatly by numerous plot issues and bad design choices. This time, instead of the Goyer- Snyder "golden boys" screwing everything up, we have one man at the helm taking all the blame. Now I may like David Ayer's movies in his unapologetic, openly grimy movie catalogue, (I personally think Fury is still his masterpiece) but there is no denying the amount of weight he struggles to carry here, doubly so thanks to the reshoots. Constant shifts in tone, weak transition of plot elements, and a stupid-looking choices he makes with the purple and green color palette and supercharged cutting techniques make the film look occasionally phony, and that's before you see the final boss in her crappy-looking silk-sheets-as-smoke-clouds getup. In design, it's as if Ayer desperately panders to the new age of wannabe gangster Snapchat teens the way he panders to thugs in Harsh Times, as he also shoves on- the-nose pop songs in any scene possible. However, as someone who objectively follows some people in that demographic, I can't help but enjoy this broken apparatus. Even among the catchy soundtrack and weirdly enjoyable aesthetic, there is quite a lot of genuine good that's sadly squashed by the vape-stinking baggage. The backstory for both El Diablo and Deadshot are genuinely engaging however short-shifted, there's a small bar scene where they share fun banter, and I'd be lying if there aren't some good payoffs in the action scenes. Plus, I cannot deny the effort by Margot Robbie as the best Harley Quinn ever (although a bit oversexualized) , Will Smith and Viola Davis. All the rest are on autopilot, but its fun to see Jai Courtney hamming up as an Australian stereotype.Sadly, all the poor actors lose any goodwill by a terrible performance by one Jared Leto as the new Joker. Passing aside the way the film contrives his every screen presence, Leto simply fails at invoking any menace or charisma to this character. Initially, I like the idea of making the Joker of more like a modern street thug, but Leto tries too hard to make another Heath Ledger impression. The result is embarrassing and almost sleazy. If this shows up in the new Batman movie, then DC/Warner Bros is even more screwed than they already are.However, with that all in mind, this movie is the ultimate guilty pleasure. Nothing is good about it AT ALL, but I can't shake off the mindless, pandering, coked-up fun that is Suicide Squad. Take that for what its worth.For more reviews, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/08/review-suicide-squad.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just flat out hated it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE! The whole movie is so choppy that there is absolutely no flow, and every time a new character is introduced it looks like a bunch of random facts you'd find on a trading card. The flow of the movie is so choppy and ugly that i started praying for it to be over after like 20 minutes. There are amazing songs in this movie that get to play for 30 seconds and suddenly there's another song playing and its really weird. The whole plot is a complete mess and i cringed every time Enchantress and her weird brother talked in their weird language about their weird plans for world domination or...something like that. She was awkwardly gyrating while delivering her lines and it was so awkward i just had to laugh because i wasn't sure what else to do. This movie sounded like it was written by middle schoolers who had 3 hours to write a superhero script but had no ideas who the characters were. The only good thing about this movie was Viola Davis, and her story barely made sense. Will Smith was the only funny thing, and Margot Robbie clearly worked really hard on her character but i don't think anyone could successfully pull off this trash of a script. The battle between the squad and the faceless zombie like army is a waste of time, much like Slingshot or whatever that guys name was. The movie should have just been called "Harley Quinn and Deadshot: Dawn of F*** This" and probably would have included more than about 13 minutes of the Joker. For all the hype around Jared Leto, he was just super weird and didn't really bring anything memorable to the movie. I thought Leto and Robbie both did their best, but this movie made the Harley/Joker romance so cringeworthy it was unwatchable. And I'll agree that she looks fantastic but we could do with less close ups of her ass. The final battle was so terrible that i left to go watch Nine Lives, because even a horrible talking cat movie had to be better than the CGI barf all over the screen. Positives: some funny moments, a few good performances, one or two good action sequences, and a cast that obviously did their best when they could. Negatives: horrible writing, horrible villain, jumbled plot, messy transitions, awful CGI, too many cringeworthy scenes to count, and absolutely no fun. I personally love superhero movies, and I'm a huge fan of the MCU and was very excited for this one. But when one of the main members of the squad died, i literally didn't care at all. I was actually disappointed that the bomb didn't destroy everyone else and therefore end the movie. Having seen the Fantastic Four movie i didn't think a superhero squad could ever be that bad again. But after hearing reviews and going in with low expectations while hoping to be pleasantly surprised, i somehow ended up even more disappointed. I cant even explain how truly horrible this movie is and how much of a let down it must be to those who loved this comic and didn't get to see their live action dreams come true. This movie was supposed to be a redemption for Zack Snyder and the people in charge of the DCU but its probably the worst film they could have ever made. I laughed more when someone in our theater called King Kong "Harambe" during the Skull Island trailer than i did throughout this entire movie. If you see this movie and like it, i applaud you. If you haven't seen it yet and you're kind of on the fence, consider this review a warning. I would only recommend this movie to the blind and deaf interested in a fun night out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a total freaking mess. A colorful, yet bleak scattershot of stuff sprayed on a big screen. The movie is like one of those paintings where someone randomly splattered different colors all over a large canvas then called it art.The movie's greatest disappoint is easily The Joker. Granted that following Heath Ledger's iconic performance was going to be impossible for anyone, Jared Leto's character still fell short of even one's more reasonable expectations.Leto made some weird choices. Not weird in a good way, just weird. For one, his Joker played as oddly seductive. I suppose the movie had to give us some reason to believe he landed Harley Quinn, but this part of his persona still felt strange. Plus he wore diamond-studded earrings and flashed some bizarre metallic teeth. He looked half like The Joker and half like some unstable rap mogul.The worst part about The Joker in this movie, and the movie itself, is that he wasn't really necessary. With a small change he could have been removed from the story entirely. The writers just forced him in, probably to appease fans.Similarly, Leto's performance felt forced. His voice, his breathing, his expressions, they didn't seem totally convincing. Perhaps Leto tried too hard to distinguish himself from Ledger's adaptation. Whatever the case, this Joker let me down.Incidentally his love interest, Harley Quinn, highlighted the movie. She delivered an impressive performance and an even more impressive sex appeal. That alone kept the movie watchable at times. It's not really what I look for in a bad-ass superhero/super-villain movie, but if you're going to throw Margot Robbie's ass in my face 15 times in two hours, I'm going to watch.That's all for praise, back to the flaws.The soundtrack annoyed me greatly. To open the movie, each character is introduced, accompanied by a song that I like by itself but hate in the context of the scene since it doesn't fit. The filmmakers want us to empathize with the characters they introduce. We do not, save for Will Smith's Deadshot because he has a charming daughter to look after. Deadshot turns out to be one of the film's top two most intriguing characters (along with Quinn), thanks to Smith's fine acting. Seeing Will Smith in movies again makes me happy. I missed him. Just throwing that out there.After meeting the other baddies, we learn about Enchantress, an ancient spirit witch who has lived for over 6,000 years. She is a part of the suicide squad, or maybe she's not. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the one introducing the suicide squad, does not make this clear. It's one of many unanswered questions I had at this point of the movie, and still have after now long after the movie ended.Another, who is Amanda Waller and why is she the one assembling this team? Why did she put the bottle containing Enchantress's brother on her nightstand instead of a secure location? Why did the writers choose to make Killer Croc so uncomfortably racist? Actually, why is Killer Croc even a thing at all? After the intros, Enchantress frees her brother and the two wreak havoc on the city. Cue the suicide squad deployment. Big battle. You get the gist.Despite immense potential and the occasional epic moment, the movie's sloppiness overshadows the high points. I imagine it was hastily rewritten or re-shot a couple times before final edits, so that probably caused the film's scattered nature and often unfocused plot.As many flaws as Suicide Squad has, at least it's better than Fantastic Four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am massively disappointed by Suicide Squad. I hate to say it, but the critics mostly hit the nail on the head. Margot Robbie was awesome as Harley Quinn. Will Smith was decent as Dead Shot. I think Jared Leto was not impressive as the Joker. I could barely follow what was going on at points.. the villain was stupid. Maybe instead of dancing around she could have helped save her brother lolI'm a huge fan of the DC TV universe, love Arrow, Flash, Legends, Gotham. I think they need to focus on that audience and use the same actors for the movies. It's time. Stop the madness and wasted money.My friend and I were discussing how good DC is at making trailers.

		<shortDescription>A chaotic mess that destroys every single hope you had before entering the cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie started off without any context at all. I had no idea what or who these guys were going to fight against. The wait to know was more boring than thrilling. The several dialogues being delivered were unnecessarily dramatic and felt totally forced. There were parts of the movie where I admired the action and acting but most of it was just pure garbage. The movie tries to play on your emotions all too often but fails to do it in an integrative way. What bothered me most was the movie's editing and storytelling. It is as if they put together random scenes in the last moment. There were more satisfying scenes in Batman vs Superman than this mess of movie. However, there were people in the cinema who laughed at some of the corny jokes and applauding after defeating the stony robot things. Perhaps, if you have a good base in DC comics and don't care about mediocre scripts, then this movie should be just fine. It is filled with action and dramatic dialogues which when Individually taken out, can be presented as a good home movie made by a DC fan. Don't go watch it for a movie with superior acting or writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddled plot, muddled acting, muddled editing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the worst movie I've seen this year. I saw Man of Steel, enjoyed it, Batman vs superman, enjoyed that too. This, this I could not enjoy. The editing is confusing at best, fight scenes make little to no sense, with quick cuts between the violence and characters witnessing it, leading to spatial confusion. People in the know would call this the 180 rule, and they break it, a lot. Moreover, the editors applied a LUT to the film in post. This is clear, as half the film has washed out colors, too dark blacks, and saturation that reminds me of watching movies on a TV from the 90s. What's more is that the acting is very hit or miss. Some scenes are basically Will Smith acting, and the others just phoning in their lines as if it were a rehearsal. Easily Deadhshot is the best part of this mess, as he was the only character even partially fleshed out, or even remotely human. Conversely the antagonist who is revealed during the film is even more of a cluster of confusion than most other aspects, at various points their motivation spans from wanting to destroy humanity for "worshipping machines" have mercy on the suicide squad as they are noble fighters, and make a zombie army for reasons I'm still not 100% on. Honestly as a film student I would expect better from another students film. Finally I would like to comment on Harley Quinn, while I am by no means a comic- fundamentalist, this Harley Quinn makes literally no sense, her backstory is explained in what was perhaps a 5 minute scene in which she falls for the joker and is tortured by him in various ways, again for reasons unexplained. Harleys on screen presence was relegated to either making quick jokes about the ensuing action, or to everyone's detriment, weird quirky "i'm so deep" comments, which will likely soon be sold on "Hot Topic" T-shirts across the nation. All in all, Horrible film, don't see it, don't trust people who say its good. I love fun movies, I love comic book movies, I love basically all the Marvel DC lineup so far, and I would not hesitate to suggest 99% of them, even the more 'off' ones. This movie however, I would strongly suggest avoiding like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personal review from someone that loves this kind of movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy this movie as a big fan movies based on comics however you know that feeling that something was missing? So let's start with the good stuff: - Actors and performance - 10 and above; - Story - pretty awesome, 10 and above; - Costumes - pretty cool, 10 and above; - Timing - here where it got my points down. I felt like whenever there was a great scene, the one that you are supposed to laugh or pay close attention it was rushed. If they left a couple of seconds longer it would make a huge difference. - Humor - Again points down with the timing and I felt like it was supposed to be funny but it lacked audience connection to it. - Production in terms of props - pretty awesome, 10 and above; - Production in terms of camera shooting got points down because in some scenes they could have used the camera in other angles or shoot differently to make bigger and better impact. A few scenes to me were a little forced.The movie trailer sold be a pretty awesome movie and I was left with a great expectation but I left the movie thinking that I knew everything about it in the trailer and not from watching the full movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great addition into a still growing cinematic universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this film last night in IMAX 3D with my mom. We both enjoyed very much, the fact that before the movie started my mom asked "so is this marvel or something?" and by the end of the movie became familiar with the characters is quite a feat honestly. Pros:Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Will Smith absolutely own their roles as Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller, Rick Flagg and Deadshot respectively.The action scenes, while not as many as I might have hoped for, were placed throughout the film in a way that the pacing remained unaffected. Was great to see some of DC's finest villains fight together for the first time on screen.The chemistry among the cast definitely shows and the humor is very effective. The audience at my showing was laughing at nearly every well-placed joke.Cameos from other justice league members are short but effective, they don't overshadow the movie in any shape or form. Cons:Jared Leto as the Joker was barely on screen in order to get an opinion of him. What I did see was promising, but it is a completely different take on the joker that everyone may not be on board with.Enchantress, El Diablo, and Killer Croc have OK story arcs throughout this movie, but nothing that wows, unlike their aforementioned other team members. Katana speaks Japanese and has cool sword fight scenes, but also doesn't have much to do on screen.Do I really need to mention slipknot as a character? Not even a spoiler it's just like common knowledge at this point.Overall, My mom and I enjoyed the film for what it was, a comic book popcorn action film, is it as good as say civil war or Deadpool? No. But it knows what it is and you'll have a kick-ass time at the theater watching it.Oh. And be sure to stay for the mid-credit scene, sets up the rest of the DCEU in a neat way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC characters portrayed well, but within a bad plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No SpoilersBefore I begin I'd like to state that I'm purely a DC Comics fan, always will be. I do watch Marvel movies and enjoy some, but I'll say no further.I was pumped for the release of this movie, had very high hopes to see characters I've been familiar with from the comics for a long time hit the big screen, but I walked out feeling a little disappointed, but felt the movie sort of served its purpose.When I seen early reviews I was shocked, but had seen DC fans saying more positive things about the film which still gave me hope before viewing. I was sitting in the theatre just thinking that this isn't all that great, and it's simply down to the plot as the acting was superb and any return of these characters in other movies are justified by their performance in Suicide Squad.I'm one of those guys that really liked Batman vs Superman, the Ultimate Edition even more so, but I understand why other didn't which is fine. But I'm scratching my head as to why I didn't enjoy Suicide Squad more than Batman vs Superman. I will give it a 7/10 as I enjoyed many moments, easter eggs and characters, I just felt the story let this one down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie but could've been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is not great. It is good, but there are things wrong with it. All of the characters shown in the movie are very colorful and played very well by the actors. Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie stands out the most out of them all. Her backstory is very well done. She also has some very funny moments.Will Smith also does a good job as Deadshot, his family drama is shown too, which was a good addition to his character.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was good, her character was pretty evil and menacing. Jay Courtney has a few funny moments and also provides a decent job. El Diablo wasn't amazing, but he's still okay. Croc, in my opinion, had some funny lines and was actually transferred pretty well from the comics to the big screen. Katana did not have much to say, but was still a good character. I thought the cameos by Batman and flash were very good and it was a good idea to put them in the movie. Jared Leto did a great job as the joker. This is a completely new joker. I like his new look, his tattoos, his suit and the new style (purple lambo, the gangster look, the parties, champagne, guns, etc). It is kind of a mix between the joker from batman the animated series and Brian Azzarelo's 'Joker' graphic novel, I cannot say if he was better or worse than Ledger and Nicholson because I have not seen him enough. But more to that later. The film was also shot beautifully, the effects were very well done and the action scenes were good. The soundtrack is great too.However there are some negative things about it. The story was actually quite bad, it did not make much sense. The villain was very weak and not threatening at all. Enchantress, her evil brother and the whole witch stuff that went on didn't really fit in the tone of the movie (criminals, assassins, gangsters, batman etc). Another problem was the incredibly limited screen time of Joker. So much promotion of Jared Leto's joker for just about 20 minutes of him in the movie. He is barely there and his presence in the movie often seems forced. I am really hoping to see more of this Joker as I loved version. Again, can't say if he was better than his predecessors, but will certainly be able to if he gets more screen time in future films. Overall, good movie with very colorful characters and great performances, but with a bad story and weak villain. I highly recommend this movie to comic book fans, and it would also be an entertaining experience for normal audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay friendsI am pretty easy going with movies because i keep my hopes down low before heading into movies.. But for big winter (USA Summer) blockbusters, i can't help but conform and get my hopes up!! Now i say an 8/10.. But it only just made the cut, there were so many things done right with this movie that pin pointing the flaws is almost impossible for an amateur like myself. Overall, i loved will smith, and Harley Quin and the rest of the gang.. But the villain was maybe under promoted in how destructive he/she was.. It didn't help either that i thought the Joker was one of the main villains from seeing Leto's face plastered all over advertisement! If you want a brilliant movie to go and see, i would highly suggest not reading the reviews here first. So many people fall into this trap (my housemate included) and it ruins what can be a great movie. So PLEASE go and watch this movie and make your own judgment call!!!! The movie was a great piece of art and it pushed the story more towards the true comic universe of DC. If you liked the comics, and you like stereotypes of my people (Australian) then you will find this movie and absolute thrill ride with some really funny parts in-between all of the shooting!I just really hope the release an R rated version! M rated is just playing with my emotions because i really wanted to see some dead pool style action :/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is the third film in the DC Cinematic Universe. Even though I still had doubts as to whether it would be any good, considering the lukewarm feelings I have for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, this film is a big improvement. So far, I consider it the best of the three films in DC's Extended Universe.Months after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, government official Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of apprehended supervillains to undertake dangerous missions in exchange for lighter prison sentences and clemency. These supervillains include expert marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Elise Robbie), fire manipulator El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Australian assassin Boomerang (Jai Courtney), and the reptilian Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje).While the film suffers from a poorly edited and choppy first act, as was also the case with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad has such a fun, manic vibe to it that it is hard for me to dislike. I feel that the best scenes involved Deadshot's backstory and Harley Quinn's fall from grace as a respected criminal psychiatrist. However, it is Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker that was the biggest surprise for me. His chilling take on the role fits the film's aesthetic perfectly. The soundtrack was great too, which included music from Queen and The White Stripes. Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where to begin with, this, um... film? Oddly enough it too suffers the same problem; it doesn't know what it is or wants to be. You can liken its handling of story-telling with a bull in a china shop. But I may as well dig into the meat and potatoes of this "really, really bad" film.One aspect often cited in praise of the film, are the performances and chemistry, notably of and between Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Smith is fine as the sharpshooter Deadshot, He's a roguish Will Smith, what more can I say. I feel Robbie put her all into the "deranged" Harley Quinn, but the writing for her character erred too much on the side of goofy, to be believable. And this goes for all the characters in the film really, they all have their one-dimensional, underdeveloped roles and any character attempting to be funny merely served as a one-liner dispenser and not a particularly good one. These are supposed to be despicable (soon to be reformed) "bad-guys" but their characters are so thin and underwritten that they end up coming off less intimidating than a door mouse. And when the film tries to hunker down (in a bar) to get all serious; it's so unearned, cartoony and cheesy, for there to be any emotional heft whatsoever, feeling more like a box to tick than an artistic choice.The structure of the film is, by and large, the biggest issue. It's already been said countless times, but the editing was childish and amateur at best. the first half of the film serves as a consecutive set of trailers for presumably, better stand alone films. The sequences were littered with forced and ill-fitting songs whose soul purpose was to inject the film with character where the writing, directing and acting could not. The second half serves as a predictable low-stakes action film. It was filled to the brim with pointless, uninteresting antagonists, whose plan is just as flimsy as their dialogue; a ridiculous spectacle ending that made no sense and action sequences with pointless, faceless goons. Sprinkled throughout were poor character development, bland expository dialogue and ham-fisted attempts at being emotional. It doesn't help when I'm taken out of the film every five seconds to think about the relentless amount of plot holes, contrivances, and continuity errors that could fill two small estates. The one saving grace was Jared Leto's silly portrayal of The Joker, who, while not getting the reaction from me Leto probably intended, had me sniggering all the way through his scenes. As for Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, well let me say the film is way out of her league; I think she'd be more intimidating in a better-written movie. Other than Leto, the film is a bore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was sailing on an ocean of high expectations after the disappoint which was given by Batman v Superman. So it's only natural for many to think that this movie was not good enough. (Although being a Marvel fan. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie)The movie had a very nice blend of comedy with gruesome seriousness. It gave a good competition to the other CBM's that have released this past year, but just fail to top the charts. Since the trailers had dropped, the good thing that David Ayer kept in mind was not to reveal any plot line to the public, as many people had lost their minds after what BvS had done.There are tons of lighthearted moments delivered by all the characters. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman all had done a brilliant job in their respective roles. The man to fill in big shoes was Jared Leto. And personally I found him to be a better Joker than his predecessor, Heath Ledger.All in all, this movie could've definitely been much much better given the characters and the universe it is involved in. They could've made more use of the characters, made the run time of the movie a little longer, and given a more elaborate build up to the villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Already Needs a Reboot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I am not a huge super hero movie fan, but I do enjoy the genre. Upon seeing the trailer for this film I was super excited because the concept was so different, much like Dead Pool (which was an awesome movie btw). This movie HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE AN ALL TIME GREAT, but it was a complete and utter mess. The overall plot was choppy, rushed, and just terrible from its lack of back story, it's odd yet lame villain, and it's run of the mill "humanity will end by the hands of a doomsday device". The script was horribly written and many characters did not speak enough to have any sort of background information given (ex: killer croc, the guy who shows up and dies before any action- I don't even know the guy's name). The jokers minimal screen time and utter uselessness to the plot was extremely aggravating. Batman and other Heros absences (with the exception of superman) were unexplained which was also aggravating. The flashback scenes were only really for Harley Quinn and dead shot which made them protagonists despite the movies claims of a team. The editing was a mess and the introductions of each antihero were extremely cheesy. Katanas forced and unexplained insertion to the team was mind boggling and Joel kinnamans characters love interest in enchantress wasn't well explained which lead me to not care about either character. Getting back to the flashbacks, many of the flashback scenes served no purpose to the plot and were ultimately bizarre, and not in a good way. Lastely, the "villains" did not seem like villains. I am all for deep characters, but these characters weren't deep and they experienced no real change throughout the film, they were more or less Heros with weird outfits who seemed pretty fragile or good from the start which made this way to much like a traditional hero movie. Now that I've covered the terrible script and plot I have to point out the fact that this should have been an R rated film. Suicide Squad was extremely restricted because of its rating which ultimately hurt the story, it's action sequences, its dialogue, and it's characters overall darkness. I'm not saying I want Rambo 4 like violence and wolf of wall street like sex, language, and drug use, but the movie could have been better if it carried a more adult tone to coincide with the already dark and creepy scenery and characters (I mean who enjoys restricted dialogue and bloodless violence and or off screen deaths) The concept of the movie is great and Leto, Smith, and Robbie all did an above average job portraying their characters respectively which makes it all the more sad to see the final product this way. I would love to see a reboot (I know it's not gonna happen lol) but I feel if executed properly this movie could be outstanding, a cast change is not even needed because the acting was solid, the script just ruined it. I hope to see a suicide squad that fans deserve in the near future but in the mean time I'm gonna go watch the Dark Knight to wash my eyes out from the awful film I just paid to see. PS: Christain Bale is batman, sorry Ben Affleck...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like all kinds of movies, cheesy B films to Oscar winning. OK, very few romantic comedies, I usually don't like those. I liked Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. I go into a film with the mindset of how a film is marketed, as to how much of my brain to turn off to enjoy it. Now you know what level I'm on, I didn't like Suicide Squad. With a very thin plot and even thinner characters, this movie does not live up to the hype. Will Smith brought his game but could not save the lackluster, boring film. Leto brought nothing entertaining to the Joker. Harley was the comic relief, even though what she said may have been funny in the right context, the lines were delivered at inappropriate times. The pacing was awful, the characters were uninspiring, the villains were boring, the dialogue was boring, the whole movie was just pretty much a disaster. The people who put the trailers together know how to entertain. Unfortunately, the X minutes of trailers we got before the release were all the good parts taken from the movie. When those parts were put back in, they lost their luster.Watch Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy again if you want to be entertained, this DC outing has nothing to offer. Both my wife and I did not enjoy this film. We dressed as Harley and the Joker for Halloween a couple of years ago, we won't be repeating that ensemble. On the flip side, our 12 year old son thought it was amazing. He also thinks $5 Hot and Ready pizza and Pokemon tournaments are amazing. Watching Suicide Squad, I felt I was watching a generic, straight to DVD, rip-off of some recent Marvel scenes mixed with the original Ghostbusters. This is hard pressed to even be suggested as a rental. Hopefully WB will slow down and start doing things right. They have rights to something that can make them a contender, but not if they keep shoveling their ...stuff in the current direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think "X-Men: Apocalypse", by DC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where did it all go wrong? It's a question I've asked myself after seeing all the recent Super Hero movies, bar the sassy Deadpool. In a world where studios are constantly trying to outdo each other in the superhero movie wars, a few major things seem to be being left behind (or on the cutting room floor). The marketing/publicity surrounding Suicide Squad in the build up to its release, pointed to a movie based heavily around Jared Leto's "Joker" and a band of new (in screen format at least) characters from the DC universe. It looked fun, the way Deadpool was fun. And that's where I found the most disappointment during the actual watching of Suicide Squad.It's basically a complete reheat of the recent and equally dire, X-Men: Apocalypse. Government rounds up super heroes (supposedly the most evil on the planet) for use as a defence force against the possibility of a super power based terror event. It just so happens that within moments of the team being brought into custody by one of DC's main money earners, that such an event transpires and they are thrown into action. The villain in question is so similar to the last Xmen outing, its hard to believe. For reasons beyond logic, the only way this demi-god plans the destruction of the human race, is by building a weapon that will take long enough for our Squad to battle their way in and save the day. Never mind that this villain can already destroy large city blocks and structures without needing to build anything......The movie, after giving us 30mins of backstory and reasons why the Squad are "oh-so-evil", then goes into a mish mash of action/dialogue sequences that require your brain to left on standby. Some of the questions raised include; If the demi god has already enslaved so many locals into becoming hybrid monsters that can battle through head shots then isn't that another effective way to destroy humans without wasting time building something to blow everything up??? How many helicopter crashes can one team survive??? Why do we keep getting backstory to give heart to characters that are intentionally presented initially to be evil? We don't care about these characters anyway. Apart from Will Smith, who does what he can with the movies most fleshed out character, there's no one in this film you really care about or even want to see killed off. The quips and jokes are almost always off target, mistimed or misdelivered leaving characters feeling unnatural and "forced crazy". The normal humans are probably more evil than the actual Squad....The biggest question; Why is Joker even in this film? It's obvious that DC have a cash cow in Joker and obviously being at the heart of the marketing campaign, everyone was buzzing about how Jared Leto would pick up the character brought to colorful life by Ledger, Nicholson and the cartoonish Romero. You have to say, Leto's interpretation is closely aligned with the comic version of the Joker and that's great. But why is he in THIS film? He has no more purpose in the plot, than Deadshots Daughter has. Being that Harley Quinn/Deadshot are emotionally tied to their mirror characters and that being the only reason for their appearances in the film.So, as far as similarities with "Apocalypse" goes, DC follows suit with this effort - right down to cameo appearance of their respective universe's most iconic character.It's a shame that something promoted with such color and fun was delivered in the now tiring, uninspiring fashion that has seen the super hero genre descend into the realms of the now obsolete "Found Footage" category.</fullReview>

Almost Everything is perfect about this movie. And "most" people who think its bad is because they are reading what critics are saying.they are saying its a basic plot it definitely is not they are so many surprises,.. From the reviews i was reading Going into this movie i thought it was going to be horrible and one of the worst movies ever i came out surprised. The joker is in my opinion the best character in the movie his role only lasts 15 minutes but its enough. I was amazed by him. Harley Quinn was amazing they captured her very well. Deadshot was great too i actually didn't like him from the trailers but after watching the movie i love him. The movie made me like all the characters. I like them so much that now I'm collecting their toys. Another reason why this movie is good is because you've got a little bit of everything Action, Comedy, Sadness, Drama. I hope they will be making a second part very soon. But There is one problem about this movie. that is Picking Cara Delevingne as the role was a huge mistake. Her acting was horrible everything was horrible about her that is the only flaw in the movie. Before this i never liked villain and superhero movies i was never even a fan of dc. But after watching suicide squad i definitely am. I love it! And to anyone thinking of not watching the movie because of what critics are saying are making a huge mistake the movie is amazing and i am sure you will like it. I am so amazed by this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this to be a fun movie. Most people have found it as such. But for some reason I couldn't help myself not to yawn. Suicide Squad disappointed me in every aspect.I had seen Ayers' Fury a few days before I saw SS. I immediately realized that SS is probably going to be full of clichés just as Fury (which is a much more serious movie) is. Using clichés is the easiest way to make a two hour long movie when you have a terrible plot. Unfortunately, Ayer took this cowardly way and ruined what could've been a good movie.Nowhere was the movie even able to entertain me or make me laugh. But it did a good job when it comes to irritating me. Margot Robbie just goes all over the place. She's the bait to attract horny fifteen year old boys to see the movie. Jared Leto delivered a solid performance; but Joker he impersonates was more a metro, semi-female character than a villain. Will Smith delivered just what I expected him to deliver - a cool performance as a leader of the squad. Other characters are just forgettable.Camera work is also done poorly. A more shaky camera would've been a lot better. All the action is very generic: there are no stunts or moves we haven't seen a million times before. And this I find as the biggest knock down. Having "cool" characters will not compensate for poor action and moves.Poorly done action, almost not existing plot, bad camera work and easily forgettable characters make a bad movie.Don't waste your time and money on this one. Ignore the hype. You're not going to see anything you haven't seen before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. What an unbelievable mess of a movie.As someone who is good friends with several of the crew members of this film, I can tell you for a fact that David Ayer did NOT have any clear vision of this project and had no respect for his crew, the actors, WB, the DC characters themselves, or comic books in general. The amount of reviews posted about how his "brilliant" "dark visions" were destroyed/manipulated by WB studios make me unsure of whether to cringe or burst into laughter.This movie was doomed from the moment they hired him to write and direct. Next time, hire someone who actually LIKES comic books, values the creative work of others, and knows how to treat human beings with respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to love this movie, but DC Comics failed miserably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some reviews saying the beginning was strong, but I heartily disagree. The beginning was choppy and frankly awful. The only part of the first 30 minutes I could say I truly liked was seeing Harley Quinn in her original costume, dancing with the Joker like on the cover of Batman: Harley Quinn #1 when she was first introduced in the comics. If you were uneasy about Margot Robbie's portrayal of her, the first few scenes with her do not help change your mind. I went into the theater absolutely hating every scene in the trailer with Harley Quinn. My problem is they rushed her origin, creating her out immediately to be maniacally in love with "Mr. J", so we never got to see her as a brilliant therapist, truly trying to save a mad man before eventually going insane herself. I wanted to like Jared Leto, he looked pretty awesome but that's about all I can say. Both him and Robbie were all over the place with their portrayals, and not in a good way. I am glad they went back later in the movie to fill in gaps of Harley's slap chop origin.For some reason they decided to give Captain Boomerang a secret unicorn obsession, not canon to my knowledge, but it was a funny enough gag that I'll let it slide despite copying Deadpool. Slip Knot, oh boy do I feel bad for Adam Beach and the five dollars they paid him to say five words. I was hoping he'd have some kind of moment where someone could say "Hey that's kinda cool" but no. When Amanda Waller is going through her book of villains, she doesn't even mention him.Now the best part of this movie was Batman, which is saying a lot because he's only in the movie for three or four scenes. Will Smith was good as Deadshot. Katana was cool and Croc had moments, but I can't say his one-liners actually made me laugh. I think the only one doing any laughing in the theater was the Joker. Okay big spoiler lets go: Ayer makes you think the Joker is dead. Yes my friends he Snydered us. What is with these directors? Because seriously, Snyder decided to "kill" the greatest comic book hero of all time, and Ayer decided to "kill" the greatest comic book villain of all time. But if you're going to do something like that, go through with it and let us strangle you with Slipknot's ropes, I mean he's not using them. Just like dirt rising on a coffin, Ayer decides to reveal Mr. J isn't dead at the end of the movie, roll credits.But what angered me more than all of that, when introducing the characters, they used the title slides from the commercials (making me have to read), and on Harley Quinn's it said that she killed Robin! Ayer disrespected the comics. Okay so I'm sure they only said this to make us see Harley Quinn as a real threat, which she was because she was the biggest reason for me hating this movie. And it might have not been a problem but they made her the star. The scene where she smashed the window and stole the purse was out of place and unnecessary. Don't make a Harley Quinn movie because this was it.Last thoughts, villain was throw away, plot was garbage, Viola Davis was a great Amanda Waller, Hernadez's El Diablo brought more emotion to the movie, and most of the music ruined the mood and felt out of place even though they used classic rock songs. You should go see this movie and form your own opinion, or don't because the more money Warner Bros and DC Comics get, the more awful movies they'll make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie with two bright spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was it a romance? A rescue mission? Save the world? Who was the main character? This movie was bad from the beginning. The only bright spots were Deadshot and Diablo. The only two characters with any depth. The Rick Flag character was totally unbelievable as a Colonel, he just came across as a complete poser. They scraped the bottom of the barrel with this guy. Jared Leto as the Joker was pathetic, he was trying to be Heath Ledger's Joker and utterly failed. The story was bad, the characters were even worse, there were at least 4 different story lines that sort of ended up working together, but the two romances in the movie were bad. No chemistry, nothing holding anything together. It was a complete waste of 2 hours of my time. I should have gone with my daughter to see Secret Life of Pets. Don't waste your time. And DC? Please stop making movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So after a decent start with a pretty good but not so amazing "Man of Steel", and a disappointing follow up with the terrible "Batman v Superman", comes the third movie of DC Extended Universe. Suicide Squad!From the guy who brought you "Fury", David Ayer delivers an action packed, entertaining movie with a lot of interesting characters, dark humour, decent CGI effects, and fast pacing. Maybe it wasn't the best DC movie I've ever seen, but it's a lot more better than "Man of Steel" and "Batman v Superman" combined.This is the good things of the movie: The casting is excellent! The introduction of the main characters was well performed. Will Smith is doing great at being cool as usual. I was kinda worried that Jared Leto as The Joker would turn out to be silly and not so accurate. But thankfully he did a very great job. It was like a more nutty version of Heath Ledger's portrayal from "The Dark Knight". Margot Robbie was probably the best choice to play Harley Quinn. She was creepy, psychopathic, and crazy, but at the same time sweet and hilarious, and a lot more interesting than she usually was in the comics and the TV shows. Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis, and Jai Courtney were also pretty good, but maybe not so amazingly great.This is the bad things of the movie: The main villain is just so uninteresting, forgettable, and boring. I actually thought it was gonna be The Joker. But nope. Instead we have a dark supernatural demon that wants to take over the world for no interesting purpose at all. The 3D was okay at some moments but at the most it was just unnecessary and bland. The characters should have had a lot more back stories. But I guess we got enough, we will probably see more in the sequels.If you want to see it, go watch it. You will probably not be disappointed. I can tell you that I think this is the best movie so far in the DC Extended Universe.</fullReview>

So why can't you just get it right? What is going on man. Why do you want to screw up my weekend? Aaarghhhh. If you thought Batman v Superman was dumb, wait till you see this epic.

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is an incoherent mess just about the whole way through. I love these DC characters and I put faith in David Ayer, but I can't pretend that I like this movie. The directing, the editing, sound mixing, transitions and a fair share of campy lines, blast any potential "Suicide Squad" could had straight to Hell. The only thing you're doing by giving Warner Brothers your money is prolonging the suffering of these characters that we've grown to love. Rarely will you witness such poor craft of storytelling and characterization. The only interesting dynamic of the film was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as Joker, yet their caricatures are given backseat to subplots no one even cares about. Sure, it's funny; but at what cost? This crap makes BvS look like The Dark Knight (both films I like). I was really hoping this movie would shut Marvel fanboys up, David Ayer sure thought it would when he cursed at 'em. Well now I'm cursing' back: **** YOU David AYER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole movie is extremely boring. The base story is overwhelmingly simple, much simpler than in the worst Jason Statham movies. For example, you exactly know who will die at the beginning of the movie.The characters are not built up well. They are not built up at all. they are boring also You do not know them two much during the whole film.Additionally it has not too much actions the discussions are too long and does not have any sense.The final battle was the worst that I have seen in the past few years.So all together I do not recommend to anyone. Avoid it. If you want to watch action movie with super heroes, go and watch age of Ultron three times! than this one once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warner Bros have clearly learnt overreacted to the critical backlash aimed at bvs. This film is a ghastly car crash of a movie. It feels like the studio drove a garish bus of frat boys into the dark sleek car of David Ayer's original vision. What could have been a darkly comic film has been turned into a overly silly nonsense fest complete with very obvious reshoot footage which shoe horns in some really really bad slices of what the studio thinks passes for humour. It is in short tonally all-over the place as is the pacing. That tone in the reshoot footage also stinks of misogyny especially when it comes to Harley Quinn. A character whom it would appear David Ayer's wanted to be shown as a deeply damaged and complex character is reduced to a overtly sexual object spouting one liners. Just awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had potential, it really did, but it just falls on itself and many quips that are SO overdone (for some characters I can understand it, but come on. Millions spent and we get some of the same schlock that Marvel has pumped out for years now). Longer intros than was needed (and some that didn't get one at all, guess what happens to them *wink, wink* *nudge, nudge*) and parts that basically can be seen as over-hyped, short music videos. And Will Smith AS Will Smith?! Get outta town, give that man an Oscar.Yeah, but there are a few good things in this movie. Margot Robbie, great casting right there (a bit on the nose with the comedy like I said before but that's the character). Leto, despite not being in that much leaves an impression; looking forward to see if they do something more with him as the joker. Also Joel Kinnaman plays surprisingly good as Rick Flag. The others are brushed aside by Smith, but hey, he has top billing which makes sense from a marketing perspective, but the majority of the screen time Smith is on it just falls flat. It's not Deadshot you're looking at, it's Will Smith, he makes up for it, somewhat, in the end.A lot of parts are just a copy/paste from any marvel-movie, it tries to play it safe when it should've taken a different route. OH WELL... It's an okay movie, no more, some less. Take some risks DC, you've done it before why not now?...oh right, money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just what I was hoping for in since I saw the first trailer a year ago. It didn't disappoint. People are trying to compare this to Marvel films where they have had years of putting the back-story of each character. Jared Leto was exceptional as the Joker, he brought HIS Joker and left the rest behind. There was just NOT enough of him in the movie but the scenes he was in were exceptional. Cant wait for the next movies with him as the Joker. Margot Robbie was just the perfect Harley Quinn, she played the Jokers on/off again girlfriend psychotic perfectly. She nailed it! Will Smith was perfect as Dead Shot and the leader of the group, I loved Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje role as Killer Croq. He had just the best lines. I just fell in love with him. Didn't see enough of Kevin Eastwood. Cara Delevingne did just a fantastic job for her 1st time on the big screen. Loved Karen Fukuhara as well. The funniest was Jai Courtney and this bad-ass who likes stuffed unicorns. This is by far the best film to see over the summer. Even twice so you can see what you missed the 1st time. So many Easter Eggs you miss the 1st time. AND there will be a sequel as you need to stay after the closing scene. Was a bit disappointed the Skrillex and Rick Ross Purple Lamborgini video wasn't at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a lot of fun. The characters were great and they gave each one a backstory so they were more than just criminals forced to do a job by Amanda Waller.Batman made two appearances in flashbacks, first when he captured Deadshot in Deadshot's backstory of how he ended up in Belle Reve. Then we saw him capture Harley Quinn.We got to see Harley Quinn as a psychiatrist who was manipulated by the Joker, we see him hit her with electroshock therapy which led to her being crazy. We got to see her in that classic costume from the animated series, which was awesome.We saw Deadshot with his kid, and that he willingly turned himself in to Batman (who left him for the cops) because his daughter told him he could be better.The rest of them had their backstories too, but probably the most interesting one was Captain Boomerang. Not because it was interesting (he was just robbing a bank and then got caught), but the fact that we got our first appearance of Ezra Miller as The Flash in full costume. It was a very brief cameo, but it was awesome.We saw Enchantress' backstory and her ties to Rick Flagg, and then everyone else's stories, but outside of El Diablo they weren't as good as Harley and Deadshot's.The movie is about Enchantress reviving her ancient brother to help her wipe mankind off the face of the Earth because they betrayed her and no longer worship her as they did in the old days. The Squad is put together (forced into it with chips in their necks that will be detonated if they try to leave or kill any of Waller's people) to retrieve Waller from Midway City and put a stop to Enchantress.Joker and Harley were the best part of the whole movie (besides Batman and Flash making an appearance). Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn. She had the look and she pulled off the quirky, crazy personality of Harley. Jared Leto's Joker was pretty creepy. He was so possessive of Harley, killing a man in a flashback for disrespecting her, and going to great lengths to get her back. He's not in the movie much, but what he is in the movie, he steals the show. I can only hope with Joker busting Harley out of prison at the end of the film that we get to see more of them together in the future in a Batman movie.The action was great, it had some humor (which seems to be the only thing most people care about in comic movies these days with whiny "where's the humor?" if a movie is darker than an episode of Spongebob Squarepants).The characters were all interesting, except Slipknot, but I'll get to him later. My biggest beef with the movie was that overly long slow-mo sequence at the end when they beat Enchantress. It went on so long I practically yelled "Just get on with it!!" There was a nice nod to the comics between Captain Boomerang and Slipknot. Captain Boomerang, unsure if the bombs in their necks are legit or just a way to keep them in line, tricks Slipknot into believing it's mind games and convinces him to make a run for it with him. Slipknot starts to escape, and is immediately killed by Flagg who blows his head off remotely. They did that gag in an earlier issue from the 80s or 90s (can't remember which). Where the bombs were on their wrists and Slipknot got his arm blown off so Boomerang could see if the threat was real or not. I enjoyed the reference.I personally don't see why the movie has a 26% on Rotten Tomatoes. Just because it's not part of the MCU with it's already tired formula of McGuffins, quip after quip after quip even from serious characters, 1-dimensional villains, and actors who phone it in more and more with each movie doesn't mean it's a bad movie. See it for yourself and form your own opinion. That's what I did. Ignoring reviews from paid stooges who would praise a bad movie just for an agenda (Ghostbusters 2016) or ignore gaping problems in a Marvel movie just to go with the bandwagon (Captain America: Civil War's gaping plot holes) is how you can think for yourself. Too many people make what some critic says "their opinion" before a movie is even out. I know a lot of people who decide they hate a movie or love a movie before it's even released based on "professional critics." See it for yourself and judge it for yourself.9/10. Lots of fun, but that slow-mo scene was so annoying.P.S. Mid-credit scene has Bruce Wayne and sets up Justice League</fullReview>

Also most of the dialogue is chit chat bullshit.Full of illogical scenes, and stupid story line. Also very brutal at the beginning, but not having read those particular comics, I can not judge on that original backstory.Fight/action scenes were badly filmed. Some actors were completely useless in the main story and had idiotic punchline or purpose.Went to see it with my 17 yo sister, and she loved it although she agrees with me that many many scenes didn't make any sense.Looking forward to reading what other people think of this movie.Overall : pretty good movie.

		<shortDescription>Worst Heroes Ever. Best Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched the movie on a premier screening, I thought to myself, 'Did David Ayer(director)really pull the highest potential to direct this movie? Why was he chosen when they're thousand of other great directors who have made bigger names than him?' He mostly directed bloody and gory films, but this was a litter tamer (little blood) than his other movies. I felt frantic when the movie showed us the first few mins as I'm a big fan of the movie.I rarely wrote reviews but I need this one in my document. Worst heroes ever including Harley Quinn, Deadshot, El Diablo, Katana, Killer Croc and Slipknot, grouped together to form a high elite team after the government hesitant that Superman was no longer a vigilante, but a destroyer of humanity's properties. The first 30 mins was a bit slow as they built up each of the villain's stories.But let me remind you, it has no flaws. When they arrived at the abandoned city, I could feel the nerve started to wreak havoc on my body, the gloomy images were so eerie yet I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen, the CGI was absolutely stunning!Margot Robbie was almost perfect as Harley Quinn, but there were a few times she was trying hard to be Harley. Other times, she pulled her favorable skill to the highest peak! Will Smith was good as Deadshot, it's just that the way he talked reminded me of his past movies. I love Jai Courtney as Boomerang! Many have I talked to claim that he didn't deserve any recognition in the latest Terminator, but I guess he has proved it wrong this time. His character as jinx and bogan attitudes who liked to drink lots and lots of booze suit his acting well. The new girl who held the role as Katana should give a standing ovation. If not mistaken, this was her first acting in Hollywood. Joel Kinnaman played Rick Flag as the daddy of them all, he's like the more aggressive robocop this time, and the only person that he really had a faith of trust was Katana. Killer Croc was scary, El Diablo stole the show when his hands were on fire! Slipknot was the least good, he could only play with ropes. I don't want to judge Jared Leto's performance, people can argue this for days, but he deserved an A+ for it.The action scenes began 10 minutes after they trekked into the city. To cut it short, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE STUNT. I shouldn't have hesitated David at all. Flash made a cameo for a while, should watch it yourself. So hilarious!The $175 million budget ($250 million was a fraud) was wisely spent, I guaranteed people who loved action films would love this movie. Precisely better than Batman Vs Superman and Captain America 3. This is the best film in 2016! 100/100</fullReview>

Considering the cast seemed strong, I wasn't expecting any stupidity in the movie like I didn't in the first two parts of the iron-man but slightly disappointed afterwards. From the trailers, I was expecting Harley Quinn as this really strong character comprising of crazy hotness &amp; cunning intelligence but halfway through it she suddenly turned into a dumb blonde teenager. Lastly, the enchantress role was horribly depicted by the end. The weird animated dance seemed more like an organism from a cartoon than a witch, wth was that? I'm specifically pointing the dance out because it seriously weird-ed me out. And lastly, how can bombs end a magic spell radiating from the ground to the skies?!?! Was it even a magic spell, or some sort of alien invasion because hey we were told she was centuries old witch?! Should've been another plot for the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's new and it brings a lot of heroes so you must make some compromises if you want something like that to work. Way Ayer did it was probably one of best ways and only problem was main villain and his lover. Movie had to be made at certain date so director scraped some things and put them together. Deadshot is may little too Smith but hey Harley ain't nothing more than Harley and Margot played very well. Balance between seriousness of DC universe and some light put inside is always good thing to make audience entertained. Enchantress seems too powerful to be taken and tricked so easily but Harley is unpredictable. Flag looks very sentimental but at the same time so "badass" you got to wonder about that. Joker, what is there to be said except we saw a too little of him. Jared is exceptional actor that is capable of creating very strong characters and he did pretty good job but evidently Ayer didn't put too much of him cause t was going to cost probably little more. Light, fun, strong, violent, sad, powerful, book example villain and mixed characters but after all it shows us maybe there is hope some day we'll be so excited about new DC movie. 8.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad might not be that DC movie you have been impatiently waiting for, and it is highly probable that we are never going to hit that old Nolan high ever again, but it still manages to rope you in with entertainment galore. What is important that we are joining DCEU pieces together, and trying our level best to build something beautiful in the long run. Aren't we really looking up to it? DIRECTION OF SUICIDE SQUAD The problem with David Ayer's direction is that he doesn't retain focus. The guy wouldn't let you pivot on anything. His direction gallops like a speeding steed, and by the time you are trying to put sense into something he canters around to imminent frames to cloud his shoddy direction, without caring about how spectators feel. That's where he goes wrong. What we need is depth, a gorgeous profundity to hold onto something serious, so that we have something to reflect, and possibly tag along to a frequency that keeps us on our toes to meet those elusive frames. Sadly, Ayer doesn't have that tranquility and he storms like Usain Bolt.BEST THINGS WE TAKE Without wasting any time, let's delve into the good the flick had to offer. The best thing about Suicide Squad is hands down Harley Quinn. A one woman show that swallows everything in its wake of perversion. Margot Robbie does justice to our good ol' Harley successfully creating a stunning persona that is probably the most cherishable character we take from Suicide Squad.Another powerful one is that of Will Smith's Deadshot. He has some of the best lines and he delivers too. But still I wished he was built as memorable as the animated character in Batman: Gotham Knight. Watch out for that one man army show though with his unmissable headshots.Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag was a confident affair too. He carries a comportment that will have you believe things were actually serious. Amanda Waller was magnificently built with Viola Davis placing things in perspective. But she melts into immaterialism with a vapid story to back her.THE JARED LETO JOKER David Ayer fails to stun us with a Zack Snyder like theatrics when it comes to depicting fighting sequences, but he still manages to create memorable bits keeping Joker under the wraps. There are cameos of him that are absolutely dazzling, as Jared Leto masters that notorious Joker laugh, thrilling every frame with his occasional presence. There are theatrics entailed, no doubt, but I wished he was given more screen time to create an enchanting scene all for himself. His occasional visits with hooligans in dramatic veils sizzle the screen with pizazz nevertheless.Enchantress was gorgeously carved in the beginning. The part where Amanda Waller introduces her will have you mesmerized by her ghastly transition. But then as the movie progresses on its thinly built plot, she loses the charm and dread of enchanting us, and withers away like a dead flower. The worst part is when you see Cara Delevingne actually dancing as she performs her bewitching acts. Terrible! Another good part was ephemeral Batsy cameos. Wish he had some more unexpected eye-popping bits at odd hours and we would have the whole hall erupting with his occasional presence. The part Zack Snyder shot for Flash was there too and will have you bite your nails for that Justice League movie build up.FOCUSING ON OTHER ASPECTS Other characters in the movie have not been helmed properly. They fall like dominoes without having a proper focus on their abilities except for Diablo played by Jay Hernandez, who gets to have his proper super-villain moment. Incubus walks in strong with his outrageous annihilation in the beginning, but where it all mattered, he succumbs to one of the easiest victories ever.I am afraid, the screenplay has nothing much to offer. There were moments inscribed wherein you would be impatiently waiting for a funny one-liner, and then end up realizing it was already advertised in the trailers before. Side stories to the tale were like inevitable bits that didn't have us feeling sorry for the characters. Those were the things that were highly plausible, and don't reek of enough melodrama to sieve things in perspective.For the better half of Suicide Squad, we have songs that play in the backdrop, that we all have been forever accustomed to. The flick has limited score strewn across that will make you feel how steep the fall really is, coming from Hans Zimmer's gorgeous music in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.SPOILERS AHEADSuicide Squad has fabricated bits too. Like that scene when Harley takes the elevator. It seems a deliberate attempt to create just one scene. To be honest, we could have lived without.Killer Croc and Boomerang get shadowed beyond limit. Slipknot is literally added just for one scene. Is he that expendable? To put it out there candidly, you should watch the animation to witness how beautiful comic helming is done. To experience what the original Suicide Squad was capable of doing you must read the comic or watch the Batman: Assault on Arkham version.Introduction to characters fell far away from the tree as well. It felt sped up as if you were playing some kind of game, and that time was the key factor. With such teensy moments to spare, there was a whole team to cover and it is understandable too. But really we needed some calm there too.THE FINAL VERDICT It goes without saying, DC has a lot of ground to cover. Whilst Suicide Squad might have come out a dud, it was entertaining nevertheless. At the end we still wait with dilated eyes to see what DCEU has in store for us in future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great writing, great editing, amazing soundtrack, lots of great, unique characters, cool scenes with rain, totally original take on the whole comic book thing, and dope special guest appearances... Really cool original style, not at all what I was expecting. Was not expecting Will Smith to do so well. Also, has a heart...not overly dark and depressing, kinda hopeful actually. Saw this movie 4 times. Strong Judeo-Christian themes. Interesting dynamic of who is actually "bad", "evil", and "crazy". Shows people as deep and complex, with both "good" and "bad" motivations. Enjoyed it the most on the 2nd and 4th viewing. Didn't love the villain at first, and later felt it made sense and multiple levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely am not a DC apologist, but this movie truly isn't as bad as some of the reviews say. (review includes spoilers)001. the actorsI feel as though the actors did the best with what was given to them, both script and direction-wise. Margot Robbie and Will Smith really held their own and all the other actors weren't half bad either. Although, Slipknot really was there just to give the feeling of some stakes, which ended up quite lackluster seeing as how he only has like 3 lines of dialogue and no introduction like all the other characters had.002. storyWell, here is where i have no idea what to say. It wasn't like the story was hard to follow, but something about it was just off - there were things that I felt were completely unnecessary and some bits where I needed some explanation from the DC fan I went to see it with. For one, the Joker was completely unnecessary throughout the movie, he could've just shown up at the end to set up the next Batman or whatever. I do however like the theory that's been floating around, about how the Joker is all part of Harley's imagination and how he's been dead for years. SUICIDE SQUAD IS A SOLID 6/10 (this probably makes no sense because this is the first review for a movie I've ever done, but I'll get better.movie seen 29/08/2016)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was everything I was looking for or waiting for rather. I loved Will Smith as Dead-shot so much so that I had to save a picture of Dead-shot on my phone. Jared Leto played a great Joker and I love the new look on him and I thought he looked pretty cool. Then on top of that I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn I really loved everything about her and the development as a psychopath who was actually pretty decent at fighting. I didn't like however the witch to the movie and how easy it was for her and her brother to get stopped by the Suicide Squad. I think that the movie was interesting that Batman was more in the movie than I expected him to be. I can't wait to see the next movie or challenge the Suicide Squad and there may be a league that gives justice to the system (pun intended). Great job its about time Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Understanding Goes A Long Way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...That's the theme I sorta took from this one. So I made it to the local multi-plex to check out this latest in the "DC Universe"; this one from writer/director, David Ayer ("Fury", "Training Day", "Street Kings", etc..), known mostly for a series of crime pictures. I wasn't terribly familiar with too many of the characters in this, but apparently portraying "Deadshot" was one of the reasons Mr. Smith was not able to do double duty with the sequel to "Independence Day", which just came out so many weeks ago. And he is probably the best thing about this movie. Jared Leto is good as the Joker, but after Heath Ledger's performance eight years ago, he's got some big shoes to fill. I also really liked his girlfriend, Harley Quinn, of course played by Margot Robbie, the big breakout star from "The Wolf of Wall Street" a few years back. She stole just about every scene she was in. The new "Robocop" star, Joel Kinnaman, was also pretty good as the military leader of the bunch. Never been a big fan of Jay Hernandez, but thought he was really good as "El Diablo". And *SPOILER* Adam Beach as "Slipknot" was out of there way too soon IMHO. Possible More *SPOILERS* -- I enjoyed the cameos from some expected, and some unexpected, other DC Universe characters from other movies and TV shows.Overall, I had a really good time at this movie. I don't think it was as well-received as the studio hoped it would be (maybe thinking it would be the next "Guardians of the Galaxy", in terms of it's box office performance), but I would definitely recommend giving this one a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wife and I saw this together and were both really impressed with how it played out. After all the poor reviews, our expectations were low, but we both walked out of the theatre excited for a sequel! Yes, I wish there was more of the Joker and more of Captain Boomerang, but there was only so much D. Ayer could've put into 2 hours.We were REALLY impressed by Margot Robbie. I think (and hope) she'll own the Harley Quinn role for the rest of her career. What Jared Leto portrayed as the Joker, I definitely want more of. I think we got to see just the tip of the iceberg.PLEASE RELEASE A DIRECTOR'S CUT! I've heard about all of the extra footage and hope to see it all. The rumors about the studio heads interfering with post production really irritate me. I'm very inclined to believe the rumors, because we're talking about David Ayer here. He knows his stuff.Fingers crossed there's a sequel. Please tell the studio heads to stay out of the way (as if they know better than David Ayer, pshhhhhh).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Suicide Squad" is fun but will probably leave you with a headache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the devastating events in "Batman V. Superman", top government agent Amanda Waller presents the idea to form 'Task Force X' - a combat team composed of the most dangerous villains within the United States' prison system. The squad's main goal will be to counter otherworldly threats that would otherwise be too difficult for the military to handle. In exchange for successfully completing their missions, members receive a ten-year reduction off their sentences. After a new, supernatural terror arises, the team is forced to band together and work under the supervision of Colonel Rick Flag and his squad.The greatest strength of "Suicide Squad" is its cast. Margot Robbie shows her true acting chops as the delightfully devilish Harley Quinn; her performance of that iconic character is reminiscent to how she's portrayed in the "Batman: The Animated Series". She perfectly captures her unpredictable, goofy nature as well as her emotional/romantic side (there is one scene that particularly highlights this aspect). Her chemistry with the rest of the cast is palpable but especially strong with Will Smith's character, Deadshot. Will Smith rocks it as Deadshot, being both a hardened, no-nonsense assassin and an all-around good guy with a concept of honor and respect. Unfortunately, Smith seems too comfortable in this role and, as a result fails to completely merge with his character. Most of the time he's on-screen, I don't feel like I'm seeing Deadshot, but just Will Smith being himself in an awesome-looking costume.The rest of the cast doesn't compare to these two, but they still made an impression on me. Jared Leto proves he is worthy of playing the clown prince of crime; Jai Courtney is surprisingly absorbed into the role of Captain Boomerang (I didn't even recognize him); even Joel Kinnaman manages to bring some levity to the movie despite playing the hardened Colonel Flag (but his performance is bone dry). Viola Davis ties this stellar cast with a cold and menacing performance as Amanda Waller. Ayer does his best to salvage what he can from a script that probably received a million notes from Warner execs; the strongest aspect of his direction (for this movie) lies in his ability to create chemistry between the characters. However, aside from that, David Ayer has directed far better films in the past.The script lies on the other end of the spectrum ? it is riddled with plot holes, contrivances, sentimentality, and predictable moments. On the other hand, it suffers from a lack of meaningful moments, character development, and, of course, the Joker. The villain in this movie (Enchantress) is forgettable and is only evil because the story requires her to be. However, despite these story sins, I still had a fun time watching "Suicide Squad". All I had to do was turn off my brain and remind myself that I was about to watch a popcorn flick that had no intention of taking anything seriously.Another thing about this movie that could easily irk people is its musical selection. Almost every major song that pops up in a "Suicide Squad" trailers also appears in the movie itself. Most of the songs are poorly utilized, but there are scenes that work really well with the musical selections (e.g. during each character's introduction). "Suicide Squad" works well if you're a casual fan of DC's comic books. The cast is fantastic, the script could have been far better, and everything else ? the VFX, the editing, the cinematography, etc. ? is mostly hit and miss. I had a fun time watching "Suicide Squad" but will probably skip it should I run into it again.</fullReview>

So many good moments at the start were ruined by backstory introduction and fast editing. If you didn't know these characters from the comics, you had no time to identify with them. While I hate Guardians of the Galaxy, they understood character dynamics.They finally explore dynamics towards the middle and end of the film. My favorite parts are when the characters are just allowed to interact with each other, like Diablo and Boomerang or Harley Quinn and Killer Croc. It's there that you get the original tone this movie was suppose to be going for.What does this movie have going for it? *) Characters *) Visuals *) PotentialWhat do the next films need to work on? *) Story *) Tone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed by Joker, Pleased by Harley Quinn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not an avid moviegoer, frankly, I'm very choosy about movies when I have to pay. But I didn't even care about the money while booking for Suicide Squad. Because I love Jared Leto on screen and I was so enthusiastic to see how he fits as joker. But now I think he agreed to play this role to confirm about the worst joker ever. You are definitely going to be disappointed if you go to watch Suicide Squad only for him. Not only his over make-up and extra laughing, he didn't actually have a specific role to play. Forget joker, the most disappointing part of this film is the story-line. It is more like a MARVEL film, arrange the plot in such a way that you could end up the film with a superhero fight between two gangs. Just saying 'we are bad guys' won't create a bad image to audience until you act like a real psychopath.Harley Quinn, she is the face, she is the sociopath you like to be, she is the one who will make you feel that you're actually into DC. Her laughing to her bubblegum blowing, She is the best in the entire film. Will Smith, good as hit-man, was mainly focused than any other characters. Overall, worthy enough for one-time watch but you need to keep your expectation low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations before seeing Suicide Squad. When I watched the real thing, it kinda falls down. First of all, the movie was cool looking. It had interesting characters, good action and not so bad acting. Will Smith and Margot Robbie did great playing their respective characters. It made me want to see more. With the down side, not all of the characters were given attention. Even though I pretty much know who Killer Croc, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Rick Flagg and Enchantress are, those characters lack the backstory they needed. Also, Jared Leto's Joker; I didn't love it nor hate it, I just think it's a lot less interesting unlike the previous Jokers like Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. In conclusion, Suicide Squad is a fun movie to watch, it may have its flaws but still, it's fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on what Dc gave us this year, it was pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that the reviews for this film were less than stellar so I was not sure what to expect. I had had high expectations for this movie previously, that's true, and it wasn't what I had hoped for. I had a lot, and I mean a lot of flaw, but overall, it was much better than what you might have thought based on the reviews. I understand why the critics didn't like it that much, because, yes it is full of clichés, and the plot is stupid, a total mess and is not going anywhere, it didn't have a big action scene ( the action in general left much to be desired), the CGI was not always good, the mix between the two variations is noticeable ( we get two opening scenes, etc), the soundtrack is overused (don't get me wrong, I loved the soundtrack but there were moments it became distracting. There was loud music over dialogue, over key scenes. Sometimes it really works but sometimes it doesn't and becomes annoying) and the pacing and editing are really terrible. The first 30 minutes of the movie is only backstory after backstory as they try to introduce and establish the characters, but there are so many, and it becomes tiresome at some point. It would have been better if that had been alternated at different parts of the film and not all blend together one after the other, or even better, don't give us an backstory, give us aspects of it and the characters personality during the story, through dialogue and through their actions, and save the backstory for their own movie. And that Slipnot guy, we all knew he was gonna die from the start, and they didn't care to get us invested in his character, but than what's the point of killing the character if that leaves you no impact at all! And since there were so many characters, there wasn't enough screen time. Not to mention how some of them were so badly written and Katana was barely in the movie. We never see her using her soultaker sword. So many scenes from the trailer were cut,that one. so, from what I'm saying it seems as if I hated this movie. Well, no. To enjoy it you have to actually turn your brain off, let that be said, but overall, it was a lot of fun. It was bad-ass, and cool, and had humor, and whatever you can ask from a comic book movie. That's what it is, a typical comic book movie movie. It doesn't break new ground but it doesn't need to. The cast did a great job. Really, the best part about this movie were the characters. There is a clear intention on building up these characters over building the film . It is not about what is going on, it is about what is going on inside these character's minds that really push the movie forward. I loved everyone in the cast. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is exceptional. She delivers a performance that is straight out of Girl, Interrupted. She is extremely unpredictable on screen and it is a pure delight watching her relish in exactly what makes Harley Quinn memorable: her sultry psychotic demeanor. The chemistry between her and Deadshot is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other,is entertaining. Viola Davis also brought up her character pretty well, as she played the cold-hearted leader Amanda Waller. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney, Joel Kinneman,, Scott Eastwood and Adam Beach, all give great performances and there isn't one false beat and that means a lot considering who little screen time and how few lines they had. Jerard Leto's Joker was one of the best things in the movie, but we don't get to see much of his performance. I am really looking foreword to see more of his Joker in the future. So in the end, I liked it more than I disliked it, and it is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying popcorn film with several strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is campy and fun, with a surprising amount of heart. 8/10 for general audiences, 9/10 for fans.Praise:- We already knew that the film would be visually appealing. What I didn't expect was that David Ayer would be able to take nine new characters with decades of history and successfully make us care about them. Their disparate motivations make the conflict between characters genuine,and not the standard "two superheroes meet and must automatically fight," so when they do come together as a team it feels earned.-The action scenes against the Lovecraftian hordes of corrupted citizens are brutal, high-energy, and satisfying spectacles in which every team member shines.-The Boomerang/ Slipknot scene is lifted straight from the classic comics, with one sick twist-Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller with perfect gravitas.- Margot Robbie's version of Harley Quinn is a near-perfect portrayal of a performance artist drawing attention to cover her pain. Not all her jokes land, but she's a worthy addition to the character's history.-Will Smith's Deadshot is probably the most sympathetic version of the character to date. He takes a fairly clichéd backstory and makes us care.- We get to see Batman on the hunt in Gotham, and in his limited screen time Affleck proves once again that he's the most comic-accurate Batman to date.Complaints:-The pacing of the main story is a little weird. After a creepy and effective introduction, the villains of the piece camp out in the third act of a Ghostbusters movie and more or less wait for our heroes to catch up. The "big bad" isn't really the point of the film, but it would have been nice to give them more to do.-For all the reports of Jared Leto's method acting, he fails to embody the Joker. He does not instill fear, nor perform with enough panache to make us cheer for him.-Katana was amazing, and I would have loved to see more of her story. We don't really get to know her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining flick with its share of hiccups.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was panned by critics but seemingly beloved by fans. This movie was nowhere near as bad as critics said it was. As a whole, the film really slows down once the squad enters the smoldering ruins of the city. The pacing is inconsistent, either being fun and action-packed or dull and dreary. The film spent a large portion of its run-time trying to find its identity without fully succeeding. That being said, most of the cast was terrific. Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Jay Hernandez all delivered memorable roles. Jared Leto's Joker was enjoyable despite the fact that the dynamic in the Joker-Harley love story was scrapped and replaced by WB execs for that sweet, sweet merchandise money. I wasn't a huge fan of the lovey-dovey Joker-Harley love story but it was Oscar-worthy compared to that of Rick Flagg-Enchantress. This pitiful attempt at a love story served as nothing more than a crummy plot device. Zero chemistry and little background was given to this toilet paper tapestry of love. Joel Kinnaman did not sell me on Rick Flagg and the model playing Enchantress was basically just CGI that was dubbed over. This was by far the weakest portion of the film's story and unfortunately made up a large part of the plot. Was this film bad? No, but it had its shortcomings. I left the theater entertained but slightly disappointed. The more I hear about WB forcing director David Ayers to re-shoot and edit certain scenes make me want to see a director's cut. I feel like Ayers' original vision would surpass the watered-down cut many audiences saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the awesome soundtrack, unbelievable acting, intriguing story line and perfect cast members, this film is one I definitely recommend seeing. The film is about an assembled team of the most dangerous villains in the world who are sent on a mission to defeat a bigger evil entity. The film's twist on typical superhero movies really stands out as the antagonists take the spotlight for once. The squad is composed of fearless felons with nothing to lose. Their actions, hidden agendas and intentions are absolutely unpredictable. One of the best aspects of this movie is the cast and their outstanding acting. Margot Robbie's role as Harley Quinn is jaw dropping and Jared Leto deserves lots of credit for his performance as the Joker. They played their roles so amazingly well that it was hard for me to imagine them as people outside of their roles here. Their facial expressions, from scene to scene, is unbelievable. All of the characters' portrayals are amazing. Deadshot, played wonderfully by Will Smith, provides a comedic and emotional aspect as he tries to hold a loving relationship with his daughter throughout the main conflict. What makes the characters so memorable and the film intriguing is that each one has its own twisted story and talent. The soundtrack is awesome and the film's use of lot of good songs made certain scenes especially memorable. Overall, this film is a fun movie and, if you go in to see it with no specific expectation or comparison with another film, I can't imagine anyone not liking it. The idea may have been typical but the execution was superb. Sure people argue that it is just another superhero movie and make many comparisons to other superhero films, but I think the style this film has, including the acting, music, camera work and visuals puts this film above others. I recommend this film for people ages 13 to 18 and think adults will enjoy it as well, especially those who like twisted, psychotic and creepy vibes because, although I am not a fan of action movies, the psychotic and creepy feel made it really interesting for me. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Harmony M, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith, Kinnaman, Robbie and Co. shine but are let down by the plotting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>U.S. intelligence officer decides to assemble a team of dangerous, incarcerated super villains who are held to ransom for a top-secret mission.David Ayer's dark comic book film Suicide Squad offers plenty of solid acting, but the film feel like a series of abridged clips in a paper thin story, which is a shame given Will Smith's fine performance as Dead Shot and Joel Kinnaman's first-rate Rick Flag. Actually the cast save this suicide run including the likes of Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez who has an horrific back story as Diablo and gets a memorable show down with an Incubus. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is notable with plenty of presence as Killer Croc. Ben Affleck's Batman's cameo and The Jokers failed attempts to reunite with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is at times more interesting than David Ayer's popcorn servicing plot. Ayer's bid to frame all the squad Magnificent Seven/Reservoir Dogs style arguably feels staged and overtly over done. Steven Price's music helps the action and poses with some techno Rambo-like motifs. The all-villain fighting team spend too much time fighting faceless hordes of monster entities. That's not to say that Ayer doesn't deliver of the directing duties or aesthetics, the look of Suicide Squad oozes an edgy ominous atmosphere and a quantity of dialogue and cutting humour hit the mark. Its just all undermined by paint by numbers plotting and a collection of convenient coincidences as the team log heads with intelligence operative Amanda Waller and/or is attacked by the Enchantress, her brother and their minions.With the team forced to carry out the governments wishes or have their heads blown off to Ayer credit there's poignant moments with a sense of camaraderie and heart much of which come from Smith, Kinnaman and Robbie. Jai Courtney redeems himself as Boomerang after his stint as Kyle Reese. Sadly, at times confined to flashbacks Jared Leto's admirable maniacal uncomfortable take on The Joker is left to just pop up now and again like a whirlwind Silver tooth evil Cesar Romero. Robbie's Quinn and Leto's Joker tortured Stockholm syndrome-like relationship is scarily realised. Their switch-blade romance reminiscent of Natural Born Killers and the like would have made an interesting dark original film in its own right. Nigglingly Ayer on occasion debatably reduces Robbie to eye candy (by default) and Harley could have been played by anyone with the equal amount of nihilistic sassiness which under serves both the character and the actor, thankfully the flashbacks flesh her out but Robbie is spread quip thin in the main story. The editing and pacing doesn't seem to help things either, Suicide Squad possibly could have benefited with the back-stories being extended and playing out chronologically, even over two films - as it rushes to get to a place and that somewhere never quite pays off which is a crying shame giving the effort put in. Cara Delevingne puts in a good dual role innings as June Moone/Enchantress but the otherworldly unstoppable CGI villain while well realised feels out of place, the CGI versus the gritty underdogs doesn't seem to hold up in the closing. There's also a tagged on ending with an unnecessary (Marvel style) scene that sets up the Justice League movie instead of a Suicide Squad sequel, which leaves the Squad characters hanging.Warner Bros' Suicide Squad is entertaining but frustrating, it's worth watching for the actor's efforts if you can over look its short comings. Will Smith and company require another fairer crack of the whip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At no point in the movie did I feel the need to keep watching. The character intros felt awkward."Comic" style typeface stuff was really poor. Was done well in Sin City and similar comic style movies, but was really awkward and annoying in this.Smith's story-line gave us one character to kinda want to follow, but still wasn't a very compelling watch. Boring. Left after 1hr in.Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie, but it ain't a good one either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Off everybody waited for this movie because it had live adaptation of Joker after a long time in it, but believe me it wasn't worth it. He appeared as a forced entry rather than good part in the film. I personally had huge expectation because it was coming from a director whose last flick was a world war 2 tank movie and with amazing character devlopment. Now this movie had no character devlopment of any sort except harley and deadshot. DCEU is failing miserably in that part be it MOS or BVS. The Jokes feel forced, choppy story and miserable script. This movie like BVS has god awful script. I heard the news that they had a lots of cuts to match MCU movies. Now coming to the good part, Will Smith, was stand off. He was the most entertaining part of Suicide Squad. He delivered almost all the goods in the movie. Next up Harley quinn up to a point was good, but when it came to awful dialogues nobody could save her. Voila Davis had her moments and at the climax she too sucked. Rick Flag had a half baked forced moments. boomerang, El Diablo, Katana, Croc were just there to make film look good in trailers. The start of the movie was good and from then on the torture started. And Batman's role was terbly wasted. I would suggest you this movie if youn are a die hard DC fan, not for others though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's wrong but in the wrong ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect to particularly like this film given the current status of the reviews coming out and the fact that I'm not in general a big DC or even comic book fan otherwise - but I have enjoyed super hero stuff perfectly well in the past. And... I didn't particularly enjoy it, but weirdly it was for things that I would have thought this film , whatever its flaws, would've been immune from. Foremost amongst these was the fact that, for a lot of the time, it was just plain dull.The hour in the middle is most to blame for this - essentially the 'squad' are making their way through city ruins toward the big bad boss and... that's literally it. They introduce these quite cool looking characters and build them up (I guess much like the pre-release hype via the trailers) and yet for this main part of the movie they just kind of walk next to a bunch of soldiers who slowly crawl their way through buildings, occasionally whacking a few bad guys themselves. It seems like a slow motion Call of Duty level and is criminal underuse of what otherwise seem like very promising characters.One aspect that has been praised is the casting, which on paper, does look good, but I just don't think Will Smith is suited to sharing the screen with an ensemble. Cara Delevingne's baddie is bizarrely funny but I kind of felt I was laughing at the pretty meh CGI superimposed over her than the character herself, and Margot Robie's cringe level is off the charts. I hear that, in fairness, the dialogue and action written for her is pretty loyal to the Harley Quinn source material, and that's great, but someone needs to tell the makers that film adaptations are exactly that - adaptations - and need editing and compromising; they can't just be a scene-for- scene copy and paste of the original.That said it's not the worst superhero film I've ever seen, and, if these characters are in future utilised properly there's definitely hope for the DC-verse, but this is sadly lacking in transferring much loved characters onto the big screen. Watch Guardians of the Galaxy instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would watch again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I cannot say I am a big fan of superhero movies (except for The Dark Knight Trilogy, which is absolutely amazing) so I was sceptical about seeing this one since I was afraid of impending disappointment as soon as the first scene starts (as with some other superhero movies). With that said, I must admit, what compelled me the most to see it was the cast: Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Will Smith... It did help that I'd seen other David Ayer movies and liked them too.This movie was pure entertainment. Great soundtrack (someone might dislike the playlist with popular hits, but I really enjoyed it), brilliant performance by Jared Leto as Joker (I wasn't sure I would enjoy another actor's performance of that character, but Heath Ledger's Joker was set in another mood, more sombre, while Leto's Joker fits perfectly into this colourful craziness; Margot Robbie's perfectly ''vexing'' character, which provides us with most of the zingers in the film; Will Smith - he had more demanding roles than this one, so he could not fall short of the expectations; Viola Davis as the stern and ruthless government official and other actors that delivered great performances. I cannot say I am completely happy with all of the characters (their development; not enough screen time for everyone) or all of the dialogues but I can say I was not bored even for a second.It doesn't have that ''seriousness'' but I was not looking for it either. It is a pleasant experience and I recommend watching it - I would definitely watch it again.I would not mind if they did a separate Joker-Harley Quinn story too because those two are the perfect entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the mess that Batman v. Superman turned out to be I was incredibly nervous for this film ... I was wrong to be. I actually found myself thoroughly enjoying Suicide Squad, I loved the characters, I thought the plot was actually pretty well constructed and really quite original too but ... I did have to pick flaws in that of the fact that we didn't see enough screen time for characters I would've liked to have seen more of, I really, really do not like the 'gangster' version of The Joker and I can't help but think Harley would've been hotter If more was left to the imagination. To be honest actually, I thought Katana was hotter than Quinn. But regardless, I thought some of the acting in this film was some of the best I've seen In a comic book film especially from Viola Davis, Will Smith, Jared Leto and surprisingly Jai Courtney. All in all I thought Suicide Squad was an enjoyable comic book romp with a great villain. Oh and El Diablo, Jesus. Talk about a dark horse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning felt a little scattered and over all the movie felt like it wanted to be 2 1/2 or 3 hours long, instead of the 2 hours we have. The cut from scene to scene sometimes felt like something was missing, but it still came through with lot's of action. Surprises at the end, of course, but not too much of a surprise. Loved Harley Quinn (who wouldn't) and Killer Croc. I would love to see more of both.I saw it in 3D and think it was passable, but probably unnecessary to enjoy. I gave it a 7 of 10 and might have gone as high as a 9, if a longer cut had revealed more juice. We'll see how the inevitable Director's Cut looks whenever it comes out. If you haven't gone to see it, give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad creates characters I want to see again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand all the negative reviews on this site. Suicide Squad provided a pretty standard roller coast ride for an action movie, but it was fun and interesting. Most of all, it created (and introduced me to)characters that both my wife and I want to see again in another movie.Top Tier of new DC Movie Characters: Deadshot and Harley Quinn were both extremely interesting -for different reasons. We would pay to see any movies in the theater that has either of these characters in it -even solo movies.Excellent "Ensemble-type" characters: We enjoyed Killer Croc, Katana, Amanda Waller and Diablo. Killer Croc is a "Thing-like" who probably benefited from not being on the screen continuously for long periods of time. Katana was intriguing but didn't speak much or show as much personality as others -we liked her though and want to see more. Diablo's internal struggles and meta-human skills were interesting. Amanda Waller was impressive as one tough cookie - a female Nick Fury who is far more 'morally-ambiguous" than Fury. Viola Davis looked the part as Amanda and did a reasonable job with her.Rick Flag: He was okay but nothing special. We have seen characters like him hundreds of times before in movies - like, for example, in every Bruce Willis movie ever made.Captain Boomerang: This character was 'meh' for me. He seemed very weak in the fight scenes, his personality was not interesting and his spoken lines were hard to understand.Enchantress had overly strong powers that seemed to lack any rules or boundaries - not a good combination. However, her backstory was good and she was visually interesting -and her human alter-ego inspired sympathy.Joker by Jared Leto is not a new DC Movie character, but he was very menacing and well-done. Nice job.Given that Suicide Squad creates new character 'assets' for future DC Movies, I think it was a strong success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jared Leto plays awful Joker, awful jokes, Marvel copycat movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Spoilers ***Will Smith probably saved the movie from total failure. Harley Quinn was annoying and I don't understand what the hype was all about with her character (besides the actress).1.5 hours into the movie and we only saw the Joker a few times. The first appearance was more sexual than scary when he started touching Griggs. Very weird compared to what you'd expect from the Joker.Last battle scene vs the witch's brother They discussed a battle plan before attacking the witch's brother and determined that a super bomb will take out this magical being. This being said, someone still tried to throw a knife at the witch's brother and then Harley goes after the witch's brother with a baseball bat. It's kind of ridiculous. There were none of the witch's foot soldiers to protect them (odd) and her spell was completed the second after her brother died ; talk about impeccable timing.Last battle vs the witch: After the witch decides to stay and fight while her spell is consuming the world, Harley decides to hit the witch with a baseball bat, yes a baseball bat, and says "Oh, sorry". The witch then shoves her away instead of killing her with the dual katana. Horrible, just horrible. They even knew that the only way to destroy the witch is to cut her heart out so I'm not sure what a baseball bat would do and I would not call a baseball bat a distraction vs a witch but this movie does. Then the witch says "Enough" and in 1 second takes all of their weapons away and then tells them to bow to her or die. Harley then pretends to bow and then grabs a katana and cuts out the witch's heart. The end.I also don't understand why Jared Leto went into method acting for only a few sentences in the movie.Terrible movie and nothing new. There is an after a scene after the credits of an Avengers wanna-be movie apparently led by Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rise of the good Villains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, many critics have been published splitting the community of movie lovers and DC fans in many fractions. So I want to join those appreciated colleagues, who tried to give you an honest feedback of Suicide Squad and its story of really bad guys who can do something good.As neither a DC nor Marvel hardcore fan, nor more than a mainstream comic book reader, I was still as thrilled as many with the promising picture orchestration the various trailers showed us. A new set of remarkable characters in the dark universe of Man of Steel and Co should entertain the wannabe super villain in us, who wants to cheer for the bad but cool guys. The new interpretation of the Joker alone, kept us on the edge of the seat in awaiting the best movie experience ever. Well, here we have the problem?the hype.As always, expectations were tremendously high and people set unreachable hopes into the follow up after a disappointing Batman vs Superman. People expected the Joker to be a main character and a legendary movie to be created. I tell you the truth, if you leave that away, the movie is really good.In a short living action flick, with a really innovative compilation of pictures and soundtrack, the viewer experiences a straight origin story of a team of strange but somehow likable guys. From the famous crazy Joker sidekick Harley Quinn, over the human reptile Killer Croc, to Will Smith as Deadshot, we see a more or less loose newly created team growing together to kick some ? well whatever the henchmen are. Additionally we see guest characters to make the DC universe more believable like the Joker, Batman or the Flash. To be honest, of course the story is fast pacing and not much individual origin story of the main characters is told. Yes the dialogues and story line has gaps, highs and lows and yes I understand that people wanted more of the Joker. BUT if you are open minded, the balance of all the issues with the focus on action, entertainment and fun will turn out as absolutely fine for the level a comic book movie may have. The Joker as side character has much more screen time than in most critics stated, as well as the story does not give so many mistake possibilities as reviewed mostly. For sure, the reason for that is the simplicity behind the movie, which could have a deeper story, as well as not all scene cuts were done very clever. Still the two hours will run by and keep you smiling. Please try to be forgiving for the fact, that maybe Harley Quinns relationship with the Joker is misplaced as too romantic, Deadshot is too focused on his daughter or how could this squad ever stop Superman if each of them can be hold back by five police men with a Taser Gun. As a result you see an awesome summer movie, which my twelve year old me can recommend with peace of conscience.In short, better than reviewed most of the time. Not the best movie or story, but a great spectacle and show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie actually gets most things right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not people... this isn't a Joker or Batman movie. This isn't a thought provoking introspective movie either. It's meant to be a fun movie and possibly be one that introduces new characters to most.Without spoiling things- What the movie gets right: 1. Great introduction to characters with some real good casting choices there. 2. This is supposed to be a frenetic movie with action coming from all angles 3. Actually quite funny 4. Jared Leto's joker is actually really good- an interesting new takeThis part here touches on spoilers- What they got wrong: 1. Having a supernatural enemy here was probably not a great choice. Would have been better to go with a terrorist, or the Joker or... just not this enemy 2. With the point above- too much CGI on the enemy and all the enemy minions. 3. Would have been more fun if they pushed the envelope a bit more on content. Should have made it an R rated action movie. These aren't good guys you knowBut I left the movie satisfied with the fun I was expecting. Harley Quinn and Deadshot are certainly now qualified to be in more DC universe movies.Here's hoping for a Suicide Squad 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Suicide Squad I cracked the code of why DC movies are so hated against Marvel's. PLOT TWISTS!Suicide Squad was, in my opinion, a better movie than Batman vs. Sueprman, but with less interesting characters and an even more ridiculous ending. I liked the directing, the staging, the effects in the fight scenes (something I hated in BvS, looked so unreal) but everything else, I disliked.The characters were believable, but not entertaining. As a fan of comics and these stories I find it so stupid that these people, these people with such average skills who mostly fight with their fists or man made weapons (except for Diablo) go up against an ancient witch (basically a god) AND WIN! That's so stupid in my mind. Where were all those real superheroes when the 'terror attack' began?!But as I was saying.. DC movies totally lack proper plot twist. Suicide Squad is often compared to Batman vs. Superman and I did it too, throughout the whole movie and that's because they both lack proper plot twists! They are so straightforward and it's boring! Marvel at least brought out proper plot twists during the Civil War to keep things interesting, even during the end of the movie. These movies are just.. straight as an arrow. You know exactly what's gonna happen and how it's going to end.Final word on the Joker: I liked Leto's interpretation of him, hated his surroundings and makeup. I just stared at his teeth most of the movie thinking, "That's so not the Joker..". And seriously, night clubs? He seemed like a cliché east-European gangster with the bling bling and everything. Comparing him to Ledger is not fair, but at least Ledger somehow captured the Joker we all know. A wild card, insane. Leto's Joker just seemed way too slick and greasy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad should have been to DC what Deadpool was for Marvel. Settling for a PG rating just did not do any justice at all. Like what Harley Quinn says ... "We are the bad guys that's what we do" and the studio should have just let them do what they do best...baddest ass kicking bad ass.Remember Independence Day? The original one not the crap sequel that recently came out. Remember Hancock, I Robot, I am Legend? Remember that Will Smith? Yeah after a long time we get to see him back in action that we have missed so much. Margot Robbie charms you as Harley Quinn and she is the real 'enchantress' in this movie!Jared Leto was phenomenal playing the Joker. Even with such short screen time and minimal dialogues, he floors you completely with his performance. He was unpredictable, unstable and unbelievable.Otherwise the mediocre action, lame jokes, bland story and silly climax makes the whole movie nothing more than just a fun ride than what it could have been, should have been...in Harley Quinns own words "What a ride!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie despite what critics want to say is a fantastic piece of cinematic feature. I haven't written a review in a long time... So here it goes, I rate this with an 8 because this movie stayed in my opinion to the beginning of Suicide Squad. I never read any Batman comic except for The Killing Joke. Therefore, I have no basis for comparison, but his movie with an open mind was brilliant and enjoyable. It is my belief that people including the critics went into it with a total different perspective and that's why these people are let down. The cinematography and dialogue were on point. It is a one of a class film and I saw it TWICE in theatre. I wanted to prove the critics wrong. So many people I know or don't loved this movie. It's the critics and die hard Marvel fans that are turning this movie to crap. The Joker should have been in it more I will agree but in the end, I believe the crew and cast were just introducing the population to what Suicide Squad is. Reshooting is a bit of a pain, but ultimately the cast was great especially featuring stars like Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Both did an excellent portrayal of the characters. This movie when you see it and you will is meant to be seen as a movie first and foremost. I'm so sick of people bashing good movies just because of critics. Be YOUR own critic. Instead of listening to others. Btw, I'm a die hard Batman fanatic. So when people want to dis the Bat I have to disagree. Seriously, the movie and music are both great. Just give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Oscars here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I'm writing this review is because this movie was set up very well over the first 40 minutes or so, but then took a tumble leaving me disappointed and angry. The back-story for each character near the beginning was the highlight of the movie; in truth they needed more of this. Another positive feature was the choice of songs in the soundtrack. The enchantress was an excellent character until she turned into a less scary, predictable, cliché villain with cheesy lines and a frankly awful side-kick brother. In fact, it was the point she resurrected her brother in the tube station where this movie began its downward spiral. This was epitomised by the predictable plot towards the end - nothing original, we've seen it all before. The attempt at humour by the killer croc was cringe worthy, I honestly can't believe they included it. It's the type of humour we used to enjoy as 10 year old's, which is pointless considering the age rating of 15. This movie needed to be more serious, with a greater fear factor like the cave scene where we meet the enchantress. The producers failed to target the appropriate audience throughout the movie and this is reflected by the poor reviews. Suggestions: 1) why couldn't the enchantress have an even more evil sister (instead of the brother) who she resurrects with detrimental consequences? 2) no cheesy croc jokes. In fact, no croc whatsoever. 3) a smaller army of villains, but scarier and more dangerous. 4) more scenes of the suicide squad being awesome, particularly dead eye - what's the point of including a character with incredible aim if the villains are going to be max 10 metres away? Overall, this is an okay movie but had the potential to be so much more.</fullReview>

Especially Jared Leto as the joker. He's a very skillful actor I must say. But I don't think he fits quite right for the role, or maybe the movie didn't quite give him a chance cause he didn't make it into lots of scenes like others. The movie wasn't that bad overall. It is still entertaining to some point. But the plot is pretty terrible. There are so many loopholes in it and it doesn't really make sense in some scenes. The first few scenes when the movie introduced the characters are interesting but then it went downhill after that. It wasn't what I was expecting when I first saw the trailer.</fullReview>

I think after BVS and Suicide Squad, WB and DC comics should take the stories and directors seriously. DC should not just show immense power from superheroes, fans also want to see intellectuality from their heroes. I think they should hire CHRISTOPHER NOLAN or DEL TORO for their next films(especially Justice League) if they don't want their extended universe to be blown away. All Batman movies from Nolan were rated awesome and the joker created by him was awesome. He got the story in the right direction in the sequels. I would love to see their work.

		<shortDescription>Over-hyped and disappointing mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was my most anticipated movie ever. I watched every trailer and TV spot the day they came out, and read the 1987 and 2014 comic series. Batman: The Animated Series is my TV show. After seeing the reviews, I lowered my expectations, going into the movie wanting to love it. This movie had the potential to become one of the best comic book movies, but it fails miserably in many ways.1)The plot was one giant generic mess. It was a simple and filled with clichés, which is really disappointing considering the idea of a group of criminals forced to go on missions and do good is an incredible base for a great story.2)For a movie full of villains, and where anyone could die at any moment, there was a huge lack of tension. You barely cared for any of the characters, and most of the action consists of the squad fighting against CGI monsters, which loses all of the tension this movie should of had.3)The characters were badly written. None of the characters actually feel like villains, and are more like heroes. Harley Quinn is barely insane, Deadshot is Will Smith, and the rest of the characters are wasted. Katana and Captain Boomerang had nearly no role in the movie. 4)Horrible lighting and CGI. The movie looks like they spent all their money hiring Will Smith, and had no money left for special effects. The majority of the movie is barely lit, which causes a lack of color, which messes with the tone. The CGI is well below average.5)The tone is lost somewhere in between light hearted and dark.6)Too much action. In the movie Batman: Assault on Arkham (which was much better than this) the squad breaks into Arkham Asylum, which is very entertaining, but in Suicide Squad, most of the mission is fighting. The majority of the movie is carried by action, which becomes very boring.7)Dialogue is poorly written. Throughout the movie, most of the things characters say are extremely bland and cliché. The final fight consists of cringe worthy and extremely off dialogue that will keep you asking "What?"8)Many unanswered questions9)Huge lack of character motive10)Editing and pacing is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. It seems like this movie was actually well edited and consisted of full scenes, until Warner Bros. came in and edited it to hell. (Which is actually what happened)There were only two short parts in the movie I actually liked, the only things in this movie that I don't absolutely despise.Overall, this is one huge disappointing mess that is a huge disgrace to the superhero genre. DC fans and casual moviegoers alike deserve better then this.</fullReview>

It was such an awful experience, one of the most irritating movies I have seen in a long time.Movies like Suicide Squad are supposed to be fun entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. Here we have such an uninspired mess of a film, with an awful script which is so inherently unfunny, it hurts. There is not one punchline that delivers, not one dialogue that creates even distant engagement to the story, not one character that makes me even superficially care what happens to them. Even fundamental characteristics like special effects are unimpressive at best, amateurish at worst. And I cannot say that I am in any way impressed by the acting, though the film features many big names. I do not believe it is their fault, though.Today, I have read a review of this movie in a German newspaper which was titled "Better hit your head against the wall for two hours". I cannot say that I disagree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not dark or twisted enough but fun nevertheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In its 3rd outing of the DC Extended Universe, Warner Brothers too, has realized that its true- to-comicbook superheroes are overwhelmingly appreciated only by their ardent fans while the rest of the world continues to bat an eye to the studio's massive efforts. DC's villains have always been the more twisted, psychotic and vile lot that took years for Batman and other masked vigilantes to overcome. Now, in an effort to fight fire with fire, an U.S. Intelligence Officer assembles an unusual team of incarcerated meta-humans who will serve to protect mankind. David Ayer ('Street Kings', 'End of Watch', 'Fury') attempts to make heroes out of villains with an unusual cast of very capable actors with some intriguing overlapping themes that will tie-in with future DC ventures. The Suicide Squad has nothing to lose and that might just be their strength against a paranormal threat to the world.Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) insists that the Government must have a team of meta-humans to fight against forces that have greater powers. Col. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), with his experience in leading black ops teams, heads the squad with a convincing threat to keep them from escaping. Boomerang (Jai Courtney), the snappy Australian has sharp, electric boomerangs and his ruthlessness as his weapons. Killer Croc is best in his element; the dark, damp sewers and holes that others won't venture into. He is also mighty strong. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) remains aloof and concerned about his powers for good reason. He carries the burden of a disturbing past and with enough motivation, can be quite destructive with his fire. Katana (Karen Fukuhara) bears the samurai sword that traps the souls of its victims. While keeping the squad in check, she can wield it to deadly effect. Deadshot (Will Smith) was a solitary hit-man, renowned and feared worldwide for his marksmanship. That was until the Bat caught him. Harley Quinn (Margott Robbie) is the life of the squad with a carefree attitude even in the face of adversity. But the attitude, being jestful, can also be quite unpredictable. She draws her craziness from Mr. J himself whose influence on her has her smitten. One of the other intended recruits, June Moone (Cara Delevingne), is overpowered by the ancient spirit that shared her physical being. The Enchantress suddenly turns against mankind, deeming them responsible for her imprisonment. Waller calls for the Squad who are yet non trusting of each other but must comply with Flag's command. A combat with a large army of monsters, depicts the incredible talent of Deadshot and following his example, the Suicide Squad sets out on the mission to save the world from the giant beacon pointing at the night sky. Suicide Squad has an admittedly banal plot. What keeps it interesting is the chemistry between these villains as they grow to appreciate each other's strengths and their unpredictable natures. Then there is Jared Leto's Joker that commands attention for his distinct but wicked take on the most challenging villain. He is no Heath Ledger but his laugh and cold bloodedness make him quite a sinister Joker. There is a lot of action that gives each of the squad members their moment of glory. Yet the predictable nature of the plot somehow prevents the narrative from being dark or evil. David Ayer had a lot of potential to make a really twisted movie with villains at its core but in the end, they end up being a team of meta-humans who need to save the world. The background score is a lot of fun with several re-tuned classics. The special effects suit the capabilities of the characters in action sequences while the make-up team deserves a special mention for the exemplary work with the Joker, Killer Croc, Enchantress, Diablo and Harley Quinn. The very objective of this Squad is suicidal. By putting themselves on the line, they can get their terms in prison reduced. They have the capability to overcome great odds even when the world views them negatively. Such is the case with DC's films and its enthusiasts will enjoy Suicide Squad more so for its integration with the Extended Universe.7.837 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KIler Croc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I loved almost everything about this movie, there was one character in the film that I didn't like. Well it turns out that Killer Croc was depicted as a stereotypical black male. With his choice of words and what he wanted to have in his cell after the mission was done. This was my least favorite character due to the lack of depth and knowledge. Otherwise the film was really good. I also could have done without the pointless slow motion...that seemed to last about 5 minutes and wasn't needed in the film. But between Headshot, Harley Quinn and the Joker well done, those characters kept the movie interesting and fun to watch. P.s. Director: Not all black people watch BET.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicidal tedium.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me how so much hype and money can be spent to produce something that, in my opinion, is fundamentally tedious.Suicide Squad commits harakiri early in the piece.It opens with glacial speed offering up thick slices of cynically self important, US establishment blather. The bureaucratic puffery is broken up by what I can only describe as bland, formulaic action "spam". Canned action sequences, made more gruesome by utterly uninteresting, often cretinous, characterizations.For me this set the tone for the whole film which limps from uninteresting scene to scene before finally and mercifully expiring, after 123 minutes.To be honest I was not going to wait that long for this thing to put a gun to its own head and walked out half way through. Perhaps the only good thing to come from this experience was to reaffirm my belief that my time is valuable. That includes my free time. My advice, take your entertainment "seriously" and seek out worthwhile films that offer up action but also, at least, a modicum of intelligence, wit and genuine flair. Two out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, its more fun than anything else in the DCEU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this with fairly low expectations, judging by the negative reviews from critics. I walked out feeling that, while not being that bad, and better than Man of Steel (3/10) or Batman vs Superman (2/10), Suicide Squad was flawed at several levels.Firstly, the writing is sub par. There is little development of character prior to the disaster begins that the squad has to stop. Which happens about ten minutes too early. The pacing is awkward and some of the dialogue is, for lack of a better word, cringe worthy (especially Harley Quinn), which was a shame as (despite never reading the books) I really wanted to like the characters.On that note, the characters are (mostly) disappointingly average, or simply annoying. In fact, the characters have been done better before this movie. Deadshot? Discount Deadpool. Diablo? Discount Dr Manhattan. To give credit where its due however, Diablo was the one character I actually liked, as his traits went beyond either "loyal" (Katana) or "aggressive" (Killer Croc). My least favorite is the Boomerang guy, who has practically nothing noteworthy to talk about. Also, half the time Harley was pretty cute and funny, and the other half of the time I was biting my fist in frustration. On the acting side of it, the actors mostly did a decent job, but sometimes Jared Leto was a bit too weird for me to watch easily.To be fair, this is the best DCEU movie so far (saying very little). I mean, its just a bit of dumb fun, at times. But with weird lighting (especially in action scenes) a couple of irritating characters and a weird plot thread I feel this could have been much better. For a good David Ayer movie, go see Fury (7/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great tunes, not so great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my 15 year old daughter to the drive ins to see this movie late last Thursday night. She loves the drive ins, as we get KFC beforehand and have a little picnic in the car and talk about the previews and discuss things about the movie whilst it's playing, things you may find difficult to do in a crowded theatre.THAT was the best part of our night! Beyond having to explain to her that these guys are bad, murdering, thieving arsonists, trying to understand the whole point of assembling a ragtag bunch of 'misfits', with the existence of an upcoming Justice League, I felt like we needed a manual to go along with this movie that should have been given to us along with our tickets. This is a good movie with some fun scenes, some eye opening cameos, as well as an introduction to a new breed of characters that DC will force down our throats. Suicide Squad is an okay entertaining way to spend two hours, it really is, so why the hostility you may be wondering? The reason is because the stakes are so high, we the public have been forced to accept that this is how movies, summer tentpole movies, will be presented to us for the foreseeable future. No longer do we get stand alone movies, studios and film makers are been coerced into believing that this is the only way to make money nowadays, by providing episodic type stories that fit in to a larger universe, with crossovers and cameos galore. So if this is the standard, no studio or director can take issue with those such as myself, who find it insulting to think they we will just fork over our cash, summer after summer, simply based on titles and characters that we have some semblance of. repeat success. Firstly, the movie opens up with an introduction to our characters that we will share this journey with. If we are asked to participate in the movie going experience, then at least we need to like, or at the very least, understand the drivers of this vehicle. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and her relationship with Jared Leto's Joker, were tantalizingly interesting, until we were ripped away from it and placed in a southern Californian prison. Once the team has been put together they are directed to find and kill an evil entity. I wonder how long it took to come up with the premise? The evil entity in question, I am pretty sure was an evil spirit, I think, in the body of Rick Flag's flame, Dr June Moone aka Enchantress. For some reason this all powerful, evil villain, can build gaudy machines upend entire city blocks, yet is incapable of reaching across a table and taking her heart back, which was the whole point to her existence. Plot holes aside, this is basic premise (spoilers and all). They (DC) are clearly trying to emulate their (Marvel) model, without directly admitting it, so my question is, if you're going to steal something, or at the very least copy it, then why not do it properly? In a word, greed. But what DC seem to have forgotten, or downright ignored, is that we CARED about the smart ass billionaire, we felt for the Australian playing a Nordic god and we appreciated the efforts of a man with a bow and arrow as well as a bosomy blonde who can take down creatures 8 times her size. We had gotten to know these characters, on multiple outings, we knew their personalities and we know what their prime motivations were. Marvel load all their bases with precise and interesting base hits. Targeted audiences and most of all stayed true to who the characters were, what made them tick, what made them fanboy favourites for decades. They respected their audience. So when it came time to hit a home run, in steps the batter and knocks it out the park, bringing with it all the other runners with patience and excitement that is the benefit of delivering a slow burn, for a huge pay off. Remember if this is the template now, then at the very least do it properly, and they did! When it was DC's turn at bat, they went for the home run straight away, not giving us anytime to learn and understand these age old superheroes, bought to us in this new light of the 21st century. How would Clark Kent work in an office with all these new technological devices? Does Bruce Wayne really believe that being a vigilante in the 21st century is the best way to fight crime? What are the philosophical differences between the big blue boy scout, and the man in the cowl? DC didn't load their bases first! We never given time to really care about these new hitters, partly because DC never stayed true to their source material, so we were asked to simply accept that Batman kills, the Superman snaps necks and Harley Quinn is just so crazy, cos well, she just is. They may have hit a home run, the box office seems to think so, but fans didn't care, didn't watch and worst of all, are starting to get upset. My problems with the Suicide Squad therefore extend farther than the actual movie, it's more of deep sense of "this is what we've got now, so get used to it". And this pains me as a lover of DC comics, because I know these characters, I've grown up with them, but what I see on the big screen, is not them, I've never met these guys before. But don't think you are going to see characters and story lines that move you, don't go into this thinking that the time and money you've invested in it will pay off, because it won't. Enjoy the tunes, that's what my daughter took away from it, and I agree with her, as I always will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed, enjoyable and at times frustrating guilty pleasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a watchable movie, but it's not the DCEU-redeeming-masterpiece that fans were hoping for. Far from it. It suffers from the same sloppy pacing as Batman v Superman and even WORSE editing, but it's at least nice to look at, when there's no CGI-sh## infesting the otherwise solid performances from Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto's criminally wasted screen-time. David Ayer doesn't know how to tell a linear story, especially not here, but he at least lets some of the 'Squad' members have moments to shine, particularly Harley Quinn and Deadshot.Some of the things in this movie do work, but the potentially great film suffers from an end-of-the-world scenario that has been abused so many times in so many movies now it's not funny. Sky beam? Check. CGI monsters that look out of place within the context of the story? Check. Heroes assembling to take down the 'great threat'? Check. Dumb baddies that wouldn't realistically let down their guard? Check. The final act derails Suicide's Squad's potential to be one of the comic book greats.The good stuff? Well it starts well, and we see Deadshot confront Batman (Ben Affleck) in a flashback, which had potential to be a stronger sub-plot in the film instead of being solely-revisited by Enchantress in the climax. It shows how figures like 'The Bat' affects the lives of the Suicide Squad, at least for Deadshot; his daughter stops him from killing Batman, and that was powerful. I wanted to know more about Will Smith's take on the character and what he was given, he gave a solid performance. Margot Robbie is also 'touched' by Batman in a flashback, and we see throughout the film the relationship she has with The Joker. Sadly, we don't see enough of her "puddin'". I guess the benefit is that we see she is still gorgeous and psychotic without assistance from her boyfriend.I was expecting a film that was drastically different from Batman v Superman, and the only real difference was that it had colour to it, and more dashes of humor here and there. If superhero movies are your jam, this is right up your alley. For those of you who don't like them so much, I'd say skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, DC Comics and Superhero movie genre miss it again. Seriously, i think is time to press the stop button and start to think what kind of entertainment are making. Or is this the proof that they don't give a f*ck about that? Well, maybe they don't at all and that's why they keep doing such crap as this, so they can earn billions of dollars, for the simple fact that you know a lot of kids who grew up with this characters as their heroes will go to theaters and will pay the ticket. But the thing is they are stealing our money. They are selling us movies like if they were some coca-cola can. Movies use to be not only fun, but with a meaningful content that could make you think, and care for the characters and the story-line. Here, that simply does not happen, at any level. It is the same disappointment i felt when i watched Batman vs Superman. I think it is worthless make a review about the plot and seriously it doesn't matter. Waste of time and money. I think I'm going to start reading more books or something, because I'm done with all this foolishness-no-sense movies. I'll give it a 6/10 just for the good actors and the camera work, it was the 2 things i thought were fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Studio meddling and weak script undermine potentially great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall: Suicide Squad opens in a ham fisted and slow manner, which immediately puts the pacing on its back foot. By the time action starts to pick up about half way through, the poorly written and clichéd characters have not given me any reason to be invested in the story and thus not really have any care for the action. It's a shame, because this was a great opportunity for DC to step out from behind Marvel with something unique that had a great pedigree of comic history and talent involved. Instead, this is a mess of uninteresting story lines coupled with a collection of half-baked characters that result in a boring film. 4/10Detailed Breakdown:Story: The biggest issue with this story is that it lacks a cohesive perspective; Deadshot and Harley Quinn are given minimal backstory, with Deadshot being the only one that is given an emotional grounding. That leaves the audience without an anchor point for their involvement in the story, which when coupled with blaise visuals and hackneyed writing, gives the story no characters for us to really care about. Without characters to care about, the story is scattershot and weak, underlining this lack of perspective and robbing the film of any momentum. -3Characters: Overall, the characters do a seemingly alright job at building chemistry and gelling as a team. The real big problem is that this one movie has too much to do, so it tries to force us to feel something for them rather than letting it occur naturally. Will Smith plays Deadshot well, effectively portraying a preternatural assassin and is easily the strongest performance in the movie. However, Jared Leto and Margot Robie's Joker and Harley Quinn are both poorly thought out and weakly portrayed. Jared Leto is not in the film nearly as much as you are led to think, but the time he is in the movie is both annoying and distracting; you never felt any real menace from his performance, no maniacal energy that is a perfect and complete foil for Batman. He feels like every "crazed gangster" character that we've seen in crime movies the last 15 years. But, the real tragedy here is Harley Quinn, which was either written or edited terribly. When she is working with the team, she is constantly reaching for one-liners that are obvious and poorly written and her history doesn't make sense or have any impact on the story. Overall, the characters in this movie are generally one-dimensional and the performances pretty much reflect that. -3Production Design: Pretty bland overall. Costumes are well put together, with Deadshot's costume really standing out as each part of his costume having actual functions. Harley Quinn's gun was also well designed, bringing a certain anarchic grace to the pistol. Other than that, the design was not anything special. 0Music: This soundtrack was distracting and forced. The problem here is not so much the pop score rather the soundtrack is used in lieu of character development, which ultimately comes off as heavy handed. Furthermore, when using a pop soundtrack, there should be a connecting theme beyond the fact its "movie music". There is no connecting theme than trying to hit over the head repeatedly with how cool it's trying to be, which only glaringly points out how it's trying to cover over weak editing and storytelling. -4Misc: With the prevalence of films being adapted from deep mythologies with years of backstory and lore to draw from, it's easy to fall into the trap of "well, it explains it in the book/comic/etc.". A movie needs to tell it's story, completely, within its running time. If the viewer isn't given an emotional anchor because of how the story is told, then the movie failed. Harley Quinn and The Joker have an incredibly rich and deep relationship that spans years of comics and movies. None of that complexity made it to the final film.Movies like this will continue to fail if they rely on external media to do the heavy story telling lifting. While films can, and should, draw inspiration from a myriad of sources, these sources should not be used as shortcuts from what the job of writers and directors: to tell a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I recommend watching "Assault on Arkham" over this, hands down. There were some OK moments in this, but the highest anything in this really got was "pretty good". So what problems did I have with the movie? Well, let's find out.The main problem I had was that I didn't care about the villain. I've never been a fan of supernatural elements in superhero movies. Super powers are OK, but you lose me once you start to introduce alternate dimensions and stuff like that. Judging by the trailer, I thought Joker would be the main villain, which brings me to my next problem. Jared Leto's Joker is interesting. The most important thing about Joker is his unpredictability, not his appearance, not his laugh, not whoever plays him. And they appear to have played up Joker's unpredictability in this. The problem, is that his total combined screen time, is about 7 minutes. Because of this, there's not enough to compare his performance to Nicholson and Ledger's performances. If I were to rate Leto's Joker performance, I'd give it probably 3 out of 5. He definitely made the character his own, which I respect, he didn't just try to copy Ledger or Nicholson. The third and final problem I'll put in this review is a lot of the Suicide Squad members are pretty much pointless. Captain Boomerang only really serves as a reason to have a Flash cameo. Slipknot might as well not be in the movie at all, he only serves to show that the collars from "Battle Royale" work. Diablo is useless for the first half of the movie, and I know he's going through an internal crisis, but you'd think Flag would've killed him for not doing anything before that.The positives of this mostly consist of the characters people actually know. Croc, Joker, Quinn, and Lawton. Batfleck is also a cool cameo, cuz I ain't ever seeing "BvS", so this was my first time seeing him. I like how Batfleck's batsuit looks a lot like the one from "The Dark Knight Returns". While the four characters people know have their moments, none of their performances blew me away. Out of all the characters, Quinn was probably the best one. They got a lot of her personality down, which is enough for the first live-action portrayal of her. Lawton is also portrayed well, and Will Smith was a pretty good choice for him.I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just wait for the superhero movie bubble to either burst or fade away, because none of the other superhero movies that are coming out interest me. If there's a solo Batfleck movie without any crossovers I'll definitely give that a shot (I'm still waiting for a live-action version of "Hush"), but other than that, this'll probably be the last live-action superhero movie I'll see for at least 3 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Villains Movie With Too Much Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for this movie, I was REALLY excited. Joker, Harley Quinn, and a bunch of other DC baddies banding together? How freaking awesome is that?! Plus, Queen music! The final result, to me anyway, was a flawed, but good movie. First, I'll point out the good bits.I think Margot Robbie was EXCELLENT as Harley Quinn. She nailed the accent, as well as her psychotic nature. I could also tell that her love for Joker was genuine, and didn't feel like forced acting. If they really are making a movie on Harley Quinn, I would definitely love to see Robbie reprise her role. And speaking of Joker, I actually really liked Jared Leto's performance. I can acknowledge that his performance wasn't nearly as legendary as Heath Ledger's or Mark Hamill's, but he puts his own twist onto the Joker that makes him stand out in his own unique way. Will Smith was also very good as Deadshot. I was rooting for him, and felt sympathetic for him. He also had a few funny moments. I also really liked Katana. Her backstory on her and her sword were very interesting, and I wanted to learn more about her. As for the humor, there were some funny bits here and there. Most of the humor, for me, came from Croc, Harley Quinn, and Deadshot.As for the bad, well, I guess I'll start with the editing. It was very obvious that scenes were cut out. A lot of the scenes shown in the trailers weren't even in the movie. I was left confused as to why they were cut out, and disappointed. What I was also disappointed about was the lack of Joker. I know he wasn't in the Suicide Squad, but the trailer had me believing that he would play a big role in the film. All he did was drool over Harley, "die" off screen, then show up at the end. Very disappointing. I also wasn't too fond of how Leto spoke as Joker. Most of his dialogue was grunts, or he spoke through his teeth and I wouldn't be able to understand what he said most of the time. Most of the villains aside from Deadshot and Harley Quinn are shoved in the background. They're either there for comedic relief, or just because the comics said they had to be there. I was especially disappointed by Katana not having much use. As I said, she seemed very interesting, but she didn't play a big role. The plot itself seemed predictable, and I was instantly reminded of other movies that had similar plots. The villain wasn't that interesting to me, and I was honestly bored whenever she was on screen.So, while this film had its flaws, I still enjoyed it. I didn't feel like I wasted money on it. Would I watch it again? Probably. Do I think this movie deserves the hate it's been getting? Hell no. I think people hate it, mainly DC fans, because they all were excited by the trailers, and were left disappointed. I know how you all feel, but as I said, this doesn't deserve so much hatred. Besides, the director's cut is sure to have what was cut out from the film, and I bet that'll be worth watching more than the theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No really, that summary wasn't a joke. This suffers the Ghostbusters 2016 problem more than Ghostbusters 2016, at least from what I've seen. If you rate the movie too high, you'll look like an ironic hipster nobody wants to be around. Too low and you look like you hate DC. In the middle? My friend, you'll just look like a "casual viewer", and "your opinion doesn't count". There isn't any kind of leverage. Heck, people are probably getting triggered by this review right now, seeing as I haven't even begun talking about the actual movie AND haven't left a rating.The entire reason I was hyped for this was because it is a movie basically about BATMAN VILLAINS. I love the villains from the Batman series so much I can basically recite them by memory alone. How many that I know are in this movie? 3. 2 of which are obvious. There's The Joker and Harley Quin, but also Killer Croc. Unfortunately, that's all my memory is good for, because I had not heard of Deadshot, Slipknot, or Boomerang before this movie. Nor Enchantress. Or Diablo... oh that's right, my experience with Batman Villains has been entirely based on LEGO Batman 1. Oops. Hey, at least I knew who Killer Croc was right? Also I know who Man-Bat, Killer Moth, and Hush are. I'm willing to bet you don't even know who they are. Either way, I was kinda disappointed there weren't more that I knew.The characters themselves don't do that bad. The actors were nicely picked. Will Smith did a good job as Deadshot. However, the dumber Harley, who was already insane to begin with, was not a good choice. Making her just... what she is in this movie wasn't the best of options for her. Speaking of Harley, The Joker was bad. Not bad in a bad guy way, I mean just not a good actor. It's the same deal with him as it is with Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman, it just wasn't the right casting and portrayal. Except, for this one, he doesn't even need to be in it to begin with.The comedy is kinda weak for a superhero movie. Maybe it's because I saw Iron Man right before this, but not a lot of jokes are worth the effort in this one.The whole "setting up Justice League" thing is forced. Was there really a need to throw in Batman and Flash? They contribute next to nothing to the story, other than get three characters in prison.But still, there are positives. The action was nice, and the characters are pretty memorable.Does it all work? Not really. Am I glad I saw it? Yeah. Would I recommend it? I guess. Is it awful? Nope. But is it good? No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a fun ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am super excited DC is expanding its film universe. In the reverse of Marvel, Suicide Squad starts with a lot of characters in one movie and I hope many more individual movies to follow. In short, the movie does have some short-comings. The villain (Enchantress) is awful and wiggly. There was not enough investment in June's character to make me care about her/Enchantress' outcome. The pacing is off and felt a bit like a giant trailer to me. That being said - I had a great time and really enjoyed it overall. Deadshot and Harley stole the show, but the other characters were well acted and enjoyable. I wish there had been more joker - I really did enjoy Leto's fresh take. I thought Leto balanced the psychological nightmare that is the joker with his comic style that is his true origin. I loved the stylized take and crazy look. I also enjoyed the romantic undertones between him and Harley, although I am aware this is a step away from source material. Harley and Joker definitely deserve a full film to explore their characters and often abusive relationship - this just wasn't the movie for it and they didn't have the time which is OK. The movie was fun and energetic. Also the soundtrack was simply impressive. At the end of the day, this was a fun movie and a great introduction to what I hope are more narrowly focused DC characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, another film without Samuel L. Jackson in it! American film, he could have been in it, he's in almost every film nowadays. And, without Morgan Freeman too. He's also in almost any film. They are not very bad actors but, when you eat the same food every day, you get tired and bored, you want something else. And, they are the same in all their films. OK, we got other actors. Let's analyze them one by one, only those who deserve. Let's start with the best, Jared Leto. I've seen him in other very good films, making cool roles. Here, he's beating a nail in his sole and another one in his head. Margot Robbie, which was not convincing as Jane in "The Legend of Tarzan", demonstrates that has potential, she can play. I can say the same thing about Will Smith, I never liked him in anything. He evolved. Overall, a film for the level of talent of that actress called Cara Delevingne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When compared to the trailers, it's disappointing. When compared to other superhero films, it's average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that "Suicide Squad" (2016) was my most hyped up film of the year, mainly due to my love for the characters, actors, and brilliant marketing. From the first dark and moody trailer to the fun and action packed Bohemian Rhapsody trailer, I knew this film had a lot going for it. To say my expectations were high would be an understatement, and sadly I feared they wouldn't be meet.After seeing the film twice, I have come to terms with how I really feel about it. The best way I can sum up how I felt about this film is by making a list. This is a good, the bad, and the ugly of "Suicide Squad."The Good: "Suicide Squad's" best thing it has going for it both in the trailers and the film is the cast (aside from the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). Margot Robbie completely steals the show as Harley Quinn, and it is so refreshing to see an actress bring to life such an iconic role and do it justice.Viola Davis was the standout in this film as Amanda Waller. Every time she is on the screen she brings a powerful and commanding presence, you can actually see why the Squad takes her seriously.Will Smith's Deadshot of course gets a lot of screen-time, though his performance doesn't feel out of his usual range.Every other character is good to fair, but unfortunately we do not get enough time to really get to know them.The Bad: Sadly, the Joker (Jared Leto) gets very little screen-time in "Suicide Squad," even though he was probably the second most anticipated character next to Margo's Harley Quinn. It is obvious to see that a lot of Leto's scenes were cut out of the film, especially ones that depicted his abusive relationship with Harley. If you were looking forward to finally see a great depiction of the iconic "Mad Love" comic book story, you will sadly be disappointed.It seems that "BVS" being seen as too dark and moody, may have heavily influenced David Ayer and company to get rid of those intense/dark scenes. Sadly, we will never know if that was a good choice to remove them or not.The Ugly: The areas where "Suicide Squad" clearly fails are editing and writing. Sadly, the film is an editing mess. You can tell that Ayer didn't have clear direction for the story he wanted to tell, and if he did, someone else must of have strongly suggested to change his original idea.The film tries to combine several different tones, but sadly it can't quite identify what kind of film it wants to be.The writing is sadly also weak and very typical to many other action films. It has a generic villain (which is kinda hilarious in a film all about them) played by a very weak actress, Cara Delevingne. Her powers mainly involved her "dancing" and when she was possessed by the witch her voice was dubbed over, so if Cara could actually deliver a threatening line we will never know.The humor is also hit or miss. Some lines are funny, while others are just generic. For a film with both Harley Quinn and the Joker you would have expected some better material.In the end, "Suicide Squad" isn't the worst superhero film ever, but it doesn't meet it's hugely possible potential. The film had a ton of material to work with from the outstanding "Mad Love" story to a great core cast and characters. Sadly, it did not take full advantage of these things with the writing, directing, and editing. I truly hope WB/DC gets their act together with "Wonder Woman" (2017) and "Justice League" (2017),especially in the writing/editing department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Live your intelligence outside and submerge yourself in to most fragmented bad dream. Story is primitive and yet complected mush, that live only one question "How many authors had a go writing it? And have they read earlier material?" No, this is not Batman with bad knees, it is next level. Even special effects can not distract you from heavily mutated story.Could be good for very young kids if only not too scary, boring and political. As it is, perfect scary lullaby for young once. But worse of all, random introduction of maverick character, only for making the point that escape is futile. They simply had to take some ones head off, did they? No really, where is this Slipknot came from? Other than from black Van? Even with attempted humour and some good effects it is still 5 out of 10 (stretch really) At least grate cast had nice payment at the end of this embarrassment, but not at my expense. I am asking for a refund.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so disappointing that I think I will just skip the cinema for the upcoming DC movies. The plot was bad with so many clichés, I constantly rolled my eyes with every "we are bad guys" line. Also, I couldn't stand to hear another "puddin". The dialogue was poorly written or interpreted and the few moments that were supposed to be "funny" were just hard to watch and hear because of the lack of originality (I am talking about the "delete my browser history" joke) or the infelicitous chosen moment. This supposed to be an antihero movie, chaotic, unpredictable but it fell into disgrace; by the middle of the movie it transformed into a very superhero movie without making any sense. I still have no idea why Deadshot or Harley Quinn decided to save the world out of good heart denying everything that they are and represent. I gave it a 5 out of 10 because I really liked Margot Robbie performance, she looked amazing and she played her role flawlessly. She was the single factor that kept me from exiting the movie theater.</fullReview>

If there would be a part 2 of this movie, i would recommend the director to focus more on the joker and Harley give them the main role and let the movie be psychotic and funny without the interference of the batman! its time to see villains win at the end!! would be an epic twist!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi all, i am big fan of DC universe. I was very much excited to see Will smith as Dead shot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn,but in-spite of its big cast's, the movie seems to be boring and less entertaining. It was hard for me to stay focused till the end. If the screenplay and story could be much more in depth then the movie would had been a better bet. The BGM seems to be not with the movie. We audience and fans come for a DC movie to see action and some cool stuffs like gadgets, armors and lot of action, looks like the director got everything wrong here. The animation movie on Batman's suicide squad was far better and had everything that needed to be a movie. Hope DC starts doing better movies on big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but let down by weakeness of script and characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this with no expectations good or bad. It is worth a watch, I found it entertaining. However, I came away with a sense that this could (and should) have been so much better. If you like the genre you can turn a blind eye to many short comings but this film felt half made. The plot so banal that it was probably written on the back of an envelope while taking a dump. In short : Government fears another 'Superman' may not be a good guy (didn't actually explain what happened to Superman).So create team of criminals with superpowers (or no superpowers) ready to fight any super baddies. To make sure they behave insert explosive device in neck that can be remotely detonated. One of team is possessed by 'enchantress' a thousands of year old being with unknown powers. She manages to get away and co- incidentally finds long lost fellow brother being. Together they begin to create mayhem. Criminal team sent in and beat bad guys then go back to prison. What i liked : Will Smnith as 'Deadshot' and Margot Robbie as 'Harly Quinn' both stood out in their roles Jared Leto as 'Joker' also (but not quite) with a similar portrayal to heath ledger except the character seemed under used. What I did not particularly like: The other characters were pretty much un-inspiring to the point of boring. Cara Delevingne I found particularly annoying and illustrated that 'eye candy' is not a substitute for an actor. Viola Davis as 'Amanda Waller' didn't come across as tough/ruthless.All in all, a few good characters and a crowd of boring ones, looking for a plot. Entertaining but unsatisfying 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a film about a group of villains forced to work for the government on suicide mission hence, the name "SUICIDE SQUAD" a.k.a. Task Force X. And these are group of actual villains---not outlaws or some anti-hero---that came from the rouges gallery of some superheroes like Batman and Flash. Among these "villains", the standout performance is Deadshot played by Will Smith. Watching the trailer, I was worried that he would not do the character justice. But Will Smith's Will Smith. Margot Robbie is as good as you expect her to be as Harley even without the quirky Harley voice from the cartoons and video games. She's a good and beautiful actress, so no worries there. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller is powerful and scary--in a good way, that is. And as for Mister J: well, he has a few scenes and Jared Leto's Joker is scary and very unpredictable. Imagine having a friend treating you to a diner and the next thing he'll do is hit your head with the plate just for laughs. That's how this Joker is. But this Joker is more comic book-y than the previous incarnations. And I'm very interested on how this Joker would go toe-to-toe with Ben Affleck's bad-ass Batman. As for the plot, it's a little predictable. You know, generic super villains with generic henchmen that pose no threat at all but it does not bother me that much. The problem is the characters or how they are given importance. Some are very important, some are just there and others are just disposable. The studio should that this is the first live- action incarnation of these characters on film. Yes, you may know Captain Boomerang as villain of Flash and Killer Croc as Batman's villain but do you know who the eff is Slipknot or Katana? But seeing as they are part of Task Force X, anybody could die any minute but it is still no excuse to not give these character importance. So, is it watchable? Yes. Very. Soundtrack alone is worth the admission. This is the third film in the DCEU following Man of Steel and BvS and is the most lighthearted in terms of tone amongst the three. Humors are spot on on this film. This film is a small step expanding the DC universe where Batman and Superman exist but it could have been a great leap. As for a DC comic reader, watching these characters on the big screen is a real treat and so many easter eggs. It may have a generic and predictable plot but it is still good and even better and awesome soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being one of the most anticipated movie of the year, David Ayer's Suicide Squad was unable to fulfill the expectations of the audience. It is important to notice that while all the usual elements of a superhero flick are present, this is a somewhat different kind of a superhero film. It consists of the villains we love from DC Universe, doing atrocious things all in the name of good. In the first half of the movie it looks quite promising but in second half storytelling becomes slow and it starts loosing connection with the audience.Oscar nominee actor Will Smith leads the squad and fully justifies the character of the unerring assassin, Deadshot. Margot Robbie is terrific as the giggly devious maniac Harley Quinn, earning the movie's best lines and nailing almost every one of them. The movie has a little feminist tone as all female characters are shown strong, confident and given kick-ass lines, thus breaking the usual stereotypes about women. The Oscar winning actor Jared Leto's Joker has less than 10 minutes of screen time. Though Jared Leto brought a new perspective to the Joker, his performance couldn't reach the bar set by Heath Ledger's legendary Joker in DC's Dark Knight.In my opinion, the best kind of visual effects are the ones where we can't separate effects from reality and Suicide Squad gets full marks in this department. The fighting scenes were amazingly shot, the camera angles of each stunt were stunning and chosen very appropriately. Amazing work was done in Cinematography and some scenes were so exquisitely shot that it gave me Goosebumps, like the scene of Enchantress taking control over Dr June Moon.Overall the dialogues and fight scenes were great while the plot was quite weak. Still the story was saved by the awesome performance delivered by Margot Robbie and Will Smith .If you don't like Action and Superhero movies then this is definitely not for you. For all the DC comic lovers this exciting entertainer is a must watch.</fullReview>

So care to elaborate a bit about this flammable superhero. A guy who able to shoot fire and transform into fire devil got all insecure about explosive device planted on his neck? and why he died once again? 4. We have Captain Boomerang, and apparently they pick Croc who thrown the bomb at the end? Manage that thing out. 5. Enchantress planned to act her things on predictable place. Midland..

		<fullReview>So DC Comics is desperately trying to catch up to Marvel's cinematic success after Batman vs. Superman's poor reviews and relatively poor revenue. Yet, I can't help but tell they didn't try very hard. I almost wish I had seen a rerun of 'The Scorpion King' instead, there was more tension and apprehension of evil forces there than in this movie that really only starts to get interesting around 51st minute (way to long after everyone's finished their drinks and popcorn)Up until then time has been wasted explaining the concept of the Suicide Squad without creating much soul to any the characters, except military-man Joel Kinnaman who gets more of a back-story than many members of the squad and still stands flat as a character (and actor) as his only trait apart from being a military-man is caring for June, who we also know nothing about except that she's possessed by an evil witch.Will Smith has played a string of heroes by now and this seems like his "back-in-the-game" flick where he just needs popcorn-time at the movies, USD;s in his pocket and doesn't care much about a good script. Even Academy-awarded Jared Leto's performance is overwhelmed by heavy make-up and fake silver-teeth and doesn't deliver a single one-liner worth remembering. Boo script-writers! Consequently iconic and usually deeply unsettling villain Joker is most remembered for... a long, almost avian-like laughter that re-appears a couple of times throughout the movie.So there is 1 character that keeps us wanting more, that delivers punch-lines and keeps the pace up. Little miss Harley Quinn is the hero of the villains or unwilling heroes, and displays a wider range of emotions throughout the movie than anyone else (tight-lipped Will Smith, open-jaw Joker or the British accent-wielding Enchantress)Lord knows how many would have fallen asleep in the theater if we didn't have actress Margot Robbie to bring life to Harley and to this dark and sad story. Yes dark and sad, not dark and exciting like director Christopher Nolan's captivating Batman-trilogy that reinvigorated DC's darkest hero after the 1997 unintentional seppuku (Japanese term for ritual suicide) of 'Batman &amp; Robin'.Even in the 114th minutes, after 68,3% of the film, we're getting backstory to one of the characters. Really? Smell a sequel anyone? One I'm not looking forward to.Hero of the movie: Actress Margot Robbie Villain of the movie: Writer &amp; director David Ayer Moment of Truth: In the final action build-up 6000-something years old witch Enchantress does a little arrhythmic dance to cast blue lightning and a few minutes later Deadshot screams "You are evil!" at her, to clarify the situation I presume... Hot tip: Watch 'Deadpool' again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to this films release since watching the first trailer. For over 6 months the expectation and excitement built up. The trailers were looking good, and after the success of Chris Nolan's Batman Films, Marvels Avenger and their tie ins, The majority of the X-men and a few of the spider-man films...expectations were high. Surely this film will continue the trend? In a word...No.I came out the cinema completely disappointed. I've waited a few days to write this review...I thought maybe I was just expecting too much and no matter how good the film was, it was never going to live up to my expectations. What I've come to realize is that the longer I've had to think about it, the worse its become. Plot = Poor could have been written by a 15 year old work experience kid. You'll have your own questions regarding plot but I'm still trying to figure out why a 'suicide squad' needed putting together when they had Batman, The flash etc to round them up in the first place. The main characters back stories are either unexplained, weak or extremely clichéd. Script / acting = Poor Even the charisma of Will Smith couldn't bring this script to life. few one liners will make you smile - mainly from Margot Robbie. again, predictable and clichéd. Soundtrack / sound = Poor Why they needed a song over every main scene in the movie I'm not sure - maybe to cover the fact there wasn't enough happening in the script or visually. became annoyingCharacters = poorOverall you feel very little connection, empathy or emotion for any of these characters. Deadshot - you know its bad when Will Smith cant even inject some charisma into a character. He dodged a bullet with independence day 2...and ran straight into a huge suicide squad shaped one. one of, if not the least memorable performance he's ever done.Harley - The shining light of the film. Robbie Nails it. She has all the one liners, all the charisma. Plays crazy pretty convincinglyThe Joker - About as scary / menacing as a trifle. Leto manages to get it all wrong where Heath Ledger got it all right. Batman - Ben Affleck is not a Batman. never has been. never will be. Temptress - poor performance from her, not helped by the fact the character she was playing was probably the worst 'bad guy' in marvel / DC history. Her faceless 'army' lacked any personality / threat. The rest - Boomerang, Diablo, katana, Flagg, and any others I have failed to mention (as they were totally unforgettable) were totally and utterly pointless additions in the film. Overall... unless you walk into the cinema with really low expectations, you will be disappointed. DC seriously need to get their **** together as this was a million miles away from the best Marvel have on offer. The recent superman films have been tragic, Wonder women looks like a car crash waiting to happens and don't get me started on aqua-man. Bang Average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a die-hard super hero fan, so when I got invited to watch this movie I had no expectations of it. I wasn't expecting it to be very good or very bad. And that's kind of where it was for me, somewhere in the middle. If I had watched only the first 35 minutes of the movie, I would have left with a much better review of it. I thought that the characters were awesome. They were funny, quirky, strange, tough, and unique. And for me that was just about all I got out of the movie; the characters. The plot line was not interesting, not original, and no one who enjoyed the movie is out there saying "oh wow that story was awesome." But again, the movie did a good job introducing us to these comic characters.*Spoiler* Not really but whatever From a technical standpoint it seems as though they tried really really hard to make this movie, and then got tired at some point and said who cares, lets wrap it up as is, people will watch it anyways. There was a scene where the squad is in a helicopter and it gets shot and the way it came down was done well; at first it slowly circled around in flames, then crashed and tumbled its way to a stop. Moments later when the boss lady, Amanda Waller is in a helicopter that gets shot the same way in the same place, the way it came down was a weird animated super fast need-for-speed video game looking metal crash and slide. It was very weird and threw me off.Again, the characters were cool, story......not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting and fun movie but has its own problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When can DC films smash Marvels' has been a question asked for a long time, and I've put much anticipation in the summer blockbuster Suicide Squad. Overall the movie is fun and easy to watch, actions scenes were fabulous, yet there are some problems that outweigh the goods.The music in the film is one of the greatest things. The soundtracks were totally awesome, especially the iconic "Purple Lamborghini", "Heathens", "Gangsta" etc. Also the original music score conducted by Steven Price works surprisingly well with the soundtrack. The timing of each track was perfect. They suit each characters and each scene, stirring up audience's excitement and anticipation of what will happen next.The characters were another awesome part of the film. Although having many characters to introduce, I reckon the film had done a good job to help the audience who are not familiar with these comic characters, and each character was full of live and emotions. These "super villains" background stories were mind-blowing, and the humanisation of them had made the audience (at least me) able to relate to them more. However, same characters' appearance had raised questions. Does Joker really need to be in this film? I understand that it is necessary to have Mr. J in order to introduce Harley, but the scene of him were just not enough, making him looked just like a random, unimportant guy. More Joker or no Joker please. It is really excited to see the Flash in Suicide Squad especially that his is going to be in the future DC films, but it is really confusing for those who are not familiar to DC universe, and pose the question if he is really necessary to be there. And I personally think that characters in Suicide Squad need more time for their background stories and more time to explain why and how the Task Force X is resembled, and it will be better if Suicide Squad is made as a TV series.The edit and too many cut scenes were the parts that made the film less impressive. The plot was simple and easy to follow. Join the task force, rescue target defeat the bad guy or you will die. But the edit is just so jumpy, cutting the flow of the story. And about the cut scenes, I understand that the director must had them cut for a reason, but even before reading about the articles about them I can still see that there are something missing. The worst part is the villain, or villains. The reason for them to turn into villains was just ridiculous! You wanna destroy the world just because people don't worship you anymore? Think about those sad, puny gods in the Nightside Series! (by Simon Green btw), and what spell (or machine) you're creating to destroy the world? The film just skips it without any explanation. Also, please if you have super power, why don't you just use it? Why you need to fight with freaking swords? What I can't stand the most is that she stands there for the whole time and move like a seaweed, what happen to that?!Anyways, Suicide Squad was an entertaining and fun film to watch. Some parts need more improvement, and really hope to see those cut scenes in the extended version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really excited for this movie. What do I have to say i after i saw this movie? Pros:I really liked the acting in this. Everyone did a fantastic job. Margot did a phenomenal job as Harley Quinn. There were a lot of touching scenes with Deathshot, Harley,El Diablo.I thought they worked well.I loved Harley Quinn in this movie. She might be a crazy person but i like that there is a bit of humanity in this character. She was really funny. I also liked some of her flashbacks. Deathshot was also really good, his relationship with his daughter is good and his character development is good.El Diablo at the beginning was not that interesting but in the 3rd act i really liked his character.Viola Davis's character was great! This movie had a lot of heartI liked Jared's interpretation of the joker. I liked that he tried to be his own version of the Joker.Some action scenes were okay.The soundtrack is really good.The comedy is handled wellCons: This movie has a problem with it's writing. It feels like 3 movies in one. I am not gonna mention what types of movies I will spoil this movie. This movie was really rushed. The movie also didn't develop the villain's motivation, it just happens,the movie expects you to understand the villain's motivation.A lot of characters are not developed. I really liked Katana's design and how she was fighting but i wanted to see more of her. She didn't had any character development what so ever. There was no reason for her to be in the movie. Captain Boomerang felt he was also useless. Killer Croc is also useless, he doesn't even have a line, he has one at least.The editing of this movie was really sloppy and choppy. It was really distracting. And the songs they putted didn't fit some scenes in the movie.The action was poorly handled, it's like someone in the editing room didn't know how to edit. The Joker is barely in this movie. I literally forgot that he was even in this movie.Every scene with the Joker that you have seen from the trailers. The beginning was good but it was really exposition heavy and i thought that the introduction of the characters was way too long.Overall i thought the movie was okay. If you want to see go watch you might have a different viewing experience but i suggest you to wait for the DVD or Blu ray release</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC trying to go too fast for big team blockbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of DC Comics so I am familiar with some of the characters. I found this story was too muddled. The premise for the main action was not great. Lots of goofs in terms of what the characters can do physically. It is not possible to parachute in several characters and then have a big slug-fest and expect your audience to sympathise with each character.Build the characters as part of the story. Show what they can do and why they are as they are as you go. Then go on to have the confrontation. DC need to build a proper story arc. They need to lay off having every villain seem to be a mad scientist or thwarted Demigod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The build up to this movie was very good to see, it had me and all my friends very excited to see it, however the anticipation left us with a bad taste in our mouths once the movie was over. The story was very poorly written, you felt lost from time to time trying to keep up with what was happening. The characters were OK but harley quinn was pushed as being sexy rather then actually so concentrating on the character which they should have concentrated on. The action was OK but again was rushed and the climax to the movie was not good enough for a film that built it up so much All in all it was OK but people that go in with a open mind like me will feel it was nothing special, people with high anticipation for the film will feel very let down</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert Puddins****** Finally, after waiting so long DCs answer to the Guardians of the Galaxy is here. The trailers more than built up hype surrounding these 'lesser known' DC characters and with our first REAL live action Harley Quinn and the promise of The Joker and Batman added to the mix it made the possibility of this movie being a hit a sure thing.However after seeing the movie it seems like the hype was just that, hype. Sadly the trailer and soundtrack may have been the best parts of the movie.I think that's why I'm having trouble writing this, I wanted so badly and was so sure this movie would be good, I felt bad when halfway though it I realized I was bored and didn't really care anymore.Right from the first scene we're thrown into the story and as you would expect with a large cast, some of the characters don't get a good enough back story for you to really care about them. I understand they are bad guys but still, shouldn't I be given a good reason to root for them seeing as how they are the 'hero' of the film.You can tell that Deadshot and Harley are the main characters, Enchantress is supposed to be one too, but the way her story is told so quickly you find it really hard to care about what happens to her . Killer Crock and El Diablo are just there, plain and simple, their back stories are not explored enough and they provide nothing to further the plot, they are just THERE.The scenes were cut weird, at times it seemed less of a movie and more of a wild dream sequence and some things just plain didn't make sense. Like the plot. This had to have been the dumbest reasoning to bring these villains together, THERE WAS NO REASON FOR IT. A military unit or some of the super heroes around could have taken care of this much easier, why go to all this trouble? It seriously seemed like the wrote the action parts, forgot to put a plot in and threw together something assuming no one would really notice because you'd be too busy looking at Harleys butt every 10 minutes.A few things got to me so if you would allow me to vent for a moment:1.Harley was unneeded; all she was there for really was to tie the Joker into the movie and for sex appeal. THAT'S ALL. The movie would have gone on without her and you know it.2.So they are all standing there right beside Deadshot who has an unlimited amount of guns and ammo to just shoot at these targets and NO ONE is wearing hearing protection? Seriously? 3.Speaking of Harley, I've never seen so many ass shots of a superhero since Clooney in the bat suit. I mean really, she must drop a lot of stuff because she was CONSTANTLY bent over it seemed.4.The Joker: Leto was OK in the role; I look forward to seeing him more. But in this movie he was pointless, other than to show how Harley became the way she is; he was reduced to "Hey everyone, remember me? I'm still here. OK enjoy the movie." Not quite the presence Ledger was.5.The war room scene. "What if Superman turned bad? We would need to defeat him." With a sharp shooter, a crocodile, a dude that throws boomerangs and a lady clown? Really? THAT is the best you can come up with to stop Superman even though in Batman V Superman you were introduced to Kryptonite? Waller really should have gone back to the drawing board.6.Who ever played Flag and Deadshots daughter were TERRIBLE. I mean they were worse than the new characters in Independence Day Resurgence. It was painful to watch any scene they were in.7.So they give everyone their gear back and Harley has her cell phone in it. Provided we don't know how long she's been in there, but how is her phone still fully charged? Plus the guards had to have known what was in those boxes, how did she not think that Waller had the thing bugged or traced? 8.If Flag had a thing with the Enchantress why would they send him to kill her? He would emotionally compromise the mission. I mean come on; didn't they watch the 2009 Star Trek?9.Flag was a really bad leader; "Deadshot don't do the thing" Deadshot does the thing. "Stay in line or I'll kill you." They don't stay in line. "We're going there to stop this." They don't go there. He must have learned his leadership skills from the same place he learned to act.10.If it was THAT easy for the Joker to just break into the 'Maximum security cell' then it begs to differ that it was probably just as easy to break out.There were more but I assume you get the picture.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying to NOT go see the movie. It's your typical final summer blow out of a movie, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But if you were looking for something along the lines of what Marvel is putting out nowadays, don't hold your breath.In the end, the Suicide Squads greatest success and failure is its trailer. It was good enough to give all of us hope that THIS would be the movie that finally shut all the haters up and finally give Marvel a run for their money. But it didn't even come close.I have a brilliant idea DC. How about you stop trying so badly to have what Marvel has and just be you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first DC Universe film to hit mediocre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Suicide Squad' has arrived after much hype and that hype should have been something of a warning sign. It is by far the best comic book movie this summer but that isn't saying much as I hated 'Batman V. Superman' and 'Captain America Civil War'. I have the standard complaints. It is a movie that shows tremendous signs of 'Avengers' envy and as such it has a lot of the crippling faults facing pretty much all comic book movies. The good news is that sprinkled within 'Suicide Squad's comic book monotony are some inspired characters and build ups. It allows 'Suicide Squad' to hit mediocre to okay. That is a feat 'Batman v. Superman' really couldn't do in it's wildest dreams.I feel as if I have to explore the faults because they are numerous. 'Suicide Squad' is way too crowded a movie especially since we are being introduced to all these characters for the first time. Some of these characters receive no lines at all. The film should have reduced it's main cast to four. It might have saved it's coherence. They can't even fit in proper introductions for everyone. Katana's character just jumps in before the flight to the war zone. This is putting selling toys and sequels ahead of creating a fully realized story this time around.'Suicide Squad' is also visually uninteresting as it tries to continue the dark supposedly gritty color palette of 'Batman v. Superman'. You can be dark without literally being dark.The beginning exposition though is absolutely fantastic. Viola Davis gives the best performance in a comic book film in years. Amanda Waller is more interesting than Harley Quinn or the Joker. Honestly the movie would have been far more biting had the entire thing cast her as the main character putting the team together. Once the action starts it gets repetitive. I hate endless faceless armies in these films and that unfortunately is what the majority of 'Suicide Squad' ends up being. (Also Jared Leto is awful in it. He's doing an over-the-top Heath Ledger.)I'd mildly recommend it for comic book completists. If you don't like comic book movies I'd say stay away. It won't do anything for you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, the movie isn't as bad as what some critics make it out to be....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not saying that the movie was a masterpiece or anything. If anything, it was a mindless popcorn thriller with barely any character development and just thrills all the way.I have to say that the movie really should have given moments for each and every one of the cast to shine. But, they didn't. The focus is all on Harley Quinn( I am not saying that Margot Robbie was bad or anything in her role) and characters like Katanna and Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang barely have any lines in this movie.And, don't even get me started on the horrible mess of its plot. Enchantress was a terrible villain and her motivation for trying to conquer the world is hardly ever explained. And we have to admit that she was a pretty crappy villain. She spent most of her screen time trying to build some crappy machine while she let her brother do all of the work.But, those things aside, the first twenty minutes of the movie where they introduce the characters are stylish and cool. It might have been exposition-heavy, but it sure was fun to watch. And I was always somewhat entertained throughout the whole movie. Though, without Margot Robbie's performance, I would probably give this movie a 4 and a half stars. She definitely nailed the role. And she was one of the highlights of the movie.Overall, it is a mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have worked better as a Sequel...Maybe to a standalone Batman film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I want to start by asking why did Ayer have a small moment of appreciation for Snyder, by having a giant smily face for 2 secs...Thanks for reminding us that Snyder still has DC Comic movies by the "balls"... The good parts : Harley: overall justice has been done to the character by the actress Katana: Interesting addition and well played ElDiablo: I always enjoy watching Jay H. as he is a pretty good actor. The OK parts: Joker:Comparing any Jokers or "J"s to Ledgers is not fun anymore, as nobody will bring the same level of intensity and non-chalant-ness to CHAOS as he did. But Leto's J is interesting, different and weird in a comic way. I didn't get much violence out of him except that he robs and shoots...but jumping into Acid.....again...if this was a Batman film where we see that J is super in love with Harley...we would appreciate Leto's sadness and overall depressive state in this movie more..than we did... THE BAD::::: Why open with 2 main characters, then give us the credits and then tell us the story....only to then go back and tell us more about the other Squad members? So if Enchantress was so bad and evil and pretty powerful...why just have her hang around as a human...And if June Moone(seriously??) hates being Ench. so much...how can she wake up one moment and want to say it...? Ench. could leave the room and go to Iran...but she couldn't leave the room and go to Amanda to pick her "heart" up... And her brother seems pretty cool too...wouldn't you want to warn everyone involved to watch out for scary brothers...and probably not keep his doll in a small room hanging out on his own... This is one of the few movies that reveal the villain in the 1st 10 minutes of the film. OK ...with Fant4, we all know that Doom is coming... And this film is the 2nd most recent superhero movie that cheats the fans by picking a villain from the list of already present people. Last one was Avengers and made Loki the bad guy... Will Smith: He still acts like a stick and has either very emotional moments with watering eyes...or dumb way of delivering the already bad Dr.Phil jokes.. Who shot at the helicopter that brought them down into the city... Why bring slingshot only to get rid of him after 5 minutes? The first part of the movie is about MetaHumans...but Harley, DShot,Boomer and sling are not meta...just human... Ench. EVIL DANCE during the whole last scene...why did she look like she needed to PEE? And yes...going back to the start..This movie would have worked better and make so much more sense if it were a sequel to a Batman movie...or SSquad 1....Instead of watching rushed flashbacks, rushed action scenes and no real set up as the set up was already ruined by ComicCon trailer...Perhaps David Ayers talent was shown in the my favorite part of the film...ElDiablo.. as Ayer is best at capturing the ghetto and gangster characters in all of his films...he did it again here...but the rest of the film...not so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUICIDE SQUAD RANT. SPOILERS!!! I am a huge fan of DC comics. I grew up reading the comic books, and batman is my all time favorite superhero so I have a special fondness for these characters. Its a shame they were wasted in this "movie". None of the characters had any development or arc besides deadshot, who's entire character was a tired trope we have seen a million times before (bad man has daughter so he tries to be good for her) and el diablo who's "we're a family" speech at the end feels so rushed and unearned it was more humorous than heartfelt. The rest were just explained to us cliffs notes style by the narrarat- I mean Amanda Waller (i.e. "this person is like a crocodile who eats people, this person was an archaeologist who's became possessed, etc"). Harley Quinn was perhaps the biggest waste. Her character is a useless member of the squad who has no special powers or traits besides being the jokers girlfriend (which makes her more of a liability than anything else). The appeal of her character is witnessing how the joker can influence a seemingly normal psychologist into becoming a psychopath, and then seeing how she realizes how poorly he has been treating her and her rebellion against him. This film completely skips over the first transformation (the first flashback is her agreeing to get the joker a gun in prison) and never reaches the second, providing us with a character that 1. contributes nothing to the group and 2. never develops. It is so painfully obvious how DC wants spinoffs and sequels to explore things that should never have been left out of this movie. The actual "SQUAD" never actually interact until about halfway through the film so when they do, the chemistry is half baked and unearned. The joker is not a memorable presence, and seems less like the criminal mastermind that he should be and more like a slightly quirky gangster. (Also if batman is murdering people now, why is the joker still alive? and how has he not been caught yet when he spends his time in nightclubs and parading himself around the city? C'mon Batman!). The villain is underdeveloped and generic (blue beam shooting into the sky, faceless minions for the heroes to kill, weak motivations). Also, if her plan was to release her brother and take over the world, why would she not do it while she was at the temple immediately after possessing dr. Moon? Other quick thoughts: 1. can we have an Asian action hero who isn't a samurai or ninja for once? 2. the first 2 action scenes in the city are nearly identical (creatures attack, flagg is grabbed by the creatures, squad shoots them, el diablo sulks in the corner. 3. why put a deep pool in killer crocs cell that he can hide in and attack you from? 4. where were the flash, batman, or wonder woman when an entire city was being destroyed? we know they are active during this time period and even make some brief cameos but never show up to help during the world ending catastrophe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Visuals Cannot Atone for Lackluster Storyline and Plot Holes Galore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before reading this, know that I was incredibly hyped to see this and am a completely unbiased lover of both DC/Marvel and I won't be making any comparisons to the latter as that's completely unnecessary. This was a movie I was more excited to see than I was even BvS or Civil War. That says a lot for the marketing of the film.Let me start by saying that the only characters I ended up actually caring about were Harley Quinn and Deadshot. The origins were a convoluted mess of cut scenes and probably would've better played out in order than an array of flashbacks. I put aside the poor editing as everything was still contained but from the flashbacks I now wish that they would've done an origin movie on either or both Harley and how she and the Joker fell in love, or Deadshot and how he came to become the hit-man for hire before ultimately being captured by Batman. The rest of the squad honestly can be surmised relatively quickly in flashbacks and that's fine.That aside, the movie starts off well but quickly begins to decline as the introduction of all these characters begins to drag. One error I noted immediately was how neither Slipknot nor Katana were mentioned in the briefing at the beginning and, if we're being true to reality, they should've been, but somehow they just...show up. Perhaps that was part of the re-shoots so I'll assume their inclusion was something added later on. So what right?Plot holes all begin with Enchantress and whatever the heck that "machine" is that she's building, which is basically just a lightning bolt with debris and crushed cars rotating around it, which conveniently takes the entire amount of time for the Suicide Squad to A) reach Waller and B) reach her. If Enchantress could teleport everywhere in a flash, such as when she retrieved that "impossible to get" book of military strategies, why didn't she just teleport to Waller, grab her with her newfound power granted her via her brother, and then just plug her into said "machine" for info and then just teleport to each of these places and lay bombs and blow them all simultaneously? Maybe that's stretching the realm of possibility but I don't think it would've taken her as long as it did to build said machine, etc.Next plot hole, if Waller was going to call a chopper...why did she need the squad to come retrieve her? That part made absolutely no sense. Why didn't Waller have the other clay doll containing Enchantress's brother locked away in the same box instead of, idk, in the top of her closet?! The bar scene was atrociously lame. Somehow, we went from drinking and realizing the world's going to end to hearing Diablo's sob story of how he killed his wife and kids. It was endearingly heartbreaking moment for his character but the lead-in was weirdly played out. Then we turn to Harley, whom I've never so much as thought to have a serious moment save for before when she was a psychiatrist, suddenly tell him to "own that sh*t." It fell very oddly upon my ears and came across more cheesy than anything.The cheesy lines don't end there. Being from the south and hearing Flagg, I kept wondering what exact region in the south he was supposed to be from? Accents aside, Flagg had his fair share of cheesy dialogue, but perhaps cheesier and more unexplainable was how Diablo, after only a few hours with this group, suddenly considers them family. Enchantress says things like "You don't have the balls!" which is a bit weird coming from an ancient all powerful god-like witch.More plot holes: how the heck is a God defeated by a bomb? And how did they know that that would work when Diablo already has his fiery hand, not only inside his chest, but actually burning his face, wasn't stopping him? How is he not immortal when Katana chops off his hand and it grows back but somehow a bomb takes him out? It didn't add up. The machine Enchantress created is somehow stopped by a pack of stick dynamite ignited by Deadshot? Why didn't she teleport and grab the pack? How did Harley know to throw a gun to Deadshot when he screamed her name? Was Killer Croc's only purpose to throw said bag of dynamite when Flagg easily could've done the same? What purpose did Captain Boomerang even serve? He seemed all but expendable in the grand scheme of things. At least Deadshot can replace half of Flagg's army.I feel I have to see more of Leto's Joker to really formulate a true opinion of him but I liked him from what I saw. I think Ledger's Joker is a better approach on a more sociopathic Joker but Leto's could be truer to the psychotic, crazy, and fun side of Joker. I need more. Batman appearing in the film was pretty awesome. Affleck has given a very true to comic version of the Dark Knight and I couldn't be happier with his performance. I really want to see more scenes between his Batman and Leto's Joker. The ending and the mid- credits scenes were great.It wasn't the worst film in the world, but there are just so many unanswered questions and the fact is, it had so much potential to be BETTER. It came across very sloppy and jumbled but Deadshot and Harley were very fun to watch and actually made me miss Saturday morning cartoons. I do hope DC gets on track and starts making coherent films that flow better. This was the most fun out of the DCEU thus far for sure, but please just take care of the little things and get this train moving. I don't want this to be a preview of what we have to look forward to from Justice League.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was disappointing how much this turned into a superhero movie. Yes, it's in a superhero setting, but the plot felt way, way too much like a standard superhero movie. Now that doesn't make it bad, but it was advertised as something that was more like a satire of a superhero movie. As soon as I saw the lightning bolt going into the sky, I thought "Oh, not another one of those movies." The same shot and plot basis has already been in three major action movies of the last five years: Man of Steel, Dark of the Moon, and Avengers. It doesn't automatically make a movie bad, but there are more ways to make a plot be on a global scale than to have it almost get destroyed. Then to top that off we had the witch conveniently die without killing her host body and were given no explanation for this. Again, this isn't necessarily bad, it just comes up so frequently and wasn't what I was paying to see.There were no disappointments to speak of with the characters, though. They aren't balanced great, but they all feel natural and get good performances. We only really care about Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Flagg. Deadshot and Flagg both have someone they care about, which is always a good way of gaining access. We can sympathize with Harley a little because of how normal she used to be and how she hides behind her mask of false insanity. The other characters are just kind of there for fun, and to advance the plot, but they definitely make it better. My favorite was El Diablo, the quiet master.There was a lot more action than I was anticipating. There wasn't any hint as to what the mission the squad was going to take in the trailers, so I was a little surprised when there was a whole military team fighting a bunch of zombies. Villains are at their best when they are confronting another character in a fight, which never really happened. Deadshot was easily the most formidable in a fight, followed by Katana. There is some debate about whether Harley was over sexualized, and I would answer with "yes, but not outrageously."As advertised there was a decent amount of comedy. Will Smith was in his usual element delivering sarcastic lines with just the right amount of seriousness. The smaller parts like Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang had a few funny moments. Harley Quinn was supposed to be funny, but she ended up just being annoying, like that classmate you had to do group work with in school who makes lame jokes in a failed attempt to make things less awkward.The script wasn't bad from a crafting standpoint. The exposition at the beginning was pretty good, giving us a sense of each character. The dialogue was decent too, and all of the actors gave good performances. Jared Leto's rendition of the Joker should not disappoint even when compared to Heath Ledger. He wasn't scripted as well as the Joker of the Dark Knight, but the acting was not lacking. The visuals were adequately amazing as expected, but a lot of the supernatural action felt like it was supposed to be part of a video game.If you like superhero movies, this is pretty cookie cutter. If you are hoping that this will be the DC movie that is "different" from all those other super movies, you are in the wrong place. The trailers are accurate to content, but not that accurate to theme. I'm not really surprised that they concealed the big-scale plot in the trailers, because I don't think that's what people really wanted from this kind of movie. Overall Rating: 7.3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot not to good but characters are OK. I felt Will Smith's character and Margot Robbie (Harley QUINN) makes the movie more enjoyable. The plot was corny in ways and repetitive with the same thing over and over. Typical comic book movie that isn't the Dark knight, it just kinda cheesy and lame at times. I give it 6/10. The joker's character is kinda iffy to me I think its a hard show to follow after Jack Nick and Heath's great performance. So they had to try something different, it looks like it cold work, possibly if done right.I really don't think I'll go to a theaters see any other DC movies besides a stand alone Batman movie or Justice League. but I'll will watch them once they are released on Blu Ray</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2000 Washington Redskins of the Summer (Paper Champions)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears that Hollywood and the NBA have been embarking on the same "super team or bust" approach the past 10 years. Their formula for success consists of throwing as many stars as possible on the same team, factoring in the other variables after the fact. Disney's Marvel universe resembles the 2010 ? 2014 Miami Heat, a consistently successful machine with a very high floor. Universal's Fast and Furious franchise mirrors the Oklahoma City Thunder right down to the balls to the wall mentality of Rusty Westbrook. While Fox's X-Men looks like the LA Clippers to me, a star studded squad that comes up just short every year for some reason, but still entertaining in it's own right.WB, looking to enter the fray, assembled their own super team for the Batman/Superman centric DC Comics universe. However, what looked great on paper turned out to be the 2012-2013 Los Angeles Lakers. Remember how hyped everyone was upon hearing that Dwight Howard, Steve Nash, and Kobe would be on the same team? But then they actually played a game and people realized that they sucked together (my other analogy for this before I came up with the NBA angle was the quintessential paper champion 2000 Washington Redskins). And for the record when it comes to non-blockbuster, adult movies, I think WB offers the best material out of the major studios (i.e. Creed, Nice Guys, Black Mass, etc), but man, their blockbusters are on a bad streak. I'm not sure who's having a worse 2016, WB's DC character universe or my Facebook newsfeed.Which brings us to DC's latest installment, the critically pummeled Suicide Squad. This isn't really as bad as its 26% Rotten Tomato score would attest. I actually think the cast does a good job, most notably America's current #wcw Margot Robbie and surprisingly Will Smith, who exudes his most charisma since Bad Boys 2. Meanwhile Jared Leto does OK with The Joker. That's a no win situation for him in following up Heath Ledger's iconic Oscar winning performance, so as long as he doesn't butcher it and stays in his lane, it works. For me, there are enough good scenes and performances to justify seeing Suicide Squad. If an album had a couple good jams surrounded by trash filler songs, you wouldn't renounce the album entirely.So it's not the actors, and I don't even necessarily think it's the direction. The real problem with Suicide Squad is simply an overall corny story. It seems like such an unforced error to have this group of likable misfits played by bankable stars team up to defeat what amounts to a bootleg version of Gozer The Destructor from the original Ghostbusters and hundreds of faceless minions. I realize this is a superhero movie so you have to suspend belief, but they couldn't come up with something just a little more grounded? WB clearly wants these movies to be taken seriously given the resources they are applying to the franchise, however by mixing in with these cartoony elements it just comes off as a very uneven tone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't often write film reviews, but after seeing a film I had waited SO long to see and leaving with only the frustrated question of what the writers were actually thinking, I feel compelled to vent some frustrations about the entire plot progression and the character focus.A film 123 minutes long is plenty of time to do justice to every member of a group that you're following in their quest to save the world. So I'm wondering why about a third of that time was dedicated solely to two characters while the rest barely got five minutes (collectively) for their background? If the filmmakers were that obsessed with certain characters they should get their own movies. It seemed almost insulting to go into full detail about these two then briefly mention the rest, especially when one *SPOILER ALERT* almost single-handedly saves them in the end. The audience is still scrambling to remember the characters names, nonetheless throwing in some half-hearted flashbacks to force some empathy for a character's backstory while ignoring the others completely. I don't usually leave a movie theater wondering what was going through the writer's minds when the plot was set out, but I definitely did here. I have to ask, did they even use a storyboard? How else would this film result in choppy storytelling and brief explanations of characters we are supposed to connect with throughout the film? *Spoiler* There is even a laughable moment early in the film where a character is mentioned in passing last second (right before the primary mission) only to be blown up within another moment as an example to the rest of the crew. Really, no other context or gradual pacing but "Oh, here he is. There he goes". I sincerely expected better with how long we have waited for a film with so much context (only YEARS of comic books and cartoons) to go off. That being said, Suicide Squad wasn't BAD. I was more miffed at the fact the great characters did not receive the time they so richly deserve. Jai Courtney as "Boomerang" was spot on and provided both humour and the realistic portrayal of a selfish criminal, Jay Hernandez was refreshing as "Diablo" and gave a new depth into what first appears to be a one-dimensional character. It is frustrating that Robbie and Smith, while great in their own characters, are hailed as the stars when they are given far more of a chance to perform as such. Katana is a character that has freakin' souls in a freakin' sword and yet she is (at best) briefly mentioned so we can stare at Cara Delevin-whatever gyrating awkwardly for a half hour. (Don't get me STARTED on her). All in all, Suicide Squad has the premise and characters (sans Cara DevDon'tCare) for a great film. However, the execution leaves you with a lot of frustration, only saved by the fantastic soundtrack that, by the looks of things, probably stole a large chunk of the movie's budget. I can only assume the writers were forced to save the money they would have spent on a storyboard and simply guess what ratio of time should be dedicated to each squad member (without a calculator).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>completely misses the point, bigger is not always better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first heard that suicide squad was being made into a movie i was ecstatic, suicide squad is one of my favorite parts of the DC comic world and Harley Quinn has been my favorite comic book character ever since Batman TAS, and this was gonna be her first appearance on a live action movie, so safe to say i was really looking forward to this, and the trailers got me even more excited. What i didn't expect was how much different the movie would be.Somehow everyone seems to think that comic book/superhero movies today have to be HUGE, that the entire world should be at peril, with enormous CGI monsters fighting around a huge sky beam and generic faceless CGI armies swarming our heroes. What writer/director David Ayer completely misses about the Suicide Squad is that the precise reason why they're so great is because they're not big, they're usually small time/mid-tier villains on a small time/mid-tier mission that might have some connection to something bigger but it's usually very contained and personal. They don't "save the world" they merely participate.The movie starts off great, we have well paced comic book style character introductions, in a fun and enjoyable way, we understand them(mostly) we have dialogues crackling with quips and jokes and the movie's tone overall seems darkly comical, and it seems like DC has finally got it down, but then the story starts.we have some huge powerful magical generic evil monsters with their generic evil plans sending generic faceless armies and trying to destroy the whole world, and it's up to a guy that has good aim, a psychotic girl with a baseball bat, a guy with boomerangs, a slightly stronger human crocodile hybrid, a guy that can shoot some fire but doesn't really want to, and a girl with a sword to stop them. Wait what? how the hell are they gonna do that?That's not the suicide squad, suicide squad is about small covert missions to steal some plans or neutralize some smaller threats, they don't fight literal gods nor should they, that's their charm, that their stories are small and you can just focus on the characters and enjoy them.I hate to bring up Marvel to compare cos i know they're different blablabla, but remember Ant-man? That whole movie was just a heist film, break into here, steal a weapon, get out and fight a guy around a house. It didn't have the need to have the whole world about to explode, it was a small contained story and that's what made it great, and that's exactly how suicide squad should be. You could've just had the joker as the villain or something.Another big problem is that the movie has this tendency to shift tones so fast that you wonder if two separate guys were making the movie. One moment it's funny and enjoyable, the next everything is super serious and they just don't mash together. It feels like DC had a great, fun style but they just didn't wanna fully commit to it and it had to have those dour joyless elements of the previous two films, which dragged it down a lot.What i will say is that all the casting and performances are fantastic, Will smith is the same Will Smith we all love, Jai Courtney is surprisingly hilarious when he finally gets to play an Aussie, Margo Robbie is a great Harley Quinn, shes got the voice, the attitude and the general feel of the character down. Jared Leto is solid as the Joker you can really tell he committed despite being criminally underused and Joel Kinnaman is great as the straight man in all the madness.The actors and their characters basically salvage this wreckage of a story and make it mildly enjoyable, if all of them return in a movie where the story is much smaller and we can just enjoy their interactions without having to worry about the entire world exploding any second, i'm gonna be the happiest man alive and the first to pay for the ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out of the way: much like Ghostbusters before it, this was a good movie but not great enough to quiet the haters from BvS.That said, I had fun with this movie which is something I can't say I did in the previous DCEU outing. This movie was fun and it didn't feel like a Marvel movie proving that DC can still do it's dark thing while still finding hope and a little humor (mainly dark humor) in its stories.This movie was good, but not great. I feel the story was something that belonged in a second or third movie. With (spoiler) Enchantress as the big bad, her powers and how she worked to tear down the villains didn't really hit home with me. Harley wanting to have a normal family life with her Puddin felt really strange after watching her kill without remorse for the previous hour+. The only one that felt real was Deadshot wanting to kill the Bat.Deadshot and Harley are easily the two standouts. The other characters had moments and Slipknot was used exactly how he should have been, but no one was really as special as Deadshot and Harley. Both of their arcs had solid beginnings, middles, and ends with Deadshot looking like he could reform and Harley showing that she just wants to belong.The Joker was fine for what he had. I feel like he would have been a better bigger bad for this movie as he has an established movie base and the team toppling him would have had a bigger impact, for me anyways. Leto was fine but I'm going to wait until I see a bigger role before I pass judgment.All in all, this movie was a move in the right direction for DCEU. It was good but not great but I think it showed that DCEU can be dark but still find moments of humor and hope in their stories. If nothing else, it has gotten me excited for Ezra Miller's Flash (he had a five second cameo and it was great).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but badly put together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Ayer is fast becoming the 'hit or miss' director for me, releasing instant classics like End of Watch (2012) and Fury (2014) but also great disappointments like Sabotage (2014) and now this. But wait two minutes while I retort myself and say there are some amazing parts and a lot of good things to say about this movie however it's poorly put together; Ayer had some incredible scenes but wasn't able to join them all up in any good way. The story, also written by Ayer was a surprising twist to what was expected, with the trailers not really giving anything away I was assuming it was going to be the squad Vs the Joker as the trailer might suggest, but far from it and it loosely centers around the Enchantress going rogue, I suppose the right term would be, going from bad to worse. It's certainly comic book fashion Super villains are forcibly recruited to carry out do-or-die missions by way of Wedlock, and whilst some of the plot seems to focus on Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, the rest of the characters feel very rushed, like they ran out of time. It's a clever attempt at having several subplots, linking the recent DCuniverse in, but to go lovey-dovey takes away the nastiness resulting it in becoming cheesy and clichéd towards the end (it's always about a girl.) Cara Delevinge plays the enchantress who manages to part company, revives her godlike brother, create a legion of grotesque mutants and goes Gozer on Gotham with only the remains of the squad to try stop her. I'm undecided about Joel Kinnaman, wasn't too keen on the new Robocop but loved him in Run All Night. Jay Hernandez made an explosive Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc wasn't quite believable to me, parts looking a lot like body paint, but I think Jai Courtney's Boomerang worked best for me, if Bane was cocky and was from Australia. Batfleck is in the film, but obviously off hero hunting whilst his city turns into a scene from Ghostbusters. Margot Robbie is probably the best thing about this film, bringing Harley Quinn to life in such a beautiful manner, raising sarcasm to a whole new level of cuteness and downright sinister. There isn't enough of Jared Leto's Joker, who is good, but just doesn't take the lead from Heath Ledger. This one is definitely more the comic book/animated joker and his dress sense is fabulous, but he's more of a tease than an actual character in the film. There's some amazing scenes like Deadshot going trigger happy and Ayer has some incredible vision like The Joker and Harley Quinn going toxic. The finale is actually beautifully shot, it's just badly filled with smaller, weaker scenes that taint the film overall. The action is good enough, and again, some impressive camera work and great use of colour giving it that vibrant video game feel yet still dark and gritty. One particular scene actually reminded me of Aliens, especially when Deadshot goes Chuck Norris on the horde of mutants. Steven Price reunites from Fury to do an unnoticeable score or could it be it got played out by the awesome explicit soundtrack with tracks like Panic! At The Disco's Bohemian Rhapsody, Eminem's Without Me and songs like Sucker For Pain, You Don't Own Me and an uncredited Sympathy For The Devil which was also used with Will Smith in Focus. I'm was trying to decide if I was ultimately let down by the hype or the actual film, but it's unfortunately both. Some great potential but not of the right consistency throughout and this might have something to do with the Warner Bros cut twenty plus minutes from the final film, who knows? Maybe it'll make the director's cut and all will be saved, such a beautiful shame. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 6 Story: 4 Script: 4 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 5 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. 68% 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While there were elements that I liked, I disliked the overall film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Suicide Squad, several DC bad guys are assembled by government agent Amanda Waller to fight other bad guys. People shoot guns, hit people with bats, explosions happen, and then the day is saved. My core complaint about this movie is that it's, for the most part, an action film that takes itself far too seriously. Keep in mind that this film includes: a crime boss in clown makeup, a human crocodile, and mushroom-head zombies created by an evil witch. Positives:Will Smith: the best performance in the film. As Deadshot, he's the sarcastic mercenary with a soft spot for his daughter. Had the whole film been like his performance (snarky yet playful with a few dramatic moments), I would have liked this film quite a bit. Bright Colors: Hooray! The two previous DC films seemed totally sapped of any visual cheer, and this film at least had a few neon visuals to contrast with the nighttime action scenes. The soundtrack: clearly aping off Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool, Suicide Squad employs a number of rock, pop, and rap songs throughout to add a sense of levity.Margot Robbie is an attractive lady (as many shots of the film make clear to the audience): I suppose Robbie did what she could with her performance as Harley Quinn, but it's difficult to step out of the shadows of Arleen Sorkin and Tara Strong. To me, the overall design (performance aside) came off as a mediocre stripper cosplay of an already sexualized character. And the Joker? Well, it's hard to judge considering how little time Jared Leto had on-screen.Others: Killer Croc growled out a couple of funny lines. Captain Boomerang (a bank robber with deadly weapons from down under) and Diablo (a Hispanic fire-bender) are neat characters. Negatives: Tone: Seriously, lighten up. You don't have to go full-on campy, but all comic books (no matter how serious) have some element of silliness that creators tend to embrace. Except for a few obvious reshoots, this film could have given Schindler's List a run for its money in terms of self-serious attitude. Villain: Before the Squad is assembled, there is no established villain beyond the vague threat that a superhuman could come and kill us all. There are scenes that establish The Enchantress and her brother (Incubus?), but there seems to be no concrete force for the Squad to fight until over half an hour into the film. Suicide Squad is a film that is mostly bogged down in its own sense of importance. Do I have a Marvel bias? Sure, but DC villains tend to be cooler than any heroes, so I had hopes for this film. Is there a conspiracy to hate this film? Maybe, but I guess the Secret Film Haters Society forgot to send me the memo. If you really want to see this film, don't let me stop you. But, I would personally say that you can skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie that is Not Very Memorable, but Still Leaves Me Excited for a Possible Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by no means a bad movie but the amount of cringe is ever present in the first Suicide Squad movie. The leading candidates for this would have to be Killer Croc (a very generic and sometimes stereotypical character) and Rick Flagg. Every line Croc said left me shaking my head wondering who approved this. Rick Flagg and of course Deadshot continually like an old record kept informing me that their "the bad guys". I heard you the first time no need to repeat the main idea of the story every 5 minutes. The dialogue tried to hard to be funny. I did find myself laughing a number of times, but overall I started to get annoyed by the whole thing, much like I do with Marvel. The other annoyances I found were at the beginning where there was to much jumping around to each character in short spurts. There probably isn't a good way to show 5 origins in 15 minutes so they could have spread the flashbacks over the course of the movie. Many of the songs felt unnecessary or just didn't belong which took me out of the moment. As for the overall story, I felt they played it to safe and made it feel to generic. I think that can be attributed to the backlash of BvS for having too much story in one movie. All I got was the basic idea of the Task Force X program, which is fine but they never really established the main relationship with Deadshot and Harley. Their chemistry keeps the team in proper check. Now this criticism could just be me but the final boss fight was too over the top for me. Why would the Squad's first mission be with one of the strongest characters in the DCU? They were not properly equipped to deal with that. I think they should have faced off with someone on their level as it would have been an easy victory and the movie could have focused more on character development.Now the positives of the movie. I think the performances by Deadshot, Harley, and El Diablo really make this movie. The conversations between these three didn't feel clichéd or anything of the sort. El Diablo's story arc was very entertaining so entertaining that I think he became my favorite character in the whole movie. The chemistry between Joker and Harley was the best part of the movie and its one of the few reasons I am semi-excited for another installment. The action in the movie was well shot and fun to watch. I believe the best scene with the squad took place in the bar; you really connect with these villains.Suicide Squad is a pretty meh movie. I didn't leave happy but nor did I walk away disappointed either. I will give it a pass since it was more of a set up movie to get to know the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing, but has good moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was my most anticipated film of this year, but it is the most disappointing film I have seen this year so far! My main problems were: I felt that the movie was kind of twisted dark...it was not interesting dark, The Enchantress was an awful villain (she looked like she was hula dancing and having a seizure the whole time she moved!), and also the editing and plot of this film were weak. The editing was extremely choppy in the first 30 minutes, it did get better though.Now onto the positives of the film. I loved Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo (I hate that he died!). I also enjoyed Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Karen Fukuhara as Katana, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Abaje as Killer Croc, but those characters were very underused. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was good too. I thought Jared Leto did a good job as Joker, but I don't love the Joker's character because he's sickeningly evil, and he isn't sympathetic at all, he's just pure evil! Now, I loved the soundtrack in this film! The soundtrack was fun and exciting.Overall, this film was a huge disappointment, especially since I absolutely LOVED BvS. I'd give BvS a 10/10, but I'd give Suicide Squad a 6.5 or 7/10. Maybe I need to see it again? Maybe I'll like it more a second time, but idk.</fullReview>

Margot Robbie: best role but she couldn't carry an entire movie.no surprises, Viola Brown was contemptible but not even worth hating. this was no guardians of the galaxy, lame compared to Deadpool, it wasn't even as good as Ant Man and that was a kid's movie.apparently i have to add more lines. Cara Delevingne is so ordinary looking since she gained weight. she's just a poor man's Kim Alexis 35 years later. someone taller with an Angelina Jolie body would have been so much more witchy.i don't know who the goofy batman stand-in was either.save your money and rent it on Redbox.disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-baked plot, two dimensional characters, and terrible dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mediocre at best, "Suicide Squad" is confirmation that DC is flailing in comparison to Marvel. Just like Batman v Superman, you are left feeling unsure of/unconvinced by the main characters' motivations, and equally unsure what the heck the writers were thinking when they concocted the plot line. A few observations in no particular order of importance.... 1) BAD dialogue. Just really, really terrible writing there...I don't think a single character said anything funny, interesting, clever, or surprising. Harley Quinn almost got there a few times, but her lines could have been SO much better! For example, WHY would she say "Are you the devil?" to Amanda Waller before they even meet? That's not funny and it doesn't even make any sense...it was clearly just the writers trying to show us that the Squad members have a kind of fear/reverence for Waller, but that had not been illustrated yet. It just sounded dumb. However, Margot Robbie delivered her poorly written lines well, and portrayed the character in other ways with her mannerisms, facial expressions, tone of voice, etc. 2) Every scene where it was the audience's time to be blown away by the awesomeness of the Squad member's skills fell very short. For example, they couldn't think of a cooler way to show DeadShot is a great with a gun than using the same freaking cutout people targets that everyone practices with?! How about having him shoot the eye of a pigeon flying by or literally anything else?? Get creative! And then El Diablo's "wow" moment is lighting a portion of a building on fire? Any knucklehead with gasoline and a match can do the same thing. None of these moments were interesting to watch. 3) The film's antagonist should not have been supernatural because it didn't allow everyone to shine. We hardly got to see what Boomerang or Katana can do...they could have easily not been in the movie! Why wouldn't they go against the Joker? That would have made him more of a main character, it would have been interesting to see Harley struggle with her loyalty, and everyone could have had cooler action scenes fighting his minions. And didn't Jared Leto prepare super hard for this part? He was in maybe 3 scenes and none of them were memorable. 4) The sudden BFF-ness of the Squad that Diablo references in his "I'm not losing my second family" (gag) line, and Harley in her "you hurt my friends" line feels really inappropriate and strange...these are criminals who are supposed to be motivated by self-interest and they have known each other for a span of 8 hours. This is not that kind of movie. 5) The "modern gangster" theme of the movie really works, and I liked the costumes and appearances of all the characters. Too bad that was about the only thing that worked! Better luck next time DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the trailers I was hoping the movie will be epic, but how disappointed I was. Half way through a movie I wanted to leave. There is no story line to follow at all. The movie is a collection of characters who do not fit with each other. The Joker makes no sense in the movie, it feels like they wanted to introduce a bunch new characters for the future and decided and decided; let throw all of them to one set and see what will happen. I am sure they will build on some of the characters in the future. But as for now, if you want story line; look somewhere else, if you like shallow action movies this might be just about right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was fun, no doubt, but what the film did well was cancelled out by it's flaws. Some of these flaws are minute details that many would be willing to overlook, but to others it's impossible. The one that annoyed me most was the relationship between Harley and the Joker. She's meant to love him and this was shown in the film, but she's meant to LOVE him! She's obsessed whilst on the other hand, The Joker has little regard for poor Harley. Their relationship in the film was too even between the pair, the Joker wouldn't bother breaking her out of prison but Harley would have taken up Enchantress' offer to bring him back in a heartbeat. Other flaws include the pacing of the film, the introduction of each character was great, their profiles on screen were very stylish offering insight into each villain, but you could tell which characters were going to be at the forefront of the film through these. Captain Boomerang and Katana's introductions were lazy and didn't offer much to the film with both ending up as missed opportunities. There were other flaws but I'd be nitpicking if I were to debate over them, onto the good parts! Humour was incorporated well with some jokes falling flat and others being needless. Croc made me think of a Groot/Thing hybrid. He shouldn't be funny, he should be ruthless and cold. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, both superb. Will Smith's Deadshot isn't the Deadshot known from the when the Squad was formed but is a great character non the less. The other characters needed more depth and screen time to be appreciated and I hope justice is served if they appear in future films. I personally don't care much for Leto's Joker but that may be down to the fact he only appeared for 15 minutes tops, of maybe it's because he's just not Heath Ledger. The laugh seems out of place too. Considering all the hype surrounding the film pre-release I was left disappointed, but I had fun. For all the stick Deadpool got for it's lack of faith to source material, Deadpool's character was spot on if a little too heavy on the sex jokes, this deserves just as much if not more. Too often SS deviated from it's source material regarding character traits, I'm not too bothered if the story isn't ripped straight from the comic (it's more fun if it's something you haven't seen before) that certain characters were not who they were meant to be or had no purpose in the film other than to be extra targets for the bad guys so the big players had little trouble in combat. Oh yeah, the bad guys were pretty lame. Enchantress was cool, quite scary to be honest! But she's gone now so hey-ho. She deserved more. But the grunts were generic, faceless grunts that posed no threat to the 'heroes'. All in all, it was good but it really should have been better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been hyped for Suicide Squad ever since that dark and gritty trailer debuted at San Diego Comic Con 2015. It had everything, a good Harley Quinn, The Joker a dark atmosphere and a twisted setting. What happened?I definitely liked CERTAIN aspects of this film so we will break it up into a pro's and con's list.Pro's.- Will Smith as Deadshot, I think he did as much as he could with that script given.- Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, he was absolutely my favorite character bringing a different side to the average villain. - Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, she displayed a good amount of crazy and a certain lovable sense.- Jai Courtney as Boomerang, wow never thought I'd say that. Why wasn't there more of him though! He brought great levity to the Squad.- Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, damn she was fantastic! She was wonderful and had a certain psychotic sense to her.- JARED LETO AS THE JOKER, I know he won't be everyone's Joker but even if he wasn't on screen for that long he certainly made an impression on me. I can't wait to see more of him and his crazy aggressive Joker.Con's.- Cara Delevigne and Joel Kinnaman, please quit acting. Joel Kinnaman was just over acting and I wanted to kick him. Cara Delevigne, ugh no words.- Some things just didn't make sense. Why was Amanda Waller talking to the Squad at MidWay City FROM MidWay City???- The Enchantress and Rick Flagg love story overall was just odd.- Killer Croc and Katana....cool looking characters. Cheesy lines for Croc and barely any for Katana. - Slipknot, now I was hyped for this character as he looked pretty cool in the promos, I knew he was gonna die but not that quick! I thought he maybe would've died a little later after showing us what he could do. I honestly feel bad for Adam Beach, he was being a part of all those rehearsals and media sessions only to have three lines. I counted- The Final Act, near the final showdown between Enchantress and her weird brother thing. Everything sort of went into weird mode. The editing was odd and it sort of cut away from lines, the whole final act is a mess to dumb it down. - The Plot, the beginning of the film is quite good and decent but when they get to Enchantress' story it just goes a little off and generic. The fighting was pointless action stuff which David Ayer loves. The writing was cheesy so was the whole Rick and Enchantress love story. One moment really stood out and Deadshot basically spoke what the audience were thinking "How the hell are you not dead lady?" Overall I was really looking forward to this and it sadly disappointed me, in terms of the DC Films they go Man of Steel as the best, BVS as the second best and Suicide Squad the worst. That's not to say it doesn't have it's moments. It's not a horrible film but lord knows it ain't perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most important lesson I know about movies is this: If James Bond is the hero of your film, you'd better have a world-dominater as the villain ? not a Store Accountant fudging the books.This, in whole, sums up the problem with Suicide Squad. It was as if WB decided that having a powerful and charismatic villain would detract from the Suicide Squad coolness. So they deliberately put in a villain who would be super-powerful, but fall short ? way short ? of the "charm" of the members of the Squad themselves. Because, God forbid, the villain should outshine the squad. Then how would WB make this into a franchise? So let's begin with the review: First off, there is one point which many critics so far, got wrong. That the music is so loud that it detracts. That does not happen. Never at any point in the movie.However, unfortunately everything else they say, is more or less, correct.So we start off the movie with a bunch of flashbacks, which I think were okay. Though, when it came to Deadshot/Will Smith's flashbacks, I wondered whether I was watching a feature film, or a soap-opera on television. Will Smith in tears. His daughter in tears. The background music in tears. The weather in tears. I was sure Batman was going to be in tears too! Thank God, he just smirks and kicks Will's posterior, instead.Then we are introduced to Amanda Waller juxtaposed with the flashbacks of the squad members. She's supposed to be some kind of "I'm such a bad female-canine and I have a three mile detonation radius" woman, but instead, if you can visualize a world-weary Principal of a kid's school, you've already seen her in your mind then. You know the type. Strict. Matronly. Clipped English. Talking only as needed. Economical with movements. Prim. Proper. Then, you've seen Amanda Waller.We also get scenes of the bad boys and girl (Harley, in this case) being tortured in the prison, with sad, melancholy background music being played in the background. We're supposed to 'feel' for this bunch, dammit. But all that goes on in our minds is Deadshot has orphaned so many children, widowed even more men and women. Harley has killed so many, broken so many homes and lives. So it's hard to feel sympathy for the characters. A minus point ? Harley tries to out-joker the Joker. Every time. All the time. Even in normal conversations. Yikes! I guess being unhinged means making faces (the kind you make to get your baby brother in the pram to laugh) and saying trite one-liners. Well, WB, whatever floats your boat.Then one of them, the Witch (don't miss her incredibly toned abs, I must say), escapes and becomes the villain. Then turns men into gloppy zombies that do her bidding. Which is to wipe out humanity. Oh, the humanity! The zombies? well, imagine a high school kid with face covered full of zits. Lots and lots of them. And large ones, mind it. Purple too. Well, those are the zombies.After that, the movie basically is about "bondage". Not that kind, but the "we're gonna bond so good the audience will cheer us with tears in their eyes" stuff. Some action scenes the follow. Military men Team A shooting zombies. Military men Team B shooting zombies. Will Smith climbing on cars and shooting zombies. Boomerang boomeranging zombies. Harley baseball batting zombies. Croc biting zombies (ugh!), Katana samurai-zing zombies, and then?more of that?when?wait, more of that again?after which, we finally come to?um mm..more of that, even now!...Then, abruptly, the final confrontation. I don't want to spoil it for you. But it was like you were traveling home in a bus and the conductor announcing your stop had arrived. You felt?hmm, time to get off. You checked your surroundings for missing items or something you may have left behind, smiled at the people who usually travel at the same time as you do, then step of the bus, happy to be home. That's what it feels like. A bus ride. And before you know it, it's over. Just like that. Over. No, really! Finally, let me comment quickly on a few things:JOKER: Jared's trying too hard. His image and makeup were spot on, though. If he were "reserved" with it, like Heath Ledger was, then Jared would have raised the movie through the roof. He would have been the "new Joker". Instead, he blows it ? he gesticulates, goes through maniacal facial expressions (which Heath never did, hence the CHILLING Joker, one which caused fear). Let us just say, that Jared's threat levels are because of what he can do. Heath's threat levels were because of who he was. A difference, lost on WB and Leto, both.BATMAN: Ben Affleck. Kicks Will's ass. Kicks Joker and HQ's ass. Kicks Joker's car's ass with the bat-mobile. Saves HQ. Punches HQ in the face, unapologetic. Will cries, daughter cries, Batman smirks. Then kick's Will's ass even more. Rocks!! KATANA: Why was she in this? BOOMERANG: Supposed to be the comic relief. WB have serious introspection to do. Fire your Casting Supervisor and Casting Director asap CROC: Quite nice, actually. Except, he shouldn't be wearing a double hoodie! Looks ridiculous in that. Bare chested, torn vest, muscular, killer rage?now THAT'S the Croc we all know and love.FIREMAN/DIABLO: Tattooed. Any other gangster. No personality. Shoots fire from finger tips. Yawn! SLIPKNOT: Blink. And you miss him.DEATHSTROKE!! : Just kidding. He's not there.EVERYONE ELSE: Everything generic about the military. It's there.So, final word about the movie? A couple of times I asked myself: Is it over yet? Not a good start, WB. Definitely not a good start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie and Its Trailers (Maybe One Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ruthless government bureaucrat assembles a team of super villains to fight even worst menaces, in return for reduced sentences. I have been waiting to see this all year. I was disappointed. I thought, after seeing the first trailer, that is was going to be another dreary DC Comics film. Then the second and third trailers appeared, and I and countless others were led to believe that we were going to be treated to the second coming of "Guardians of the Galaxy." Well, guess what. The first trailer was the honest trailer. The people who made the second and third trailers lied to us.That stated, I didn't think it was as bad as the critics made it out to be. I didn't hate it the way I hated "Batman vs Superman." I liked the actors even when I didn't like their characters. Will Smith provided gravitas as the leader while Margot Robbie was the tomato in the salad. Viola Davis was solid but she played the kind of despicable bureaucrat that gets exposed by Jason Bourne. Cara Delevigne, cute on talk shows, here gave a bad performance as an uninteresting villain.One hope: maybe the people who made trailers two and three could be persuaded to make the sequel, if there is one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to divide my review in negatives and positives-Positives- The actors did an amazing job with what they had. Most of the characters were convincing and kept you in your seat. Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Rick Flagg and Harley Quinn are the aces in this movie. The movie has a good balance of action and humor. Every character has perfect screen time.Negatives- The editing of this movie was horrible at times and jarring. The plot is very generic and weak. Having an amazing set of characters doesn't save this movie from it's plot holes. The villain of this movie needed more love from the writing department.I couldn't properly judge Leto's Joker, I need more of him in future movies to get a good assumption. DC needs to make movies for general audience, I gave it a 5 being a DC fan, any other average person would've scored it less. I can understand why certain people bashed it and why some loved it. As for me, I would say it's an average popcorn flick. It's not bad but it's not good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the movie i was waiting for this year, and boy was i disappointed. Its not even like my expectations were so high, because of the bad publicity it got, i lowered my expectations, and still came out disappointed.Some very interesting, weird and wacky characters we have here, but they did not really play them out.Robbie should have been an excellent Harley, but she wasn't. Leto you would have thought well capable of playing the joker, and though he was not bad, he was not great(though it might be because of the obvious comparison with Heath Ledger, impossible act to follow).Hollow, full of holes story, no character depth.DC just too much in a rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cast of characters who are unfortunately stuck in a disappointingly mediocre film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although finding 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' a decent film despite some major flaws, I thought DC could have done a better effort kick starting their Extended Universe. So naturally, I thought 'Suicide Squad' would be the one to properly get the ball rolling in terms of solid quality. With its ensemble cast, and the amazing trailers that have been dropped, I was naturally excited to see this film, and it is my second most anticipated film of the year. Now, after over a year of waiting, I finally got to see it. However, once again, DC has delivered another just average film that misses the mark, and I have to say it is probably the most disappointing film I've seen this year. It's by no means bad, far from the negative bashing it's been receiving by critics, but it just has so many issues that they ultimately tarnish my overall enjoyment.Okay, so what's good? Firstly, the cast. About 90% of them were absolutely terrific. DC seems to always manage to stick the landing with it's casting. Margot Robbie delivers the best performance in the film. Despite looking more like a pale skinned cheerleader than Harley Quinn, she is the epitome of Harley, as she conveys that mix between sexiness, comedy, and insanity of the character. She seems to be having the most fun with her role, and I had the most fun watching her as well. Will Smith rarely fails to deliver in a role and as Deadshot, this is yet another example. The man oozes with charisma like he always does, and I found him to be one of the more surprising characters, as he undoubtedly had the best story arc. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is pretty solid in her role, who is probably the most threatening of all the characters. Other nods go out to El Diablo, who I found intriguing. I also thought he had one of the best roles in the climax. I really like Killer Croc as well, despite him not contributing much until the climax. It was difficult to understand what he was saying half the time though. Ben Affleck cameos as Batman, which is not really a spoiler, who I still think is the best on screen Batman. And Jai Courtney as Boomerang didn't suck. Yay. And finally Jared Leto as the Joker. He was the one I was most looking forward too, obviously because he is the Joker, and he is my favourite comic character. I thought Leto did a pretty good job. Each scene he was in, he was very interesting enjoyable to watch, and despite his limited screen time (which is about 10-12 minutes), I wanted to see more of him. However, his role in the film was pretty pointless. He didn't contribute anything to the plot whatsoever. Due to only being in a hand full of scenes, it's hard to compare him to other on screen Jokers, as we don't get to see what motivates him and makes him tick. Also, I don't remember him telling any jokes. His name is the Joker, right? Even Heath Ledger told jokes. Hopefully, we will get to see more of Leto's Joker in future installments, especially the Solo Batman Movie, as I liked this portrayal of the character. Another positive factor is the humour, which is great to see after the practically humourless 'Man of Steel' and 'Bvs'. However, for those who don't like how those movies were dark, this does not change here, as it has a pretty gloomy atmosphere and sinister elements. Speaking of the plot, now onto the negatives. The story-line is pretty weak. It does not try anything new in terms of storytelling, and once again, a comic-movie revolves around a big blue portal in the sky. I got sick of this with 'Fan4stic' The villain is also pretty dull, whose performance was just awful, and I didn't understand their motivations or plan. If you have seen the film by now, you'll understand. However, the worst offender is the editing. It is some of the worst editing I have ever seen in a film. Especially, in the first half- hour, where a pop song is played every minute. And the pacing is all over the place. The character's introductions are so rushed, and there isn't really a moment that slows down and let the audience get to know them better until the second act. It is even more disappointing when the majority of these scenes are good, but when they are put together, they lack any transition or coherency. I would have to say, if it wasn't for the cast, the humour and some scenes, I believe I would have disliked this film. Overall, 'Suicide Squad' has a great cast of characters who are unfortunately stuck in a disappointingly mediocre film. I am unsure whether this to be blamed on the studio or the director, David Ayer, as he has directed good films like 'Fury'. I did enjoy it for the most part, but it's discouraging that at this point, the DCEU has yet to deliver a relatively great installment to their franchise. I actually don't want to see a sequel to this, and would rather have these characters appear in other films, especially Deadshot, Harley, Joker and Amanda Waller. I still recommend people to go see it, but to see it with low expectations, so they are not disappointed like I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right I'm gonna skip the obvious stuff, Suicide Squad is a fun film, If you just want to see a decent Super hero... I mean Villain film, Stuff blow up, You get to see cool powers, Gun play, and funny moments here and there.I found it a little cliché, But this is where It gets personal, FOR ME, Heath Ledgers Joker is not only the best Joker ever to be on the big screen, It was also some of the best acting I've seen as of late, So anyone else going to play Joker after will have a tough time appealing to me on that level(even though he's hardly in the film), That aside, for characters without solo movies or solid established backstories it's pretty good!It's centred around Dead-shot and Harley mostly and I was fine with it, I think what makes this film even better is the Production, The colour scheme, the trailers, the Music and the posters/banners the way it was marketed I think made the lead up to the film much better but also was it's downfall as it wasn't that Great.Overall I can definitely see why people have mixed opinions on the film but from someone who mentally prepared himself to go into the film without high expectations of two of my favourite DC characters (Harley and Joker) It was a fun watch. Jared Leto's Joker is.. Interesting, I haven't seen enough to really judge so I'll hold back on that but I do like it, he's got that weird, crazy mob boss mentality. And as for Harley Quinn she was... OK too, nothing amazing, just adequate, I do think some of the writing let her down though so I'll give her that.The best character by far is Amanda Waller, she's like DC's Nick Fury, always one step ahead, always well informed. She was menacing and had good screen presence.Dead-shot is also in the same vein but to me it just felt like Hancock so basically, it's Will Smith. Good but capped. I wanted Dead-shot, not Will Smith dressed as Dead-shot but then again I don't think Dead- shot is a character of depth anyways so it did work.The rest of them, I didn't care for much, Enchantress was Cliché, her brother was just something to fight (with some sub par CGI), Cpt.Boomerang was alright although he hardly threw them, the only thing that kept coming back was his beer. Killer Croc looked cool, the make up and all but he was also kinda meh.Katana, was also very meh, one dimensional and since the only thing I compared it to was the Katana from the TV Show Arrow, it was hard as that show got rubbish too. (notice how I said "got")Diablo is actually cool, His back story was somewhat touching and I like how he's legit very reluctant to using his powers but what pushes him to do it is kinda ridiculous, but in general he was OK. I would've gone in depth but ... There wasn't much depth to the film to be completely honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike Deadshot who "never misses," Suicide Squad is a movie that misses in big ways, and hits in the best ways. As a premise, it shakes up the current trend entirely; by not simply being a movie about a group of good people who are bent to save the world at any costs. It in fact, has some of the most morally comprised human beings to populate its story, which asks a blaring question: "If you're so bad, can you ever really be good?" It opens with Amanda Waller, played venomously and with love by Viola Davis; while Will Smith is uncompromisingly effective as Deadshot, she is the heart of the team, and the main driving force of Task Force X. She proposes that a group of villains be at the disposal of the government program ARGUS, and be the next deterrent to hold up against another potential threat like Zod. Its a pretty good idea, considering she can leverage literally anybody to her bidding. She was one of my favorite characters in the movie, and unlike Lex Luthor, she doesn't play it up operatically, but creates a level headed manipulative egoist, who does what she wants, how she wants, when she wants, to who she wants, and is only interested in results.As the movie unfolds we get to meet the squad. First up is Deadshot a.k.a Floyd Lawton (Will Smith), a career hit-man, and an all time gangster. But Deadshot has a sweet spot for his daughter, and its a bit of a tug and pull on his conscience. He likes killing, and even dreams about killing The Bat, but holds himself back, because of his daughter. He provides some of the coolest, and most personal moments of the film, and is really the most three dimensional character of all of them.This leads me to the triumphant return of The Joker a.k.a Mr. J (Jared Leto), and the addition of Harley Quinn a.k.a Dr. Harleen Quinzel (Margot Robbie). They're the wild cards of the movie, who really should've been the main focus. After all, if you have one of Batman's greatest villains, played with religious method acting by Leto, than why would you not have taken full advantage of that? Some of the best moments are the little hints of the chemistry and life they shared together before the events of "Suicide Squad." I loved every minute with this crazy pair, but it was all done in snippets, rather than being the full back bone of the story. Harley Quinn works well on her own (even in a bigger way than The Joker), and Margot Robbie makes her both sexy and scary as hell. She was more or less still, the cherry on the cheese cake. However, the true villain is The Enchantress a.k.a. June Moon (Cara Delevingne), and I felt literally no stakes whatsoever. In fact she fell on mostly flat ears the entire film. Her relationship to Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), was thinly written, and had no insight into their vulnerability as a couple, they simply seemed like they just really liked each other. David Ayer could've really taken the time to make them the flip side of the coin to Harley Quinn and the Joker, which would've created some fun and unique couples contrast. But instead they just seem like a good looking pair in a bad situation. I will say that she does spare some stunning villainy sprinkled through out. I just never felt the same level of impending doom, as I did with the finale of "Batman V Superman."The story is pretty straight forward for the most part, setting the playing field early on by establishing the backgrounds of the super villains, like Boomerang (who has a really cool cameo by another super hero in his introduction), Killer Croc, Katana, and El Diablo. They were really more than just the backdrop, and surprisingly Jai Courtney brings it as Boomerang with some of the funniest moments to be had by his character (I can't wait to see him go up against The Flash, and see their back and forth banter between each other). The plot gets pretty thin once they get deeper into the action, but the characters are so diversely played that you're never really sure what might happen. I loved David Ayers punk vibe, and rock n roll attitude, it really gives a whole different flavor to anything DC has done, and separates it from the bulk of superhero movies. It almost feels like a musical, with perfectly featured tracks like "Without Me" by Eminem, and "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Panic! At the Disco. If anything see this movie for the music. It's definitely got a rebel feel towards conventions, and really challenges the market by being edgier, grittier, and meaner. Yet, as much I was entertained, I still felt longing for more. I think the Joker and Harley Quinn needed more pull on the story, and that higher stakes with less familiar action, could've been at hand. But never the less, DC yet again tries something different to set the tone for their "cinematic universe," and if that ain't call for a light applause, than I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the intense hype for the movie after the past six months of advertisement, trailers etc. I was disappointed with the the final result-overall the film was a great film but it could have been better, firstly Margot Robbie played Harley Quinn extremely well in the movie, the psychotic maniac who was madly in love with the joker was played well by this actress, she almost carried the movie the entire time. In addition Will Smith played deadshot reasonably well, I couldn't think of a better actor to play that role to be honest. The plot for the movie was well thought out and the opening introducing all the characters was very well done, however it did take a while for me personally to get into the film (a good half an hour or so) but I wasn't disappointed. The reason I gave the movie a rating of 7 was for two solid reasons, firstly and most importantly, the trailers showed a lot of joker action, I was really looking forward to Jared Leto's performance as the joker as I wanted to see how well he compared to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker in 2008 The Dark Knight, unfortunately the joker did not appear as often as I thought as the trailers showed more of the joker, I liked the way Jared played the joker, in a physco way but I really liked the laugh as it came off as a bit insane and over the top. Having said that, the way the film ends brings back the joker and I am looking forward to see the joker in the upcoming movie Justice League in 2017. The other reason I gave it a 7 was because I did not like the way killer croc looked. I really enjoyed the action in this movie and I recommend everyone to watch it, I thought every character had a part to play in the movie, overall Suicide Squad was a great movie, if you enjoy action pact, plot twisting madness then I would say this movie is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm honestly not sure how I'm supposed to feel about this movie. There are a lot of 'huh' moments and 'why the f*** would they do that'. It seems as if DC wanted us to root for the SS and the villains rather than the 'good guys'. Overall I'd say this is a mixed bag and your priorities when going to see the film will determine whether you enjoy yourself or not. Pros: Deadshot and Harley Quinn back-stories, overall performances from the cast. Interactions between the characters was great and resulted in some hilarious moments. Villains were pretty decent.Cons: Cheap looking CGI, some jokes fell through, some corny dialogue. Some characters were sidelined and really underused. Soundtrack got in the way of some scenes-- too loud.I feel like a broken record saying this again, but I just feel confused. Its a super-mixed bag. What was the point of making this movie only to undermine it later on... ( when you see the end credits you will know what I'm talking about )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got to watch the much anticipated Suicide Squad, and... I'd like to start with; DC and David Ayer, are not the reasons I believe, as to why this movie is WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION, one of the most incoherent motion pictures I have EVER seen in my life. Suicide Squad is incredibly enjoyable, however, it has more plot holes than a Gang/Mob of Meerkats, and that run deeper than The Mariana Trench.The Suicide Squad we've seen, is actually 2 versions of the same movie, in 1. And therein, lies the problem. Thus, TRUTHFULLY, anyone who believes this movie is an 8+/10, is either lying to themselves, or, they just don't care either way.Firstly, the good. The show was not stolen by who I thought it would be stolen by, which is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn - she was awesome to watch, and had a depth which once explored in later films, will probably make her the most interesting of the bunch, however in this film, truth be told, Viola Davis, Will Smith and Cara Delevingne's Enchantress, were the hero's that inflated the enjoyment. Davis's badassery was, "gangster". Will Smith's humour was, genuine. And Cara's Enchantress, was... well, enchanting.The Joker, I was afraid would be overacted by Leto, but... I think, he was as good as Affleck's Batman in comparison to Bales, as his Joker is comparable to that of Ledgers. Leto was good, but Ledger is still better.Speaking of Affleck, his Batman/Wayne cameo was, really fun to see.The visuals, though the cinematography could've been better, were an absolute joy.The score. One word. Amazing!!!Now for why critics give Suicide Squad 26%. This movie is like a well constructed main national road, that has "potholes" left, right and centre. The plot holes are so bad in fact, that the movie would keep contradicting itself in the exact same moment... I don't think I've ever seen a movie, at least one of this calibre, do that. For example; While Amanda Waller was describing just how crazier than The Joker, Harley is, The Joker proves to in fact, be crazier than Harley. Another one (among MANY others, that you just can't let it go anymore); Right after we're shown how easy it is to kill The Enchantress's army, Amanda, explains how difficult, to almost impossible it is, to kill them. Now, these can be taken as "nit picking", but sadly - because of the many times this same mistake happens, it's really not nit picking... But let's say it is; how about the movies motivation though? It's a plot hole so bad, it makes little, to no sense.The Squad, had an opportunity to kill the ONLY 2 people who had power over them, however, the movie just completely ignored that fact... A fact that would've ended this movie, in 1 hour. But fine, let's still say, they inexplicably, had a change of heart.How do they explain, The Enchantress not killing Amanda Waller in her hotel room??? I'll tell you how, they don't.How do they explain The Enchantress not killing everybody, in the boardroom at ARGUS? They don't.Why didn't AT ANY TIME, with one fell swoop, The Enchantress not take her heart back???The Enchantress's brother (Incubus) was a killing machine... Then suddenly, against the Squad, he turned into an amateur blind archer... He's precision moved from 100, to 0... Why? Because...Suicide Squad, made the exact same mistake Green Lantern made back in 2011 (AMONG MANY OTHERS); They had a villain way to powerful, as an initial adversary, to overcome.This films greatest flaw is, if you were to explain it's motivation logically... The movie wouldn't exist.Is 26% harsh? Perhaps. Is it better than BvsS... Arguably not, but I do believe it is certainly, without question, more enjoyable.I don't know how to rate this movie, because Making Love is 100% fun, however Suicide... that, that can mess up your whole day.Easily could've been an 8... Hell, even a 9... But then... That 9, from some point in the movie, slowly started rotating. I would truly love to give this movie a 7... I would love to... But, David Ayer/WB make it IMPOSSIBLE to justify. Hell, I'm only even hovering around 6, because I refuse to believe that, this movie could possibly be a 5, and below.So, from 9... To 6.something/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the comic book fans decry the subject line let me state that I read comics or graphic novels if you want to get into semantics too. Probably not as much as the guys and gals tagged ass fanboy and fan-girls but enough with Spidey, The Avengers, Fantastic Four, Superman and Batman - hell, even the ancient Legion of Super Heroes form the 60's.So - that was too much intro to say that Suicide Squad was a fairly incoherent mess that was shot clearly enough for you to witness the mess and also be disappointed at the talent wasted that could have made something special.Will Smith and Margot Robie were in great form and the film is not unwatchable like a Michael Bay Transformer destructothon. And while I am fully sick of comic book/Super Hero movies always being about a world class catastrophic event or evil that will wipe out/take over ALL the Earth...it's nine to see them just take care of some every day thing...just keep Iran from nuking Israel and we have a film.But the film goes mystic, with no explanation, our heroes are released because Superman is dead. Now, if your premise rides on the most famous and powerful superhero now being RECENTLY dead, they owe us a flashback or two, like they did for every character in the movie, including the now missing, though never pronounced dead, Batman...who shows up in a couple of scenes for no apparent reason except that someone was telling a story about him, so he appears in their tell a story flashback exposition.So - at this point we have dead superman, missing Batman and confused Flash, because lo and behold, in one criminal's flashback, it appears that guy gets busted by The Flash. And that's the last we see of the Flash. and based on the fights that come later, The Flash would have been their best superhero..at least we understand what his power really contributes to the fight.You see, that is the killing point moving forward after some higher up in some black ops version of the CIA or NSA or FBI (I saw Bourne last week and it will scramble you brain with all the code crap)decided that a group of jailed meta-humans (X-Men to Marvel fans)who are serving multiple life sentences for horrific crimes, including the strangest choice among them from a logical point, Harley Quinn who used to be The Joker's Psychiatrist but became obsessed with him and fell in love with him and became as psychotic as him. All fine and good but exactly what power does mercurial, manic, goofy, psychotic thin female with decent martial arts skills with no body armor armed with one 14 round pistol and a baseball bat actually over an gang banger? Much less these meta-enhanced alien spirit people beings or whatever they are. (Trust me, We agree never told) And besides Dead-shot, who can shoot any firearm he finds and hit any target he aims at plus he never seems to need to reload either. So, we know his thing. And the Fire guy, well, he shoots fire when he gets over his angst and gets all Bruce Banner. But then we still have about three more to deal with, A boomerang guy who throws a boomerang that spy's on people, for a little while. Glad they had that! And some other guy who just seemed to hang around and look tense. And they are led by a Special Forces guy who, of course, used to have a relationship with one of the main bad women. That plot description is close to all you really get out this movie. Oh - forgot..there's a guy who's big and is skinned like a big crocodile but with a round face so he just looks like The Thing from Fantastic Four. See, this is where the story, already non-nonsensical, makes things worse. The plan is to send this squad in to fight these two bad people and save the world for a reduction in their sentence, and because they have families to that might want to keep living on the world. But notice, I just called them bad people - that's because the movie never defines exactly what these people's powers or weakness's are. At one point we are led to believe that they are immensely powerful - let's face it - world destroying powerful - yet near the end, The Joker's girlfriend, armed only with a blade or a bat lights into the super powerful baddie and the bad women has trouble deflecting the blow with her own sword. Not so damn powerful there or that psychotic gal should be at training camp for the Yankees. None of these characters ability to be superhuman is ever explained to those of us who haven;t read the comics. So I was lost trying to figure out the power ranking and who do what to who. It was an incoherent mush.In Guardians things were explained quickly with humor, action and panache. Same with the Avengers. And Man of Steel and Batman v Superman made coherent sense as well. This could have been a lot worse but it sure could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but there were some issues I had while watching it. Firstly it felt too stuffed. There were a lot of characters and they tried to shove in too much back story. They easily could have had back story movies for most of the characters and then made Suicide Squad. With so much stuffed in it was hard to have a good main story line.Secondly, they spent way to much time trying to capitalize on their female characters. It felt like the majority of the shots were framed to show off Margot's ass in her short shorts.Third, plot issues. They are in the dc universe, show Batman and the Flash within the movie, yet after 3 DAYS of this city being taken over, they still leave it up to this squad of villains? That doesn't make any sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These are not the bad guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty excited to see Suicide Squad. The marketing for this movie trolled my whole online presence - impossible to ignore the movie.Now we know for sure - another movie which over-promised and under-delivered.To say, that it is a bad movie is nonsense. It is a good action movie - however it never could point with unique characters or a great "ambiance". It never had mystique.One of the main problems I seen in the movie was Will Smith. Don't get me wrong - like so many people I also agree, that he really oozed charisma. But he wasn't Deadshot - and maybe he is the best example, what the producers did wrong. Will Smith played a soldier in this movie - somebody who is quite good with his guns. However he didn't fetishised his guns (enough), nor was he really a (perfect) serial killer for money. They portrayed him as "good father" and as mentioned: as kinda soldier... all the possibilities of the movie already then went south. If I think of the members of Suicide Squad, I think of bad people, who are criminal, insane, dangerous, ruthless... However in the movie, the members were just people, who did have some abilities and did the wrong choices. We could call it "good-washing". In fact I didn't wanted to watch a movie about some anti-heroes which become "good guys". I wanted to see bad guys, who were exploited to do bad stuff (with hopefully a good outcome) and have fun with it.Further there are issues with the logic: Batman and the Flash were in this movie - but if a crisis of epic proportions arises, they are not responding and try to help to avert the possible extinction of the human race? Yeah right. And why are Captain Boomerang (who happen to be great with boomerangs), or especially Harley Quinn deployed for the mission? TAt hey don't even have "superpowers"... And really - do we need in any comic movie the prospect of extinction? If compared to Deadpool, it was a successful movie, without the possible destruction of the world. What really bugged me, was the potential of the movie, which never was used. Really bad people are extremely interesting to portray - but maybe except of Harley Quinn (which still could have been far crazier and definitely more manipulative as a psychiatrist) the characters were all "good people which made bad choices. This is just boring stuff we seen a thousand times.Another point is the rating. Suicide Squad - even more than Deadpool would deserve an R-rating. The Joker having crazy potentially violent sex with Harley, would have added to the real craziness. Opponents which look like people, not like hardened Play-Doh would also have been helped.At the end we have had a movie, which was far too conservative to be great. And a producer which over-promised and under-delivered. A shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a to the point "what can you expect" review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad: - If you have seen the trailers, you've already seen the good punchlines. - The "villain" sucks. Someone good turns bad, want to destroy all of mankind because reasons, blabla. - Half of the suicide squad brings nothing to the group besides a directors attempt to portrait cool characters. Harley Quinn is the only one who's cool and also not very important. - There is a ninja girl with a katana that holds souls from victims slain. Supernat..ural? Whatever. She's not in the squad, but she's always with the squad. She is connected to the people behind the squad, she loves her katana. Her husband is dead. No, you won't learn anything else about her. This is not a spoiler. - There are two love stories, one of which you will feel deserves it's own movie so you'll be disappointed to not see more, the other will bothered you for even being a part of this movie. - Plot holes. - The thought behind the suicide squad has some major logical flaws.The Good: - Cool characters, even though most of them does nothing for the plot line! - Harley Quinn! - CGI Effects! - The first 30 minutes gives a great introduction to the characters and the basic plot line, and might give you lots of hope that the rest will be just as great! (it isn't!) - You'll get to see all the punchlines from the trailer!I gave this a 5, because my expectations were low. This is a sad attampt by DC to match Guardians of the Galaxy, even using classical hits from the 80's and 90's as the main soundtracks. For a pretty bad movie, it managed to entertain me because I let it, and because the actors are great, some of the characters are cool and interesting, and everything CGI looks pretty. But this is not a good movie. The do sell the whole idea of, and reasoning behind, CREATING the suicide squad, but besides that, logic and reason doesn't not live here. Oh, and I liked Jared Leto as The Joker. Make us a movie about Joker and Harley Quinn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will DC ever learn?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DCEU (Detective Comics Extended Universe) hasn't really got off to the greatest of starts with Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I liked the former but the latter was disappointingly poor, with critics not really taking to either well at all. Now we have Suicide Squad, a film that many felt could potentially put DC back on track with their cinematic universe.With director David Ayer pulling the strings and the likes of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Viola Davis starring, Suicide Squad was easily one of my most anticipated films of 2016.After the death of Superman, intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is convinced that she has the solution, should something of Superman's power want to threaten the world. Her plan is to assemble a team of the most dangerous criminals to take on any threat too great for regular soldiers.Task Force X or Suicide Squad, as they name themselves, is made up of; Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Slipknot (Adam Beach), each and every one of them under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) who, like Waller, sees them all as expendable.When an unworldly threat arrives, the squad try their best to get the job done however, their villainous nature and the Joker (Jared Leto), looking to get Harley Quinn back, might just throw a few spanners in the works.Just like the film that proceeded it in the DCEU, Suicide Squad is a mess of the film that literally allows the audience no time to breathe, shoving the characters down their throats and forcing them to fall in love with them right away. David Ayer's narrative is so rushed, getting to the finale within around forty-five minutes, meaning there's no real time for any sort of character development. His film also has quite possibly one of the worst villains in the history of comic-book adaptations, and that's not even an exaggeration.The film is also edited really badly, chopping and changing so much that you'll start to get a headache, and not just in the action sequences. Ayer's script is really disappointing, considering the fact this was rated 15 in the UK, yet nothing here made me feel that was warranted. There's also the fact that every moment that should have got a major laugh was ruined by the fact they were all seen in the trailer. If you've seen all the trailers you've literally seen the whole film.The thing that annoyed me the most about Suicide Squad though was the soundtrack, which I was really looking forward to see how Ayer would incorporate it into his film. Now, Marvel didn't event the usage of a cool soundtrack to accompany a film but, in Guardians of the Galaxy, the musical choices made perfect sense with what was going on in the relevant scene. In Suicide Squad, random songs play at random times and it just ruined some scenes in particular.Coming to the performances, which are easily the best thing about the film, Suicide Squad has some form of redemption. Viola Davis is great as the intense Amanda Waller, as is Will Smith as Deadshot. Harley Quinn was always going to be a tough character to bring to life but I felt Margot Robbie did her enough justice, whether it's enough to warrant a solo film is questionable mind. I actually really enjoyed Jai Courtney's performance as Captain Boomerang which is quite something considering I normally can't stand the guy.Cara Delevingne, who hasn't had too much acting experience, can be used as a bit of a scapegoat as her performance isn't great however, I feel that was more down to how awfully written her character was. Joel Kinnaman doesn't really do anything wrong as Rick Flag, it's just unfortunate that he had to step into a role that we could have potentially seen Tom Hardy in if he didn't have to do reshoots on The Revenant.The use of the Joker is something that has been bugging me ever since I left the cinema. Jared Leto had huge boots to fill after the perfect performance Heath Ledger gave as the iconic villain in The Dark Knight and I think Leto did well. My main issue was that he just wasn't in it enough for my liking. The Joker has to either be the main villain or not in the film at all, not a side character who pops up for a couple of scenes throughout the film. I was intrigued by what we did see of Leto and it would be great to see him go up again Ben Affleck's Batman in a future film. You can't even consider judging him as the best representation of the Joker until we see more of him.There are some Justice League cameos in Suicide Squad, one lasting a split second and the other featuring Batman. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the appearances Batman makes did feel really jarring and out of place. I loved him in Batman v Superman but not quite so much here in Suicide Squad.While Suicide Squad does offer some form of entertainment, like other films in the DCEU, it does so with glaring issues you'd think they'd learn from. It's not the end of the world mind, remember the MCU had two not so well received films that followed Iron Man and look what they've gone on to achieve. It just means a lot rides on Wonder Woman so no pressure DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Not Great Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a bit of a surprise when DC and Warner Bros. announced a Suicide Squad movie a few years back. While the team made up of super villains forced into doing good by the US government has long been a fan favorite, it was an odd choice for the third movie in the shared DC universe of movies following Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I still personally feel that way after seeing Suicide Squad. While the movie is leagues better than most critics want you to believe it is, it's also not as good as most fans were wanting it to be either. Instead, Suicide Squad is a flawed, yet occasionally fun comic book movie that will appease some, but not all.The movie opens with a series of vignettes setting up the primary members of the Suicide Squad: Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flagg, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang, Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje's Killer Croc, and Jay Hernandez's Diablo. They are all brought together by a morally dubious US agent by the name of Amanda Waller (played exceptionally by Viola Davis), to go into the fictional metropolis of Midway City to stop a supernatural threat that threatens the entire world. Once the Suicide Squad sets down in Midway City, the movie really starts to take off with wall-to-wall action, but the first forty-five minutes of set up really keeps the movie ever from gaining much momentum upfront. On top of that, as a DC Comics fanboy, I found many of the portrayals of the characters lacking.While it is fun to see the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, on the bigscreen for the first time, I don't think writer/director David Ayer handled her well. Personally, I feel Margot Robbie was well cast, but she lacked the right material to make Harley the Harley from the comic books. The way Harley is written in this movie is a little too flirtatious for my liking, missing that naive quality that makes her so irresistibly entertaining in the comics. Then there is the bigger issue of the portrayal of Harley's puddin', Mr. J himself, the Joker. Actor Jared Leto and Ayer seemed to want to turn the Joker more into a gangsta rather than a gangster, and I'm not really sure I like that angle, with the metal teeth just annoying me as a fanboy. Of course I could live with the appearance of the character if he acted like the comic book Joker for most of the movie, but the way the character is portrayed, he rarely does. He often comes across serious in most of his scenes, which is in stark contrast to every other Joker portrayal ever. Honestly, Jared Leto was always going to have a tough row to hoe with him being the first actor to follow Heath Ledger in the role, and unfortunately, while they tried to differentiate Leto's Joker from Heath's Joker, in the end, they might have tried too much. Now while I took issue with some of the characterizations in this movie, there were some that were spot on.Viola Davis is absolutely perfect as Amanda Waller, getting the authoritative swagger of the character down pat. Then there's Will Smith as Deadshot, who is essentially being Will Smith as a hit-man for hire, but his Deadshot works in areas where some of the other characters don't by injecting appropriate doses of humor and empathy into the role. And I can't go on without mentioning Karen Fukuhara as Katana, the sword- wielding ninja that comes in to protect Waller's liaison, Rick Flagg, from being turned on by the squad. Katana is not handled with as much attention as I wish she would have been, but Fukuhara makes the most of her limited screen time and really nails the silent, but deadly demeanor of the character. As well, while Ben Affleck is literally only in about two to three minutes of the whole movie, he continues to make a good impression as Batman. Sprinkle on top some action that is fun to watch unfold, and you have a Summer blockbuster that is more entertaining than it's not.All in all, Suicide Squad is a movie that is enjoyable enough to warrant seeing if you're a fanboy, but you'll still probably come away with a few quibbles of your own. I am still baffled as to why DC isn't choosing to be like Marvel and be more faithful to the comic books with most of their characters, but Suicide Squad does manage to get right more than it gets wrong. As far as the three movies currently in the DC Extended Universe, I'd have to say Suicide Squad is the weakest of the three, weaker than both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, which I still personally feel is the best of the flawed bunch.I give Suicide Squad a 6 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started out great. The characters and their backstory were presented really good and they were interesting, it actually looked cool, the action scenes were good and the music was amazing.Margot Robbie was great, Will smith had some of the best lines and even Jay Courtney was good but by the middle i started realizing all its style and cool use of music was to compensate for horribly written dialogue and plot holes.What I hated the most? The guy that was never introduced but then suddenly he was on the squad just to be killed of, the cheesiness of the slow motion, the terrible jokes and awful dialogue, how they became a "family" and friends out of the freaking nowhere, how everyone just ignored diablo just died, how the whole premise relied on Waller being able to control Flag through his girlfriend because she was inevitably one with the enchantress in the end just as easy she was set free (in an incredibly cheesy scene). The batman scenes are awkward and out of place, Batman gritty version looked awkward inside a childish movie.And now, the Joker. Why on earth did the joker looked like a gangster trying too hard to be edgy? This was a horrible horrible rendition of the character. And i love Jared Leto. And this terrible characterization is more of a writing issue but still i was so disappointed. He was not awesomely mad and crazy he was just awkward... the whole movie he was a thug with money and a bunch of guys that worked with him for money. And his relationship with Harley Quinn was great on paper. But as portrait it looked so childish and non sense. With a more serious joker the same scenes would have been great, but this joker just overacted everything. And that laugh? Oh my god what a horrible laugh. It was not awesomely wicked, it was not hunting, it wasn't even the right amount of annoying, it was awkward.Honestly i just want to erase this movie out of my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deadshot and Harley Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide SquadFirst thing's first: I had a good time. Second: the film is a mess in terms of dialogue, screenplay, and editing. Many times I was left scratching my head thinking "if he did this why would he do this?" or "why would that character even do that?" Without spoiling there were too many moments of just bafflement as to why the characters did the things they did.The movie should be called the Deadshot and Harley Quin movie because that's what it is. Who cares about Killer Croc? Um...I do. I grew up watching Batman: The Animated Series. Captain Boomerang gets one or two short clips, Diablo gets about three. Deadshot and Harley get the rest of the entire movie. Will Smith, it must have been in his contract that he gets the most dialogue and best action scenes. You might have heard that Will Smith refused to work with Tarantino because he wanted to be the one who killed an important character at the end of Django. I'm not surprised that he got a chance to be the main character in this film.Harley Quinn: Margot Robbie, probably my favorite performance of hers, that being said she hasn't been in that good of movies. Exception: The Wolf of Wall Street. She has the perfect voice for it and do I wish they had developed her backstory a tad better, yeah. Best actor in the film.Amanda Waller, Viola Davis can have the stern mean look on her face but don't wear it throughout the film. Oh you're going to do that anyways? Okay. Her character is boring, and there's no meaningful connection to her, plus what she does with the Suicide Squad is just counter-intuitive.Jay Hernandez plays Diablo and has an interesting backstory. I don't really remember him from the animated series. He burns things, that's his power. There are moments when he's on screen where the things he does do not portray the character we've been introduced to. Slopping storytelling but overall good performance.Joker: Jared Leto plays his version of the joker. Does his impression of the joker change through the film. You betcha. Close your eyes for a moment when he talks and imagine Richard Nixon. Yeah. Then sometimes he sounds more like Heath Ledger. Never once did I get a Mark Hamill style voice. I get that he's trying to be his own but stick to a voice to be consistent. Other than that there's not much else to talk about the other characters of the suicide squad since the rest do pretty much nothing and the baddie in the film also acts stereotypical and dances through the monologue. Not in a good way either.Verdict: Is it a popcorn movie with mindless fun like Transformers. Yes. Does it do the characters justice? Some. Does it have problems. Yeah, lots. Should you still go see it? Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yup, ridiculous. I've been waiting too long for the new Joker and I absolutely disappointed. There's only a few scenes about Joker, you totally waste Joker's potential. I know this's not a Joker that everyone knew but I'm OK with that, in fact, I love Jared Leto performance but it too short. I also love Margot Robbie performance too, they both re-create the image of Joker and Harley that I've never seen before. Now is the ridiculous part. Can you take care of your story's plot more please, it's so predictable, so lame and there's nothing interesting at all. Worse, there's some point in the plot doesn't make any sense. Not only Joker, you also waste a lot of the other star's potential. Please, instead of making a movie with a ton of star or doing some thing to hype us, just somehow, try to make the story's plot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I had very low expectations. I had seen early reviews, and they weren't pretty. What I got from the movie was something I wasn't expecting. It wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the word, but the low scores it's receiving aren't warranted either. There are certainly problems with the movie, the pacing was weird, the editing was the worst aspect of the movie and made it hard to follow, at times. And as far as characters go, I found the joker the most annoying part. Character development could have been a tad bit better as well, you only got the back story on a couple of the characters. And some of the characters felt like your prototypical throw away villains. The story wasn't an overly complicated one, but it was enough to keep me intrigued. There were a few twists, but nothing an average movie goer wouldn't have foreseen. I think the most disappointing thing, for me, is that this title had so much potential, and DC kind of dropped the ball by making an average movie.All in all, even with these problems it wasn't a bad movie. 5 to 6 out of 10 seems appropriate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you hate me, hear me out: this movie wasn't necessarily bad: it just wasn't good. It definitely did not meet expectations, and people that don't admit that are quite sincerely kidding themselves.Listen: the show is so scripted and you can just hear it in every, single, scene. Sure, it's cutesy and funny, you laugh here and there, but even more so, you face palm yourself because it all sounds like it was written two days ago, filmed yesterday, and released today. Really, it sounds like that. The script is terrible, well, either that or the director executes the script very poorly on screen.In addition, the plot. Oh, the plot. So interesting: it is so predictable at parts, but then so flat out confusing at others that it is hard to feel emotionally connected to it. It's tough when the whole time you are squinting trying to understand exactly how everything is connected.The back stories of the characters, I mean, they tried. But, to be honest, it wasn't motivating. Harley Quinn, who was supposed to be the most BA character in the whole movie, who basically was the key marketing item in the film (yes, even bigger than Deadshot), was weak! This is NOT a spoiler when I say she really wasn't all that intimidating. They tried, but I wasn't convinced.Will Smith does go through his role well. He deserves the most credit. Other characters, though? Ugh...that's just how I felt. Listen: they rushed this, folks. I'm serious. This film was rushed and you felt it the whole time. Basically zero character development, jokes that basically fall flat, and a waste of talent in actors. I'm excited for other DC movies to come out, still, but this one is not going to be their golden child, let me tell you.Like I said, don't be a hater, but, c'mon, you have to admit this wasn't that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***This review may contain spoilers***I'm writing this review as a movie fan, not a comic book fan. I went to see it last night, and I expected a lot even though I heard all the critics. So here are a couple of facts about what I saw:- Wrong casting for Rick Flag. Jared Leto was used so much for marketing, but Joker was so unnecessary in this plot, the movie would be basically the same without him. Margot Robbie was perfect choice for Harley Quinn. I think they wanted to put so many things in one movie that nothing made sense. You see in flashbacks their backstories but at the end of the day you have no clue why are they who/what they are. They didn't use enormous talent of Viola Davis in a right way, none of her actions are explained, and she seems to be the way she is for no reason. (you'll see) Cara Delevingne, not quite sure why they chose her for the role. They tried to be funny, they failed. - At the beginning of the film it seemed to me that the director is very bold and crazy (in a good way) and my opinion changed after a couple of minutes. Katana, El Diablo, Killer Croc and Boomerang could have been done better. Amazing soundtrack. Harley was the only fun character and Boomerang had only one funny line, but I have to admit, I laughed at his one line more than anything else in the film. So, basically, my conclusion is:It is not a BAD movie, it is movie with potential that finished in a wrong hands. They should have done a movie about Harley, Joker or Deadshot, since they gave them so much screen time, or maybe do a movie about every character and then suicide squad (Avengers style) It would be so much better!!!! Since the basic plot line (bad vs bad) is similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, I have to say that Guardians are better for about million!Go see this film, but be ready not to like it as much as you want!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I'd like to state that I do not read comic books, nor am I in anyway engaged in the DC universe. I just really (really) love movies.For me this is the type of movie which, in my mind, gets categorized in a certain group. A group which, in my opinion, already has an abundance of likewise movies in it. Easy, simple and entertaining would be a good name to paste on this group. Because that is what this movie is. Simply entertaining. Like all movies in this imaginary category it: Is minimally re- watchable, doesn't have a rock solid plot, it contains many stereotypes and clichés,...etc I know it may now sound like I am bashing this movie, and you might be left thinking: "Why bother giving it a six, then?". Because the truth is, we all sometimes prefer to mindlessly watch a blockbusting, action-y movie, with many explosions, gun fire, and a few jokes here and there. And this is absolutely okay, but if I was considering too see this movie, I would like someone to tell me what I was committing the following two hours to. And no, I don't despise this movie in any way. I just expected something different, seeing the marketing/budget and all.The biggest turnoff for me was that it seemed too typical. Like, if you expect it to be a hilarious film filled with witty jokes(i.e. Deadpool) then, I'm sorry to have to upset you but you will not be getting what you paid for. If you are expecting a bad-ass, ruthless movie (which I don't blame you for wanting, since it's a movie filled with a ton of villains). Then once again I have to let you down. Suicide Squad is somewhere in between these two movies. And no, this is not a good thing, because, simply put, there are already a too many movies like this.Also, finally I would like to say a last thing. Which is something that can only be said about few movies: Suicide Squad would have benefited from a lower budget. But you will notice this when you see the movie for yourself. TL;DR If all you want is mindless entertainment (I don't blame you, sometimes we are just in the mood for this.) this movie will definitely satisfy (if you know what to expect). But for anything other than that, I don't recommend this movie. Still it will be worth watching when it premieres on cable. Lucas Deijkers</fullReview>

Instead, it went way out of line and made it very confusing and ridiculous. I don't think that the overall story is bad. I can really see how this film could have been really good, but it's so obviously flawed. There are some really good scenes and some characters are even spot on, but it's hard to watch some scenes and not really know what they want you to feel. Overall a very strange film and I think they had a much better Suicide Squad in the TV-series "The Arrow" in S2E14 (though the series is overall very mediocre and boring) I expected much more. This is not science fiction. This is fantasy.</fullReview>

No character gets development or depth: Most of them getting clichéd backstories and the rest are appeared without a reason or explanation. The script is very bad: Incoherent, idiotic and uninteresting. I don't know what this movie was about and I don't care about that. The direction is childish, enthusiastic and makes headache. I was so relieve when this cinematic nightmare was end.Margot Robbie was cute as Harley Queen but her gimmick is runs its course in the middle of the film. Will Smith, most of the time with a lot of charisma, is doing nothing but reciting his clichéd script lines. Jared Leto isn't bad but he misses the character of the Joker: He supposes to be scary and threatening, not cool mobster with green colored hair and face with white makeup.I suffered in that film. I wish 'Suicide Squad' will be a huge failure that bury the DCCU. I have no more expectations from the future films of that cinematic universe. Marvel and Deadpool wins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not trash, but neither treasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the record, I wish to state that I don't read the comics, my interest in these characters is casual. I was excited for this film, hoping that it would be the break DC and Warner needed to perhaps challenge the Marvel machine. When this film came out and the news trickled down to me that it just another disappointment, I almost chose not to see it.I'm glad I saw it anyway. Those that say this movie is a disaster are over reacting. I'm not saying it's perfect; the first act is weighed down with lengthy introductions of the Squad. It does have a problem with pacing and focusing attention where it should. Harley Quinn and Deadshot get layers of attention and backstory, while some characters are simply thrown in. I must mention Jared Leto. Some complain he doesn't leave a huge impression and falls flat; I argue no. The Joker is not a member of the Suicide Squad, therefore not a main player of the movie. Sure, we all like to see plenty of Joker, but Harley Quinn takes the spotlight, as she should. This is HER movie, not his. And hey, we can't all be Heath Ledger's Joker.Overall, I enjoyed it. I hope they bring out the promised Harley Quinn spin off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was not quite at all like the comic, but totally Hollywood style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So aside from having big willy smith in this film as deadshot, which would explain why he could not be bothered to be in independence day, jered leto portrays the joker , in what fans, since the first trailers were out lat year, have dubbed a travesty.Now in all fairness the joker is a hard character to do, and leto kinda sounded awesome playing him, and was okay to watch, for a modern, methed out gang banger version of the arch villain.Without Harley quinn occasionally being scantily clad, baring most of her two little petite cupcake cheeks, this would have been worse.Oh and captain boomerang is certainly not supposed to be the most buff one in the group, aside from killer croc, whom in actually replaced King shark as the lead meat head muscle tank in the actual comics. This was way outta hand and poorly replicated the attempts by the shadowy government liaison, Amanda Waller, to pull an M Knight Shamalayab. The premise should have sooner lead to something that made more sense, but of course Hollywood panders to the dumbest wannabe new age fan person or average jane and leaves a bad taste in ones mouth and the horror of time wasted in ones mind. Tickets now a days at your average theater cost 12.50 usd. That don't help none. So as my well read comic aficionado friends and my own self knew, this was not too good, but we gave it a shot. Don't expect Justice league to be any better, because DC or most comic companies that remain active, don't do things in ANY medium true justice any longer. PE@CE and save your cash, just stream it if you must.5-5.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depends on what you're watching the movie for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Ayer's Suicide Squad falls short in many different categories and emphatically disappoints on more than one spectrum. The bottom line is, this movie had so much potential that it fails to reach. With such an A and B list cast, I was surprised at the result of so much hype and anticipation. Between some specific lines in the film that were very poorly written and painfully delivered, the plot that is unfortunately so thin you'll wonder what's happening every few minutes, and the character development that is basically non-existent (I'll admit that I'm sure the writers thought it too difficult, time consuming, and maybe even unnecessary to include backgrounds for every single main character, but unfortunately this lack of development leaves the audience drowning in a sea of familiar faces and questioning who these characters are and why they're important to the story) this movie, as disappointing as it may seem, tries so hard to be something it simply is not. Jared Leto's Joker was average in my opinion, but credit to him. Honestly, how is anyone supposed to play that character now after Ledger perfected it eight years ago? Will Smith and Margot Robbie played enjoyable characters, but their performance is far from their best. If you're looking for an action-packed display of bullets, fire, loud noises and close-ups, definitely go see this movie. If you're looking for a thought-provoking, strong, character-driven, antihero storyline that flows elegantly yet recklessly, I would tell you to look somewhere else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Trial Trying To Get Things Straight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the third installment of DC trying to build a universe of their own, they commit yet another mistake of choosing a good director but poor screenplay and mediocre dialogue writing and execution. It has equal portions of comedy, action, audio and visual elements tied together which build up the excitement for the first half of the movie and get you to the edge of your seats by the end, of course for the exactly opposite reason. #Yawns That's exactly what happened when a movie like Exodus that started and ran with low expectations, ended with a Tsunami that washed away everyone except the protagonist and antagonist.All the characters were unnecessarily introduced for too long and each back story has something that doesn't leave you a lot impacted when you see them fight the bad guys. Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker can still not be judged or misjudged because his screen time as Joker was smaller than all the movie's trailers put together. And I am still not sure why Bruce Wayne wants to just hand over criminals to the police but didn't wanna show up when monsters from another world want to destroy the world. That is exactly what they wanted to correct after Man of Steel and have committed the same mistake again.Writers haven't spent much time on focusing what Amanda Waller has hired the squad for, instead they keep digging into the stories of each person that aren't essential to the mission. Due to lack of screen- time, all the characters have been under utilized. Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is DC's best decision after choosing Ben Affeck as Batman.Unlike Winter Solder where Nick Fury asks Cap not to trust anyone due to which he didn't call for help, there is no specific reason what shows why Princess Diana, Barry Allen or Batman show up in the current time line to stop a monster that is casting a spell on civilians and burning them to death and a Hybrid monster brother who has been destroying pretty much everything. It is good as a standalone comic book that you finish reading and put it back to your shelf but doesn't leave you excited for the bigger DCCU that is going to get characters Brainiac and Darkseid in the movies to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Producer. Not only who is responsible of the funding the movie production, but also to give advice or the goals (read. requirement) of the movie. Usually even if the director have demands for making decision of the movie, it's all up to the producer to approve or to decline. As the producer, Zack Snyder does "live" very clearly in David Ayer's movie. The color is one of the elements that this movie offers. From the early movie trailer it was all over the scene. The posters. If usually Snyder uses gold to sepia color, David Ayers give cyan to magenta. It was as if Ayer made a cartooned form from the earlier Zack Snyder movies. Sill it was dark.

		<fullReview>SUICIDE SQUAD - My plan for today was to watch two back to back movies , but watching SUICIDE SQUAD made me so much exhausted that i canceled my plan for the second film. And by exhausted i didn't mean by tiredness but by frustration. Things are not working for DC universe. Its all started really well with MAN OF STEEL , but DAWN OF JUSTICE disappointed and same goes for suicide squad. David AYER as director didn't faulted but as a writer he did a bad job. He has done some good writing before(FURY , END OF WATCH,U-571,TRAINING DAY) but he has done some bad writing too (2nd part of fast and furious series , yes the worst one and SABOTAGE , one of the worst movies having ARNOLD as hero). SUICIDE SQUAD fall in the 2nd category.SUICIDE SQUAD is a very limited movie as long as we talk about its scope. Let me tell you the story(obviously in brief and only that part which already have been showed in 4 trailers of this movie). A team of bad villains has been organized. A good half an hour has been spent on their introduction using some colorful visuals. Then one of those recruit ENCHANTRESS goes bad and want to destroy the world. So our team land on the city where this villain making some machine (which the movie never explain that what will it do if made completely) to extinct the human race. Then they fight and they win , and the story ends. SHOCKING RIGHT! i know , but that's the truth. There was no plot , its just the intro , then some comic moment and then the mission. O yes i forgot , there were some back stories too to make us connected to the characters , but non of it worked. Think of this, the movie first promoted itself as a group of bad people come together to do something good , then the movie tries to justifies that those people are not actually bad , but just the victim of bad situation, i mean how does this work does anybody think of that. Why cant they create some GREY characters who have conflicted hidden motives , why they have to show villain as good persons. It doesn't make sense. More then half of the movie is the mission they have been appointed for , that could also have been a nice entertaining movie , only if we have got some exceptional action sequences , but the movie lacks that too. Its just gunshot , some punches , some baseball bat shots and yes some fire (which is among the good visuals). A time when MARVEL movies are making us stun with fast martial arts and chasing sequences , DC universe is still stuck with old slow motion style action. I mean at the climax one of our hero throws a bomb towards the villain , and that bomb literally took almost 30 second too reach the villain. The selection of villain was bad too. Non of our heroes have superpower except DIABLO who had the ability to generate fire. And they still gavecompetition to a 6000 years old witch with exceptional superpowers. Imagine VOLDEMORT defeated by gunshot and rocket launchers of BATMAN , it literally felt like that. It was actually a shame for ENCHANTRESS to get defeated by SUICIDE SQUAD. We get two very small scenes of BATMAN. And those two scenes along with JUSTICE LEAGUE trailer make me realize that m actually in that state where i can get rid of the thing that Christian BALe is the best BATMAN , and i actually started liking Ben Afflecks. But same cant be said abound THE JOKER. He was a really small part of this movie. Not even a part of main plot, just as a side villain who comes and go in between the main plot. I didn't like this version of JOKER. Not at least in this small role. The humor word well . But cant say same about all the dialogues. take this as an example - A 6000 years old witch say to one of our Hero when he trying to kill her - YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BALLS TO DO IT. Really? Is that the way a witch must talk. Action scenes although didn't worked well but the visuals are good. But the darkness of the night scenes ruined it too. Bad cinematography. Which was disappointing because i was kind of liking the 3D at first. As i said the humor worked ,so at least the first half didn't bore. But the lack of any exceptional set piece bore you in the 2nd half. I don't even know how this story-line is gonna be connected to the main JUSTICE LEAGUE story-line. After watching this the whole DC universe seems so unplanned to me. WARNER BROS needs to do some serious thinking on it. 6.3/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers Alert)ALL THE POINTS BELOW ARE NOT IN ORDER.Hope you enjoy it. I'm a Chinese student studying in England by the way.1. The main character is not Joker, not Harley Quinn. It's the come-out- from-nowhere Deadshot.2. The only people who looked not stupid are black.3. I thought that black woman was smart and energetic. Until she killed all her innocent coworkers with no reason.4. Remember we showed you the Flash in the last movie that you felt you're f#$%ed? Welcome to be f$%^ed again.5. Why the hell would Batman be f$%^&amp;*g interested in Harley? Am I watching the p$%^hub in a cinema?6. Remove a sin because that punch on Harley's face makes it funny.7. As the BVS did, all the clues you thought of due to the trailer was wrong. They are here just to fight another looks-f$%^*&amp;g-strong-but- still-can-be-defeated magic-powered boss.8. They destroyed the song Seven Nation Army because all the peak points in the song makes nonsense in the movie.9. Then they destroyed another two great songs. Sorry I forgot the name.10. Finally, they devastated one of the best song in the world called Bohemian Rhapsody just because they need it. This is a movie that wanna describe about evilness, but it was evil itself.11. A man looked like the Thing plus the boss in the last movie...with a ridiculously small body.12. They planted a bomb in everyone's neck that never seemed to work.13. Okay, here comes the Joker...he laughed loudly. He laughed. Then he laughed. Then he killed someone. Then he jumped in that boiled water...then he laughed again.14. Harley Quinn also has almost nothing to do except terrible smile when she stops talking s$%t. That's what jokers do right? Aren't they supposed to make us scared or humored? There's nothing but cringe.15. Harley killed a monster soldier and smiled, then she killed another then smiled again, then another..then she walked out of the elevator and smiled.(Maybe there's another word for "big smile"? My English isn't very good but I hope you can understand. )16. A suicide group contains the one who always laughs, the one who is silent and powerful, the one that is ugly and funny and strong, the useless one and the one who is the main character that has a daughter to take care of...wait, there's another speechless-but-shout-a-lot SAMURAI and another guy who lost her girlfriend?17. Deadshot never fails except when he needs to shoot some teammates.18. She lost her boyfriend and smiled to all the others.19. The phone is so convenient to contact her boyfriend.20. Remember Batman and his friend(s)? Here he comes...after some colorful songs.21. We promise we will stay in the cage in the next few bunch of movies.22. She threw the top secret on the dinner desk...and then he threw it on a car. Welcome to America!23. That witch can go to anywhere she wants to go and do anything. So she steals something from the black woman's room without doing anything else.24. Sometimes you need a silent guy to fight the magical secondary boss. Sometimes you need a suicidal bomb to win this fight.25. She was speaking IN English to others in her modern woman's face and then she leaves that face inside her witch skin, in case the witch dies so she could get out of it.26. To kill the magical boss you need a bomb, a gun and an annoying woman...Guys that's all I can think about the movie. I know my grammar is bad but I still think it's fun to read if you have watched the movie. I always wanted to add some other points..You can leave anything you wanna say in the comments. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's the problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself was actually decent on it's own legs. Jai, Smith, Robbie, everyone put in as good a performance as you could expect. No one seemed like they were phoning it in. The visual effects were good. The plot was shaky, chaotic, and disjointed; however they managed to bring it back together before it got lost in itself. A decent 7 in comic movies. The problem is that they are basically starting their DCEU run by making joint movies instead of stand alone movies. The biggest complaint across every recent DC movie is that it loses focus trying to introduce characters and backstory. BvS was 3 iconic stories and 2 introduction stories mushed into one film. Suicide Squad is no different. A big part of what being a DC fan is about is the deep storytelling. We know about The Joker because he's been methodically laid out to us. All of these villains have just as rich a story, but we're getting 1/4 of the potential in a messy montage. It's unfulfilling, upsetting, and it's why DC is losing.On a personal note, I hated the deconstruction of the Joker from smart, crazy philosopher to badly dressed gangster. It felt like they had no idea what to make him say or do. I know he's not supposed to be a big part of this movie, but what they had him do felt maligned to every previous Joker in history. To be clear, I'm blaming the studio, not Jared Leto, and I don't even like him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earlier this year, Zack Snyder helmed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Now with Suicide Squad (my latest review), he is the de facto executive producer of 2016's second, DC Comics endeavor. Snyder has always been a good director visually but his storytelling comes off as sort of suspect. You can tell that he had heavy influence over what went into "Squad's" two-hour plus running time. Yeah it might be David Ayer shooting this vehicle but Snyder's trademarks are all over it. Ayer is more of a blitzkrieg filmmaker, a cops and robbers guy, Mr. machismo. With "Squad", we're a long way from his stylish writing in Training Day and his assertively-violent, Street Kings.Obviously inspired by 1981's Escape From New York (the anti-heroes have bombs implanted in their necks) and containing a classic rock song to accompany almost every clip (if I hear "Sympathy for the Devil" one more time in a movie I'm gonna lose it), Suicide Squad has a PG-13 rating which sort of keeps it from being ultra-nasty. Regardless, it's still a scuzzbucket of a motion picture, complete with dirty colors, unbearable loudness, and more flashbacks than Oklahoma tornadoes. The simple blueprint for a superhero diegesis is there. Five comic book criminals who are all serving long prison sentences, get a chance at leniency by going on a black ops mission via a city that looks like Chicago, Illinois (actually it's a mixture of Chi-Town and parts of Ontario, Canada). Too bad David Ayer clutters "Squad" with uneven character introductions, add-on subplots, and an underdeveloped Joker (played with kooky abandon by Jared Leto) that feels like its in a separate flick altogether.Bottom line: You can call this thing The Dirty "Cousins". Suicide Squad has slow-motion, samurai action setups and deep-seated shootout sequences that are anywhere between slipshod and sufficient. In terms of the acting, well inmate Will Smith as a hired assassin, caged inmate Margot Robbie as a crazed psychiatrist, and ratboy Jay Hernandez as a human flame thrower, give decent performances. However, they spout one- liners, make speeches, and emote with their scenes seeming out of place and not quite sticking. That's because "Squad" is an editing calamity. It was reported that the film needed reshoots to make things more humorous and less dark. You can tell.Anyway, I saw "Dawn of Justice" a second time and it sort of flowed better. I almost changed my mind about recommending Batfleck's, Bruce Wayne debut. I plan on seeing "Squad" a second time as well in hopes that I'll reach that same dissertation. Until then, I'll have to give it a mixed review. Rating: 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Borderline fun. With too much burdens of expectations for it to bear alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was anticipating this for so long and now it has finally arrived. Keyword here is: anticipation. We must all first do this - check our own anticipation for this movie and whatever baggage of expectations that we want out the door, before the lights to the theater dims.If not, you will probably end up feeling like i did. I had my own expectations and hope for the movie - wanting it to be a dark somber exploration of gray moral characters. Continuing the dark themed of the DCEU. In which this movie is definitely not.This movie is bright, fun, chirpy to a certain extent. At times, it reminded me of the game franchise Borderlands in its execution.The humor for each character portrayed are pretty convincing. It belongs to each individual personality. It never felt like everyone is a carbon copy of a one-note-sarcastic-spewing-one-liner. Never. Each of them had their own voice and sense of humor. And for that, i am really grateful.Even though there are missteps in its execution of its story and pacing - the most annoying thing for me, was really about the songs that got way too annoyingly repetitive.All in all...i really enjoyed the chemistry that the Squad had. Each cast was believable as their characters too.As for the Joker, it is unfair to judge if this is as good as the late Heath Ledger's masterpiece of a performance; since the Joker isn't the main focus here. I will refrain judging Jared Leto's Joker, until the next installment of him being that character again (either the solo Batman film, or that of Harley Quinn's; who knows?) But for now, he does seem very very unsettling. Captivating yet scary.Currently it is on a borderline ratings for me. It varies a lot. At times good, at times bad. I found myself really enjoying it for the most times, yet i can't deny that i was equally annoyed by that constant music.Was it worth the wait? Definitely. Did it live up to what i want? No - and it is unfair for me to expect any movie to live up to my own expectations that i had built while anticipating.Will it address the problems of what BvS theatrical cut did? The most unfair judgment for this film if one was expecting it to. As the production of this Suicide Squad was well ahead before that said film was ever released to the public. No matter how much was done to "fix" it (i do not mind about the prior's dark humorless tone), one can not totally change a film that was already well underway. To be fair, I will leave it to the Justice League to bear that said burden.Most importantly was to ask myself: Did i enjoy it? Some what. I definitely like the Squad a lot, and wish for a sequel after this. Will i recommend it? Yes. Judge it for yourself. Movies are subjective. So is the Squad.Overall, I found this film to be "O" "Kay", some what enjoyable. At least (to me) its positivity outweighs its negativity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, but incomplete mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters this year, Suicide Squad was supposed to be the answer for what would happen if David Ayer glossed his gritty vision over a superhero film that was destined to be dead on arrival. The initial trailers were enticing and opened many possibilities in mind as to how the rag-tag band of anti-heroes would go up against The Joker. For the first 20 minutes of the film, it was a fun ride as the gritty color palette and omniscient cinematography engrossed the audience into the dark world that was built for us to experience. A surprising amount of charisma from Jai Courtney along with a spectacular effort to bring a natural chemistry amongst the big collection of stars headlining this film and the amazing combo of Jared Leto and Margot Robbie brought hope in my mind in that it would be an exciting ride from beginning to end.It was after this point to where I realized that there was an insurmountable magnitude of studio interference similar to that of what happened to Fan4stic (2015). All the signs were there: scenes that would end abruptly, minuscule exposure to the one character we all wanted to know more about, and jump cut action sequences that have little to no meaning, almost as if Paul Greengrass has a few too many cups of coffee and collaborated with the editor of Columbiana and Alex Cross to make the most nauseating cuts known to film. The main difference that makes this film more enjoyable to watch over Fan4stic was the passion that went into the project and the witty writing that came with the interactions of the first act. However, this does not excuse the film from using unnecessary amounts of voice-over and flashback sequences that introduce the audience to these characters. If the film had brought along interactions with these characters that made some sense in that there was an implicit history of these characters that build up the back story naturally, it could open itself up for a multitude of endless creative possibilities that can be presented on screen for the "Suicide Squad" to shine on-screen. The remainder of the film gets dragged by the lack of agency that is presented in the structure of the plot. The final act of the film was nothing more than dull at best, frustrating at worst with a villain that might be one of the most cringe-worthy performances to ever come out of a plank of wood. Perhaps seeing the Suicide Squad go out of line from their initial objective a few times may bring intriguing possibilities of social commentary and even meaningful character growth out of some damaged characters looking for retribution while others want to continue there rebellious demeanor for the sake of their reputation. If there is no growth or conflict, is this really a film or a product? A piece of art to be appreciated and analyzed or a collection of cuts with no ultimate meaning to them?At the end of the day, the chemistry of the characters within the Suicide Squad and star power could be enough to bring comic-book fanatics into theaters, but ultimately suffers from the annoying amount of interference brought upon the film by Warner Brothers that sours this otherwise fantastic passion project. I want to urge studios everywhere that they should not have a stranglehold of the artistic vision that minds that David Ayer and Zack Snyder have over their projects for the sake of selling a product and producing several set- up films that set-up other set-up films. If this practice continues, we may end up settling for these kinds of films that feel more like products you would sell at the grocery store and we may never see film as art the way it should be. Do not settle for products like this and instead, wait for an unrated director's cut to come out (although I have a feeling that's what Warner Brothers is baiting with this whole time...).This film gets an (artsy Play-doh mess) out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the films with higher Hype year disappoints, the soundtrack of the film is really good, the overall performances are all good especially Margot Robbie, the script, well, he's a mess, most of the characters do not develop some the villain of the film is nothing but a development flashback 2min leaving a shitload of things unexplained things happen in the movie and you wonder how? When? And why ?, things are thrown in your face, you just have to accept, not to mention that is externally predictable, cliché, common and after a while is to boring, and the film tries to be funny, it's even in one or two scenes (thanks to Harley Quinn), but overall it's not funny, it's not dark, you do not really know how to frame suicide squad. We were all waiting for the wild card of Jared Leto (which for me is a spectacular actor), and he aprece about 6 minutes into the movie and does not show that to come, and serious? Friendship power between villains? Diablo arrives talk to are all one big family and that only known 5min, DC, has learned nothing from Batman vs Superman ?, this film had so much potential, shame that the bad script the spoils.</fullReview>

Harley Quinn and deadshot were really good, killer croc didn't disappoint, diablo was nice too but the villain, the wish were just a big joke. Could be better but it's still worth your money.

I would go and form my own opinion and hope to prove the critics wrong like with BvS. Unfortunately I can't really do that! I won't go as far as to say that the movie is the 'worst of the worst' as one critic has said. But I won't say it was great either, it was somewhere in-between, a 6/10 from me! I really wanted to enjoy it, I thought the animated movie, Assault on Arkham was great and that they would follow that sort of storyline, with some bits taken from the Batman: Arkham games. But what we got was an incoherent storyline, with plot holes, poor editing and a Killer Croc that was more 'Tame Croc' than Killer. After watching it, I really wished it was a 15 rating. When you have a group of villains, who pretty much assassinate and brutally murder people for a living, and replace the violence with forced jokes and music, you end up with an all-over-the place movie that doesn't deliver. The main take-away from the movie was the acting... I loved the portrayal of Joker by Jared Leto, which is probably the closest to the comics I've seen (minus the tats and clothing). And Margot Robbie's Harley at times, I was like 'woah, this is really Harley', she did a great job. Amanda Waller was really good minus the unnecessary joke scene. Deadshot was pretty much Will Smith being Will Smith aka Hancock. El Diablo was actually really good, one of the better characters of the movie, probably because they didn't force any jokes on his character. Enchantress was quite good I thought, at least to begin with. Captain Boomerang was a laugh, which you expect from the character. And the rest were just okay. I really expected more from the movie and it could have been so much more, but it fell short, because they wanted to Marvel-ise it and make it funny to please the masses. In doing so, they alienated their true fans and made a movie with no heart, just wasted talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to say this, but Suicide Squad is a huge, HUGE mess. The movie is a pastiche of flat jokes that rarely land, failed attempts at creating tension between its characters (that bar scene is incredibly stupid) and laughable drama. The plot is incredibly rushed and doesn't make any sense if you take the time to think about it, the editing is a disaster, the soundtrack is overstuffed (anyone can throw 20 great songs in a film, but that doesn't make for a great soundtrack if the choices are random and awkwardly placed. It was the sense of perfectly fitting into the scene what made the "Watchmen" soundtrack so damn good, and that doesn't happen here).The characters, with a couple of alright exceptions (a great Harley Quinn that nevertheless gets stabbed by the incompetence of the screenwriters during the third act, a barely decent Deadshot whose choices near the end, as Harley's, don't make much sense, and a cold and Machiavellian Amanda Waller), are bland as hell. Katana has a great physical design, but she's nothing but a wordless minion. And she's not even the worst of the bunch. The Enchantress is terribly explained and her motivations are completely out of place. Boomerang just walks by every now and then, with no development at all, changing his allegiances every five minutes. Killer Croc does nothing. Rick Flag is useless. The Joker isn't terrible, but he isn't good either. Yeah, he's mildly entertaining, and I get that Leto needed to try something desperately different, but he's neither funny nor intimidating. He's the Joker in name only. And of course, there's the third act, which is a freaking travesty full of cringe-worthy dialogue, bad writing, characters that constantly betray themselves to serve a happy-ending-in-a-Hollywood-style purpose and poor action sequences.So, to sum up: F**k you, David Ayer. You took a concept with incredible potential and delivered the worst comic book movie of the year. I can't find the words to express how extremely disappointed I am. Please, someone save the DCEU, because this is the third strike, and these movies keep getting worse and worse. I don't trust Wonder Woman at this point. How could I?Rating: 4,5/10PD: Does anyone dies in a helicopter crash in this f**king universe?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film itself was probably better than I expected, I didn't go in with high hopes and I came out pleasantly surprised. The story was alright and the casting was average, Will Smith stuck out as the best cast in the entire film, Margot Robbie was decent but I didn't rate Jared Leto as The Joker. It felt like a Will Smith film and I came out thinking that if he wasn't in it then it could have easily been a 5/10 instead. Cara Delevingne was the worst cast in the whole film, she felt too small to play the Enchantress and the whole film she was in this mist of smoke which didn't work well. The soundtrack was really good and I feel the film would have lost another aspect if the soundtrack wasn't as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matinée worthy, not date worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie because I'm a fan of the "summer blockbuster" genre. Never having read the comics, I was aware of the characters simply because of their impact on pop culture but not the minute details that a fan of the comics would be. I guess I'm the target audience age wise, being in my early 40s and having grown up with Harley Quinn/Mr. J/Batman animated series. The plot is good in concept but junky in execution. It jumps and never really seems to become a cohesive story-line. So many characters are there that it's hard to really latch onto them as individual pieces and you just have to accept they are there. Grossly underdeveloped and becoming caricatures of even themselves, the movie never really draws you in ... most glaring example of this is Harley Quinn. She is less "free spirit" and more "doll with her strings cut". All in all, it was worth the price of popcorn but I don't know that it would be a group or a date movie. It never really draws you in, never holds your attention and plunks along for 2.5 hours. Wait for it to stream somewhere ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great group of actors. Trailer Is thrilling, and that's what happened.The movie started and everything is okay eating Popcorn enjoying the Slash and BANG!! The Joker showed up and again BANG!! The Batman is here too!! Wooow what's going on?!! and yet this guy from the "The Flash" series I believe showed up too, its really confusing. Now let's move to the ridiculous part "the witch" and its stupid machine you can't tell what the machine is or what does't do, there is just a "thing" circling and a lightning with smoke around it. Not to mention of course the soldiers the witch captured and then converted them to soldiers with bubbly faces by kissing them !!!! I don't know what the director was thinking...Regardless of everything the performance of the actors is great and I think Suicide Squad could have been made in a much better way.</fullReview>

We want to rule the earth but let's be sexy while we do it..." Cara Delevingne: "Like this?" Director: "BAM! That's gold!

Intriguing trailers the past few months, but it feels like the movie just wasn't thought out very well. Yes, I know, it's a shoot 'em up flick, but they can at least try to pretend we're not total suckers, right? Will Smith: you don't need to Sandler yourself; you're better than this. Margo: congrats on being hot (The End). Jai Courtney: was than an Austrailian accent? I'm not being sarcastic, I couldn't tell. Jared Leto: I'm mixed here. I felt like his Joker was lacking.. Heath Ledger set the bar for a Joker performance, that could be it... The plot feels like a giant contradiction. The entirety of everything that goes wrong in this movie is Waller's fault; seems like she walks away free and her program is still there (sequel). I think my favorite part of any of this is the ongoing debate of whether Harley Quinn is an appropriate feminist character. Facepalm. Feel free to see this movie if you get a free ticket or want to laugh at Cara dance in her funny costumes/special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could've been so good. It's not, and that makes me a sad panda. The main issue is the scope of the plot. I'm a big DC fan and have read the last few runs of Suicide Squad since its resurrection. It works because they're not trying to save the world. They have a specific purpose: when the US government doesn't have jurisdiction and doesn't want to start a war, they send in the Suicide Squad. If they fail, the government denies involvement and blames it on the misfit B-list villains. The actual terrorist/cult leader/splinter cell they're after in the comics are never particularly interesting, but it doesn't really matter because as soon as the squad is deployed, mayhem and one-liners come so rapid fire that you're having too much fun to realize the actual objective never really mattered in the first place.This movie needed a grounded war-monger/terrorist villain with desires firmly planted in reality. Sure, throw in some hostages that need to be saved and some mildly super- powered disposable henchman for good measure, but whatever you do, don't make the Suicide Squad responsible for saving the whole damn world. The Flash and Batman will worry about that. They're far more equipped for the job than a sharp-shooter, an Aussie with an affinity for boomerangs, and a giant cannibalistic crocodile. Sure, you can write a hack story where each of their individual skills proves to be crucial to taking down the big bad, but it'll come off looking contrived and unearned. Exhibit A: this movie.In my opinion, the Harley/Joker scenes were really the only thing that worked here and they were few and far between. There was a Captain Boomerang moment that made me laugh out loud, and then the movie proceeded to ruin the joke 15 seconds later. As a fanboy, I certainly appreciated Easter eggs and nods to the source material, but I would've far preferred a linear story that gave more space to the characters. It would've been simple:1) Introduce the characters 2) Send them somewhere awful 3) Let mayhem and hilarity ensueThere was no need to freaking Tarantino the Suicide Squad plot line. There was no need for the world to hang in the balance. 4/10 because, despite the script, Robbie and Leto managed to squeeze out a few moments that did justice to my two favorite villains from the DC Universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - literally 'bad-ass'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad tries to be fresh and unique, but falls into the same pattern as the previous DCEU movies. It starts with a fairly interesting premise, but never goes much further.Story-wise, there's not a lot going on - in fact the vast majority of the movie is one long event (where the Squad takes to the streets to battle their apparent foe). One of the joys of ensemble movies like this is the characters coming together and the audience gradually learning their backstories, traits and motivations, but even this opportunity is wasted as all the histories are rambled through at the start! Structurally it's a mess - at 123 minutes it feels quite long but nothing really happens, and some of the dialogue is painfully clunky.So with that in mind, the entire infrastructure of the film is built on the eponymous band of criminal freaks, and therefore the success really relies on how well an audience can engage with them. It's fairly hit and miss. Of course at the forefront is Smith, his usual cheeky smile replaced with an all-too-serious frown - he commands most of the screen presence and deservedly so! Robbie tries her best, but it's very difficult to take someone seriously when their arse is hanging out the whole time - her peculiar accent and fluctuating mania ended up being more annoying than fun. Surprisingly the character I was most interested in was Hernandez's, who seemed to have more depth than the others combined! Davis, on the other hand, was all over the place as the grumpy and terribly uncool mastermind behind the team.It's not just individual performances though - this is a *team* movie, so their relationships with each other are crucial. Robbie's romance with Leto's Joker (who we didn't really see enough of to make a proper judgement on - but for me was actually a little boring) felt almost as unnatural and cold as Kinnaman and Delevigne's. We're told that they fell in love, but we're never really shown any proper affection. Some of the other characters in the background (like Boomerang, Croc and Katana) have such little involvement, they may as well have not been there.But the key question is, was it fun? Honestly, no. There are some fantastic action set pieces and a few funny quips, but generally it felt underwritten and overspent. The volume of CGI, particularly in the final act, was pretty overwhelming too (like the laser-like bullets Ayer took from Fury). Rated 15 in the UK, I was expecting something more along the lines of Deadpool, which despite its flaws, was incredibly enjoyable. For me, Suicide Squad felt like it was being pulled and stretched in different directions (Make it funnier! Make it less violent! Introduce more characters! Fit it into the DCEU! Don't kill off anyone major! Have a Batman cameo!) and now it just feels warped with too many fingerprints smudged all over it.Suicide Squad has enough to entertain for two hours. But with a director known for his grit (End Of Watch, Fury, Sabotage) it's all a bit ridiculous, but takes itself a little too seriously. Too many executives spoil the franchise, and honestly I can't see a bright future for the DC universe. Robbie quite vividly puts the 'ass' in 'bad-ass', but without her, what are we left with?3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Severely Disappointing - poor structure, story and editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally speaking, I'm more of a DC fan. I tend to root for their movies as I've always preferred their darker, more serious tone and better villains. I had/have very high hopes for their new fleet of titles. But whilst I loved Batman vs Superman (and am very keen to see Justice League), I have to admit that Suicide Squad is absolutely terrible. Considering its hype, it's one of the worst comic book films I've seen in recent years.So, why was it bad? Poor structure / story: To be honest, I don't think there even was a structure to this movie. After a rushed and choppy introduction to each of the characters, a bunch of stuff just happens for them to fight. The story is non-existent. There's no central character to follow, or even a decent villain to understand/appreciate their motives. To sum up, it seems like they changed/re-edited the film AFTER they made it. Everything is so choppy and poorly edited, that you can't help but feel large chunks of it have been left out. Undoubtedly, this is not the movie that they started with.Forgettable action: Okay, so the plot isn't very good. But as a comic book film, the action can salvage this, right? Wrong. It's not that the action is bad. It's just that there's nothing memorable about it. Batman vs Superman had the amazing first battle (followed up by the amazing Martha Kent rescue by Batman), and Civil War had the incredible airport fight. Suicide Squad has NOTHING. It tries very hard to create one meaningful/impactful sequence with Deadshot, but it is soooo underwhelming that you begin to feel sorry for them.Joker: If you have high hopes for the amazing Jared Leto and the iconic Joker character that's contributed to most of the movie's hype, then prepare for an epic let-down. Firstly, he barely even features throughout the two hours. And secondly his introduction and the few scenes involving him, are so rushed and pointless in the grand-scheme of whatever the plot is. Again, when they edited this, Jared Leto's Joker became somewhat of an afterthought. There was no real insight into him, no progression, and quite frankly, you quickly lose any interest in him because his role is so meaningless. It's remarkable how badly they got this wrong! Uninteresting characters: Harley Quinn quickly grows tiresome with her ditsy/crazy demeanour. If you've caught all of the trailers and promotional material beforehand, then you've already seen her best bits. The croc dude is pointless and just growls. The fire guy has a sympathetic backstory but offers very little. Jai Courtney is quite funny as the Australian bloke. And although I was cynical going in, Will Smith as Deadshot was surprisingly good (so props for that). There are many other things wrong which, at this moment, I don't have the energy to put down. And as a viewer it's becoming increasingly frustrating to not get a good stand-alone comic book movie anymore. The producers are so franchise-focused that they concentrate more on setting up future instalments instead of the current movie they're working on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CLAW here with another quick Review:Well, it finally arrived the most anticipated movie of the summer, and, well, It was OK. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for. The introduction of a couple of the characters started the movie off strong, with a great soundtrack but these outshines the others, which I get, time restrictions and all. The action was good. Deadshot, Boomerang, Killer Croc, Katana, Harley Quinn, Joker all get their due, which was great to see. Diablo was a breakout character, and had some great sentimental, and action scenes. Enchantress was really well done, loved her transformations into June Moon. Viola Davis was amazing as Amanda Waller. The plot was pretty linear, and the villain was, well, was just there to move the plot along and something for the squad to fight. A lot of humor felt forced, or out of place. There are some truly good one liners not shown in the trailers, but most of them were, which I predicted. The joker was a side character, which was somewhat disappointing, however his scenes with Quinn are fun to watch, and I can't wait for his own movie, hopefully with her! Verdict: See in theaters(at a matinée).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, the best DC has to offer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is yet another disappointing entry into the DC Cinematic Universe. Unlike its predecessors, Suicide Squad is exciting although it suffers from a wonky storyline, cheesy dialogue, and a lack of direction.The first thing that you will notice about this movie is that Deadshot (Will Smith) is the main character. The first shot is of him, the most time is spent on his backstory, and he appears first in pretty much every possible way. This is both a good and a bad thing. I am not a fan of changing the source material to accommodate for a big Hollywood name. It seems like Deadshot will have a large part to play going forward in future movies. The bright side of this is that Will Smith kills it in this movie. He makes the assassin very likable, and more importantly, hilarious.Harley Quinn shares the spot light as well, and Margot Robbie does a great job with the character. She is funny and her acrobatics make for the most fun fighting sequences. Unfortunately, paired with Robbie's Quinn, is Leto's Joker, which may be the worst part of this film. The Joker is not scary, disturbing, or creepy instead he leaves you feeling second hand embarrassment for Leto. Also, in an attempt to show you how crazy The Joker really is, effects are used on multiple of his scenes. The production is crap, and it just looks tacky. The Joker in this movie is a major disappoint, in comparison to any other Joker that I have ever seen.Although both Will and Margot do a great job, it is still a disappointment that other members of the team do not get more screen time. Killer croc, Boomerang, and Diablo all had potential to be great additions to the cast, but are barely given time to develop. Their introductions last a fraction of the time that Deadshot's and Quinn's do. They have their moments later on, but are never given a real chance to develop. It seems like they are just there to fill in the blank space and make jokes. Towards the end of the movie, Diablo plays a much bigger part, but because he was never fleshed out as a character, it comes off as very forced and out of nowhere. Katana appears later on to help control the villains, but she is completely forgettable, and completely non-essential to the plot. Slipknot makes an appearance out of nowhere and with no explanation, just to be made an example of to the rest of the squad.The plot to the movie is very convoluted and random. The action starts quick and out of nowhere. All of a sudden the task force that everyone was against, is now up and ready for action. The plot is often moved forward by the characters stupid decisions or by things that just don't make any sense. Why was Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) building crawling with the enchantresses minion? Why did they allow Waller to leave on her own helicopter with no superhuman protection? How did they allow Deadshot to find top-secret information all alone in the wreckage of the helicopter? Why did Flagg bring the letters from Deadshot's daughter on mission? The same joke is also constantly used over and over. The punch line is always the same being, "We are bad guys." It gets old very quickly. Another card that DC has already overplayed in just three movies is the death fake-out. With the Joker fake out in this movie combined with Superman's inevitable return, it is just lazy writing. Overall, Suicide Squad misses the mark on it's "dark" and "disturbed" target. The film comes off as pretentious and messy. The film is a fun popcorn flick, but flops when it comes to having any meaning or heart. Suicide Squad is another stumble for DC as they try to catch up to super hero flick giant Marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Good but Not Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When leaving the cinema, the one thought you don't want to have is that "it could have been better." With such a great premise, Suicide Squad could have been incredible. But unfortunately this film, in my opinion, now joins the long list of movies which had great potential but failed to reach it. The major problem for me was the lack of grit and reality which would have given Suicide Squad its edge from every other superhero film. Instead it overdosed on CGI and that manufactured Hollywood glow which meant it wasn't as cool and as raw as it should have been. Another fault was too many characters, which once introduced (which was very necessary) a good half and hour had been lost. I reckon you could have halved the squad and it would have made no difference to the movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn carried this film in my view (she basically the reason for 5 stars!) and I'd totally go to a Harley Quinn only film. Will Smith as Deadshot was also good as was Viola Davis as Amanda Waller and the rest were decent enough. However, Jared Leto as The Joker was a bit of a disappointment. I get why people loved his portrayal but all I could think while watching him was how alike he was to Jim Carrey! And unfortunately Cara Delevigne as Enchantress was pretty laughable! I can imagine it was so much fun to make this film and although not amazing, I can't class it as terrible! Time to try again DC?!</fullReview>

Deadshot and Harley are the only reasons to watch this movie - they are the only ones we get any real information on. The rest of the "worst of the worst" are just fillers, because a squad needs at least four. It was predictable, and only vaguely entertaining, in my opinion. Blah, blah, save the world, blah, blah. I did a lot of yawning. The post credit scene is supposed to amp you up for Justice League. Yeah...whatever. I'm waiting for DVD releases on DC movies from here on out.</fullReview>

The characters were underdeveloped which led to a lack of compassion and compelling moments. Most scenes and overall story line felt rushed and there was no time to learn or understand the characters. The story line was also predictive and stale. I will say that both Harley Quinn and Deadshot were amazing although there was not much time available for the other squad members.

		<shortDescription>Shaky Opening, but Fantastic Character Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts very shaky. Editing and pacing feels completely off and the character introductions take a bit too long thanks to flashbacks being interweaved with the introductory scene of Waller proposing the squad's formation to her peers. This long sequence of introductions also immediately paints who's important and who isn't. For instance Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Enchantress each get multiple long flashbacks, while Killer Croc, Boomerang, and Diablo just get a little nod to their history, and Slipknot is left out entirely (spoiler, he's the red shirt). Even after the introductions, the set-up still isn't complete, as they then need to assemble the team and create an antagonist for them to go after. After that's over though, and the action starts to kick in, it's nigh relentless. I mean, there really isn't much plot here at all; Waller proposes the formation of the squad, a villain starts to destroy the city, and the squad is hastily put together and sent in.Okay, so plot isn't the film's strong suit, but it's linear simplicity is what makes it as enjoyable as it is. Just sit back and enjoy the craziness that fills the screen. What Suicide Squad lacks in plot, it more than makes up for with character development, particularly for Harley and Deadshot, but Diablo also gets quite a pivotal moment as well. Their flashbacks don't end after the introductions, as we get a few more for each them that delves into their backstory a bit more to show how they got to where they are now. Of course Harley Quinn gets a lot of attention, but Diablo's development is particularly heartbreaking.But back to Harley Quinn. She's a massively popular character and of course Suicide Squad spends a lot of time looking at her. This is her first ever Live-Action incarnation, so I got a massive kick out of seeing her transition from Harleen Quinzel to the villainess we know and love a la Mad Love. Also seeing her and Joker together was exquisite, and I didn't want those scenes to end. Give me a whole movie of Joker and Harley and I'll chuck money at the screen indiscriminately. I particularly loved the recreation of their most iconic comic cover, with Harley in her full Animated Universe costume. Margot Robbie was also probably my favourite casting choice for her (living at least; Brittany Murphy would've been 10/10 perfect, but alas), and she did not disappoint. She managed to delve deep into the character and embrace both her playful, flirtatious side, and her more vulnerable and human side as well. Harley is a character beyond the red-and-black scheme and the high-pitched voice, and Margot Robbie proves that once and for all. Give me more Margot Robbie Harley Quinn WB! More!Then there's Jared Leto's Joker. He features a lot in the promotional material, but don't think that means he plays a pivotal role. I was personally expecting little more than a cameo, but he certainly gets more screen time than that. He's just like a minor annoyance in the background who chiefly appears in the flashbacks. By the third act he's almost completely forgotten about, and early on his presence is literally just as a companion to Harley (somewhat amusingly). As for Leto himself, I can't say I hated his portrayal. He's definitely the sociopathic Joker from more recent iterations; violent, unpredictable, and creepy. However, let's settle this now, he still wasn't as good as Heath Ledger's interpretation.There is quite a bit of humour in Suicide Squad as well. I mean it could've gone further and become DC's version of Deadpool, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or even Kick-Ass, and in some ways it absolutely was, but they could've embraced it wholly and gone all-out black comedy with it and I guarantee it would've worked. They didn't, but it's still a very funny movie. Jai Courtney in particular was great with his comedy delivery as Captain Boomerang. I mean I'm not exactly the biggest Jai Courtney fan in the world, but he did do a fantastic job of Boomerang, and I'll admit competed with Robbie's Harley Quinn as one of the most entertaining characters of the movie.The laughs are balanced out really well with an ear to the more tragic and emotional side of this ragtag group of supervillains as well. It's not all super serious and dark, but when it is, it's actually quite heartbreaking. El Diablo in particular has a really heartbreaking history that rattles the whole squad in their down time. Harley, as I mentioned, also shows her more vulnerable side on a couple of occasions as well, while Will Smith's Deadshot is rooted to humanity thanks to his daughter. Floyd's always been one of the more human members of the team in the comics (or those he features in, at least), and the movie makes no difference there at all.I could talk a little more about it's place in the extended universe, or the use of it's soundtrack (hit and miss), or delve a bit more into the acting work, but I don't feel there's anything interesting enough to say about any of it. Suicide Squad is not the complete trainwreck professional critics would have you believe (surprise, surprise). It's opening moments are badly paced, mismatched, and overly-long, but it starts to find itself from the second act onwards. Plot is so-so at best and the action is entertaining but unmemorable, but the character work is sublime. Every character gets their moment to shine, some more than others I'll admit, but everyone gets their turn. I give Suicide Squad a very entertaining 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chaotic Catastrophe, But Harley is Hot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the history of Suicide Squad's production. Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club) went through meticulous preparation for his role as the Joker, including mailing a live rat to his on screen girlfriend, Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street). Women all over were cosplaying as Harley Quinn months before this film even was completed. A group of fans formed a petition to shut down RottenTomatoes after critics gave it a 35% rating only three days before its release. So now, it's time to ask: was it worth all the hullabaloo?Essentially, in this first ever villain ensemble picture, these imprisoned denizens of the law are temporarily released from their cells for a top secret mission. The government is already worried of another Superman coming to earth, so they have no other options besides rely on these metahumans to stop a typical extra-dimensional villain from creating yet another doomsday over the world. If they succeed, they get ten years off their prison sentence. If they fail, they die.The result is an edgier version of Guardians of the Galaxy, except without the fun, fascinating imagery, impressive CGI, or anything else that makes this stand out as its own entity. Like any other action movie these days, it resorts to constant close-up motion sickness in all the action scenes, overusing noisy colors and upbeat pop music to add flavor. The entire first forty minutes is a meticulous bore to manage through, as it overuses backstory exposition and flashback on every single character. And yes, I do mean every single one. Anyways, after this torturous, lengthy intro, the movie finally gets started with the villains gearing up for their mission under the supervision of the CIA. It's a pretty wild ride if you are an expert at keeping track of ten different subplots from one-dimensional characters fighting for the audience's attention.The team is not full of the biggest failures known to mankind, but they're not going to be remembered within an hour after the first meeting. From what I remembered, there was a masked Japanese warrior named Katana (Karen Fukuhara) whose husband is trapped in her sword. There was also an offensive Australian stereotype named Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) who exists for no reason besides comic relief. Then there was Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who does next to nothing memorable besides being rolled in a restraining harness like Hannibal Lecter. Then there was the skeleton-tatted El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who stands out with his surprisingly tragic backstory. Then there was the governmental supervisor of the squad (Viola Davis) who likes to control them as their god.The squad does have a couple of redeeming members who want something out of their mission. El Diablo is certainly one, but the rogue gunman Deadshot (Will Smith) makes one of the film's greater impressions. Now, it's not to say that Will Smith was any good in the role, because he honestly does exactly the same routine as all his 90's roles. Even his character's backstory feels clichéd to Smith's type of character. He has a daughter, you see, and she does not approve of his murderous lifestyle. She even puts her own life at risk to stop her father from killing anyone else. It feels pretty sweet, but haven't we seen this before?Now as for Jared Leto's highly anticipated performance as the Joker, I hate to break it to you: he let me down. With all we have heard about what he did to prepare for his role to make it his own, the crew barely gives him any useful material to work off of. The closest thing to disturbing he gets to is laughing like a pedophile inside a circle of knives.Everyone thought he would be the best part of the movie, but you know what was the best part? Not the Joker, but the Joker's lil' monster. Margot Robbie is both deliciously seductive and delightfully psychotic as Harley Quinn, balancing that behavior with a girly innocence to generate a believable romance with the clown prince of crime. She has the only flashbacks that I was okay with seeing, particularly one where she willfully jumps into a vat of chemicals for a twisted make-out session with her beau. Sure, she may have been a bit too sexualized for what her character called for, but I would have much preferred her to be the sole main character than to have five different leads.We've never seen anything quite like this movie, and I'm sure this will not be the last supervillain ensemble picture. I'm sure that the crimes that Suicide Squad has committed on storytelling will not remain in the public's memories, but I already presume a long and successful screen career for the fresh Margot Robbie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harley, Deadshot, &amp; Viola Davis Keep It from Sucking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suicide Squad" is a good movie that could have been much better.The script needed work. There were too many members of The Squad ... &amp; they killed off *the wrong one* near the outset! But Harley Quinn and Deadshot both worked well. Viola Davis has total bad-ass gravitas. Not a bad Joker ... though Heath's shadow will always loom large over whoever essays that role (more on this later). I liked some elements of Enchantress.The action sequences were, predictably, WAY too uber-rapid-cut-cut-cut; when there are fights (or dancing) in a movie, I wanna see the freakin' *choreography*, which requires shots of greater length -- even with a camera that's in motion. God, I'm SO SICK of the MTV-on-steroids, blink-and-you-miss-4-shots clichéd editing that once (like, 30-plus YEARS ago) was experimental &amp; adrenaline boosting but now is a lazy-ass way to produce excitement where none otherwise would exist. (Don't get me started on how editing &amp; cinematography destroyed Lara Croft. TOTAL missed opp.) If Alfonso Cuaron had directed this (which he should &amp; could &amp; well might have; hell, it's better source material than "Hellboy"), with a better script (one that delves into the psycho-socio-cultural/neo-feminist subtext -- and/or the socio-political subtext, as "The Dark Knight" did) -- now, THERE's a movie.OK, so: Mista J. (-sigh-) After Ledger died, I said, "Retire this character. Hang his jersey up on the wall, &amp; call it a day, 'cause no one will ever touch this." I thought Leto did as good a job as anyone could of following in those footsteps -- without downright mimicry, which likewise wouldn't have worked. Talk about a thankless job! Like I said: "Not a bad Joker." But not a very-good one, either. We had ONE. ONCE. In ONE masterpiece of a movie. Time to go re-watch (again!) TDK.My nephew Henry Darrow McComas has mentioned "Escape from New York" in connection with SS, which is spooky, 'cause last nite, in its best, tensest moments, SS was giving me total "Escape..." vibes, as bad guys whom we're rootin' for are stalkin' the mean nite-time streets of a demolished Big Apple, w/ WORSE baddies right around the corner. John Carpenter should have directed! Henry also mentioned the -- SPOILER ALERT! -- unlikelihood of an iPhone app doing-in super-meta-humans. Agreed. Kinda like the use of -- "STAR TREK: BEYOND" SPOILER ALERT! -- "Sabotage" over radio waves during the climax of the (otherwise largely fine) new Trek film.In view of Margot Robbie's performance, I hold out high hopes for the upcoming Harley Quinn movie. (And I'll be there for the imminent Wonder Woman re-boot, that's for sure; been carrying a flame for HER since I was 14!) See "SS," &amp; judge it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK-ish film but I expected more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty I would give the movie a 6.5/10 but it fails to preform for a 7/10. Pros for the the movie: absolutely great cast, all in all good story kind of in the DC universe setting and lore. Bad things: Well the plot and script are kind of a bag of mixed things. It is not as bad as the recent ghostbusters but it fails to deliver( especially in the end). A rather big group of people that sat in front of me were grumbling quite a lot (i assume that they were fans)Conclusion: is it worth the 18$ entrance fee? Well it depends. I kind of liked it but some aspects ( shoddy humor also in the movie) so I am on the fence a bit. If you like DC and comics in general, you should go and watch it in the theaters but if you are a casual movie lover, wait until it is on hulu, vudu or netflix ( or on bluray) Is the "curse of DC" broken? Well this movie was OK-ish but saying that the curse has been broken is a bridge too far in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Heroes Ever turn the DCEU upwards in this joyful romp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the world first met Superman, we were lucky he liked us. Spec ops operator Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) doesn't want to take that chance with the next metahuman. She assembles a special unit of career criminals to work as a last line of defense against supernatural threats, in exchange for shorter prison sentences and other such perks. But Waller's arrogance works against her when one of the squad, Enchantress (Cara Delevigne), goes rogue and awakens her ancient brother in a bid to make humanity worship her once more. It's now up to this rag-tag band of misfits to save the very people that ruined their lives. Lurking in the shadows of this simple story is The Joker (Jared Leto), who can't bear to be away from his Harley (Margot Robbie) and will stop at nothing to get her back in his crazy arms.Director David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, Fury) is no stranger to ensemble filmmaking, and he's in his comfort zone here. Some characters are more important than others, certainly, but everyone gets their time to shine. De facto leader Deadshot (Will Smith) is wonderfully fleshed out as a devoted dad/serial killer, who can fire off a round almost as fast as he can shoot off his mouth. Davis is chilling as the callous, unflinching Waller: a woman confident enough to handle things herself, but not too proud to call for "help" if it gets things done faster.Jay Hernandez is El Diablo, a former West Coast gang member whose inability to keep a cool head - literally - leaves him on the sidelines while his squad-mates do the fighting. Haunted by the sins of his past, Diablo is the cathartic heart of a film you'd otherwise expect to leave such emotional soul-searching at the door. Robbie's Quinn is more The Animated Series than Arkham series. Her whimsy is matched only by her mean streak, though there are fleeting moments where she displays her last lingering shred of sanity, struggling vainly to break free amongst the madness in her mind. Leto's Joker is an enigma. Far too psychotic for your average villainous crime lord, yet too cold and calculating for the Clown Prince of Crime. Nonetheless, he makes the role his own.The greatest pleasure of Suicide Squad comes simply from sitting back and watching each of these characters interact with one another. Indeed, the story is so refreshingly basic that the film demands we make our focus the characters, and how they fit into a world that deserves them, but ultimately doesn't need them. The entire affair abounds in levity and simplicity, two unchecked boxes that hurt Batman v Superman in a way that ultimately caused irreversible damage. This trim, taut tale told in a touch under two hours ? almost unheard of for modern blockbusters ? moves briskly without feeling choppy. The film is let down by a little too much exposition (perhaps necessary for viewers unfamiliar with the characters) and some occasionally schlocky, melodramatic dialogue, but those minor gripes do little to detract from the overall experience.A long time coming since the disappointing events of BvS, Suicide Squad turns the DC cinematic universe in an entirely new direction: one of joy, excitement and boundless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Change of Pace For Super Hero Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the follow-up to "Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice," "Fury" director David Ayer's DC Comics extravaganza "The Suicide Squad" qualifies as a gritty, slam-bang, straight-faced, but formulaic action thriller. Although far from realistic in an any conventional sense, Ayer's ensemble epic casts a dark shadow over everything that it depicts and its unsavory psychotic felons tangle with powerful mystical entities from an ancient era. Specifically, the chief villain is almost seven thousand years old and relies on magical incantations. Clearly, the ostensible difference between DC Comics movies and Disney's Marvel movies is night and day, with DC preferring the dark, while Marvel basks in the daylight. Unlike The House of Mouse's Marvel costume-clad, crime fighters, "Squad" doesn't sugarcoat either its costume-clad convicts or its sinister shenanigans. Interestingly enough, Twentieth Century Fox's three Marvel franchises ("X-Men," "Fantastic Four," and "Deadpool") land somewhere between DC and Disney. Whereas the "Captain America: Civil War" characters survived miraculously to fight another day, some "Suicide Squad" characters die. Most of the characters in "Suicide Squad" are as repugnant as they are unrepentant, and I don't mean just the heinous criminals that the Government has recruited for Task Force X to perform their unscrupulous chores. The trigger-happy dame who assembles these dastards is pretty despicable herself. Unless you're a literate DC Comics bibliophile, you may not be familiar with the Suicide Squad but they bear some resemblance to Marvel Comics' Avengers but altogether lack their charisma. Historically, the first "Suicide Squad" bore little resemblance to the cinematic "Suicide Squad." Captain Rick Flag and his girlfriend Karin Grace, Dr. Hugh Evans, and Jess Bright battled monsters back in 1959 in DC Comics' "The Brave and The Bold." They were all humans and flew jet-bombers. In 1987, DC Comics' Legends Crossover graphic series introduced the new "Suicide Squad" that consisted of an assemblage of super-convicts, such as Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and Enchantress, similar to those in Ayer's film.As "Suicide Squad" unfolds, Superman is still dead and gone. Street vendors sell 'Remember' T-shirts commemorating the last son of Krypton. Although Clark Kent's alter-ego doesn't show up for this clash of the titans, anybody with half-a-brain should know that Superman will eventually make an encore appearance. Indeed, Warner Brothers and DC Comics have plans in the pipeline for a "Man of Steel" sequel. Nevertheless, Superman is nowhere to be seen here, and an unscrupulous, top-level government official, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis of "The Help"), fears that the next extraterrestrials may not be as benevolent as the Man of Steel. Consequently, she is mobilizing a gang of costume-clad, super-convicts that she classifies as "the worst of the worst." When she presents Task Force X, the National Security Council initially wants nothing to do with it. The Pentagon thinks that Waller's idea is foolhardy. In short order, Waller changes their minds. She dispatches one of her motley crew, the witch-goddess Enchantress, aka June Moon (Cara Delevingne of "Paper Towns"), and Enchantress swipes a top-secret document from Iran that the Pentagon has been desperately trying to seize without success. An ex-Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie of "Focus"); a cream of the crop assassin Deadshot (Will Smith of "Concussion"); a guilt-stricken pyromaniac El Diablo (Jay Hernandez of "Hostel"); a sociopathic Australian bank robber Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney of "Terminator Genysis"); a mutant half-man, half-crocodile cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of "Pompeii"); and a specialized assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach of "Cowboys &amp; Aliens") constitute Waller's group. Rounding out this diversified outfit of unsavory savages is an implacable female ninja, Katana (Karen Fukuhara), armed with a bizarre samurai sword which traps the souls of all who die by its blade. Actually, she serves to protect the group's commander, Special Forces Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman of "Robocop"), who has a genius for strategic planning. Oddly enough, Flag is involved romantically with June Moon, an archaeologist who blundered into the wrong cave and encountered the spirit of the Enchantress. Unlike the other members of the Suicide Squad who bide their time in a miserable Louisiana dungeon, June and the creepy Enchantress share the same body. Think of the split-personality of the Enchantress and June Moon as a variation on Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Whenever Waller requires June to summon the Enchantress, this untrustworthy 7,000-year old sorceress takes over June's body. Meantime, an elite team of Seals, led by Captain G.Q. Edwards (Scott Eastwood of "Fury"), are around to mop up what the Suicide Squad doesn't wipe out."The Suicide Squad'' differs from "Batman Vs Superman." Although Batman appears momentarily in two scenes while Bruce Wayne puts in a cameo appearance, the costume-clad convicts dominate matters in "The Suicide Squad." They carry or conceal standard-issue weapons, and their outfits aren't as colorful as either Batman or Superman. El Diablo comes the closest to being a superhero because he can transform himself into an incendiary human torch on impulse. Enchantress makes a strong adversary because she can conjure up things out of thin air. At one point, she summons the spirit of her long-lost brother to help her subjugate mankind. Second, "The Suicide Squad" resembles a zombie combat movie. Our anti-heroic team marches through the apocalyptic wreckage of Midway City as if they were soldiers entering a recently bombed city. The Witch-Goddess Enchantress possesses the power to turn Flag's own men against him. She kills Flag's soldiers and reconstitutes them as her hooligans. In this sense, Enchantress' army behaves like the zombies from "The Walking Dead," and they whittle down our heroes. If a witch-goddess with an army of zombies weren't enough with which to contend, our heroes clash with the Joker (Jared Leto of "The Dallas Buyers Club") who pops up as a largely peripheral villain to rescue his sweetheart Harley Quinn.Clocking in at two hours and three minutes, "The Suicide Squad" doesn't provide enough detail about some characters, but director David Ayes doesn't squander a second as he parades the convicts to the brink of extinction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixed Bag! For a DC flick it's pretty decent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally after much wait I have finally seen Suicide Squad. This movie was..... pretty good don't listen to these haters I know why a lot of people will hate this movie because of it's slow-pace and for some a disappointing story-line. My thoughts on it are that it was good but not great. DC has really disappointed us this year from BvS to The Killing Joke we didn't have anything that great, But Suicide Squad really makes up for it sure it is flawed but that doesn't mean it is not entertaining. This film was pretty boring the first 30 minutes and I thought maybe I should listen to these reviews. But after it picks up the pace and turns out to be a pretty good end to the summer.This movie revolves around the DC comic about the government who need heroes to save the world because Superman is not around anymore {Minor spoiler from Batman v Superman} they assemble a task force of super villains promising them a chance of redemption. If anything goes wrong the government will kill these prison inmates. Will they survive? Will the mission go as planned? Watch it and find out.The story is well-written but falls flat during the third act the ending was very well executed but not done as well as I thought it would be the visual effects were excellent and the film was shot beautifully but this movie does have a few negatives: The trailer shows you that it is going to a fast paced and fun-filled movie but after it is really slow-paced but the action sequences make up for it. What also was a big negative that Jared Leto didn't have much screen time he played a great role but was barely there for 20 minutes. The introductions to the characters wasn't as well as I thought it would be it tells you a great background but isn't crisp as it is supposed to be shown. I was pretty disappointed because I found a lot of lacks in the story and the characters weren't shown well enough.The performances: Let's start with the big one Jared Leto as The Joker, now the Joker's character has been passed on by some amazing performances and Leto's take on it is........... really good but it does not live up to his predecessor's Jack Nicholson was awesome and Heath Ledger was beyond perfection he was amazing. Jared Leto also lives up to Jack Nicholson but has a tiny gap between Ledger. Will Smith as Deadshot played exceptionally well, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is charming and delivers a solid performance, Jay Hernandez as Diablo is very good as well, Viola Davis steals the show, Cara Delevingne is great as the ghost Enchantress and also steals the show with an amazing performance the rest are very good but I'm just talking about the main.The film is not as good you thought it would be nor as bad as people are saying it is a very good movie but doesn't live as high as the expectations. I thought it was really good despite some negatives. It definitely could have been longer for a DC movie there movies are usually 140 min approx. This could have been at least 137 min.Overall, Suicide Squad was a great end to the summer despite some negatives I would watch it again. Final verdict: DC's better films this year. 7/10, 4/5 and the Grade: B+.Do not listen to them reviews you should check this one out if you hate it whatever just spreading my opinion around. What is your favorite DC Movie? cough* Dark Knight trilogy cough* cough*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's the first time I really wanna go see a movie after I've watched the trailers. (I usually don't watch them because I think they are full of spoilers). I was really excited about the movie, the Joker and Harley Quinn are two of my favorite comics characters, I thought the idea of getting a Suicide Squad was really really good and could lead to a lot of craziness, funny scenes,...I cannot explain how Disappointed I am. (Capital D, I need to show it in my review) The movie is definitely one of the worst I've watched in my entire life. I'm probably not objective here because of the feelings I got before I see it. We don't see enough of the Joker, the story is just stupid, Cara Delevingue's character is useless...I could go on and write all the bad things down but I won't, I'm sick of it. I was about to rate 1 out of 10 but Will Smith's performance is good (+1) and an other +1 because of Margot Robbie. My heart is melting every time I see her.P.S. I used the word "really" a lot, I know it, I'm sorry but I was really disappointed !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie a week ago, but I'm lazy. So let's begin.The characters. 9/10Harley Quinn, I really liked the look for Harley Quinn, I just hated the cartoon version of Harley, with the jester look. She also has a couple of tattoos, which I also like.The Joker, some people hated the Joker, but personally I liked the new joker, he was a thug like appeal, which I think looks best for the joker.Deadshot, Deadshot is really cool and they made Deadshot have some heart in him and can do some nice things, I like how he's trying to do good, so that his daughter can trust him.El Diablo, one of my favorite characters, El Diablo killed his family and wants his redemption and have a 2nd shot at everything, he then dies, but hes proud.Killer Croc, Croc is not that tall which I don'y like, I want a 7ft tall croc instead of a 6ft croc.Captain Boomerang, I like captain Boomerang, because hes funny and manipulating, you'll see why.Slipknot, Slipknot dies early, because Captain Boomerang manipulated him into running and get his head blown up.Enchantress, Enchantress has a dark and mysterious look which I like, there's not much to say about her.The Story. 8/10The story is casual, kill the bad guy (enchantress) the squad starts to bond and trust each other, and I like that, and it shows that the characters are not dull, but interesting how they cooperate, the joker appears sometimes trying to rescue Harley, Deadshot and Harley have a very strong relationship, again they did a very strong job with the characters.The Action. 10/10Great action scenes and one of the most entertaining boss fight I have every seen, I was entertained from the begging to the end, and some movies have cheap action scenes and try to be epic.The Comedy 5.5/10It breaks my heart that the comedy isn't it's suit, I really want everything to be perfect, sometimes when there's a joke it wasn't funny so it was quiet and awkward.Some people are biased doing reviews because of it's ratings, and sometimes I'm biased, but I really enjoyed the movie, so it's a 9/10 don't listen to the critics, its a really fun movie to watch. -Thanks...</fullReview>

Robbie is tremendous as a broken woman that found someone to love her edges. Leto is absolutely stellar at making the Joker the most likable evil villain I have ever seen on screen. Davis is wonderful as the 'ends justify the means' public servant.

Harley was bad ass. Deadshot was perfect. Amanda Waller was just amazing and el diablo surprised me. The thing I hated about the movie is Joker. The joker was awesome and that's why it sucked. He has like 15 minutes screen time. I want to see more joker and I hope DC fixes this. I also was not very fond of the bad guy which was enchantress and his stupid brother. I want some one who I know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome film, great cast, lots of fun!This is a movie not to be taken too seriously, it's an experiment and a hell of a fun one, Jared Leto is not trying to be the new Heath Ledger with his limited screen time and more comic book approach and that lil' bit of Batman you see in the movie is not some Oscar winning work. The overall film was great, extremely fun and interesting, especially for people that haven't read many of the DC UNiverse comic books, that get a chance to hear about some of the lesser known characters such as The Enchantress and Captain Boomerang.The overall plot/story line is very entertaining though quite a lot is filled into such a short film, would've loved it to be a lot longer.I myself have always been a huge fan of the DC universe, I love the games, the movies, the cartoons, never really read many of the comic books, but there's still time for that, my favorite Batman universe is the one of which the games are based around, the Arkham story, so it was nice to see characters from that franchise depicted in a new way. I was particularly interested in the character El Diablo, as I have never heard of this character within the DC universe and the actor playing him did a great job, they all did great jobs with the characters they had and the screen time they had.Overall, I can't wait for the sequel, I love all DC's media creations, don't listen to the haters, watch it first and gather your own opinion, 9/10 due to the fact it could have been longer, wasn't too keen on the new Batman and wasn't keen on the Waller character, though she is integral to the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're the bad guys, and this is a BAD movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--SPOILER FREE REVIEW--After the big disappointment that was "Batman v Superman - Dawn Of Justice", I really hoped that Suicide Squad would've been the renaissance of the DC Extended Universe, which started really horribly. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This movie wasn't even fun to watch. Let's take a look at the mistakes that this movie has:-MESSY AND STUPID PLOT: there are dozens of other ways this movie could have been written. But the writers chose the worst way. The villain is useless and stupid.-THE JOKER: Jared Leto's Joker is actually good, physically speaking. The problem is, he doesn't fit into this movie. He appears for something like 10-15 minutes in the whole picture, and I think he should have got more appearances in the movie and be like the main villain, or something like that.-THE EDITING: That's the biggest shame of this movie. Suicide Squad, not only has A LOT of deleted scenes that would have given more sense to the movie, but it probably has been edited by a 5-year old kid. Seriously, I've seen Youtube videos in 2008 edited better. And also, it does have a good soundtrack (catchy and fitting songs like Heathens, Sucker For Pain or Without Me) but it's badly stuck in the movie.So, in the end, I think this movie should be seen in schools by students so they understand what a movie shouldn't be like.It's just WRONG.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh god! What a total mess. Excuse me if I'm a comic book expert but my boyfriend is, and he noticed way more flaws I have although I've noticed just as many. The editing was a mess. I kept reading that quote over and over in other people's reviews and it's messy enough for me to compare to Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.But it's not just the editing. The film is a rubbish tip. The plot, the number of characters and the amount of time given to those characters. Feels like basically everything. Not even Will Smith's Deadshot or Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn gets enough screen time, with not much acknowledgement at all for Jared Leto's Joker, who I felt was a mishmosh of all of the past Jokers, Heath Ledger being the (way too) closest to influencing Jared. Shame. But the main issue is that with no proper back stories, they just throw in a lot of these characters and even then, we don't see enough comedy, we don't see enough action, instead most of the time the film is sappy. Even a Batman Begins reference is included. Sappier than The Notorious Bettie Page.The finale and the villains' villains are lacklustre. Mind you they would have been better as the ghosts of Ghostbusters. I believed it might have been the ghosts that the Ghostbusters would actually catch. The villain are easy to kill anyway and I could easily photoshop this finale for the Ghostbusters to be in Suicide Squad's place. Would have been higher than the 3 1/2 stars that I gave it. All it needs now is more actual jokes like Mike and Dave Needs Wedding Dates does, a proper script like any 80s comedy and the original Ghostbusters.This review might as uneven as the film itself, but the last target I want to attack is: the music!!! Queen!!! Suicide Squad trailer!!! That was fantastic. What we did get? Gun scene??? Kanye West??? AGAIN!?! Nope. This soundtrack feels like the 2010s version of Blue Brothers 2000. You know. Random scenes happen then people stay singing. Not quite the same with this but with the random songs and Bohemian Rhapsody saved for the end, I'm still very disappointed.The few good things: Even with Margot Robbie's Harley, her lines aren't perfect. We need more fecking comedian-writers if you want to beat Deadpool or even Tank Girl. Dare I say Lori Petty's current project OINTB? If that does ever happen, Mr Warner, I would want a spin-off of Harley Quinn, with proper back story, good justice and the most familiar character traits. My boyfriend disagrees with the fact that she is forced to eat in the prison. But I agree with Killer Croc that he is beautiful. EVERYBODY IS BEAUTIFUL! Mais encore, le film est un désordre total.And another thing, well, it's more like a wish. But thanks to Mike and Jay from RedLetterMedia as per usual for pointing out things I haven't noticed before, in order to write this update. They've done a update coincidentally. But indeed, the first ten minutes is basically a whole other film. I could easily enjoy whole flashbacks, even in a separate film. So I conclude that this film can't just be fixed by a Director's Cut, there will need to be a Part 1 and Part 2. And while you're at it, remove those disgraceful, random uses of pop songs.You know, Little Shop of Horrors wasn't always rated 5/5, especially before the Director's Cut came in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story should have started from enchantress character she just like that stole her brother's spirit and gave life to it and started her villain role where it has to be played by her and then squad appeared do their remaining part to fulfill what's has to be do next...Either story should have start from superman's burial service from the Batman Vs Superman last scene by explaining to the government in a proper way when world meets a danger where superman is not available, she did mention it but starting the movie from that scene would given the necessity why suicide squad is needed. In one particular part enchantress is using classified information from Amanda Waller through her brain after she was defeated Amanda is walking like she was coming from a fashion ramp not a limp not a heavily wounded marks. Information was taken from her brain without her willingly so physically she would have in a lot of pain and holding a device and making fun of it like if you run i will press it is very childish move, controls doesn't have to be with her could be somewhere where someone operates if something happens or leaving the decision remotely via satellite can be done. Stunts are not impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>alright.. Suicide Squad was an okay movie. But there were tons of flaws with this film! One in which being that The Joker (Jared Leto) didn't get enough parts to play! I needed more of the joker! And then there was slipknot who died instantly!! He was barely anything.And killer croc.. well he wasn't killer croc. He was all gangsta! The plot was a disaster! Everything just fell apart! But then some aspects of this film were good. When Deadshot (Will Smith) jumped on the car and started shooting everybody.. that was an amazing scene!Then the action sequences were also pretty good. The ending, when everything was in Slo-Mo, that was a good part as well! There were just a LITTLE bit of laughables in this film. Just a little. And Margot Robbie put on a great performance as Harley Quinn.But still.. this film is worse than Batman V Superman in a lot of ways but is still an okay film in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a movie written by a 10 years old child, it's not bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?because it HAS been written by a 10 years only child, right?It has to.The story goes on for no reason at all from start to finish. The characters are all completely useless and boring. The ending is jaw-dropping stupid, I still can't believe how dumb and nonsensical it is.When I was in 7th grade I had to write a little story. Something like 6 pages or so. For some reason I've kept it, and?&nbsp;it was way better that this crap. And it made much more sense. It didn't, mind. Only, this mess managed to be so much worse anyway.Watching the trailers it was totally unclear how could it make any sense to assemble such a team, why would anyone do that, who exactly were fighting together, against whom, and what was point of all those apparently useless characters. And? guess what? Makes no sense to assemble such a team, the confused editing made not entirely clear how or why the villain was created, no reason is given about why the gazillion actual heroes do nothing to stop her, and all the characters are exactly as bland as they promised to be.Also, in case you were wondering, the 3D is completely useless except during the opening and closing credits. Not that it is ever useful, but, you know?There is one funny joke. The single good thing about the whole movie. Won't spoiler it, in case you are unlucky or unwise enough to watch it.The posters are pretty good. Don't watch the movie, just grab a poster if you are a fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked it. I know little to nothing about comic books, and I didn't see the last DC Comics film (Batman vs Superman or whatever), but the Wonder Woman film upcoming looks good. And, of course, I grew up watching the Superfriends in cartoon form back when in the 1970s.Anyway ... I liked the structure of the film, and it was entertaining without being over-the-top lame like some of the Ironman and Avengers films. I like Captain America and Thor movies, but anything with Ironman in it makes me gag. I am not partial to either comic canon; I just want to be entertained.And I was. Margot Robbie and Will Smith were good; Cara Delevingne or whatever her name is was pretty good, too. Clint Eastwood's kid? No. He sucks. And Ben Affleck still has no talent.There were only 10 other people in the matinée I saw today, and eight of them left before the mid-credits scene that is now a staple for these movies. It sets up the Justice League movie, I assume.Not sure why critics ripped this movie, nor do I care, because I have no stake in it either way. It was totally worth the $5 to see it today.That is all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad reminds me that time I stopped watching superhero movies because they looked too silly and boring to me. Then Cristopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and latest Marvel Movies made me change my mind. And now this Movie with a great trailer, great cast, including Margot Maggie, that results just like a huge disappointment at the end. The Movie plot is messy, dialogues are embarrassing, some characters really don't work and others are a total non sense. According to the their last productions, they must have a big problem at WB finding new talented directors and writers. For their own good, I hope they resolve it soon before it's too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One mess of a movie, but it's somewhat entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't been said by others critical of this movie?I have read a few of the Suicide Squad comics and know many of the characters, I feel like they focuses too much on Deadshot (note that they made him more of family man who cares very dearly of his daughter instead of being the cold assassin that he is) and Harley Quinn (They have the longest back stories). Diablo was nice, but predictable until his death at the end, Captain Boomerang seemed useless most of the time, Killer Croc was okay from what we've seen, Amanda Waller is the cold and determined woman that I expected. I'm okay with Rick Flagg, but Katana, Enchantress, the Joker, and Slipknot are the characters who were done wrong.While every other villain on the squad has a back story, they skip Slipknot and kill him for trying to escape along with Captain Boomerang, and his death doesn't really have that big of an effect. Katana's problem comes from the fact that she can speak English in the comic, but only speaks Japanese here. I mean how can she effectively communicate with the team if she only speaks Japanese? AND she obviously understand them speaking English to her as well. Every fan knows they were falsely advertised for having The Joker in the movie (can't say too much about him since he was in for about 10 minutes) even though he wasn't even a major part of the movie even though he was advertised. Enchantress in the movie has really no reason to be a villain. They basically take her and use her for her abilities until she manages to brake free of Amanda Waller's hold and decides to turn on mankind for "Not worshiping her and worshiping technology instead" and conveniently finds her brother in the city as a normal person going to work and awakens him to make a weapon that was never explained what it will do. Her motivation makes no sense and should have been written better.The plot, editing, and humor are bad at times. I mean Amanda Waller wants to assemble a team using bad guys because Superman is dead and to fight any kind of meta-human threat, and inject a bomb with the power of a hand grenade in them for cooperation. That part is understandable and based off the comic. The scenes seem to jump from one place to another which throws off the pacing, also, the constant action to brief scene to action doesn't work all the time and seems out of place. After the second fight the squad chose to quit and get a drink and only came to finish the job because Deadshot said so, I mean why would the rest do it? Outside of Deadshot and Killer Croc, everyone with abilities doesn't seem to use them much (save Diablo during the later half of fight scenes because he refused to use them). Also Batman, and the Joker seemed unnecessary and didn't really add anything to the muddled plot. The humor was another problem, it seems like they tried to mix the dark and grittiness of Suicide Squad with light- heartedness and humor and it didn't work much. It often feels misplace, unfunny, and just unnecessary. Often the humor will ruin the scene and even action.Also, I heard there was so major Studio Interference from Hollywood Reporter, it's it true that could explain many of the problems and how it seems rushed, badly edited, and explanation of the humor and light-heart tone put in.I'd rank as average at best, but somewhat better than Batman V Superman, but not much. It's enough to watch it more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never bother writing reviews, but seeing how much flack this excellent movie is getting really irks me. First, most people don't read comics, much less "suicide squad" so I don't understand how they can give it bad reviews. Second, if you ever read a Suicide comic, this movie is exactly how it should be. I can think of no better way that this movie could have done better. Every actor was on point, it was straight forward and didn't jump around at all. The humor and action was all there, and the visuals were great. DC has been failing for awhile now, and I hope they can ride this wave and continue this story! If I were to rate Batman V. Superman it would have been a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Suicide Squad this past weekend, I was left disgruntled by the awful choices Warner Brother Studios has made this year with their expansion of the DCEU. Though they handled some things well, like the casting of Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley, director David Ayer and accomplices at WB studios failed to make a completely coherent film yet again. I'll start with the negative first and there is a lot of it, reader beware.My biggest issue with the film was its tonal inconsistencies, in one moment you're in a gritty side street being ambushed by Batman, and in the next you're watching a quirky montage of our anti-heroes suiting up for battle to Eminem's "Without me" - what's worse is that this type of scene/cuts happen consistently throughout the film and it just takes you out of the moment. My second issue with the film is what I call the "Army Aspect". The villain gathers an army to distract the protagonists of the film, while he/she does something evil and maleficent behind the scenes. My problem is that we've seen it done already! Not once, but twice with both Avengers films. How many more times must we watch a group of "heroes" fight an army of foreign species? Whats even worse is when they finally defeat the "Army" and confront the main villain of the movie - Enchantress - she is just standing there babbling nonsense and doing weird twitching movements. Frankly she looks like she is about to have a very serious stroke. They then proceed to have this long drawn out fight sequence, which ends up being useless because she just decides to disarm them, it's really jarring to actually watch happen. The movie is a mess in a lot of places.The movie seems to have been severely tampered with the studio because there are just some disgusting and rudimentary cuts throughout the film. There are scenes that were obviously docked from the film, parts that would have more than likely made the film better a la Batman V. Superman: Ultimate Edition. For the life of me, I cannot understand what goes on over at Warner Brother Studios that makes them want to produce garbage film when they have the resources to make them complete and coherent. I wait anxiously for Wonder Woman, hoping that WB studios have learnt from their last two flops.Though I made the movie seem like a steaming bag of dump, it wasn't all bad. There were small glimmers of hope, specifically with Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker. Though he is no Heath Ledger, who is arguably the best Joker, Leto's portrayal was unique and fresh. I personally did not like the fact that he was a gang banger mob boss type, but I feel as though if it was expanded upon and explained in some detail it might be an easier pill to swallow. I also feel like Margot Robbie gave a great performance as Harley Quinn even though her character wasn't written particularly well. Her on screen chemistry with Jared Leto was also great. Will Smith, as well as the writers, did an excellent job with Deadshot giving him character depth and making him relatable. My last qualm with the film is lack of character explanation for Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang, they just felt divisive and shoe horned into the movie.The movie could be better, a lot better and a huge piece of me wants the DCEU movies to be great. I hope that directors and Warner Bros Studio learns from their past DCEU filmography and drastically improves it. I wait anxiously for Wonder Woman later next year as well as the proposed Ben Affleck directed Batman movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a DC or Marvel fan but saw this on opening night,at midnight and must say from the opening credits I was entertained. A good selection of great tracks played loud got the skin tingling. Visually it was stunning, great use of colour, very stylish. A lot of what the critics say is true but despite this it works if you don't take it to seriously and deliberately don't look for the flaws. Good to see a new take on the joker and loved the linkage in the story line to other super heroes . Having two very strong females one on either side of the good/evil albeit blurred divide really made if for me. With so many characters it could only give the back story properly for a few. It did leave me wanting more in this respect but a hard balance to get right. Worth ignoring the reviews and taking a punt but go with an open mind</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUICIDE SQUADThe only good thing about the movie is that you don't have to blame two persons for this disaster, as the writer and the director is the same person, David Ayer. Suicide Squad starring Will Smith as deadshot, Jared Leto as Joker, Margot Robbie as Joker's manic girlfriend, and a bunch of other actors, was carrying the weight of DC cinematic universe after the not so well reception of "Dawn of Justice", which it failed to bear. Amanda Waller(Viola Davis), a government official, recruits a group imprisoned super villains to save the world from the next meta- human who could apparently be a superhero in exchange for clemency and by doing so she instigates the attack herself. Then, we are left with this villain, Enchantress who we know nothing about. The villain is the most messed up character of the movie. She comes out of nowhere, start taking over people and make them do things and it starts feeling like an annoying video game.There is no proper characterization of the characters except for deadshot and Harley Quinn and most of which is also done by excessive flashbacks, yet another case of a messed up DC story. There is not much of a plot in the movie, Margot Robbie did a good job despite of the generic plot and some pretty dumb jokes and dialogues. Most of the marketing was on the Joker and Jared Leto has done a great job in picturizing Joker, but the thing is, he is barely in the movie. we could completely remove all his scenes from the movie, but it would still be the same. There is no proper explanation to his scenes as to why he keeps popping in and out. There is some pretty great imagery and editing but it seems like it is all over the place and it doesn't let any scene breathe. Overall, the movie is disappointing to the level of "Fantastic Four", the average viewer will definitely find it below par.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad acting and so stupid that style can't save it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may or may not include a spoiler so as to protect myself for after I'm done I'll check the box for now. Will Smith is not a dimensional actor. He is the same in everything like a Samuel l Jackson. No depth to his character is developed at all. They try to make it look like his bad guy is good too. Harley uses a bat. It's so stupid that style can't save it. Focuses on dead shot who is will smith. He is a terrible actor. Stereotypical all the way but I'm sure would not want to be adhered to a stereotype. Typical hypocrite. It's a movie also based on Harley Quinn. The style of the scenes, the title and all of the colors are reminiscent of a Harley who is also a suicide girl model of some sort. Sex couldn't sell a good rating on this. Went in figuring it may not be good and wasn't surprised. Was excited after the first trailer but then the second trailer made me sink into reality. Usually when I go in not expecting much a movie can be surprisingly great but this isn't. The guy who plays the special forces soldier is a bad actor too. To be fair the girl played a good Harley Quinn but who cares about that. Leto could have played a much better joker. I wonder what made him that way when I usually like his performances. The joker wasn't my main concern of bad acting though. Will smith ruined it for me. I like to see someone actually research and prepare themselves and get into character rather than just be like I'm going out there as myself they gonna pay me anyways. Total ego garbage from talentless idiots these days only there to add diversity to the screen rather than additional talent. Action wasn't that impressive. Would have liked to have seen more kitana action though. Characters needed more to them to make it seems like they can really do damage. Some kind of real background even added if need be. Don't get your hopes up for this. It will let you down. They designed it to being people out to make their money back and hype sells everything unfortunately so there is no punishment for them making us excited for what they knew was not any good. I will say if you haven't anything else to do its kind of worth a watch. I think from now on I'll pass on watching a movie if I know will smith is in it. Try to enjoy this movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure Rotten Tomatoes' critics watched the same movie I did. I've seen it twice now, the first time, I really, really liked it, the second, I fell in love. To quote New Kids on the Block "First time was a great time, second time was a blast." The biggest difference in my first view and second view was Joker. I am a HUGE Ledger fan, and while I tried not to, I judged Leto by Ledger and that was my mistake. This movie was fun, funny, had heart and most importantly, entertaining. Did it have pacing issues, yes, but note Marvel took five movies to introduce The Avengers, this one takes 30-45 minutes to introduce the Squad. Will Smith, in my opinion, has never been better. Margot Robbie was perfect. Viola Davis was amazing. Contrary to some reviews, you do care for these characters. Batman is used sparingly. We get our first good look at Flash. Leto's Joker isn't in the film as much as the trailers would like you to believe, and that helps. If he were in it too much, his story would have taken away from the Squad's mission. The third act follows the formula used in the majority of comic book movies, destroying a non-human while trying to reach the bigger of the bads. See Avengers or Age of Ultron for prime examples. Several times during this film I applauded and laughed, I was also moved to near tears. It is a fantastic summer movie. Eat your popcorn, sip on your drink and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch Full Movie : http://themovieszone21.com/movie/297761/suicide- squad.htmlSuicide Squad has been the long gestating DC Comics film that every single fan on the planet has been waiting for. From the controversial casting of Jared Leto as the Joker to the rumored reshoots, this is a film that has been on everyone's minds for the past two years since it was announced. So, how does it hold up? Well, let's start off with the great. The greatness in the film sits on many shoulders. Jared Leto as The Joker is probably the most interesting part of the film. Leto does not even try to top Ledger or Nicholson, he simply does his own thing. He's devilishly charming but extremely psychotic. I compare him mostly to Mark Hammil's Joker from the animated series in the 90s. It is unlike anything we've seen before so, for that, I give it kudos. It is pretty cool seeing this type of Joker but I will admit, I would have loved to have seen more of him. What is a good actually is a bit of a bad. Leto is in it for merely 25 minutes tops which is a bit disappointing considering his performance is absolutely mesmerizing. On to the rest of the Squad, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is exceptional. She delivers a performance that is straight out of Girl, Interrupted. She is extremely unpredictable on screen and it is a pure delight watching her relish in exactly what makes Harley Quinn memorable: her sultry psychotic demeanor. Will Smith as Deadshot is just Will Smith. There is no real boundary breaking performance here. He is the lead actor of the film and the film plays out like such. Not saying that Deadshot isn't a cool, badass character but it is just Will Smith in costume. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney, Joel Kinneman, Viola Davis, Scott Eastwood and Adam Beach, all give great performances and there isn't one false beat. There is a true chemistry on the screen that is palpable and David Ayer deserves high praise for that. The film is good but the performances are great. There is a clear intention on building up these characters over building the film which is another good quality turned bad. The film itself is a typical comic book movie of the 21st century. It is heavy on the characters and extremely light on plot and a villain. The first twenty minutes are spent introducing these characters, not a plot, just these characters. This is cool at first but once you realize most of the important plot points are in the trailers, it becomes a bit disappointing that there isn't a villain to rally against just anti-heroes to rally behind. By many standard traditions, this is a film very close to The Dirty Dozen or The Magnificent Seven. It is not about what is going on, it is about what is going on inside these character's minds that really push the movie forward. It is an ensemble character piece above all else. While much of the spoilers have been spoiled long ago, there are still a couple things that will bring smiles to fan's faces. So, overall... Does it break new ground? No. Is it badass? Yes. Is it fun? Absolutely. Should you see it? Without a doubt. Suicide Squad is definitely going to put some nerves at ease since Batman V Superman. But DC has a long way to go in terms of churning out undeniably great comic book films outside of The Dark Knight trilogy and Suicide Squad is most certainly a great start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was super excited to see this movie, only to be disappointed. The good things about this movie are the portrayals of Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo. They were the highlight characters of the movie and the only ones given the spotlight. Well except El Diablo. I loved the humanity of Deadshot and the insanity of Harley Quinn. The action sequences were quite good. Only good. That's pretty much the only good things.There are many bad things about this movie, and we'll start with characters and writing. Deadshot, Harley, El Diablo and the Joker are the only characters that I genuinely liked. Some of the others were useless to the plot and are given no character development.Enchantress was a horrible choice as the villain, she should have stayed as part of the squad. The plot of the film is the squad being sent out to stop Enchantress from wrecking havoc in the middle of the city as she is busy making a weapon that will be used to wipe out mankind. No reason, no good enough reason on why. The reason Enchantress is a horrible choice is because she is an all-powerful witch with godlike powers. Considering how powerful she is, she is an unrealistic villain against the squad. Only El Diablo realistically had any chance against her. Had a better mission been chosen against a villain that could actually be taken down from this squad, this movie could've been better.Joker was also a disappointment. I like the modern gangster take on him, but that's all he is in this movie. He isn't insane enough, and a force of chaos. Just a love sick gangster. His relationship with Harley also should've been a bit more abusive. His subplot in the film wasn't needed. Taking Joker out of the film, and keeping him in the flashbacks could've given more time on fleshing out the other characters. Hope they do better with Joker's character in future films.The first half although better than the second, spent too much time explaining backstories of some of the characters through flashbacks. Bad characters, boring plot, wrong choice of villain and many writing and editing problems, rather than focusing on the squad working together and letting them be criminals who save the world by doing bad things for the government.Other than that, an entertaining film but just a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, bad script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has such a great cast, but the script lets it down. I really wanted to like Suicide Squad. I've been looking forward to it for a very long time. After finally seeing it, I feel quite disappointed. The actors do a great job and they make this very watchable. The dialogue is somewhat cringy at times and I wish they had spent a bit more time building the characters. Perhaps doing a couple of films showing their back stories would have been better. Really enjoyed seeing Jared Leto as the joker, would have loved it if they hadn't put almost all of his dialogue in the trailer. The funny bits in the film seemed to fall flat on the audience tonight. A couple of giggles here and there, but mostly very predictable humour. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Harley Quinn. Will Smith is great as Deadshot. Add a good Joker and you have the makings of an amazing movie. Really don't know how it still fell flat and didn't hit the spot. Shame about the effort from the actors. The studio seems to be rushing to get to the Justice League at the cost of quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as everyone says</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to begin by saying that this is definitely not a perfect movie. I did enjoy it, but there were still many problems with it. The biggest being the messiness of the first act. I felt that there were so many ways to introduce the characters that would've been better than the way they chose. As a result of this, characters like Kiler Croc, Captain Boomerang and Slipknot felt like nothing more than bodies taking up space. Also, some of the exposition (especially for Harley Quinn) was not as deep as it should have been. I was left wanting to see more about her relationship with the Joker, as well as Deadshot's previous life. The entire plot line of the Suicide Squad defeating a CGI witch was rather silly as well. However, once the second act started and the movie went into full swing, I found myself enjoying it. Will Smith and Margot Robbie came through with excellent performances. The action sequences were good for the most part and there was a good amount of humor that was enjoyable as well.

		<fullReview>D.C. Comics is the premise for this, but in putting this 2 hours together WB came up with a film that flows with action most of the way through. I kind of expected this movie might get an "R" rating, but they have toned down the action and violence to make it PG. Even the language is tame compared to many films of this type.Because of the replacement of the mature stuff with the action and fluff, this turns into a movie you can take most of the kids too and confuse the heck out of them. Most kids would not like real anti- heroes but this movie sanitizes them enough that the action is the dominating factor to the film.With the exception of the premise of assembling bad people to do what good people need to do but can't, the movie breaks little new ground. That is because we do the the Hollywood Good Feeling PG ending. That is not all bad.The squad is formed by a Government Agency, and a mysterious type of witch and her brother are the evil that the team is forced to face. That sort of sums up the plot. There are a lot of interaction scenes between the Suicide Squad which dominates the jokes and punchlines categories. Will Smith gets the majority of the better punch lines, but there are plenty to go around. Margo Robbie (Harley Quinn) gets to talk, maybe too much, and gets some play off Deadshot (Smith) and most of the team. She gets to make out with boyfriend Joker (Jared Leto) and their relationship is possibly the most major sub-plot of the movie.Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) plays her role as the top government official in charge of the Suicide Squad much like Judi Dench's M in the Bond 007 films. This is not a bad thing as her role is one of the few roles played seriously. Granted this is not a fair comparison as the 007 scripts are generally a bit better than this film.Spoiler - during the awesome graphic credits, there is a clip which appears to very much hint at the next film getting spun from this one which I bet is already in the works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHAT A MOVIE! I bet this movie will make more money than BvS. It looks like the best DC movie since the dark knight. This movie just in perfect time for USA 2016. Bad People aren't Bad People someday and it's good to break the rules sometime *winkx*Really good movie, but rushed. If they had maybe extra 30 minutes! It was good but in my opinion I think the trailers were better. The thing is that the plot was good, the characters were so cool, but there was one thing that made the movie sink a little: they rushed it. There was no character development, except for Deadshot, Sergeant Flag and Harley. The others were like sidekicks and didn't get enough screen time. The movie felt like it was mainly about those three, thinking it's about a GROUP.Harley's character wasn't butchered. It was really fine the way they presented it, she wasn't just "objectified" she was more complex, I would say just as complex as her comic counterpart, she was someone who was taken advantage of and I believe they all they did very well!!But although, It's like getting the reason of my life back again after all the movies I've ever watched in my 21 years. AHAHAHAHAH. Whoever disliked this movie are really heartless souls!!? Sorry people but it's a spicy bitter no tomatoes truth! So the Joker freeing Harley out means there is a second movie right? Squad Suicides Again! #JokerLaugh AHAHAHAHAH</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, that really was an utter mess.It reminds me of what friends and the big bang theory became. Short 20 second clips that offer a nugget of not a great deal before bouncing on to something else.Like the film had been constructed ready made to cherry pick a trailer from but unfortunately they chose literally all the best bits for the trailer hence there was nothing new for the film.The Harley scene with the lift was a classic example of this. Utterly pointless, meaningless fight, chance to play another 'cool' track and then walks out with everyone giving her the clichéd amazed look.I really wanted to give the film a chance but it was so uninvolving and the characters so unengaging. They weren't written with any verve or intelligence, just the barest most generic collection that you could of.None of them were really bad (as in being labelled the worst of the worst), just a little naughty.The fights felt empty and nothing more than a darkened jumble of motion, loud crashes and whatever piece of music they had commissioned and rammed in to make it all feel really cool.And as for the ending, we had the usual swirly lights and overwhelming destructive power that can amazingly be destroyed with a few well placed grenades.I can't believe I'm saying it but I think B vs S held my attention more and that was shocking.Utterly woeful effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friends tell me that they've read that the studio re-edited the film removing much of the Joker footage. With the Joker being the most compelling character, his near missing in action status left me wanting so much more.Yet and two hours and change in running time felt like an eternity to me. There was little or no attention to pacing; which left the film a bit of a mess. When it was fun, it was exciting. And then someone hit the pause button so they could clue the audience into?In the end, it was as if certain expensive special effects were purchased at a volume discount so they went on forever.Did they forget to make the prequel film that might have introduced a few of the characters or was this free form movie making.Lots of people, mostly under 25, showed up for the 10:30 pm screening on cheap Wednesday. There was an unusual amount of conversation during the film and then everyone got up and left; almost without a word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey! You guys... it's actually a pretty good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is still a good movie... it just squandered the opportunity to be a great movie. I would say don't be put off by the negative comments and ratings. Watch it and make up your own mind... Which is what you should do with any movie really.For the most part the movie crackles. It plays out really well and is fun and exciting. Some of the scenes in this final cut seem a bit confusing and we are learning now that this is because some scenes were changed (perhaps for the worse) from the original direction they were heading or deleted altogether. I would like to see those scenes restored and I am sure the film would benefit greatly and would become even better.Probably my biggest gripes with this film are: The main villain should have been the Joker. Enchantress was a rubbish villain and very lackluster. To be honest it was a very poorly written villain. lots of arm waving and "look at me, look at me- I am casting a spell" for the whole movie and not much else.The Joker should have had more screen time and all those scenes that were filmed that were ultimately cut would have really fleshed out his character and his relationship with Harley. Some of the Joker scenes we see in the trailer do not make it to the finished film and I think this was a mistake and the film suffers for it.The army of foot soldiers that the Suicide Squad has to fight through are faceless, formless piles of goop or something. It made for very poor action scenes whenever they were involved. Could have been done much better and made to seem more threatening and exciting.All in all, the film is a good one. It even is a bit self-deprecating in some parts and that is refreshing. Will Smith and Margo Robbie Shine in their roles. Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker was awesome, I thought. It is just a pity that all his hard work ended up on the cutting room floor and the character was reduced to only a few measly scenes. It would have been good to see the Joker in all his glory.So I would say go see the film. Hate it if you are going to hate it, love it if you are going to love it. Or, like me, choose to take the good with the bad and enjoy the experience.</fullReview>

Read article on this movie saying that this movie has the biggest disparity between professional reviewers and audience reviews. I'm sure the professional reviewers were bothered by too many similarities with other super hero films but it worked for me.Perhaps professional reviewers were disappointed with many opportunities the film missed for better character development, but if one just accepts that this is going to be a cotton candy type experience, you will have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad: contagious, phenomenal, shocking, worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming out of the movie, I was just grinning like a mad-woman. I was thoroughly crazed, converted to freakiness as Harley Quinn--not Joker--excited, thrilled, and shocked the audience with her psychotic remarks and actions. I left the movie amazed and mind blown by its plot and turnout. I tried recollecting the movie to mentally replay previous scenes, but I was scrambling among a movie with so many different unusual elements, with evil and good, love and no mercy, that I couldn't remember. It was like a wild, fun, enjoyable dream you have at night but totally forget when woken up. First off, Harley Quinn, or Margot Robbie, or, from the movie, Dr. Quinzel: scary yet adorable, maniacal yet somehow charming, and hands-down hilarious. She brings new meaning to the word crazy, as she definitely blows that word off the water. She's more deranged than the Joker, as you'll see, but she doesn't carry the same creepiness or repelling-factor. Her lunacy becomes contagious, and you'll feel mania charge through your brain as it had to Dr. Quinzel. Margot Robbie is definitely the new hot actress, and her skill in being pretty, damsel Jane in Tarzan and then being mental yet attractive Harley is phenomenal. I praise Margot, as she successfully created the new female role: the bad-ass anti-hero, not the same-old damsel in distress (Jane), or noble heroine (Katniss, Beatrice Prior), or "that" girlfriend (most of Rachel McAdams' roles).Next, I'd like to clarify my thought on "natural". Obviously, playing a superhuman can be a challenge, as it requires being both physically fit as well as "natural", meaning the audience can believe that they are actually in the movie as bystanders. To give an example, think of Tobey Macguire in Spider-Man 1 and Christian Bale in the Dark Knight series and even Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool, compared to the 2016 Fantastic Four (Jamie Bell, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Miles Teller) (not hating though, I truly think Jamie, Michael, Kate, and Miles are amazing actors in their OTHER movies) and Jessica Alba in Fantastic Four. Spidey, Batman, and Deadpool are pretty "natural" looking, pretty amazing actors in comparison to the actors in the Fantastic Four movies. In between natural and fake, the "eh" category, I'd put the Man of Steel (Henry Cavill), Captain America, and new Batman (Ben Affleck). Keep in mind, playing superheroes naturally, as the role already is unnatural, is incredibly hard, so kudos to everyone who tried (except 2016 Fantastic Four: that was not well done). For another analogy to unnatural, think of the times in movies when actors tried to look drunk and totally failed. So on this natural topic, I'd say that Margot Robbie and Jared Leto was dead-on the bulls-eye; they really got the crazy look believable. I was just shuddering every time I saw the Joker. *shudder* Even every time I think of him. That movie really put an impact on me! Ha!I would also applaud all of the other characters, such as Deadshot, the bad-ass Japanese woman, Jai Courtney (Boomerang Man?), Diablo, and Rick Flag. Man, was I just blown away by the difference between Jai Courtney in Suicide Squad and Divergent! I just wanted to point that out!I don't mean to be too critical, but the Enchantress moments edged on "eh" and unnatural. Again, the natural part is truly difficult to achieve in supernatural movies, but at least Cara could've lost the American accent (and speak naturally) when she was June, or spoke with a less-dramatic voice as Enchantress. Not criticizing Cara, as this was the director's doing. Overall, Cara's part does NOT detract from the movie, as it was fantastic. Truly, I thought I was converted from Captain America-noble-good to evil-bad-ass-semi-good. Even though the last part was evil and not Avengers-noble-good, it was still satisfying, like when Deadpool ignored Colossus and shot Francis. (Not going to spoil anything).I left this movie blown away, the same feeling you feel when you see an amazing movie and want to just see it again and you are just hungry for more. I'd compare the craziness in this movie to that of Mad Max. This film merits a 9, only because Revenant had set the 10 standard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're the bad guys. Well, kind of bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On paper Suicide Squad seemed like it should have been DC's golden child. It had a stellar cast that included Oscar winner Jarred Leto and rising star Margot Robbie, it was being helmed by director David Ayer who's written great villainous leads in the past such as Alonzo Harris in Training Day and the trailers made it look like we were going to get everything that we'd want from a Suicide Squad movie. But somewhere along the line all this potential got wasted and Suicide Squad has ended up being the biggest misfire from DC Entertainment since Green Lantern. The Suicide Squad is based around a group of dangerous meta-humans put together by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) and led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). This team includes the most deadly shooter in the world Deadshot (Will Smith), the Jokers girlfriend Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), an Australian thief called Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), a fire conjurer called El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), a human reptile called Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and a woman with a sword capable of trapping the souls of its victims named Katana (Karen Kukuhara). Unfortunately the film seems to glaze through all the character introductions as quickly as I've done in the last paragraph, with Viola Davis presenting each of the characters in the beginning as if she were reading off the background summaries from trading cards. Even Harley Quinn, who has one of the darkest and most interesting backstories of how she entered an abusive relationship with the Joker, has her history summed up in a very brief two minute flashback. Although she still gets more time to be introduced than most, with some characters just showing up out of nowhere to join the team without any explanation whatsoever. In spite of the core concept of the suicide squad being that they're a task force of dangerous villains, the film makes every member of the squad seem like very noble characters. Whilst the film constantly reminds us that they're "the bad guys", there never seems to be much to differentiate the Suicide Squad from any other superhero team. At one point there's nothing stopping some members of the Squad from simply leaving, but they still stay for no other reason than to save the day. Their characterisation is similar to the crew from the Fast and Furious films. Sure they're criminals, but at the end of the day we're supposed to root for them since they're still going to do the right thing. They just complain more whilst they do it. Though the films saving grace is that it does have some great performances. Will Smith brings back the charm and quick wit that made him a star in films like Independence Day and Men in Black. Margot Robbie gives Harley Quinn a great live action cinematic debut with an unpredictable, chaotic nature that feels partly like the Joker and partly like the wife from the Honeymooners. Viola Davies brings a level of cold heartedness and brutality to Amanda Waller in a performance that is probably the most loyal to the comics of any character in the film. The film also boosts a charismatic and loud mouthed performance from Jai Courtney and a surprisingly heartfelt performance by Jay Harnandez, whose fire blasting antihero ends up getting the best story arc of the entire film. These performances are so good that most of the films best moments are when the film has the characters personalities bounce off one another, like Captain Boomerang teasing other members or Deadshot annoying El Diablo to get him to burn out a room full of enemies. The best scene in the film ends up just being when the squad stops to get some drinks in the bar and just start talking to each other. It's just a shame that Jared Leto, one of the films strongest cast members, doesn't even get an opportunity to interact with any members of the Suicide Squad other than Harley Quinn. In fact, in spite of Leto's prominent billing in marketing he hardly gets any screen time throughout the entire film. He was great in the short time he got, giving the Joker a young, brutal, mob boss style, so I'm looking forward to seeing him in future DC films. But his talents do not get the chance to shine here. Supposedly there was a lot cut from the film, including a lot more of the Joker and several cool trailer moments that don't end up appearing in the final film. So just like Dawn of Justice: Ultimate Edition there is probably a better version of the Suicide Squad sitting on a cutting room floor somewhere. But unless that gets released I'd advise just checking out the animated movie Batman: Assault on Arkham. It's does far better justice to the Suicide Squad characters and is everything that this film should have been.</fullReview>

To be honest the only reason I saw this was because I was bored on a Sunday afternoon. I'm sure as hell glad I saw this. It turns out I was entirely wrong about this franchise... I love it. I had absolutely no idea what was going on at some parts, but that was probably simply because I have barely seen any of the preceding movies. After seeing this I definitely will. To anyone else who thinks DC is overrated, trust me, give this a shot. You will not be disappointed. I cannot wait for the next movie and the ending (won't spoil it) really sets it up for a sequel. Once again even if superhero movies aren't your thing, I seriously recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the critics let on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reviewing this film I wasn't real sure where to start, but I think I'll lead off with my conclusion. DC Comics fans are generally speaking, assholes. They must be. Because Suicide Squad has been bombarded with horrible reviews. I'm here to tell you that this is by far the best DC movie since The Dark Knight. It's funny to me that the fans destroyed Batman vs Superman because it was too dark, too slow, too long, too confusing, not enough fun...on and on and on (though Lex was awful). Those same people are destroying this movie for the exact opposite. Its just too jam packed with action and excitement for fans this time around. Suicide Squad is the DC equivalent of a Fast and Furious/Transformers film. The film manages to introduce about a dozen of DC's best villains along with cameos from Batman and the Flash. They managed to do that seamlessly without the film running 3 hours. No "what's going on" moments. No "Who is that guy" stuff. Was there a deeply themed plot? Not at all. Were the characters fleshed out and deeply humanized. Nope. However, they weren't ever intended to be. This is not a film like Man of Steel or Batman vs Superman where there were themes about men among gods and morality vs justice. This a DC fantasy film about "What if the bad guys were the good guys". They stayed true to the source material in the fact that this was never a deep story arc. It's smash em up fun. Casting was perfect. I say that even including the fact that I hate Will Smith. He almost didn't seem to be missing DJ Jazzy Jeff in this film. He was convincingly Deadshot. And Margot Robbie? Her ass in short shorts was enough reason to rate this movie 10 stars all on it's own! I know some of the critics didn't like the villain. Well news flash folks. All the best DC villains were the stars of this film! I also didn't think the enchantress was a bad pick for the villain. She was much more interesting than some of the villains in recent Marvel films and nobody's complaining about what's happening with those movies. The pace of this movie was quick. The visual effects were seamless and stunning. They loaded it with music like as if they were making the Madden sound track and the Easter egg after the credits was pretty good. I don't know what else to say other than don't listen to the haters. See this one and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Dirty Dozen consisting of Metahumans is sent into a city to deal with something requiring their abilities ? can they be trusted? Gritty, offensive, authentic... as a huge fan of all things David Ayer, this is most definitely one of his films. A very diluted one, however. He brings some of his own weaknesses, and he's hampered by his first directorial PG-13, that he pushes like Sisyphus would, fitting into a franchise that hasn't much resembled his style before now, *and* the re-shoots and haphazard editing of a number of executives screaming about how their, rather expensive, properties keep failing in spite of seemingly built-in promises of profit. It's amazing it's not a complete mess. Then again, some say it is. The single biggest problem is that for all the great action and distinct personality, it doesn't fully grab you.There are quite a few questionable decisions, in particular on visual design. Dancing fire figures, grills in place of scarring, a villain similar to Thor's Destroyer, the list goes on. In spite of practical FX being the go-to, there ends up being too much CGI. The animal and Aussie might as well have been written out ? all anyone would say is "they were in the comic, though". When this tries for drama, we often get sap. The pacing and flow are all over the place, with flashbacks strewn about as if someone dropped a box of them on the floor.There is a ton of material that is very disturbing, violent and/or painted-over-gory in this. I recommend this to any fan of the DCEU(both of you), the source material, and, of course, those trailers... no, really, they did fit nearly every single one of those songs in there. For better or for worse. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a film about bad guys joining forces under the watch of the government to fight against an evil being that's been unleashed upon Midway City, a fictional city loosely based on Chicago but transported to Michigan. The team is assembled by government intelligence operative Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis, and includes a hit-man who never misses called Deadshot (Will Smith), a former gang member who can create and control fire called El Diablo, Australian thief Boomerang, mercenary Slipknot, a sewer dwelling monster called Killer Croc, Cara Delavigne playing a scientist possessed by the spirit of a powerful witch called Enchantress, and the star of the show, Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie.Smith and Robbie absolutely steal the film and are thrilling to watch. There are also a host of familiar characters who crop up throughout including The Joker, played by Jared Leto, Batman &amp; The Flash. The cast is well chosen and all do a great job, although something about Cara Delavigne as Enchantress doesn't quite land, thankfully she's shrouded in CGI and her voice is manipulated so it's not that big a deal but I think the film would have benefited from having someone else play the evil spirit, Delavigne does a fine job as June the scientist but as Enchantress she's just not very enchanting, the way she moves is unintentionally hilarious and quite distracting.The best parts of the film are when the squad are sharing banter, director David Ayer revels in the outlandish personalities and looks of these characters. The script is very serviceable, balancing dialogue, action, humour &amp; horror fairly well. In fact, there really isn't a single moment of the film that isn't fun and exciting. It breezes along at a steady pace and doesn't feel convoluted or complicated in any way; in fact I'd say it's pretty much the most straightforward comic book movie we've seen in a while and one where we have a big cast of characters but a simple narrative that allows us to get to know them and see how they interact without having to worry about a million different plot points. The love story between Joker and Harley brings some unconventional romance to proceedings, and it works. Visually the film excels, from the styling, to the direction and the special effects. It's a joy to watch and looks extremely comic-book like, imagine Robert Rodriguez's Sin City on LSD.I honestly don't understand all of the flack this is getting from critics. In my opinion it's a hundred times better than the woeful Batman Vs Superman. As a David Ayer film it's not quite up there with his previous work, you can tell that there was some studio-pleasing involved in terms of structuring, but as a comic book adaptation I think it gets the job done with a real sense of fun and giddiness. It's very much a Summer crowd-pleaser but there's enough to set it apart from bland studio fare and it's clearly been made with great care and passion. I really hope that if they do another Suicide Squad centred movie that Ayer is on board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first of all i am a big comic book fan. I know very well that most of Suicide Squad operations are Amanda Waller's Covert Operations. This movie is no way near a covert operation. The plot was so messed up, that the conflict in the movie came from the squad itself. They did the same thing as they did with Batman Vs Superman. There were just too many sub-Plots that shouldn't be there, or may be they should, but just a minor reference like only Verbally. I'm talking about each Characters' backgrounds. Guardians Of The Galaxy did a very good job on telling each of the members backgrounds.On top of that, the Actors performance are great. Will Smith did a fine job portraying Deadshot ( even though it was more like Will Smith being Will Smith. I mean, Where is the Cold-blooded super talented Assassin?). And Margot Robbie's performance was excellent, a perfect combination of both hot and crazy. well Captain Boomerang did a well job on making the squad a bit more less-tensed, it was a humorous performance from Jai Courtney. Other than those three, i would say other roles were just didn't quite have an enough screen time, especially The Joker and of course Slipknot ( What a waste of a good character). Don't get me wrong, Jared has always been a great actor. He went to see criminals and Psycho killers for this role. But, yeah Joker isn't actually a part of the squad. And his presence in this movie was forced. He didn't need to be in the movie. But, he killed it. He is the perfect guy to portray The Joker, beside Heath though. Well, I still enjoyed the movie though. The Soundtracks are good, and they rhyme well with the squad. The problem of the DC Cinematic Universe is that the plots are so messed up. It's like they handed you lots of scramble words and you need to put them together yourself and it confused you. They need to lighten up the plots.6 Stars for The Plot and 8 Stars For The Actors, so it's 7 stars overall!!. But, hey i'd rather watch "Batman: Assault On Arkham " instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Good Guys? or Good Bad Guys?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get straight to it! Cons: Film struggled with direction the entire time. Some points they're truly "bad guys", other moments they just seem like costume crusaders.Plot was pretty flimsy. They didn't reach any far surfaces of the brain with this story. No plot twist either. The entire movie, as long as it is, just moved way to quickly. Character building was not a thing in this film. This movie had so much potential to have sequels, but you can clearly tell they will have 1-2 spin offs. Characters! 3 out of the entire cast were the main focus. Everybody else was just.....there! (!!!spoiler spoiler!!!) Why even have a character introduced if you were just going to kill them within 5 minutes, was it a role or a cameo?Jared Leto, he can act, but in my personal opinion, he did a horrible job as joker. Out of all the actors who've played Joker i'd rate him the lowest. I just didn't feel like he was evil or insane. I didn't get any sense of fear, from his portrayal. Pros: Acting! Viola Davis as always, is a beast. She knows how to command your attention. Will Smith was at the front of almost every scene. That was both good and bad. Margot Robbie, stole every scene she was in, it was hard not to love her. She portrayed Harley Quinn to the T, down to the voice and mannerisms. Oh! and Jai Courtney, this was probably his best role ever, if he gets more work in Hollywood it'll be because of this movie. I always viewed him as the new Colin Farrell, want to ruin your movie? Hire this dodo! The CGI was too much, but was done very well. Casting! The entire cast worked really well together, nobody seemed like a bad fit, other than Jared Leto.Conclusion: Film had so much potential to be incredibly epic, but in the end I feel fell short. Should have spent more time on Character development, and on the plot. The plot was just so over exaggerated and plain. It was a good film, with good production and a great cast that played there parts really well(minus Leto) but the plot just was so dull and boring. 7/10 DVD Collection must have, but not a favorite</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magic would be my first point of call when trying to criticise Suicide Squad. I'm up for most things within the semi-realist settings DC and Marvel give us, but for me, some of the Aztec God magic got a little out of hand. I mean Batman may as well be dead if the villains in these things are that powerful. But I get that you need a lost cause denouement before a battle finale closes the deal. I think there is something to be said for cutting edge movies, whether they are full of themselves or not. In this case, perhaps the confidence in its own novelties mirrors that of some of its characters, rendering the entire concept what should be a secret garden for critics, and a minefield for the less apt at subtext. Intentionally or accidentally, Suicide Squad has done something different, not with its style or themes, approach to storytelling or even with the story itself; but with its dangerous attitude towards all of these things. We're thrown into a movie which kind of knows what it's doing- an unfunny Edgar Wright style overblown 'meta- human' movie- and that's good enough for some, but I like to tear a bit at the corners. In terms of consistency, David Ayer is a little shaky here and there. I don't know where Killer Croc comes from for instance and I don't care, a mistake here as he could have been a good character. Unfortunately he was used for awkward out of place jump-humour, the worst type of humour unless it's done by Will Smith or Margot Robbie, and they at least use it to enhance the feel of the scene, not shatter it. Still though, I absolutely loved this film. Yes, it has its faults and its five second cringe moments, and its gross overtones of the words 'fat budget' written on every chopper, fireball or Aztec ring of power. But what film nowadays doesn't have that? The key is to pretend not to see all of it. Let's talk more about the good stuff then. I'm not going to say Jared Leto was a step up from Heath Ledger, but he certainly wasn't a step down. After Ledger, I don't think it would be possible for a fan such as myself of his work to simply say 'clean slate' Joker- wise. But I can compare them. Leto brings a slightly more empathetic approach to the role, but with a darker, crazier variation on the insanity. Our Joker here is a very deeply disturbed, although less explained, Joker who is...in love? Yes, I suppose so. Leto did do the whole method actor thing whilst basically doing a Heath Ledger reboot but with a love story tied in. Now that I write this that realisation has hit me, and I feel annoyed. But I loved his performance, I guess you can understand why. The script, minus the flaws I've mentioned, was solid. And I almost didn't notice that most of the characters motives slipped into any writer's default: love. It's not a poor plot default, but it felt a little tired to me. Regardless, the screenplay didn't get to a point where I might get disconnected from everything, and the subtleties were well placed, the characters well written (aside from the crocodile guy) and the dialogue both believable and collaborative with the film as a whole. What the script also does well, is take us on an emotional journey as well as a war movie one, we do get to see the sides of these characters we haven't seen before. This is one of the things I had no fear that Ayer wouldn't do. But I think it worth noting that this is still an accomplishment to be applauded. I even liked the occasional self-referential lines, which if anything is an achievement in itself because usually I find them clichéd, arrogant and tiresome. Not in this case though, everything was well balanced. The performances from everyone else were just as fantastic, and I could not stress enough how happy I am that the movie starring two of the most stunning (wink) actresses today, only made them spend 98 percent of their screen time dressed somewhat seductively. Stylistically, I don't know what other critics are complaining about, the use of colour is fascinating and brilliant- highlighting the very nature of the message of the film as well as the various characters in an almost impressionistic way. Tonally, Suicide Squad appears convoluted, but one can always make stuff up. It could have been for instance, that that was the entire point, the style helps us get into the messed up heads of these psycho-super villains and better understand their perception of the world around them...or it's just more fun to watch a film at this scale doing something more exciting than relentless slow motion shots of death scenes we've seen a thousand times, or a five minute funeral procession no-one in the audience can believe or accept because the chance is too high that the character isn't actually dead by the end of it- total waste of time. And yes, that was a gentle dig at Batman Vs Superman. Suicide Squad and Deadpool have for me made an excellent contribution to their genre- a genre I would even venture to say is a new creation. I like it, evidently some don't.More from me at edramsey496.blogspot.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but not as good as expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watch suicide squad. I love DC comics but I'm not a huge fan of their cinematic universe. Suicide squad looked different than the previous dceu movies and that was the main reason for my excitement.I loved the characters in the movie. Margot Robbie did a great job, she sounded exactly like Harley Quinn from batman: the animated series. She was childish and lovable yet really insane.I was kind of worried when they announced that Will Smith was going to play Deadshot, I felt like he doesn't fit the role but I'm glad I was proved wrong. I loved every scene his character was in and I also loved his back story.I wasn't a huge fan of El diablo, Rick Flag and Boomerang before the movie but I absolutely loved them after it especially Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, I loved the romance between him and Enchantress' alter ego, June moon.The character that disappointed me was the Joker. I know that Jared Leto is a good actor and I know that he had so much to give to the role but he doesn't appear that much, most of his scenes in the trailers were cut out from the movie which made him an unnecessary character. I don't blame Leto for this, it's absolutely a wrong decision made by the director. I was expecting to see Harleen Quinzel becoming Harley Quinn but instead we got a one minute scene explaining her back story.The editing in my opinion was really bad, the action sequences were messy and hard to keep up with. The third act was weak and the same goes to the villain.Overall, suicide squad is another generic comic book movie but it was very entertaining. I didn't feel bored while watching it. I loved the humor and the characters. Compared to other huge let downs this summer, suicide squad was a decent movie. I expected something better but that didn't prevent the movie from being enjoyable.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Nonsense from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with ridiculously high expectations. That was my mistake, I guess. The fact that the movie wasn't even remotely good is not really the actors but DC/WB and the directors fault.Firstly I'll give my view on each of the squad as well as a few others.Harley Quinn: Margot Robbie was by far the best thing about this movie and she wasn't outstanding. She was really a presence in every scene. Backstory could have been explained better.Deadshot: Controversial is what I'd call this decision. Will smith didn't play the cold blooded killer Deadshot is suppose to be except for one scene. He was alright as he was given a lot of screen time.Boomerang: absolute crap and didn't need to be there.Katana: so irrelevant and wasted, also didn't need to be thereSlipknot: I guess an example had to be made but at least an intro would have made his death more emotional.Killer croc: so he just lurked around the whole time and made some noises before going swimming.El Diablo: wasn't very good until the end when he actually did something. Another waste overall.Joker: unnecessary and somehow is now immune to missiles. Didn't like his look or voice.Waller: quite menacing and well acted but she should have ended up dead tooRick flag: ????So that's the characters so let's talk about the plot. Actually lets not because there wasn't one at all. Such a stupid villain. I mean enchantress danced for most of it and then decided after her brother died which also is senseless (I'll explain later) that she would engage the humans in a sword fight when she has the ability to teleport and basically destroy anything in her path. I mean why not just teleport and take your heart back. She can also give visions and see what people want and yet failed to realize that Harley was going to stab her.Also the villains motives are ridiculous, there is no feasible reason for them wanting to take over the world. And it seems that the suicide squad are the reason for the villain and they are both dealt with with bombs. BOMBS. They could have called in the Air Force to Nuke them and everyone could have gone back to their cells.The action scenes were lame and too easy for the squad. The enemies were literally black faceless goblins and even Quinn's bat could decapitate them easily so why even use guns. The music was overused and the CGI and editing were terrible also.Character development was so poor most of the squad besides Deadshot and Harley barely got screen time and zero development. I mean if they decided to do an everyone dies situation then no one would care and I'd probably laugh.I would not say this movie is better than BvS but it is probably more fun to watch. So far DC have killed superman and ruined Batman who by the way was also irrelevant in this movie and now one of the easiest ways to redeem themselves is wasted.This movie is doing great at the box office only because that all they ever cared about.Money. The trailer gave away all the good parts of the film and so the rest was just boring crap. I'm happy Geoff Johns is in charge now because if Justice League ends up like this then DC is well and truly done.Overall I'm only giving this movie a 4/10 because of Harley Quinn, and Deadshot didn't suck too bad. Poor character development. Poor Editing and CGI. Zero Plot line. Decent Acting but Terrible Action. I'm not going to tell anyone to watch this or not but go and decide for yourself.I don't know who gave Ayer this movie but until I see a Nolan type movie pretty soon I'm done with DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came out of Suicide Squad thinking it was a fun movie, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it wasn't fun, but just an extremely poorly made movie. The villain was terrible. I liked her in feral witch mode because she was actually kind of frightening. But once she became Aztacian, was confusing and awfully executed. Cara does a good job with what she is given initially, but the snake like dancing make no sense with what her character is. She seemed like a Shaman wolf in her first "form", almost demonic, but once she is transformed yet again, turns into a seductive Succubus, or a snake. Enchantress/Dr. June Moone was already a doctor who turned into an other worldly witch, she didn't need to be a doctor who turned into an other worldly witch who turned into a sexy and even more powerful other worldly witch. It was counter-productive; it goes against what was already established as her character ? as someone who turns into an even more powerful someone. Having her become more powerful by her brother defeats the purpose of having Enchantress being the main villain. He in-fact is the object of her power, and creates nocebo effect in which he actually is more powerful than Enchantress. The Suicide Squad being more afraid of her brother and not her is a negative idea, as it makes Enchantress the lesser of the two. She's the villain, they should be afraid of her! She was also terrible because of unclear motivations, and strange and out of character choices.Viola Davis is a strong actress and is good in the role of Amanda Waller, but had a weak excuse for bringing the Squad together. Her excuse is that there aren't any heroes remaining to take down the next bad Superman, even though we already have Flash, Wonder Woman, and Batman being heroes in this Universe. She's wanting a team of Meta humans, but the only meta human's she recruits are El Diablo and Enchantress. El Diablo refuses to use his powers and Enchantress doesn't even become a member of the Squad. There are major plot holes like: how was Amanda Waller in the abandoned building when she would have to travel to the destination while Incubis is attacking the city? She didn't leave the Senate building until after Enchantress set her brother free, as she is seen sleeping moments before the attack. How did Joker survive when he didn't jump out of the helicopter and the missile hit the back where he was seemingly at? He would've died first come think of it. Then again, Harley was in the helicopter too, how did she survive the initial nuke. I understand she was pushed, but the nuke was aimed right at the Joker and Harley. El Diablo is one of the strongest characters, with one of the most effective stories. His backstory highly effects his current actions and is a more positive influence than other characters. The redemption arc presented in this film works well with the overall plot of the film, but does however, get saturated by a simple yet ineffective script. Highlights like this, and the interactions between Harley Quinn and Joker create a veil that elevates the quality of the film. Harley Quinn, another highlight of this movie, is a fun and colorful role that allows Margot Robbie shine in a bland script. At times, jokes andinnuendoes seemed forced, but Margot works through these problems and allows her acting to overpower these lines. The Joker on the other hand, has a rougher time overcoming these obstacles, as Jared Leto is often times seen struggling to out power the bad script, but this is more due to David Ayer directing Leto to be more like a psychotic version of Al Capone, when the character was written more like a comic book accurate Joker. A notable scene that shows the contradicting styles is when the Joker is in the middle of the weapons circle telling Frost to find Harley in a menacing glare, then suddenly leans back and creepily laughs. The other problem with Joker is having to few things to do in the film, which leaves a much less desired Joker. With these problems in mind, I look forward to see Joker in future films, and to see how Jared will do under the direction of a more seasoned Ben Affleck. Will Smith plays Floyd Lawton, another with a nice character arc. He is perhaps the most underrated actor in this film, as his performance is subtle and offers a character who is more normal than the brightly colored Harley Quinn or Captain Boomerang. His love for his daughter is shown in one of the best scenes in the film, in which Batman co-stars. Other characters like Katana and Killer Croc offered little to the plot, and could have been replaced by an other character, or removed all together. This is a fatal flaw in story writing, and should have been avoided by David Ayer who also wrote the script. The music was also very jarring, because they blasted the "greatest hits" and drowned out the actors. Editing suffered from the same issues that Batman v Superman endured, quick scenes that would either move too quickly, or jump from one scene to another than back again. It was at times either confusing or disrupted the flow that the scene had already established. Most notable of these was during the final boss fight, in which the editing completely damaged the suspense establishing Harley's motives. Suicide Squad is a colorful film that is plagued with a terrible script, weird and distracting editing, and bad sound editing. However, the amazing actors and some great characters and their individual story arcs make this movie a slightly enjoyable movie experience</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's OK, the first part is really good but after that it loses the plot a bit. Harley Quinn is pretty good, but sometimes her lines fall flat. Her comedic timing is iffy and sometimes seems a bit forced. It's hard to tell if the Joker is good or not as his scenes are a bit random and very short, sometimes I think perhaps removing him until the end and letting him be a teaser would've been a better idea as he's not part of the story at all. Deadshot is basically Will Smith so it depends if you like him or not! The Enchantress was good I was pleasantly surprised. SPOILER Diablo was built up and then killed off really fast for no reasonable reason, there was a really good twist they could've taken and they didn't. Overall characters were underdeveloped, I felt that neither Harley nor the Joker had the complexity that comic and media representations of them have had before, and the writing definitely doesn't complement Margot Robbie at times but makes her seem awkward. Nothing's really said about Killer Croc or Boomerang, and the Enchantress' story line is also a little vague. It tries to put too much into too short a time and misses some really key routes to really push the characters into our hearts and develop them. There are some really funny moments provided by Boomerang. I don't think the PG-13 rating helps this. I would say go see it at some point, it's entertaining, but it's not really well- thought through towards the end. I don't feel that these guys are really that evil, ironically Amanda Waller does the most evil in this whole movie and comes across more unpleasant than the majority of the 'bad guys' in the Suicide Squad ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the cinema to see Suicide Squad with pretty low expectations if I'm honest. After reading numerous reviews by critics that made this film sound pretty much unbearable, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this really wasn't the case. Granted, it's not the best film I've ever seen, but it was definitely enjoyable to watch. Margot Robbie absolutely nailed the role of Harley Quinn, I couldn't get enough of her. Absolutely amazing. I thought that the vast majority of the other characters were brilliant as well, particularly Deadshot and Captain Boomerang. Although it is an aspect that I've seen mixed reviews on also, I loved the soundtrack and thought that it fitted really well with the film. However there were some bad points where I was beginning to understand the discontent towards the film. Firstly, I thought that Cara Delevingne was a truly atrocious actress. Every line she spoke was wooden, boring and almost made me cringe. I think that casting her was a huge mistake. Secondly, some parts were a bit naff and overdone (note, several overuses of never ending slow-mo). I also would've liked to have seen more of the Joker - from what I saw of him, I thought that Leto's portrayal of him did the role justice, but seeing as the advertising for the film is largely centered around his character, there really could've been more of him. Overall, I think Suicide Squad really is worth the watch and undeserving of the bad reviews it's been given.</fullReview>

My sense is there was no character development but there was enough to get why these bad guys were in prison. Also the movie had plenty of plot development to go two hours and when the antiheroes seemed to be completely beaten they rose up to complete their mission to save the day.My only other exposure to Suicide Squad villains was a DC Universe movie called Batman Assault on Arkham. Some different characters in that made me understand the Batman and bad guy connection.This movie shouldn't be any kind of disappointment to an average comic book fan of live action.Root for the bad guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With DC Laughing All the Way to the Bank...Is the Joke on Us?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried my best not to get hyped up over the prospect of Suicide Squad, I better than anyone should know that a great trailer doesn't equal a great film &amp; unfortunately that statement is true to a degree.I think the missed potential of the film is what is killing it with the overall negative professional critic reaction I'm witnessing currently, it's going to truly bring the money in there's no doubt about that, but what I worry about is the fact that this should have been the film to truly kick-start the critical favourability of a DC film property, yet my own personal take on Suicide Squad is that although it certainly isn't the absolute disaster many critics would have you believe it is, yes it's fun to a point but also misguided &amp; messy in equal measure, so it isn't particularly anything to shout home about, simply put there's stuff to like &amp; other stuff to be frustrated by.So what is there to like? Well firstly a couple of the performances, Will Smith as Deadshot works extremely well if some of his plotted history is a bit on the nose, Margot Robbie certainly makes an impression as the truly troubled Harley Quinn &amp; her bow the Joker played here by Jared Leto in what can unquestionable be described as an extended cameo plotting and hinting at their personal history prior to this film including a gangster style takeover of Gotham (which is in part one of the main problems of the film because I instantly wanted to see that film) a rather surprisingly funny performance came from an actor I have previously derided in the likes of A Good Day to Die Hard and Terminator: Genisys, that actor is of course Jai Courtney playing a character called Captain Boomerang who is probably the most human member of this super-team of bad guys, his wisecracking should have been really annoying &amp; hey it may be to some but I thought it worked rather well.Another rather great positive was the actual look and feel of the film, so it did feel like a murky world these villains inhabited and my word did they get the costuming spot on, great stuff from that point of view.It is however inevitable that with a Squad this size there are going to be characters who are completely overlooked or not given any kind of effective use on screen, so principally the characters of Killer Croc &amp; Katana are no doubt interesting but given hardly anything to do and kind of seem there to make up the numbers. On a completely other note the character of Rick Flag played here by Joel Kinnaman is just way too damn boring considering he's leading a team of truly fascinating villains to have any effect on the film and you really do forget he's there sometimes.Now lets delve into the many layers of the Enchantress character played by Cara Delevingne who eventually become the villainess of the piece although initially it would appear she may be another member of the team, there are kind of three stages to her character &amp; therefore performance, one is inconsequential and merely a steppingstone, one is truly fascinating and is just interesting purely on a stylistic level but also on what her character is able to do in this form yet is quickly pushed aside for them to get to the final stage of her character who in my opinion kind of loses any threat level the moment she starts speaking (sorry but the voice for her was almost laughable considering she's supposed to be incredibly threatening) I also had memories of the villainess of Zuul from the original Ghostbusters film flying around inside my mind as she was performing.The way also that the plot tends to just plod along without any gusto was a bit concerning and it seems to be playing some particular usual cinematic plotting tropes, going through the motions some may say, one moment has the team coming together in a vain of Guardians of the Galaxy only with less awesomeness as it does feel slightly forced.There's heavy influences of particular to John Carpenter films with Escape From New York being without doubt a model for the story's structure/plotting and style, well criminals being sent to rescue an individual of high 9mportance...need I say more on than aspect? When it finally comes down to the action set pieces it's surprisingly average and plot serving to a point which is a shame given to array of characters at their disposal and there's a legion of literally faceless bad guys for them to machine-gun down as utter bullet fodder.So it would appear I'm extremely critical of an awful lot of what the film involves but yet there's still certainly a good amount to intrigue and keep your interest even if not everything works throughout.It's a complete mixed bag of a film with plenty to frustrate yet then also like and intrigue you and there's no doubt in the fact that this is certainly a film that is placed in a more unique place in our cinematic world right now and that alone makes it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for non-stop action on a hot summer day then sure it may be the movie for you. If you are looking for proper structure within story and dialogue then this is probably not for you. Transitions are a point I will highlight, when handling a transition from one scene to the next, you don't just abruptly cut to a big section of the movie without a good transition, which I think is a real highlight in what they could have done better. A positive highlight for me is the noticeably good animation, we were speculating what it would be like to watch while high, and that is up for VICELAND to experiment with. The Joker... Creepy yes, however you can see bits of Jared Leto trying too hard to be the next best thing, all in all he was fine. Harley Quinn was fine, Deadshot was fine, the rest were a bit sloppy in story telling and my least favorites Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc had scenes in which you can see the writers were desperate for a laugh when this type of humor only created some giggles in the audience. I'm sure I'm missing some other big issue with the story because there are many, nevertheless I see it as a good movie if you want action but not story. 3/10</fullReview>

The idea of having all the villains doing good is so appealing, as most villains show more complexities and depth than the "good guys" which make them more human so to say.I've heard about the bad reviews but I thought that it will not be that bad, I mean how bad can it be.. with such low expectations, I was actually still disappointed.The plot is too shallow and as the story advances, the development is so naive that you'd think an 11 years old is writing the events, no offense to 11 year olds out there.Well, it is a comic movie, and although I am against that, but some would argue that as a comic movie you don't have to offer a profound story and in-depth character design as much as you have good technique in directing and impressive CGIWell, unfortunately these too also were rather disappointing, and at some point CGI looked stupid, not to mention that directing technique and even editing were lame, nothing impressive or eye catching more than an average early nineties action movie, with some advancements in picture and coloringTo be honest by the ending, and as everything was extremely predictable, I couldn't help laughing by the ending, and as I went out, I just felt what in the world went wrong, for such an anticipated movie, for all those people involved in this work, to make it as below average as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another typical action film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film may excite the younger generations, as a 17 year old I found this film very boring. I struggled to find much meaning behind the plot and some of the acting was very "cheesy" and I generally didn't enjoy it. However, on a positive note there was so very cool graphics and action in the film and there were a few interesting scenesAlso I went with 2 friends and one of them really enjoyed it so it could just be me who doesn't really appreciate the film that much.I would not rush out to see it but it is still probably better than some of the other crap being screened at the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie would be in the style of Christopher Nolan's Batman and we would see real villains but the movie is just a mess and doesn't make sense at all. Some of the things I noticed in this movie:1. How many helicopter crashes are there in this movie ??? I think everybody experienced a helicopter crash some even 2 :)! Oh and they all miraculously survive every crash... 2. Whole city is evacuated in a couple of hours and you don't see any civilians walking the streets?3. Where is Batman? It's the end of the world and what do these villains have that a normal soldier wouldn't have? Except maybe diablo. 4. Amanda Waller = mess5. Enchantress = real funny especially her dance moves! 6. Great cast on paper and that's it. 7. No story line whatsoever... ......I can keep going on but can't loose more time on this movie then I already have. Please go watch this movie and see how someone can spend 175mil and accomplish absolutely nothing..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the mess of B vs. S I so wanted this movie to be awesome! I was looking forward to it more than any DC movie in recent memory. But, after a great opening and intro part of the movie, it stalls hard and ends flat. I'm fairly disappointed but hey...maybe they'll make an "Ultimate" edition Blu Ray to fix it...It baffles me how these DC movies can nail the casts with wonderful actors that give great performances only to ruin it with sub par stories and editing. Come on guys, get it together already! You're being handed the rights to some of the easiest money out there with all these comic book heroes. Bring it together with some good storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, if you enjoy bad storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story 2/10: I still have no idea what story this movie was trying to tell. Surprising, considering it was written and directed by David Ayer, who brought us such great films as Training Day, Fury, and End of Watch. But Suicide Squad? A swing and a miss. Is it a love story? I don't know. It certainly tries to force that clichéd theme on us. Is it an antihero story? I don't know. All of these "super villains" spontaneously sprout a conscience, abandon all self-interest, and decide to save the world. Believable, I know. The film doesn't have much comedic value either. Only one or two jokes generated actual laughter in the audience, the rest of 'em generated nothing more than awkward silence.Acting 5/10: Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) really nailed their roles. And despite the criticism, Leto wasn't terrible in his portrayal of the Joker. Though he certainly never hits the intensity that Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson have with that character. But the rest of them? Unmemorable at best, cringe worthy at worst. Most notably Joel Kinnaman, who came off like a fish outta water. I can't really speak for Boomerang (Jai Courtney) since I only understood about every 3rd word he said. Which is more than I can say for Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) since I only understood about every 5th word he said. To put it in perspective, I understood the Pikies in Snatch better than I understood those two.Sound 5/10: Not a bad soundtrack, but nothing memorable either. The random Eminem (whom I typically like) song felt out of place and broke the immersion for a bit.Visuals 8/10: The only real strong area of the film. Someone pat that CGI team on the back, they saved this film from being a complete disaster.All in all, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over. And that's not common for me. I'm not a fanboy of the comics, and like with all movies I watch, I avoided all the previews so I could step into the theater with zero expectations. Yet somehow Ayer still managed to strangle those expectations I didn't have. So if that was the goal of this film, congratulations. I'd be open to a Harley Quinn or Deadshot spin-off, so long as the producers don't let Ayer touch it with a ten-foot pole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not a Great Movie, but it is the Best from the DC Universe Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is finally here after the huge anticipation. It is the story of a group of villains called Task Force X, a.k.a. Suicide Squad, who are sent on a mission to save the world in Midway City. The movie is similar to Batman v Superman from a critical standpoint, but the viewing experience for me was far different.The biggest strength this movie has is the characters. Their introductions are done in a cool and funny way. Will Smith as Deadshot is very likable and funny. He brings humanity to the role and has some awesome action scenes. Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and super entertaining to watch. Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, and Joel Kinneman as Rick Flagg are all really good too. Jared Leto's Joker is a really cool portrayal of the character and I can't wait to see him in future films. But by far the standout performance for me is Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. She is so dark and at times cruel. Watching these characters made this movie a ton of fun. Unfortunately, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and El Diablo are the only ones who are given any real depth and backstory. The biggest weaknesses this movie has are the story and villains. The mission the Suicide Squad is sent on honestly makes no sense for the type of people they are. The story is very weak and relies only on its comedy during certain scenes. Some of the decisions made by certain characters don't make sense. I won't say who it is but the villain is by far the worst part of this movie. The villains in this movie are worse than Lex Luthor and Doomsday in Batman v Superman. Some of the songs work for the tone and others come out of nowhere. Overall, Suicide Squad is a really fun movie. From a critical standpoint, this is equivalent to Batman v Superman, but I actually found myself enjoying this movie. I was having a ton of fun with the movie even though I could blatantly see the numerous problems the movie has. I definitely think it's a better film than Batman v Superman and a little better than Man of Steel. So for me, it is the best DC Universe film. If you're a comic book fan of these characters or the DC Universe films, I would recommend seeing it. Suicide Squad gets a B-.Check out my YouTube channel where I also review movies!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGWUFunDhIwKVcL7eNMWiQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun though a little bit cartoonish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Likes: Margot Robbie ? this film is Margot Robbie's movie. I'm saying this not because I love her but because her character portrayal stood out from the rest. She is the humor of the film and literally the craziest character and the loveliest at the same time.Camera Works ? David Ayer sure knows how to take beautiful shots. I'm a little bit partial to the movie's cinematography but the shots were great.Plot ? I'm not a big fan of the "questionable" plot with no real motivation from most of its characters but I took it as it is. It's plain and simple. No complications and not hard to understand.Viola Davis ? you will hate her but you will love her at the same time that you might find yourself rooting for her over the "bad guys" and then you'll hate her again. That's how good she is.Dislikes: Execution ? this could've been executed better. Yes, David Ayer took beautiful shots but his direction is not cohesive. Flashback scenes are needed but they tend to be anti-climactic. There are also scenes that for me are a little bit unfocused to what should be really going on. There are also several scenes that I find a little bit cartoon-ish.Central Character ? I believe that Deadshot should really be the lead but Will Smith's portrayal is a little bit out there. His characterization is kind of corny. I can say easily that Harley Quinn stole every scene she's in.Cara Delevingne ? I love her as a top model but she's still too "young" to be a full-pledge actress. Blank eyes and unbelievable emotions made me cringe a bit. But she's getting there, I hope.Jared Leto ? yes, he's not Heath Ledger but I can't help comparing them together. Both are Oscar winners but unfortunately, Jared can't pull off Joker (yet). I believe that he's a method actor but it didn't work in this movie. I can still see Jared Leto acting unlike Heath who lost into the character itself. For me, that's the difference ? one is acting as Joker while the other IS Joker.Over All Impression: Well, I have to say that apart from the poor execution and direction of the movie and contrary to some (or most) of the critics Suicide Squad is good. Good thing they did re-shoots to bring in more humor in the film after BvS was heavily criticized for being boringly serious and laughable in a bad way. DC made the right move to "copy" Marvel movies though they might have overdone the humor in some parts.Suicide Squad is a psychedelic mixture of quirky (though some are forgettable) characters that surprisingly worked well for the total cinematic experience. It's a good introduction to a franchise with great potential. I would surely love to see a Suicide Squad vs Justice League movie in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even bad guys fight their own demons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How do we perceive a villain?" the 2-hour film posits the question among its viewers, transcending the stereotype that the bad guys don't have a hairline of good left in them?that it is the bad guys against the world. It has made me realize that maybe good and bad are just relative concepts, and that's what makes Suicide Squad an enticing subject of interrogation with which we can reevaluate what being bad really is.Feeling like Suicide Squad was a trade paperback (TPB) issue set in motion, crossovers included in the film may have added fuel to the frustration of those who have not liked it. It pitted story arcs against one another, for example, confusing the audience with "is s/he a saint or a sinner," a question?in loop. The producers crammed stories in one film probably because it would not hit the theaters for a continuation or a reboot entitled 'Harley Quinn and the Suicide Squad' (because let's be honest, Robbie stole all scenes despite her out-of-line humor?sometimes funny, most times forced). Another misrepresentation of the film that worked out well for most of the viewers is the relationship between Harley Quinn and the Joker. It is a relationship that is not a relationship?it is downright abusive. Good framing of promotional videos and parallelism of these two characters' mentality are not enough to justify the preconceived notion of "intimacy" that has many hooked. I thought they would make use of the clean slate for villains as an opportunity to set such idea free from misconception.The Enchantress (Delevigne)'s scene with her Brother?mentioning the human race's worship on technology, on the other hand, deserves a slab of the spotlight because it sends off a message. Deeper than what one would expect.DC Comics' Suicide Squad, one of the most anticipated films of the year, is undeniably a subject of debate, an intermediate between two poles: sink?a fault which a majority of the critics has raved; swim?a risk which a bunch of movie goers has taken, letting the film bag a three-digit opening gross.Is it worth the watch? Ask yourself this question when you have seen it.</fullReview>

On what planet do you live on?It's a movie based on COMIC and I think it is awesome. Because it has just what you REALISTICALY expect it to have: bad guys vs good buys. Of course the twist here is that the good guys are bad guys too. It's a fight between the good and the bad, just as it is in every superhero movie. Get a hold of yourself and appreciate the characters, which are brought to live by extraordinary actors. Appreciate the great music, the costumes, the CGI, and even the script which was written in 6 weeks. 6 WEEKS! Sure, it has some stuff that could've been better, but it's understandable. My only problem with the movie is that they've cut scenes with Harley and Joker, who i'm sure that if they left it, the movie would've been much better. Love the characters, the actors, the movie, the plot. They did what they could, and they know where they could've made more. Imagine the stress they work in, the rejections they get, and understand. Worth the watch if you know how to appreciate movies, and are a fan of comics. LOVE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but enjoyable and exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is nowhere near as bad as critics tell you, so don't listen to all of them. 'Suicide Squad' has its flaws and a lot of them refer to the marketing of the film. The editing of the character profiling was trailer like, and almost defeats the relevance of the character trailers the film distributed weeks before, showing almost like for like content barring a scene or two. It should be assumed by the film's beginning, that the audience are mainly comic book readers or at the very least fans of the superhero film genre. This oversight meant, in my opinion, 15-20 minutes of wasted storytelling. The sound editing in the early act of the film also made me fear for the rest of it. When soundtrack changes every two minutes, it almost feels as if the music is being shoehorned in and you don't get to appreciate the tone of the scene as much as you would when it is used correctly. After hearing about five different songs in the very beginning and by the end seeing that two of the more popular songs ('Heathens' by Twenty One Pilots and 'Sucker For Pain' by Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa and Imagine Dragons) were used primarily as credit music really disappointed me. Now to the good, Deadshot was fantastically portrayed and I felt like he could carry a Batman film as a main antagonist, as scenes in the film would further suggest. Contrary to critical reviews, I felt that Deadshot as well as most of the other squad members show villain traits and I would like to think that prison has allowed some of them time to reflect on their crimes and some of them to show remorse or lack of it. Deadshot showed a conflict of interests in his story arc, evident from his arrest in the beginning to his moment of shooting the explosives which detonate Enchantress in the finale. Jared Leto's Joker depiction caught my eye with how different and refreshing it seemed compared to what we've been treated to film wise over the last thirty years. His Joker was reminiscent of Tony Montana, Cuban drug lord from the 80's classic, 'Scarface' twisted with Jack Nicholson's Joker in 1989's 'Batman' and Heath Ledger's own rendition from 'The Dark Knight'. Leto's style was very unique and I think we as an audience can collectively say that we got something from a film featuring the Joker that we haven't seen in the past; The Joker being in love. Main villain Enchantress was a strong choice and an interesting spin on the story, I liked how they had to conflict with someone who is ultimately similar to themselves, and led by the love interest of Enchantress' alter ego June Moone in Rick Flag, respectively. The brother character I didn't quite understand, as I felt that it wasn't really explained as to how he got his powers and what his powers actually are. Furthermore, Harley Quinn was also a huge highlight in this film. Critics who complained about her outfit are surely picking at straws and should realize that in a lot of source material, Harley Quinn is dressed seductively and provocatively. Yes, her shorts were edited in the trailers to appear longer but if you think about the audience that this trailer would be broadcast to, you would undertake the same decision to make everyone not have any faults about your marketing material. Side characters I didn't think would do that well actually surprised me in a sense. El Diablo was the real star of 'the rest' of the cast and his incredible powers combined with his conflicting pacifist nature made you want to seek more about his backstory and become horrified when you hear what happened. Killer Croc should have had a stronger story arc in my opinion; I think they definitely had the right idea starting the film with Killer Croc being depicted as an animal and not a person. They should have run with this idea and used him as feeling sorry for himself and perhaps sacrificing himself in an El Diablo way that would've suited his story arc. Captain Boomerang was admittedly acted very well and made me want to see more from him as well as Deadshot, Joker and Harley. That being said, I felt they could've used Boomerang in a more inventive way and explained some of his backstory such as his love for unicorns and why he's so erratic. Amanda Waller was a big surprise in the film and showed just how much she didn't give a damn during the film with the constant execution threats, using Slipknot as an example and even killing her own officers. This all in turn made her a villain for the villains to not fight against but abide by and adhere to. The power she had in this film was incredible and I felt one of the stronger acting performances in the film by Viola Davis. On a side note, Batman's short cameos were epic and a breath of fresh air that was perfect in both character trailers of Deadshot and Harley Quinn. His role in both made me want to see Batman against both villains and would definitely feel cheated if we didn't get to see this in the Batman solo feature due for release in the coming years. Suicide Squad isn't a bad watch by any means. For me I left the cinema feeling quite happy and relieved that not all critiques are correct and I have come to disagree with a lot of critics in the last few years as my film taste has developed and matured. This film has laughs, has dark elements and may lack an exceptional story that 'The Dark Knight' thrived on but is still enjoyable and makes me want to see what else this universe has to offer. Overall: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give the DCEU to David Ayer, this is how you make a DC movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUICIDE SQUAD - NO SPOILERS REVIEWThis movie has been lambasted by the critics, they have called it misogynistic, crude, extremely violent... my take? The critics are worthless on this one.David Ayer has delivered a freaking Masterpiece when it comes to Comic Book Movies, he has taken irredeemable characters and turn them into something more, these guys are not seen as villains but as anti- heroes even. You get to care for the characters and their emotional struggles. More than that the performances are great. I was worried about Will Smith playing Will Smith but he delivers a great Deadshot, every character is on point, from Captain Boomerang to Killer Croc. And Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is the prefect villain, she embodies the evil side of government, she is someone that seen from any side you really want her dead and suffering, she is able to get that emotion from you, she is an amazing actress.And as for the Clown Prince of Crime? (mild SPOILER) He's really not that much in the movie, yet Jared Leto's take (as much as I questioned this version before) is amazing, he's no Heath Ledger or the Animated Joker but he fits nicely in the DCEU. Last but not least, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and as much as I wanted to see her in the Harlequin outfit she makes you not care about her costume as she deliberately steals the show, she becomes the key ingredient in this movie.I do have to point out that the writing towards the end became a bit predictable (more than usual in a CBM), and it leaves some HUGE holes and questions unanswered, but they managed to redeem themselves with some twists that tho expected the movie would have been incomplete and pointless without.But all and all Suicide Squad is a mixture of violence, drama and loads of humor. THIS is where you start the DCEU, take notes Zack Snyder, THIS is how you do it, because so far it has been the BEST the DCEU has to offer.2016 has been a mixed year for CBM, with disappointments like Batman v Superman, X-Men: The Mocking... I mean, X-Men: Apocalypse, and Comic Book gems like Deadpool and Captain America: Civil War. And Suicide Squad? Belongs to the latter group, not to say it was a great cinematic achievement but it was respectful to the source material, and incredibly fun to watch.I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

Smith, as always, owned his role as Deadshot, and I dare say Leto made a certain impact of his own. I know that Suicide Squad is getting ripped apart by the critics, but I dare say any of these 'professional' critics must not know jack about the one, the only, Harley Quinn! She is for all purposes the reason I went to see it, and Margot delivers - in my opinion she stole the show, but then I've been a Quinn since she was introduced in the animated series, so I'm biased. Best advice, ignore the reviews (including this one) and just go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To the fans of the comic book universe... "Suicide Squad" is one of the BEST anti-hero film of all time! Each of the character stay true to The New 52 in the DC Entertainment Universe.Will Smith's character Deadshot scores a bull's eye... not one single miss of using his combination of action, comedy, and human drama. Viola Davis (How To Get Away with Murder) is one bad chick in this picture in her role as Amanda Waller... mastermind of the "skwad". Australian actress Margot Robbie (Focus) have ultimately stolen this picture (and my heart) as the famed Harley Quinn. Utilizing the Brooklyn accent, attitude, and I-don't-give-a-**** action have truly shined in this film. I hope one day that Robbie will have her SS spin-off starring the famed Clown Princess of Crime. Making her film debut, Japanese-American actress Karen Fukuhara truly kicks butt (and then some) as Katana. She's truly gonna shine in future films to come and I would love to see more of Fukuhara. Finally, there's Jared Leto. As much as I loved Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, the late Heath Ledger, and voice talent Mark Hamill claiming their title as the Joker... Leto have ultimately went full Joker in this picture. Combining his Playboy lifestyle with psychotic and remorseless tone, Leto have truly earned the title as one of the best.This film would have been a perfect score, but lost a point for last minute editing. I was a bit disappointed that some of the scenes from the trailer wasn't in the finalized film and ended up on the cutting room floor. Not only that, I want to see more of The Joker in action. Even Harley's wink at Deadshot wasn't in the film either. I hope that one day that Warner Bros. Pictures would make a Suicide Squad Director's Cut on Blu-Ray soon.Final Judgment: Despite the last minute film editing, Suicide Squad delivers the fun, action, humor, and suspense of The New 52 series that makes you want to beg for more. David Ayer should make an SS sequel one of these days. For now... Suicide Squad scores a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie !! Characters have a full background story leaving you with emotions attached to them and seeing everyone in the squad weak points. Only reason it's not getting a 10 is because of in the fight scene at parts you can't tell what's going on so if they slowed those down the movie would get a ten for me. Will Smith does a great job playing Deadshot. Deadshot and Harley Quinn ends up being my favorite out of the squad at the end of the movie. Croc had the least amount lines and when he did talk it was corny but he was still a good character do to his fighting scenes. Critics really underrated this movie, I guess cause everyone came in with too high of expectations for it. Will be seeing Suicidé Squad 2 if it comes out.

		<fullReview>In the never-ending battle to bring to the big screen characters from the DC and Marvel comic books by Time Warner and Disney respectively, the latest shot is this super villain version of "The Dirty Dozen" which launches upon us a whole slew of oddballs from the DC stable. If you're not familiar with the comics (like me), you won't know these characters and DC superheroes Batman (brief appearances) and Superman (brief references) are barely present.The movie is a mixed success with a flashy style, a rocking soundtrack, a few sharp lines and plenty of crashing action from writer and director David Ayer who carried out the same responsibilities for "End Of Watch' and "Fury". Major weaknesses though are that the number in the squad is too large for all the characters to be developed properly and most of them are more sympathetic than evil (notably Will Smith who is just too nice as Deadshot), while the forces that they battle - model Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, her giant brother and a bunch of faceless zombies - look as if they've wandered in from a "Ghostbusters" movie.For me, the best thing about "Suicide Squad" is Margot Robbie who plays Harley Quinn, formerly prison psychiatrist Dr Harleen Quinzel who fell in love with a patient the Joker (another underdeveloped role). She is sassy and sexy while brilliantly balletic and devastating with a baseball bat and she delivers most of the best lines with charming cheek. You can understand why the Joker wants her out of her maximum security prison and why the squad will be back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother listening to the negative reviews, worth a watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start. I would say I am a fan of the DC/Marvel series of films that have been produced over the years, I mean I don't really read many comics, but I have always enjoyed a well produced comic book based film. That being said I wasn't really anticipating seeing 'Suicide Squad' based off the fact that I didn't enjoy the new Batman vs Superman film, because it was extremely boring nearly throughout the entire movie. I feel as if Marvel have produced much better films compared to DC, and are at least constant with the quality (in most cases), especially the fact that Marvel/Disney absolutely nailed the new Captain America:Civil War film, which exceeded my expectations, and is one of the best marvel movies that I have seen to date. Obviously there are exceptions to this idea (The Dark Knight trilogy) and don't mind me if you disagree.I decided to go watch Suicide Squad and my expectations were exceeded by quite a bit. Suicide Squad follows the story of some of DC's finest villains, including Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Deadshot, as well as a few others. This movie brought a fresh new idea in which the villains are no longer 'Villains'they are now the heroes of the film, although its quite obvious none of the Squad ever really convert from their evil ways, but rather do good to fulfill their own self interest. The acting was quite on par with the theme of the film as well, Will Smith plays a fantastic deadshot whom has several bad ass scenes and cracks quite a few jokes, which is quite uncharacteristic for DC films, yet it worked so well. Margot Robbie also plays a fantastic Harley Quinn, she is cute and quirky throughout the film, while still having some sweet moves with her ol' baseball bat, although she does have some pretty corny lines here and there. And really most of the other actors did a fantastic job, one important mention is Jared Leto's Joker, everyone wants to know...This first look at the new Joker was quite interesting, he is well presented, has a good look and genuinely seems like a deranged maniac. He doesn't appear often in the film, however when he is on screen he delivers a fantastic element to the film. I am excited to see him on screen again soon.The only real negatives were the fact that my expectations were that batman, and joker were going to be bigger factors within the story, however they were just a bit of background for the most part. And the plot of the entire movie was a bit shy of its full potential i believe. I honestly cannot understand the critics that bashed this film, even one went so far to say it was worse than the Fantastic 4 reboot which was all over the place. I think the screenplay, action shots, humor, soundtrack, and character development were well done. I am definitely buying this movie when it comes out. Its not flawless, but its one of the best DC movies I've seen, I recommend watching whenever you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand all the bad reviews regarding this movie. There are 2 weak points, that I 100% agree with: the super villain is strong and powerful and could destroy the Earth in 2 seconds, and the way the "heroes" solve this problem is kind of... uh-mm... hard to believe. Secondly, the main reason that makes the Suicide Squad team united and obedient is also really hard to believe, they could have done a better job on how the government would control them. However, Jared Leto is looking amazing as the Joker. He is not the main character, thus his appearances are small, but I really enjoyed him. He is a modern Joker who, let's say, in his own way, cares about Harley Quinn. Needless to say that Deadshot and Harley Quinn are looking incredible and how the production design is stunning and HQ-ish. Go check this movie in the cinemas, it is worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>really great movie that i feel is currently underrated by the critics,i just wish there was more joker though as I fell he didn't have enough screen time. the plot itself involves enchantress being the main villain with the suicide squad being villains manipulated by Amanda Waller to do good. the movie explains the backstory for the characters through mostly flashbacks throughout the movie giving these characters more depth. Harley Quinn is very funny in this movie. and dead shot has a daughter.slipknot dies in barely any time at all which is annoying.captain boomerang is very funny and is Aussie and regularly drinks beer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw Man of Steel, but I thought B v S was honestly enjoyable enough to be decent, even if it was messy. However, I really liked Suicide Squad. I thought the main villain/antagonist was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if it was the writing or the actress (both honestly) but she was beyond cheesy and lame. I also liked The Joker as a character, but Leto was just trying too hard. I didn't particularly like his portrayal. I also think the squad members were humanized way too much, but overall I found it to be super enjoyable, not nearly as exploitative, and also a lot less try-hard than expected (and less try-hard than Deadpool, which I don't really like). There were moments when it was a bit disjointed, but most characters worked, some great character moments, the balance in comedy/drama worked well, some very good acting (Mostly Margot Robbie and Viola Davis), and it definitely felt more relaxed and fun than B v S. More than anything, I think it worked so well because it never lost sight of its characters, even amidst all of the action. I think that's why it worked despite the awful main antagonist, because it was so deeply rooted in its characters and they were never ignored. It was just so much fun, mostly coherent, and well-paced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anything, Suicide Squad should be viewed as a cautionary tale for eager film students worried about the perversion of their vision by crass, avaricious and abusive film executives and studios. Thus far Director David Ayer has been towing the line, but there's no telling if and when he'll be lobbing accusations of studio meddling in the near future. Somewhere deep, deep, deep, deep down in the ashy crevasses of this film's soul, lies a good movie. One that has no need for contrived plots and flashbacks doubling as character development. Yet as it stands, the theatrical version of this set of tangentially related scenes is nothing more than a floppy, limping, barely-alive footnote in the joyless black parade that is the DC Extended Universe. At this point the only argument that can be made in favor of this film's merits is that it's not Batman Vs. Superman (2016).The Suicide Squad is the brain child of one Amanda Waller (Davis), an ambitious government official who wants to pilot a Black Ops team of arch-criminals who can go into high-risk situations and do...stuff. She recruits Col. Rick Flag (Kinnaman) to train and lead the team which includes "Metahumans" Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje), El Diablo (Hernandez) and Dr. June Moone aka Enchantress (Delevingne). Also along for the ride are professional criminals Deadshot (Smith), Captain Boomerang (Courtney) and Slipknot (Beach) as well as Flag's sword wielding bodyguard Katana (Fukuhara). The plot then bends over backwards to get these guys unchained and let loose into Midway City with the Joker (Leto) in hot pursuit so he can rescue the team's only real liability Harley Quinn (Robbie) who is there because...wait, why is she on the team again?If the first rule of visual storytelling is "don't tell the audience what they already know," then this movie not only breaks that rule but sets it on fire then stomps on it. We are introduced to our anti-heroes, their arsenals and their motivations for accepting such a cockamamie scheme a handful of times. At one point the film straight up brings out the files on them, followed by on-the-nose theme music, personifying tile cards and stats resembling a "choose your character" mod on a cheap video game. Then we get the flashbacks oh the flashbacks, which are not there to service the story at all but are there to remind you whether not you like it, Jared Leto is going to be playing the Joker for a while and Ben Affleck is still Batman.And what of The Joker whose appearance in this movie has been hyped to the point of frenzy? Well if he's the reason you came to see Suicide Squad then you're in for a bad case of blue balls. The man is barely in this film, sharing what little screen-time he has with Harley, a gaggle of Panda-suit wearing henchmen and Common. When he is on screen he lurches and leers but does very little that's scary, funny or even remotely interesting.Likewise Harley is at her best a pale imitation of Heath Ledger's Joker, interjecting El Diablo's tragic backstory with a nihilistic "own that s**t" that she herself doesn't even believe. At her worst though she's a skimpy, studio assembled, polyester sex pot whose strength is undermined by an abusive romance that has pockmarked many a comic book. She holds her own in a few fights and actress Margot Robbie does seem to be having some fun, but the image of her perched atop a wrecked taxi in the rain bemoaning the loss of her "puddin" is enough to dismantle the entire idea that she can be her own character.There are a few standouts including Jai Courtney as the flamboyantly named Captain Boomerang. He's a cut-and-run jerk through and through and revels in the douche-baggery of his own making. Plus since he's not exactly part of the squads inner-ring, he's immune to the film telling us what he's about three or four times. Will Smith's Deadshot character arc is treated with a modicum of respect which is aptly complimented by the man actually trying for the first time in ten years. Yet even then you can tell that there was a lot of him left on the cutting room floor. The film settles for giving the character the complexity of an average paint-by-numbers anti-hero with a secret heart of gold. A heart that's not coaxed out by anything more substantial than the budding bromance between himself and Col. Flag.Months of rumored extensive re-shoots have yielded the exact same problems that plagued DC's last attempt to compete with Marvel. Nearly every cut in this film feels like a battle between David Ayer, studio heads and Executive Producer Zack Snyder in an attempt to conform to a PG-13 rating, pander to the fans and keep the look and feel of the larger universe they plan to somehow cobble together. Unlike Batman V. Board of Education's reddit inspired pretentiousness, Suicide Squad has a longing unrequited desire to just have some fun. Yet any fun to be had is over-complicated by franchise maintenance and a villain reveal that could have been avoided if Amanda Waller had simply scrapped her Black Ops team at conception. Well, at least Suicide Squad has the distinction of casting Adam Beach playing the first First Nation hero in a mainstream superhero film...oh wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When big budget movies are made, with stars like Jared Leto and Will Smith; playing characters like Deadshot and Joker, the bar is set too high. And the movie fails at the first step, they have made a movie which basically consists of trailers for all the characters, which may be used in the future. There story seems like a child playing with his action figures making them fight one another. They have lacked in motivation for every character to form the squad.DC, Nolan has raised standards of Batman and Joker, I am not telling you to top that but at least do not destroy the franchise. Suicide Squad is a new low after major hiccups in B v S.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not anywhere near a perfect movie, but definitely worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(The spoilers I talk about will not ruin anything for you. They are just minor.)I would like to start off with about a year ago when I heard this movie was happening. I was already having bad thoughts about BvS and at the time I had no idea these movies were connected in the same universe. I was excited for this movie because Arrow gave me a brief and awesome look at what these guys are about. When I heard that Will Smith is playing Deadshot, I thought,"What the hell is wrong with these people? He's nowhere close to portraying Floyd Lawton/Deadshot." Well, over time the thought of him doing so kind of grew on me as I was seeing more of him in the trailers.Now let's go back to about a week before the release. I'm super excited for the concept of the film and dying to see it to see how it turns out. At the same time starting to have doubts about DC's film making all because of the whole BvS travesty that we just don't talk about anymore. At this point, i just don't know what to think.Now we're at the day I get to see it, August 6 at 8:30 PM. I sit down in a fairly packed theater and I watch the movie with my best friend. Bot me and him walked out of there thinking that it was a pretty good movie. That's saying a lot since he is the 50% that didn't care for BvS and I was on the other half trying to shine some light on it.Now, the movie.There were a lot of good things about this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was perfect and Will Smith, just wow! Much better than I thought. Just at times he was a little too Will Smithy. Those 2 characters summed up most of the movie. Everyone else did a fine job portraying their characters. Oh, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was exactly what this movie needed. She was exactly that bad ass bitch that she needed to be.The things that weren't as good about the movie is that it was maybe a little too fast paced at times and has a couple minor plot holes. Those can easily be bypassed though if you don't think too much of it.Now, I will talk about and argue about the things other people are complaining about and saying why the movie is terrible, which is false. 1. It feels like multiple movies trying to be one.I understand why people think this, but it just really doesn't feel that way. Yes, the Joker has a romantic background story with Harley Quinn and they want to show that in flashbacks a bit to show a bit of her origin to lead up to where she is now. People are saying that could easily be a whole other movie. Lie!! If DC tried to do such a thing it would be long, boring and dragged out a lot because there would have been a lot of filler scenes that just wouldn't make sense.2. The Joker doesn't get enough screen time.Well, no crap! This movie isn't about him. Its's about the Suicide Squad. Yes, Harley Quinn and him have their thing going on, but that is the sole purpose of him being in the movie. To acknowledge that he exists in this world and to help give Harley Quinn her background story even more.3. DC Sucks and should just quit trying.That's right people. Trolls exist. They just want to get people rattled up for no reason to a point where people will actually believe them. If you truly believe that you have a brain of your own, then don't let others persuade you you morons.Well, that's my review. My best suggestion is to just go in there and see the movie even if your slightly interested. If you truly believe that this movie looks completely stupid and waste of your time from the trailers, then superhero movies aren't for you and you probably won't enjoy it as well as others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this yesterday with my buddy when it came out and I have been like blown away despite what the critics or the haters say!I have known Margot Robbie since the day she was Donna Freeman on the soap opera "Neighbours" and now look at her, she is now the original real life Harley Quinn! She is just so gorgeous, I love Margot Robbie! She is just an amazing actress and she pulled such an American accent. I honestly forgot she was Margot Robbie throughout the film haha!Anyways I loved the fact they choose the right cast to be part of the Suicide Squad. Will Smith as Deadshot was brilliant, he is like the Will Smith we knew from his previous movies - well liked, funny, cheery and just downright awesome! I even liked Jared Leto too as the Joker, his character was like so unpredictable which was scary. I actually thought he was gonna be more abusive like his original self in the animated series but this time, he wanted Harley Quinn even more which was odd. Himself and Margot Robbie were a cute couple anyway like who would say no to them as a couple? Even when Enchantess was tricking everyone's mind, Robbie and Leto looked so handsome without looking gangsta seriously! Even the babies were cuties! The only disappointment in the movie was Enchantess was not part of the Suicide Squad by the way she was promoted. Apart from that, everything was 100% perfect in the film.I have been waiting so long to see this film and I'm so jumping for joy that I managed to see the first villain movie on the planet! I give this movie a 9/10 for just being awesome ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Did This Get Such Bad Reviews??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand how this got bad reviews at all! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I am super harsh on any type of film. This movie did have its problems, as almost all movies do, but I thought that this film was awesome!First off, the cast could not have been better. Margot Robbie nails her role as Harley Quinn and I really do hope that she gets her own movie in the future. Viola Davis really made you hate her character (Amanda Waller), which means she did a fantastic job as well. Will Smith also did a great job as Deadshot, and he really carried the film (along with Robbie). The best part of the film, however, was Jared Leto as the Joker. Seriously, I could not have been more pleased with the way the Joker was portrayed. I do feel like they should've included him more in the movie though. I keep reading that people are unhappy with the Joker now, and I think that's just because they are either biased against Leto, kidding themselves, or comparing him to Heath Ledger. Leto didn't try to be like Ledger at all, and yet was thoroughly creepy and I feel like he did a fantastic job. I hope to see him in future films from DC (especially if he's in the Batman movie directed by Ben Affleck). Like I said, there are some problems with the film. Cara Delevingne did fine as the Enchantress at the beginning, but the way they handled her character towards the end of the film was just stupid. The ending scene didn't feel like the rest of the film. Her corny lines ruined the scene (along with Rick Flag's lines). I think that the editing of the film felt disjointed in some places. One scene would be super dark and depressing, then the next everyone would be joking around. The film is saved at the end by the surprise ending with Harley and the Joker. Overall though, this film was extremely entertaining and I would definitely see it again. The score is also fantastic. I'm so surprised that it got only like a 29% on RT. I don't understand how a movie like this can score so low, but yet a movie such as Iron Man 2 or Captain America 1 can get like 75%. Those films were absolutely terrible. Critics were way too harsh on this movie. Don't listen to them! Go see it and make your own opinion.Pros of the Film: -Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis all are fantastic in their roles.-Cameos from Batman and the Flash-Side characters are great! (Boomerang, Katana, El Diablo, Killer Croc), sort of wish they were in it more.-Soundtrack and Score-The Joker!!!!-Entertaining and fast paced throughoutCons of the Film: -The Enchantress (at the end), also Rick Flag and Slipknot (why was he in this film?)-Corny lines at the end-Editing in some partsI would give this movie about a 7.5, but since critics were too harsh, I'll give it a solid 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a perfect film but absolutely worth the watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this review with the fact i spend a lot of my time editing and providing CG for indie films.So lets start with the obvious question is the film enjoyable ? YES absolutely. it's well written and most of the characters get really well fleshed out. i strongly recommend going to see this film.lets do a point by point.1. characters. For a film this full of popular and classic characters it does a OK job of balancing them for the most part. Harley Quinn, dead shot, rick flag and el diablo get the most emotional weight to their characters. you find yourself empathizing with them.that said the film fails to develop captain boomerang (oh how i hate him) or slipknot at all. i wanted to like captain boomerang i really did he is the first Australian character I've seen in this type of film. but he gets no explanation at all. he carries this pink unicorn for unknown reasons and is just a dick every moment he's on screen. as for slip not he really doesn't get enough screen time. he seems a likable character he's just not exposed enough. enchantress/June moon plays a big part in the movie she is creepy as hell and it works you end up hating one half of her (for the right reasons) and loving the other. as for Amanda Waller. she is played really really well i won't spoiler her but all i can say is prepare for a ride with twists and turns. (i'll mention the joker later) 2. THE CGI. This seems to be a sore point that sits at the core of a lot of the bad reviews and as I've mentioned this is one area where i hold some expertise. For the most part it's fine certainly miles better then ghostbusters and batman vs superman. there are times where they have used cgi where they really didn't need to. some parts of enchantress's scenes for example they have replaced the actress with a cgi body double which is really unnecessary for the actions being performed which leads to unnatural motions and twitches of her body. i get that shes a extra dimensional being but it just doesn't flow right. that said the average viewer is probably not going to notice too much and it doesn't take away from the enjoy-ability of the film. the rest of the cgi is barely noticeable unless you know what your looking for with a few mild exceptions i won't mention because that would be a spoiler.3. THE EDITING/MUSIC. another point at the heart of the bad reviews and again a area i hold some experience. the music is over used i have to agree with the negative reviews on that. it's used in places it shouldn't be so when it's used where its meant to be it loses it's impact. if the characters where not well acted and fleshed out this would potential ruin the experience luckily the actors performances and the writing compensate for the lost impact of the music you still feel the emotion your meant to feel. as for the editing. it's no where near as bad as the bad reviews say. there are some problems with it it's evident that there has been interference with the directors vision but it does not really detract from the experience of the film. the use of flash backs mirrors to a extent the methodology of deadpool and it's used to great effect. over all the film is not ruined by these points as the bad reviews say. in fact unless you know something about editing and the use of music to create emotion you probably won't notice any issues at all.4.The joker. i went into this fully expecting to hate the way the character was portrayed. heath ledger to me was the ultimate joker and I've been looking at images for months now hating the look and wondering if this was going to be a terrible portrayal. i have to say though i was proved wrong Jarrod letto plays the joker extremely well. the character is exactly as twisted and dark has he needs to be. his infamous twisted sense of humour is touched upon but not really explored but considering he is only on screen for about 15 minuets that's to be expected. we will see more of him in the future i'm sure and we will see more of his twisted dark persona.5.Harley and jokers relationship. I've seen a lot of complaints that the relationship is portrayed as a abusive one and that's kind of the point. the relationship between these two characters is really abusive in the comics. you could describe Harley as having Stockholm syndrome. she does. the relationship is this mad twisted almost captor and hostage relationship. Harley loves this evil freak and your caught in the middle you want to see her out of that relationship but at the same time her love for him is so strong you feel sad for her when shes missing him.over all it's a incredibly well done film sure it has flaws but what film doesn't go into this film with a open mind and you will absolutely love this roller coaster of a film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Suicide Squad on opening night last night and this movie isn't even close to as bad as the 30% review on Meta critic. In fact, I thought this movie was excellent, despite its flaws. The movie only suffers from 2 flaws. One: the action. The action in Suicide Squad wasn't very exciting. It lacked that flare that exists in most superhero movies. Not to say the action was bad, it was just noticeably weaker than most superhero movies. Two: characters break their character at some points. This is borderline nit-picking, but there were a couple of scenes where I said to myself,"That character wouldn't do that" or "That character wouldn't say that". Again, it's a very minor complaint that doesn't really affect the movie in any major way.Now, the positives easily outweigh those negatives. Jared Leto's Joker is my personal favorite although he's only in the movie for about ten minutes. He perfectly combines Nicholson's comedy with Ledger's insanity and I'm itching to see more of him in the extended cut and the Batman movie coming out. Margot Robbie also played a perfect Harley Quinn. She doesn't steal the show from the other characters and her relationship with the Joker is done perfectly. Will Smith's Deadshot is also an amazing character. I actually felt bad for him although he's a villain. All of his lines hit and his jokes were genuinely funny. All of these great main characters are backed up by mostly great supporting characters like El Diablo, Captain Boomerang, and other characters.Suicide Squad also brought a lot more comedy into the DC universe. This movie is SO much funnier than Man of Steel and BvS. Most of the jokes hit, but there were a couple that didn't. The movies is much more lighthearted and has much more character than the other movies. I won't spoil the main villain of the film, but I feel that it was done pretty well. There are zombies which I thought the movie could've done without, but it's not a big complaint. His/her motives were clear and it fit in the movie nicely. Batman and the Flash also have some pretty cool cameos in this movie that i won't spoil. I definitely recommend that you go out and see this movie in the theaters ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of comics, or the previous two movies. This movie is easily the best of the DC Cinematic Universe so far. Let's hope Justice League can improve even more!</fullReview>

And everyone is just as good as he is. But i don't know how this movie seems kind lil bit shallow, its lack something maybe the plot or the direction?

		<fullReview>Wow. That is one word to describe this film. I have waited over a year for this film and I was definitely not disappointed. There were tears and laughter during the film from start to end and I just loved it. For all the people who haven't watched it...make sure you go in ignoring all the bad reviews because I must have seen a completely different film to them. This film had everything a superhero/villain fanatic wants. The squad is assembled of the worlds most infamous villains and it is up to them to help save the world from another villain...even typing this it doesn't seem to add up but believe me it does. The squad includes; Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie), Deadshot (played by Will Smith), El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez), Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courteney), Slipknot (played by Adam Beach), Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara), June Moone/Enchantress (played by Cara Delevingne) and Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman). Obviously outside of the squad you have the King of Gotham - The Joker (played by Jared Leto).Overall, my favourite squad member is tough and it is between Deadshot and Harley because I feel those roles were played perfectly by the actors and you really felt connected to them even though they are villains. They really made the film what it was in my opinion. Everyone was worried about The Joker in the film due to the late Heath Ledger as he made that role his own and even I thought that no one can top that performance. Even though Jared Leto didn't top it...he made it his own and his Joker is as incredible and insane as ever. He left me speechless. In my opinion, make your own opinion, Mine is that when I left the cinema I wanted to go back in and watch it again just to have my mind blown a second time. But it is up to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like Iron Man and Thor you must have a quality actor portraying the main character and this movie made the right move with Big Will. The story was already known thru the comic books so you need the right people to portray evil and redemption and good. I came out of this movie pumped up and ready to destroy evil. Just like every fantasy character we read about in books and watch in movies. This movie was a great escape. Bad guys putting down even badder guys. This was great to see in 3D and the sound was not over the top. Another great performance was that of Viola Davis, she reminded me of a very evil high school principal Thank you Will Smith for another great ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plus: Good solid build up, nice main character introductions. Margot Robbie almost carries the film with her brilliant acting, making you wish there will be a Joker/Harley Quinn spin-off. The action doesn't become boring as in many other super hero flicks. Great styling, sets and casting. Some nice jokes. A nice attempt to try and get sympathy for the villains setting some kind of moral complexity, but it doesn't come off very strong. Minus: Of course the movie is full of cliche's and false sentiments, Will Smith get's way too much screen time as a less interesting character claiming the moral high ground, compared to Jared Leto as the Joker, who gets way to little screen time. Cara Delevinge is a horrid casting choice for the role of a professor, her acting is weak, she's way too young and unconvincing as the witch. The whole is pretty predictable, but will leave most Marvel fans happy to have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent action film. The first act felt like a mix of a Guy Ritchie heist film blended together with some dark humor. The rest of the film reminded me of "Escape from New York". Anti heroes forced to do a mission in a desolated city with a time limit. It is a weird movie at times. But, I understand why. The characters are weird themselves, so the film should have us seeing their world view. That being said, there are still a lot of tonal differences in this movie which could put you off very easily.Right from the start you see that this is going to be a different entry in the DC universe. Once you get what style its going for then it's more easy to have fun with it. The atmosphere of the prison setting is great and the introduction of the characters was fun and makes you understand most of them.Will Smith was the best he has been for years. Margot Robbie as Harley was just like seeing the character leap out from comics and cartoons. Killer Croc played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was a good addition, great that they used a practical suit. Joel Kinnaman was also very good as the guy who most keep the squad together. He also showed a lot of emotion. Actually all the actors did a great job. Must of the time you forget who is playing them and just see the characters, which is a good thing. All of them have a humanity about them despite the insanity that they inhabit. Jay Hernandez as Diablo surprised me with his a tragic background. Jai Courtney gave probably his best performance he has given. Jared Leto was actually very interesting as the joker. I like the way he is portrayed as a gang leader and he has a unpredictability about him which makes the character unsettling on screen. He isn't in it enough to be judged properly though.Those are the things I like about the movie. Now for what I thought could be better. I think the villain was too convenient and I little too over the top at times. I think the squad should have gone out for some other mission and then during the mission you could have a twist and make them fight something supernatural like the Enchantress. But the idea of the Enchantress starting to do her evil plan just at the same time the squad is assembled felt like a weird coincidence. And I thought that the light beam to the sky was uninteresting and already used in way too many comic book films. The action scenes could have had better variations, the seemed to repeat themselves.Since the DC films are trying to catch up to Marvel it seems they add too much story in each film. The flashbacks were needed to set everyone up, but they felt short and choppy. I could feel that a lot of it was cut out. But, the film would have benefited with the flashbacks being longer, because the origin stories of these guys are interesting. Since the need to cram all of these things into one film it felt like they tried to tell the stories of another film all together.All in all, the film was decent and entertaining. A bit bloated and better threats and action set pieces would have made it better. The bar scene was probably my favorite scene in the movie. It was a nice character moment and felt focused. I think they at DC are starting to learn how to make these films better now. Well, I hope so at least. It wasn't fantastic, but fun and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Suicide Squad" Is As Good As The Actions Of Its Antiheros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The world changed when Superman flew across the sky... and then it changed again when he didn't" says Waller at the beginning of the film. Based on the villains from DC comics created by John Ostrander and Len Wein in the early 80's; "Suicide Squad" (the most anticipated film of 2016) erects its story after the events witnessed in "Batman v Superman" (another of the most awaited of the year). Without the protection of Superman, USA is defenseless with respect to national security, therefore, Amanda Blake Waller ( Viola Davis) - high- ranking American government official and associated of the agency ARGUS - rethinks her project of national protection reforming ones few changes with the purpose of be accepted. Her project is entitled "Suicide Squad" and it constitute by highly dangerous criminals imprisoned in a high security prison. It is here where we know to Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Courtney), Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje), El Diablo (Hernandez), Sliptknot (Beach). "You want to put our national security in the hands of witches, gang-bangers and crocodiles?" asks an official public directly to Waller. This, the only alternative of global salvation for attacking to Enchantress (Delevingne), a powerful witch of black magic that wishes to exterminate the human race with its granitic brother, Incubus.The anomalous dissemination of the film has solidified the expectations of the whole world, the boys most evil and deranged of the planet as heroes, Suggestive? Of course, but as if it were another Hollywood product, so wonder is not relatively true. I am of those who do not see trailers, TV Spots, interviews or ads with products of such great magnitude like this one, so I attended to the movie theater with the naivete of a child small, without consent of its argument but predisposed to amaze me. However, I was also predisposed to bring me a bad taste due to critics reviews published yesterday that I accidentally saw, and the result was a mixture of both presentiments. "Suicide Squad" possessed potential and knew take advantage it during certain scenes with certain characters, nevertheless, an unintelligible script, untapped characters and an directing not appropriate for this kind of movies makes it a small step for the DCEU and not the leap to fame of a company that strives to predominate. They had the opportunity on their hands, but some villains snatched them shamelessly.The comic fans/ cinephiles will receive pleasant delights from its screenwriter and director David Ayer, in addition to some cameos ("The Flash" &amp; "Batman" portray to police officers imprisoning to villains, something not very useful for a generic development, except for the arrest of Quinn), the soul and costumes of the characters are chimeric and hilarious. Its soundtrack fits with delicateness and rebellion to the harmony of each scene; Eminem, Rhapsody and Skrillex offer a dark auditive landscape. Ayer also delights to the eye with comic fidelity, nevertheless, the double- edged of this strategy made less than more, basing on several comics, they omit some important information (about the Joker) complicating the creation of a rational and harmonious argument for the film. By the same token, the comical aspect was at the hands of the Harley Q - steals the scenes -, a black humor with Deadshot and crazy humor by the Joker. David Ayer feared to repeat the mistake of Znyder ("BvS") with "SQ", so, he decided to make the so known "re- shoots" for fill it of color and visual saturation, however, nor darkness nor the fluorescence has been of the pleasure of critics.Disappointing was to see that Leto's much-vaunted Joker did not form part of the squad and also with all the advertising boom and anticipations did not reach the connection I expected, Yes, he is a worthy successor to Ledger but his scant projected story and his not so majestic appearances placed him in a third plane. More striking and shocking I find to Smith, who, as his character, never wasted a bullet and with Deadshot just dead on target, again. "SQ" also lacks of a villain worthy of presence, Delevingne does not convince and was a bad play establish her as the antagonist main, weak point of the script. Robbie is undoubtedly the protagonist of the film, her introduction, her dialogues, her hobbies and her psychotic and brazen way of being ridicule others male villains, Margot steals the credit and we look forward to her solo film with greed."Suicide Squad" is Harley Quinn, the Joker, Deadshot, specific scenes of the development and allegorical final scene. We need a sequel, with the same characters, but with a script more lucid and comprehensible, more progress around the other antiheros and a distinct focus, sorrowfully, our villains continue with the bad luck of DC and remain as an excellent summer blockbuster, 2016 has not turning back, but 2017 is coming ("WW" &amp; "JL").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to the critics! The movie was fun, and action packed and awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONS: 1) I wanted more from Killer Croc. I wasn't the happiest with the way he spoke or moved. But that's a minimal gripe. 2) I also had a little issue with the "acting" of Diablo. He had a great moment in the final fight and that made up for it, but i felt like he was kind of a cheesy actor and wasn't as "natural" as others. Ironically, this was only in the end for the final fight. Because the rest of the film, I like how he had the "sentimental reveal" and I really connected with him. 3) Finally, i had a moment or two of saying "really, that's it?" when it came to the final fight. For example, with Enchantress' brother. I expected much more from him. I also thought Enchantress was way more powerful and shouldn't have had such a hard time with them or been defeated so easily. There was a moment where she said something like "enough of this....play time is over" and she waved her hands and disarmed everyone. When that happened, i was like "you should have done that from the beginning!" LOL. 4)In the beginning, I felt as if they were jumping in quick and I thought the movie was about to end. Then they expanded further and did some flashbacks and it all made more sense. It also continued past where I thought it was going to end and I was relieved. 5)Too much of the comedic moments were in the trailers. For a movie that didn't show too many trailers, I was surprised that a good portion of the major comedy moments were already spoiledHaving said that, there was waaaaaaaay more good than bad! Things I loved were: PROS: 1)Loved Will's portrayal of Deadshot. He killed it! I look forward to seeing him in another movie. 2)Loved Amanda Waller??.i can see her definitely being the lynch-pin between all future DCEU movies (kinda like Fury initially was) while working in the shadows. ESPECIALLY after that mid-credit scene they showed! 3)I loved the chemistry with the whole Squad. They def pulled off having multiple stars in a single movie. 4)The humor was great and so was the music. Sometimes the audience didn't laugh as much as I expected at certain jokes, but it could have easily been a diff reaction if I was in a diff theater with diff ppl. 5)The appearances by Batman and The Flash were perfect. Just enough to wet everyone appetite for Justice League and the upcoming solo films. Once again, it wasn't THEIR film, so they only needed to be seen in terms of quick backstory and how they relate to the Squad as opposed to full character development. 6)Action sequences were well played out. I think Civil War set the bar HIGH and it will be hard to top or meet. But it's the same for Deadpool when it comes to comedy. Suicide Squad had a good mixture of both even if it didn't exceed the other films in their respective areas of focus. OVERALL, It's DEFINITELY worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Lived Up To The Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide squad, the film that I have been hyping about for over a year with my brother and my dad. Every time a new trailer came out we all sat around a computer and watched it, waiting patiently for the film to come out. And when it did, we all thought it lived up to the hype. let's dive in. Amanda waller (Viola Davis) is a government agent who realizes that with superman gone, the next superman might be evil and thus she forms the task force of some of the most dangerous people in the world to defeat a powerful supernatural being. Now first off, Amanda Waller is scary as all hell, I mean like when I saw the trailers, my thought was; "how scary can this government agent be in comparison to a team of dangerous criminals", then after watching the film, my thought was; "I would rather be in one of jigsaw's deathtraps then be in the same room as that terrifying government agent". That is how scary she is. Secondly, the joker (Jared leto) is not the villain in this film, I have no problem with that, I just want to point that out. He is more of a supporting character. Third, the characters are really good in this movie. I really feel like the actors were having fun with the role. I felt lots of connection with the characters. They did a good job at casting. Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) were great on screen together. I really have just one big complaint with the film; the pacing. The film starts off really fast paced, then it slows down so much to the point where I felt so bored because of how slow it was to the beginning. And then it speeds back up, then slows down, and it is a big problem, but that is my only real problem. With all of that said, I give this film &#x2158; stars.</fullReview>

I loved the costumes, the soundtrack was kick***! and the characters were very well executed not to mention the acting was on point. There was a few downsides but there was a lot of upsides. If you love DC or Love Marvel or hell even LOVE superhero movies in general than this movie is right for you! I give Suicide Squad 9/10 because nothing is ever perfect but this summer gem is damn near it.P.S I loved the neon colors they looked so beautiful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i won't say i hate this movie as it's made out to be. It's an above average movie. May be because i like dark themes, i enjoyed this movie unlike others.At few times movie became boring, but then it does have some high moments, specially Harley Quinn's and Joker's love story.I do think Jared Leto is good as Joker and so is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. I wouldn't have mind "Michael Rowe" (from the TV series Arrow) to play Deadshot.Those who're comparing it with X-Men Apocalypse, i actually enjoyed it more than the apocalypse. And at anytime this movie doesn't deserve a score of 26% rotten at rotten tomatoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will go down as one of the most underrated films in the history of cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was honestly baffled at how low some of these reviews have been. "the characters weren't given enough backstory" Um, ARE YOU INSANE?! The characters that needed build(Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Rick Flag and the Enchantress) got just that: build! I bet you'd still call the movie bad for "giving too many characters unnecessary backstories" had they went in the direction of giving detailed backstories to the likes of Killer Croc, Katana and Slipknot. "The Joker was barely in it" The movie is called "Suicide Squad" NOT "The Joker" alright? And, from the short time that Jared Leto's Joker was in the movie, he knocked it out of the park! "The editing was choppy" Now, I will admit, some of the editing in the first 20-25 minutes was kind of all over the place. But beyond that, there were little problems with the editing! "There was too much music" I feel like music doesn't hinder my viewing experience even if it's hammered into the movie, as long as the movie's soundtrack is enjoyable. And guess what! The soundtrack to Suicide Squad is GREAT! That's not even talking about the many, MANY laugh out loud moments, GREAT performances from all characters, main and supporting(yes, that includes MOST of the villains performance), the great action scenes, and the multiple emotional moments that had me tearing up multiple times during the movie! The cinema that I saw this movie in applauded multiple times during this movie, and I could see why. The only problems I had were the previously mentioned shoddy editing in the first 20 minutes, and the villain being kind of meh. Besides those reasons, Suicide Squad is one of my favorite comic book movies, and definitely up there with the likes of Deadpool, Civil War and The Nice Guys as one of my favorite movies of the year! Final verdict: 4.75/5 (or 9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waaaauuuuw, what a ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie. To me, as a comic book and superheroes animated fan, DC nailed it? again? Because I also LOVE the two previous DCEU movies despite of all the bad critics? and no, I don't hate Marvel movies, I also LOVE Marvel movies. I just see them as two different visionaries on their take of superheroes. It's like comparing Disney animated movies with Dreamworks or Japanese Manga. They have similarities but are not the same. I see a lot of bad critics mentioning Marvel movies in their reviews and that Warner Bros should learn from them etc? blablabla.. I really hope WB will not listen to them and keep on track with what they are doing, because if I'm going to watch a DC movie, I want to get a DC movie. The DCEU is like Ginger ale to me and Marvel is like a Coke. I love to drink a Coke and I love to drink some ginger ale. But strangely there are people who are drinking ginger ale and think it should taste like a coke. Anyway? back to Suicide SquadBringing comic book and animated heroes to live action, is something very hard to do without making it too slapstick and silly. What may work in comic books and in animated movies, will definitely not always work in live action. But with Suicide Squad all the quirkiness works out pretty well? Why??? Because?. It's Suicide Squad? a bunch of deranged villains with powers and/or abilities in a world where there are meta humans, magic and the fracking Justice League with Batman. DC Comic book fans will certainly see all the cameo's and understand the story line. I saw an actually story arc of Enchantress and Diablo and they used the Suicide Squad to tell it. These two characters are the least known to most people, but I saw what they were doing with these two characters throughout the movie and for me as a true fan it was mind blowing. For the people who have never read a DC comic book ever, if you take this movie too seriously, don't. Just sit back, enjoy the ride because you are in for a mind blowing soundtrack throughout the movie and an amazing fun time with all the characters. Warner Bros does not play it safe, but they stay true to the heart and soul of the DC Comics and they sure deliver to the true fans with this awesome movie. It is a must see movie for true comic book fans and for people who like fun action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Harley Quinn's Movie, and I Couldn't Be Happier!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of both Harley Quinn and the Suicide Squad comic books, I was very excited to see the movie. While a few parts were lame (plot), and some characters were completely unnecessary (Slipknot), it was a fun ride. This is Harley Quinn's movie! Margot Robbie was the perfect choice to portray our favorite DC anti-hero. She's sexy, wacky, and capable of taking care of herself. Ignore the critics and watch the film in 3D this weekend. It may have a few flaws, but overall it's the perfect summer blockbuster. Be warned: The Joker isn't in the movie very much. Jared Leto was wonderful during his limited screen time and shares beautiful chemistry with Margot's Harley Quinn. Never listen to the critics; watch for yourselves. If you're in the mood for a fun action film, be sure to check out Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a gorgeous comic book adaptation and Margot Elise Robbie stole the show and like last time(BVS) critics can go to hell.... The movie has done justice to the DCEU franchise and the characters were given importance accordingly...I mean every character had a job in this movie but it kinda ranged from least important to most important but none of the characters feel 'under used"... Jared Leto was awesome and I like this psychopath gangster version of the Joker :D but some may feel his portions were small but I say it did justice to the story. All of his screen time was well applauded :) There are some great cameos and a super good mid post credit sequence so look forward to it!!!! But I did feel they had to chop off a lot of parts to make a crisp theatrical cut but hope they give us a bigger extended version for the blue ray :) And you need to know a lil bit of comics to understand some parts but otherwise its fine... Last but not the least, Jai Courtney! he and his pink unicorn did a great job making the audience laugh :D The movie is so good , you won't feel the time passing :D Great job Warner Bros. Pictures :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers were 12 out of 10, absolutely amazing. I'm not a big superhero fan, but while the plot was typically weak, it was better than most superhero movies. In my opinion the movie ranges between good and excellent... ultimately, its lacks some polish but is certainly worthwhile. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis are excellent, while Jared Leto's performance as The Joker is mixed with some very convincing scenes and also some underwhelming efforts. Importantly, the characters are much more interesting and likable than Marvel's current stable, and I expect the sequel will have a better director, editor and soundtrack, and possibly a better plot which makes this movie a worthwhile and enjoyable prelude to something very special down the line, especially with a likely improved performance from Jared Leto as The Joker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Ayers delivered every expectations that I had for Suicide Squad; after carefully watching this movie two times to study the casting and the plot delivery of the film, I must say I absolutely love it. I am not sure why it was rated a 7.3 when I strongly believe that it should of had a higher rate. You know when your extremely hungry and see food for the first time since your last meal? you know that excitement you get? well, that's how it was for me. There are so many good things to talk about this film; Lets start with the cast, the energy these actors portrayed in there roles was thrilling, every actor chosen by the casting director Lindsay Graham and Mary Vernieu were well analyzed. The graphics of the movies were out of this world, the colors and the bubbly fonts matched perfectly with the theme. Steven Price did such a good job choosing the soundtrack of Suicide Squad, that as soon as I got out of the advance movie screening I went to iTunes and downloaded the whole soundtrack of this film (my favorite song is Kehlani-Gangster). I recently had commented on a film I had reviewed that to be able to have a successful movie specially if its 2 hours long, it had to be able to catch the audience attention. This film had me smiling the whole 2 hours of excitement, it was a reminder why I will never regret choosing the field of Academia studies that I choosed. I would watch this movie over and over again, and I am not a second movie watcher. The editor of Suicide Squad Steven Price did a phenomenal job, every scene was perfectly cut and the color correcting was fantastic! everything was in sync and not once did I notice any error. I must say that 3/4th proceeding to the ending of the film, I felt like Cara Delevingne character (known as Enchantress) was becoming a little bit superficial to me, I loved the whole dark spooky design of the character, but then it became a little too "clean" and well cut when she got her power back; But overall, I can eat cupcakes and watch this movie! DC comics did a great job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I went out and watched this movie, I had heard A LOT of bad reviews - so I was fairly concerned about watching this movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised how the movie captivated me from the very beginning. Most people think that The Joker doesn't have enough screen time in the movie, which yes, he doesn't but in my opinion, I think he had just enough screen time to make all his scenes make sense - besides, he actually isn't a part of The Suicide Squad. I was also pretty worried that Harley Quinn's character would be made into some type of sex symbol that over shadowed her character, but once again, I was pleasantly surprised that they kept her sex symbol status to a minimum and let her character flourish. Every scene in this movie makes sense and all links together. There's not "too much" happening as it all links to the overall story line. This movie is very similar to the anime version as well, so if you want an idea of how the movie is going to go - give that a watch. I really enjoyed this movie and would happily watch it again.</fullReview>

Movie isn't perfect cause it does has its flaws, but it'll get the job done while watching it. I will admit that it was overly hyped though cause it could have met the hype but it did not.

		<fullReview>Okay so everything was awesome in this film. This film is just as good as the batman trilogy. The Harley Quinn character is perfect there's only one time where she doesn't sound good.. Like one line. And the joker is awesome he doesn't come out throughout 100% of the movie but he is in the storyline. From beginning to end. Deadshot is hilarious the film focuses on every character. But a few characters have more sciences than other. Katana, killer croc, and Echantress could have been given more scenes but if you know your comics your good. Amanda Waller is exactly like the book version but a bit worse like in evilness. El diablo and deadshot will make you cry. The villains are like the avengers but with a funny evil side to them. They could be more evil. The movie is as good as any other movie it's not as good as the titanic but it's not as bad as Batman v.s Superman which was only bad because it was confusing. Oh and when Harley and joker dance it makes you want to cry because that scene is perfect. It's exactly like they dance in the comics but better. And Harley's outfit is more explained in the movie because if you read the comics you know that Harley has said that it would be boring to wear the same outfit everyday like superman. And captain boomerang is funny but not as noticed as other characters.</fullReview>

With wonderful performances by Will Smith and Margot Robbie, as well as terrific special and practical effects, David Ayer really comes through. Although critics hate it, the film does have beautiful cinematography and great action-packed choreography. It is definitely better than its previously made partner film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, however it does have its own subtle flaws. It is a very odd film and is executed almost perfectly. Do go watch this movie, it will definitely be worth your tine and money! You will NOT be disappointed, even through its few flaws.

P.S., THE MOVIE REALLY DOVE INTO HARLEY'S MINDSET, which was cool cause Margot played her effortlessly.Jared did better than I thought as Joker. DC has a lot of work to do though but this was definitely a turn around. I'm gonna buy the blu-ray when it comes out for the extra footage!!!! Joker(Jared), and the fire of his loins, Harley, need more screen time, I cant wait to see what the future holds for them cause how the two interact from here on out will be fleshed out on the big screens reaaal soon.

Never lacked pace It must be so difficult to make a good film, in the insane world of Comic Movies.I will opine SS has overcame the difficulty, and produced a cracking good film. Watched today in a 4DX cinema, most people would look at the prices of 4DX showings and look for normal showings. 4DX is ridiculously expensive, ?30 for two seats&#x1f631; When you experience it, you will save your money to go to the next one. At this time 4DX is the best cinema experience you will ever have.Suicide Squad is the benchmark, brilliant.Brilliant film and 4dx is a awesome experience</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like real life movies or Shakespeare or other stuff that bores me to rears you will hate this movie. If you are a film critic that likes movies that are duller than dog dodo you will hate this movie. If you have a sense of humor and like to have fun you will love this movie. This is a great summer block buster and by far the best movie of the summer, that I have seen at least. Most movies disappointed me this year but not Suicide Squad, it was a blast. The CGI was great, there was plenty of comic relief, and I found the film slowed down in spots just enough to catch my breath, then went right back to action. I liked the way Will Smith is toned down, so other actors could shine. I really miss Heath Ledger as the joker, Jared Leto did a good job but was not in the same league as Ledger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely One step above Batman v Superman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of David Ayer, who directed movies like Fury with Brad Pitt, you'll enjoy Suicide Squad even more. It moves like most of his military styled movies, which makes perfect sense for what The Suicide Squad is all about. He rightfully treats The Squad as a covert black ops team made of low end criminals which is what they are.Will Smith can do no wrong. He was perfect as dead shoot (That's right the black man playing the White character was perfect). Will was able to take everything that made him a movie star and transfer it into the Deadshot character (It's weird that out of all the superheroes he could have played, this is the one he chooses)I did like Harley Quinn's first appearance on the big screen. It was everything I hoped for and more. Viola Davis, steps straight out of the comic with a dead on performance as Amanda Waller.I could go on and on about how the movie selected the perfect cast to play The Suicide Squad, as it was a perfect cast that brought the comic book to life on the big screen. Watching these guys interact was the highlight of the film.Plus Batman is in it, creating the strong connection in The DC animated Universe. But like Batman V Superman we are weighted down by a bunch of character backstory that does slow down the pace sometimes stopping everything from progressing, which should not be the case, but give it to Ayer, it does not suffer from this as much as Bats v Supes does. In the long run, the developing of the characters, (All of which, most of the movie going audience may not have herd of) turned out to be good for Suicide Squad, helping to make the bad guys likable.I will say that for David Ayer's first real stab at the Superhero genre, it's very good, but skimps a bit on the superhero (or rather Super villain) part. I don't know weather it was because Warner Bros. was breathing down his neck about creating a franchise or because it was the first time the director had to do so many special effects. I have seen him do a better job when it comes to drama and tension among teammates.Plus Jared Leto's Joker does suffer a little bit from Harley Quinn taking center stage. He just did not seem crazy enough.So overall, lots of origins stories to get through before getting to the main plot of The Suicide Squad makes for a group of anti-heroes you want to watch, as David Ayer creates an expendable SWAT team similar to his Arnold Schwarzenegger starring film, Sabotage.Recommend taking a look.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun movie. Might be a disappointment for the people who love the marvel formula.Not a bright movie with lots of jokes. Follows the dark tone world created by the past two DCEU movies. People wanted a 'simpler' plot and a simpler plot was given .There is not much of Joker as expected fromt the trailers. It is not a joker movie and is a suicide squad movie which does not include the Joker.And the Joker is fairly a side character giving life to Harley Quinn.So to Judge Leto we have to wait for an actual movie with the Joker. Is a perfect mix of realness and a comic book movie that DC likes to follow. The character development is done very well in a very small time . Will smith works very well as Deadshot and feels very in place. Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn. Some surprisingly emotional scenes in the movie. There is adequate chemistry between the characters. The movie is funny as Deadshot and captain boomerang give out great one liners .All in all is a movie worth watching .Has simple writing that is very fun to watch .Funny ,dark and gritty at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haven't been home for more than 10 minutes, but I just had to address the critics. SUICIDE SQUAD Did NOT deserve the 27% Rotten Tomatoes gave it. After reading all the reviews, I was devastated, but it wasn't bad...wasn't perfect either. It's what I expected of DC. THIS Ain't MARVEL FAM. Definitely GO see the movie! FOR THE MOST PART, each characters backstory was coherent, and I loved how HARLEY was fleshed out, shes a wacky girl.Joker was entertaining, Jared Leto is the BEST choice for this movie, and for the direction DC is going for, if this is any indication of it. Although I LOVED it, there was something off with the movie. Can't quite put my finger on what it was, but I gave it a 8.5 to 9/10.My mom said, "This movie saved DC," (and shes tough to please like omg) and my dad gave it a 7.5/10 if that says anything(which was surprising because he was geeked at first to see it. But then again I was reading him reviews before we went to see the movie, and he's impressionable.) "He(my dad) said he liked it but was expecting more." Sure they have some work to do, but I feel that this is just a stepping stone for more movies to come.I suppose reading all the issues with re-shooting, an alleged six- week script, and all the rumors circulating right now, if this is considered "bad" than I'll take it. Cause it's not as bad as everyone is making it seem, like I truly tried to find a lot to s*** on cause I was on Twitter when the chaos erupted. It wasn't a lot to whine about. At least I wasn't bored like I was when I watched Batman v Superman...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this film with 0 expectations. From a film-making perspective, this film is a mess, edited so poorly and chopped up to no end. Warner Bros. execs need to stop screwing with their directors and just need to let them make their films! GREAT action! The action sequences in this film are definitely highlights, but an overuse of slow-motion shots takes away from it a bit. The beginning of the film, specifically the character introductions, were very nice to see. It looked and felt like pages of a comic book right there on the screen!The film essentially had a 1st and 3rd act, and it seemed like much of the 3rd act's villain was meant to be there, instead of within the first half hour of the film. Many of the characters had multiple motivations toward the end. Generic villain plot with beam in sky we've seen in Avengers, TMNT 1, MoS, Fant4stic, and again just this summer with TMNT 2 and Ghostbusters. Why can't we get an original story where the villain doesn't need a device???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey! I Just watched Suicide Squad last night, and I am a huge fan of the comics. Now since I have read almost every single comic of Suicide Squad I know for a fact that The Joker didn't have much of a role in these comics hence it is justified that Jared leto's role as the joker wasn't the main role, it was more of a side story line in the movie. Which is the thing I love the most about this movie. The direction was amazing, the way deadshot shoots off all the enchantress's companions while standing on the car. I always wanted to see that scene. Harley quinn's human side overlapping her sociopath side especially the scene where the Joker actually drops her off the helicopter just so that she survives and the way she fakes her craziness after that was amazing. Di Abalo was surprisingly so good SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD literally the best character David Ayer could ever get for the movie. He did a great job carrying up his past and accepting the fact he killed his family and how this will help him make things right. Katana origins weren't changed and a very smart thing to do. Deadshot and his daughter's relationship was beautiful. Amanda waller that mean bi*ch was completely in her act a very good job done. Its a 10/10 from me since the direction and the script of such movies is really tough to bring out and David ayer was able to do that. He did a great job to show the origins of the whole squad and relate it to the present. Amazing job done. !!! Ironic Im going to the cinemas again to watch it lol. You guys should watch it and let critics bark coz they are best at it. Best of luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Amazing - Joker and Harley Are the BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the movie with my partner quite skeptical due to the lousy critical reviews it had received since its release. However, I was pleasantly and maniacally surprised with a pretty amazing movie that was directed pretty nicely. Most of the characters and story lines were basically taken from the comics themselves which was nice to see for a change. Leto's Joker and Robbie's Harley clicked perfectly with one another and left me and my partner pretty entertained throughout the movie. The Joker was used mostly to keep the story moving along and that was one of the things which bothered me the most with the other being how much screen time Deadshot received. Most of Joker's scenes were cut especially the ones that were shown in previews which irks me somewhat and makes me feel like the film used slightly false advertising to draw audiences in more. Deadshot got way too much screen time and seemed to have a better costume/makeup job than everyone else which also irks me because the movie is not even about Deadshot and his story at all. Overall though it was a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been epic.. but came out to be a steaming pile of trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this one the retarded story line is dominating through out the movie. All of it is nothing but random sloppy video clips hardly stitched together.The first 50 minutes of the movie is the chaotic 3 to 5 minute trailers introducing the characters, which was completely unnecessary. We already know who the characters are(also there is google). The movie should have started straight by introducing the main objective of the story. Establish the problem and send the Suicide Squad to solve it, tie in the characters story lines in between the action bits and don't waste time on BS.Also the sound track of the movie is ridiculous. 30 second installments of popular music pieces for each scene sounds and feels ridiculous and out of place.The choice for actors is total crap. The only good choices are Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne. Harley Quinn looks cool but couldn't save the movie. Enchantress is wasted as a character, stripped of potential and looks like sh*t.Will Smith should not be in another Superhero movie and at all I think it's time for him to quit. The guy is full of sh*t and craps all over his characters in all of his movies in the past years. Jared Leto is not the Joker type of guy. The Joker-Harley Quinn story line is lame as hell. A love story to the point of puking. A sort of a brief family drama as if they are some kind of high school sweet hearts or something. LAME. The Joker blew in this movie badly.Enchantress character is wasted. Completely. Cara is hot and she could've been a good Enchantress but The Director wasted her character. The enchantress story line in the movie is ridiculous on a whole another level. It's just ridiculous.First of all Enchantress basically is the only Super Villain in this movie who really has some wonderful magic superpowers and it's quite obvious that she could have won easily. Secondly she is way too powerful for Suicide Squad by a large margin and is defeated way too easily. I mean at the end she actually just strips everyone of their weapons. WHY SO SOON??? I mean Cara's character is wasted completely. What a shame. The chick is clearly hot and got potential to play cool characters even though she usually is cast in some lame ass dramas.El Diablo is another character which has cool magic but the character is also wasted. He gets like 2 minutes of some lame action at the end and dies.What they do with The Joker at the end is ridiculous. Does he die? Is this suppose to be The intrigue of the movie? Pathetic. Obviously Joker shouldn't die and there was no need for this Intrigue. Basically the idea for ending in this movie was taken from the Batman: Assault on Arkham (2014). Actually quite a few bits was taken from this animated movie and applied here. A sign of laziness and disrespect to the fans.The dialogue throughout the movie is corny as hell. Only Harley Quinn's part seems all right given the circumstances. Even though some of her dialogue is corny, but for the most part it's OK, but doesn't help the movie even one bit. Her dialogue and her character just don't work well with other character in this movie, The Joker included.Batman is corny as hell. A tradition as of lately.This movie is a spit in a fan's face. A completely disrespectful movie to the fans. WIN for the team Hollywood.Everyone expected at least a well developed action with some funny material or even something epic. FAILED.So we only have to wait for the next installment and hope they don't f**k up the next one. But given they use the same actors, then probably the next one is gonna be sh*t as well. Hoping at least for a good story but something tells me it ain't gonna happen.This Suicide Squad.. may have just suicide killed a part of DC universe. But nothing new here. SvB have kinda killed DC by making sh*t look ridiculous. I think DC is taking wrong turns and is going to waste the franchise.. just like Marvel.Is it that hard to learn from The Goodfellas or Original Predator or Aliens or Dune or a ton of other epic works of art??? I mean how stupid do you have to be to fail such epic-ness as Suicide Squad?? There are tons of "team" movies to learn from. Full Metal Jackets, The Platoon.Suicide Squad could have been EPIC.All right.. at least they could have shown a sex scene with Harley Quinn. But not. Even in that animated Batman: Assault on Arkham (2014) there was a short sex scene with Harley. EVEN in animated movie. What a blown chance to show some good ass. What a major FAIL!!!You know who The Joker should be?? Billy Bob Thornton Batman? Steven Seagal</fullReview>

Nothing is achieved with all of these different characters and the story of Deadshot is sobbing bad. Harley Quin is too slow, didn't the writers look at the essence of Deadpool? Only stole a fluffy horse from it, which adds nothing. And they stalled the movie to add extra jokes in it...but making a funny remark and then waiting for laughter kills a movie. How boring was it before??? And the story lines go nowhere and are inconsistent. And why can you kill an enemy creature whit a baseball bat and not bij shooting a clip through them.

Will Smith and Margot Robbie steal the show but Jared Leto's role was well done as well. The action, in my honest opinion, is very well done and the film is funny when it needs to be.Bad: The film overall feels a bit choppy and the editing is not perfect . Despite his good performance, Jared is not in the movie that much but that could be a good thing for some people. Also I liked his performance but not the type of Joker he made. Some members felt unimportant and the villain was kind of weak in terms of character but makes up for it in the sheer stakes.Best Part: The action scene involving Will Smith/Deadshot standing on top of a derelict car doing what Deadshot does best.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad guys have all the fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Suicide Squad' is one of those films that's surrounded by 'filmic politics' before you ever enter the theatre. You have the fact that it's based on a comic therefore there is an army of fans who are ready to pick apart how their favourite bad-guys are portrayed on screen. Plus it's part of DC Comics' attempt at playing catch-up to Marvel by creating their own shared universe. Then you have it as a ? loose ? sequel to Batman vs Superman, which is a film that has totally divided the entire world right down the middle as to its quality. And it seems that Suicide Squad is going to go down that route.It doesn't have Superman in and Batman is merely a cameo. Many will at least expect the Joker to be a major player, but his appearances amount to little more than an extended cameo. Plus you have people who will berate Jarred Leto's performance before they've seen it because a 'new Joker' is still a little too close to Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning portrayal of the 'Clown Prince of Crime.' What we have here is a superhero film about the villains. And, again, that is a difficult premise to sell. Marvel's universe was based on heroes and gave each their own movie to set them up before bringing them all together for the Avengers movies. Here, we're introduced to characters who all but the most ardent of comic book fans, will never have heard of.Anyway, the premise is simple (if a little far-fetched) ? a government agency decides that, in the event of an evil superhero threatening the world (or 'meta-human' as they're called) a task force of 'expendable' soldiers should be assembled in order to combat this. Therefore, all the villains currently in custody are brought together (just in time to combat such a threat!).You've probably already seen Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn (i.e. the Joker's long-suffering female associate) and, just because you haven't heard of 'Deadshot' you've probably heard of Will Smith, who plays him in the film. These two are basically the stars and will probably go much further in the DC shared universe. Both get the most screen time and for good reason ? they're the two who are most fun to watch. Harley Quinn is wonderfully bonkers and Will Smith plays a bad guy who still has enough good in him to save the universe while being bad at the same time.The action scenes are well done, but not excessive (maybe for budget limitations) and CGI isn't too prevalent, but, sadly, when used does come across as a little blatant. It's hard to say whether anyone will definitely love or hate the film, as ? like Batman vs Superman ? it seems to completely divide. I enjoyed it. It's harmless fun and does the job. Plus it's probably better than the Batman vs Superman film itself! However, for every person who loves it, someone else despises it. Even die-hard comic book fans won't be guaranteed to embrace it whole-heartedly.I see it as good, old-fashioned popcorn-munching fun. If I had one complaint I found it a little slow to start, but a film with so many characters needs to find a way to introduce their backstory somehow. If you're unsure of whether to watch it, read as many reviews as you can, or just wait until it appears on Netflix in a couple of year's time.</fullReview>

Oh wait, is that what is subversive ?The movie is badly directed, action scenes are a disaster, and the script !?! so many things happen in this movie with no reason at all... feels like they had no clues what to do next.The only two good points about this movie: the special effects.

The fact is I would let my 10-year-old see it but would still expect it to insult his intelligence. A cross between The Dirty Dozen and standard superhero fare the result is not as the makers probably intended. Suspension of disbelief is required in these Superhero films but the only disbelief I had to suspend was the that film direction could be so bad. The direction seems to have been to act as laconic as possible and the generated humour will carry a basically plot less movie through. Alas, this just results in overacting, creating annoying characters that seem written to appeal to boys in the range of 14-16, at the lower end of the IQ scale. Go if you want to see endless shots of Margo Robbie's behind as she walks away from a 'scene'. Or just go to Cheezers instead and buy yourself a beer, if that is your kind of thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start... Suicide Squad is a mess; you can feel the multiple rewrites, the three re-edits ('oh, Deadpool did well, we need more jokes.' 'Oh Batman vs Superman was panned by critics, we need to be like that' etc etc.) leaving this movie completely disjointed; all over the place. The multiple edits and re-shoots are physically visible in the movie - it takes you out of the film completely.I won't even mention the story - it's pointless. But story is never really what Suicide Squad is supposed to be about: The characters are. And this is one of the first major flaws of this movie: the characters are clearly separated into A grade - basically Will Smith, B Grade - Harley Quinn and then Z Grade: the rest of them. The Z Grades fight for 5% screen time and therefore become meaningless cannon fodder: they don't stand for anything, are completely undeveloped and thoroughly uninteresting. In certain cases they look bad (Killcroc) and are stupid clichés (Katana speaks Japanese and has a sword... ugh)Even Will Smith &amp; Harley Quinn don't really work. They're supposed to be villains... they're not. There isn't a single thing bad Deadshot Will has done in this movie. This means that the entire premise of Suicide Squad doesn't stand: they're not bad guys! They don't do anything bad! And don't get me started on the villain: idiotic and over-powerful yet super easy to defeat...!Visually the movie is in the same vain as the recent DC offerings but...somewhat less impressive? The characters look off, the effects are super dark and underwhelming...the super hero abilities fall flat...Suicide Squad does have some redeeming qualities... but they are very few and far between and contingent on you liking the source material and the characters. Pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is evil terrible.&nbsp; It's a glorification of brutal loss of morals by all parties, done in depressing dark colors, dirty textures and non stop ugly brutality. If folks are rating it 75, we are in serious trouble.&nbsp; I think the studios are stuffing the comment boxes big time.This movie is not just terrible.&nbsp; It's evil, it's an evil vision, it's an evil experience, it's just plain evil. I had to come home and watch Age of Ultron to clear my mind and soul.&nbsp; Wow, the contrast was universes apart.&nbsp; DC is promoting corruption, violence and evil, Marvel, even though it's an action movie with fights and deaths, is promoting love, caring and peace. The DC universe is dark and evil, so we have to be evil too. Parts of the Marvel universe are dark and evil, but not the majority of it. The Marvel heroes strive to stay good even when facing evil. The best DC universe version was the 2001-2006 Justice League and Justice League Unlimited cartoon series. Batman: the animated series 1992-1995 was pretty good too. This whole dirty gritty depressing version of the the DC universe has been tacked on by movie and TV directors, it has nothing to do with the comics, or the cartoons. It's contaminating some of the marvel TV shows too. I'm sick of it. It fetishizes evil. Not to mention, lack of color, amorphous cabbage heads for the enchanted soldiers, infantile story and characters, ugly sets, ugly costumes. ugly, ugly ugly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Of 2016!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was amazing everything was so funny and hilarious and the joker as jared leto was amazing i hope they will be making a batman movie with him in it but heres the reason why i rate it a 10/10 because in the beginning it was amazing how it showed who everyone was and what they did and it showed how jared letos joker fell in love with harley quinn and everything in this movie is amazing there is no favorite part to me and the only thing i don't like about this movie is that the director cut a lot of scenes out of from the joker and a few funny trailer scenes and that ticked me off but i think they should get another director in my book but that's just me but if you want to watch this movie or think it will be bad it will not trust me this movie is amazing everything about it and i trust that you will love it and i think jared leto was an amazing joker in this movie one of the best just not better than heath ledger but the second best of all time jokers and if you are thinking of buying this on blu-ray when it comes out you should i hope they have a directors cut because it will have all the deleted scenes but i think this movie is worth the pre-order and i definitely recommend you buy this i will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stop showing the best lines and jokes from films in the TRAILER!!! This stuff needs to be a surprise when viewing the actual movie. This film is a victim of two things critically, superhero film fatigue and trailer compression (ie. showing all the best parts in the bloody trailer!) Besides that it is a fantastic film with terrific performances. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie score a touchdown with their portrayals. Yes Leto's Joker is a contemporary version of the Joker, but in DC's revamped universe it works very well. Thematically please tell me how this film fundamentally differs from The Avengers? No it's not an imitation, although Marvel and DC have been shamelessly ripping each other off for 50 years at the newsstands. All superhero team ups are a derivative of the Seven Samurai or the Dirty Dozen anyway. Please stop using RT aggregates to judge films. They are no longer relevant. Go and see Suicide Squad. Relax and stop nit-picking and learn how to enjoy a good time once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad is okay, which is WAY better than Batman v Superman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on opening day because I'm such a fan of Harley and Joker together. Batman: The Animated Series was my show growing up. Harley and Joker WERE that show. Suicide Squad fell flat because of the absence of them. Jared Leto's Joker was great, and refreshingly different than past Jokers (Heath is still #1), but I was super annoyed by his lack of screen time. Every time Joker came on the scene, I was immediately interested, but he was there for only seconds at a time.Margot Robbie as Harley was fantastic. But, part of Harley's silly, craziness happens when she interacts with Joker and/or Batman. We got the tiniest of a glimpse of it in the beginning of the movie. Harley rides in a car with Joker, then Batman appears in the Batmobile and chases them. During this car chase we get the awesomeness of Harley's wicked humor and crazy girlfriend traits. Every scene that involved Joker and Harley together were by far the best scenes. Their silly, crazy, demented relationship together is what the movie should have focused on. Enchantress should not have been the main villain, it should have been Joker. Because he's JOKER. You can't have Joker in a film about DC Villains and not have him be in the forefront.Will Smith was the only other part of the movie that I liked. He was hilarious and perfect as Deadshot. The Squad should have just been Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, Enchantress, Rick Flag, Katana, with the addition of Nemesis. The main villains should have been Joker and Harley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Superhero Movie Since 2003's Hulk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fair warning: DO NOT SEE SUICIDE SQUAD!!! It's a waste of time and money and they don't deserve anymore than what they've already received. There has been a lot of curiosity of what Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker would be, and I must tell you that it is without a doubt the worst Joker portrayal of all time. He is only in the movie for a brief amount of time and thank god because every second he was on that screen was pure and utter agony. He technically played a character called The Joker but what i saw was in no shape or form The Joker. Will smith doesn't play dead shot, he plays will smith. Harley Quinn hardly even speaks like Harley Quinn. If your looking for a bright spot in this movie, don't worry, there isn't one. This movie encapsulates everything that's wrong with studio films nowadays. Cater to the young audience who isn't even a fan of the source material. This movie was made to sell Halloween costumes and merchandise. That is all. Try again DC, cause Marvel is kicking your ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual depiction of Justice from the opposite site</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of bring about renowned heroes by the general public such as the ones in the past, Batman and Superman, DC tried to display a bunch of bad guys as 'villain' heroes. Some of them have no names and are addressed by codes. This time round, the saviours are no longer well-known and worshiped by the people and they sacrifice for the greater good but not vanity. It's about the brotherhood rather than the leverage emphasised by Waller. The common aspect of them is that each one of them is restrained by something emotional in their life, love for family, guilt for murder, relationship with lovers... which we can somewhat relate to ourselves - the humanity in all of us, regardless of our identity. I have to say that I'm stunned by the animation and the demonstration of weapons. I'm also struck by the convoluted relationship between Joker and Harley - the insanity and persistence. Anyway it's a movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid 8/10. Don't let bad reviews spoil it for you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a fine line between being critical and being a dick. When it came to reviewing Suicide Squad, the critics and Rottentomato users completely crossed that line. I have to admit, I like read some reviews about a film before watching it, or at least check the IMDb rating, but sometimes it just spoils the mood completely. Trust me when I say, that Suicide Squad is NOT as bad as everyone is making it seem like. That was the one question I googled before going to the cinemas to watch it. Is Suicide Squad as bad as everyone was saying and is it worth watching? Yes. It is worth watching and no, the film is not as bad as the reviews depicted it to be. I'm not giving this film a 10/10, because yes, there were some major flaws and some cringey moments : Unnecessary script, the forced laugh of the Joker and rushing of the plot, but it was still watchable, heck I enjoyed it. I was shocked by how well the movie started, with the introduction of the characters and the motif. It's only about half way through the film, that awkward scenes and bad script makes its appearance, but is definitely not as bad as most reviewers are saying. I loved the music by the way.I'd like to keep this review short and without any spoilers, so I won't elaborate on the flaws. Please, don't let bad reviews spoil it for you. Go watch it yourself and form your own opinion, personally I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun movie from beginning to end. A very solid re-invention of The Joker! No facial scars. Just a tatted up, "blinged out, grill and all" gangster!! Other than being Harley Quinn"s "puddin'" The Joker doesn't bring much as far as moving the plot along. Much like John Belushi in Animal House, or Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High he steals enough scenes to remain necessary. Plus who wouldn't want to see this Joker, along with Harley Quinn take on Batfleck. Not to mention Will Smith's Deadshot would make for some interesting confrontations against some of the DCEU superheros and meta-humans. Viola Davis was amazing as always. I can't wait to see how they bring her back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie but it was so disappointing. I'll take you through why I didn't like it. Like all movies, it comes down to the script. The script for this movie is terrible. Plain and simple. It is childishly cheesy at parts. Some of the events that take place... I literally sighed in the cinema. Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker is bad too. It's just wacky... not crazy, not mad, just terrible. This makes me really sad. Even after Heath Ledger's gritty and genius portrayal of the Joker, I thought that Leto could do a good job, after all, he is a great actor... but it is just weird and he is hardly in the movie. The characters have no characteristics - that is, consistent character traits that define them - one minute they are selfish but comical villains, the next, they are one big happy family trying to save the world! Moreover, there are so many character arcs in this film that every line of dialogue is exposition! It consists of one character telling another about their or someone else's backstory. The villain: Enchantress (if you could not tell by the trailers) is just another run of the mill villain, who wants to kill and destroy because... Not to mention shine a bright blue light in the sky while doing it... which is in every comic book movie now! Why DC?????? I am a DC. But Marvel films / TV shows are winning hands down at the moment. DC please get your act together! While you wait for them to, watch civil war. It will be a much more enjoyable and satisfying way to spend your time.p.s. how much did marvel pay me to write this review? A BILLION DOLLARS (credit only to be spent at Disneyland)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So I really like this movie and almost let reviews stop me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I greatly enjoyed this movie. So much so that I decided to make an account on IMDb just to say "really critics?" It isn't the best movie I have ever seen but a 47% and a 26% is appalling. This is coming from a Marvel fan, this may have been the second best movie I have see this year. (Deadpool takes the cake) It was funny, serious, action packed, and just fun. In some reviews I have seen "confusing story line," "badly edited," "bad CGI." First off, the story line wasn't confusing at all, not even in the slightest. Secondly, I seen no obvious problem with the editing. It flowed pretty well. Lastly the CGI wasn't the best I have ever seen but far from the worst, even in an A list movie. I liked the characters with a few exceptions but that is to be expected with any movie. I didn't care for Captain Boomerang very much. I highly recommend ignoring the reviews and checking it out for yourselves. This may be because I have never read the Suicide Squad comics but I freaking love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcomed Addition to the DC Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to find the time to watch "Suicide Squad" last Saturday, and it turns out to be a really good addition to the DC Universe that both DC Comics and Warner Bros. want to show to movie goers."Suicide Squad" is actually a sequel to "Man of Steel" and "Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice". With the apparent death of Superman, Amanda Waller (played by Viola Davis) plots to make use of the services of Gotham City's worst villains, and random criminals, in captivity, in order to fight off potential threats. It did make some of us wonder how dumb she could be not to talk to Batman, as she did in having Will Smith's character, Deadshot, arrested, but it became clearer when the guys were warned that the bombs embedded in their necks would blow their heads off, i.e. if they try and do anything funny.That's fine that villains were made to fight villains here, except that a mortal lady, June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne), had a misfortune of coming in contact with an evil spirit in a cave. Thus, like Steven Spielberg's "Freakazoid", saying a phrase causes her to transform into someone else, the "Enchantress"... not to be confused with Marvel's Enchantress. The Enchantress' an ancient witch turned outcast by ex-worshippers of the past. Still bitter at humanity, even centuries later, this two-face ("two-face" because she was originally helping Waller) and her brother, whose spirit possessed another unfortunate soul, secretly plotted till they were able to create an army to decimate Gotham. The brother even disturbed some movie goers by killing off random people, while fusing with a train he destroyed, in order to transform into a demonic overlord. With all that being said, little did Suicide Squad know was that they were assigned to fight "super villains".At the climax, I liked that the transformed Enchantress gave the members of Suicide Squad visions of those brighter futures that she claimed she could grant, if they help her take over the world, and one of the members, "Diablo", who had a dark past of killing off his wife and kids with arson, dismissed the visions as "aren't real". A bit predictable, but liked how they were used here, the action scenes, or that she tried to stop Deadshot with a vision of his daughter begging him to put his guns away. I recommend you sit through the climax to see how things unfold.I also like that the film was re-shot to be less moody, and funny, giving it its own flavor. With the "Batman Vs. Superman" backlashes, DC and Warner Bros. thought of taking a break from the dark tone. Even on Facebook, we all were worried that the studio didn't know what sort of DC Universe films they wanted to produce to their fans anymore. At the end, at least with the audience I sat with, we laughed every two to ten minutes in certain parts of the movie.When there were serious scenes, like Deadshot losing his daughter, or figuring out why Waller was using them, or even Katana... and WarCraft fans can relate to her and her sword, it did leave a lot of us thinking, since we've grown to liking the characters.Of course, the movie isn't too perfect. The worst part of it has to be Jared Leto's Joker. He's a side character that goes around... with men in costumes... shooting people, hangs around with Harley Quinn, disappears (or apparently dies), then shows up tens of minutes later to repeat the process. This happened two to three times, and he barely stayed long when compared to the movie's length. Thus, while the movie concentrates on the actual members of Suicide Squad, and the villains, it seems that DC Comics and Warner Bros. were warming up the Joker for a future movie, since this movie ended with him breaking Harley out of prison. Overall, it made the flashbacks of the Joker and Harley needless in "Suicide Squad"... well maybe except in explaining Harley's origin.Overall, after months of wondering what sort of movie we'd be getting in August, "Suicide Squad" is a welcomed addition to the DC Universe. After giving credits to the main actors, and actresses, the movie shows an extra scene of Waller talking to Bruce Wayne, apparently knowing that he and Batman are the same person. They were apparently talking about the Joker's prison break, with Wayne advising her to shut down the Suicide Squad, while he prepares his own team to fight crimes. It was the assurance of a Justice League movie we were glad to sit through before the credits rolled, ending the movie perfectly. This is the other DC Universe movie of 2016 I actually recommend watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was dark, gritty, fun, and had wonderful action. The depth of certain characters was presented properly.While they could have shown the Joker more I feel that they did a great job blending the grit and darkness that belongs in this new DCEU.Harley Quinn was perfect. Will Smith was better than I thought he would be.Amanda Waller was on point.If you are a typical fan of the fun-loving Marvel universe then this might not be for you but if you're looking for a grown-up version of a Superhero movie then I highly recommend Suicide Squad.They are doing these DC movies properly and I have a feeling that these "critics" are conspiring with Disney to bring these movies down when the fans love them.I absolutely LOVE the movie. I am not sure what the critics problem was but I thought it was awesome.The only complaint I have is that... I WANT MORE!I absolutely loved Harley Quinn and The Joker. Deadshot was amazing too.I think it was a fun movie and could have been even better in the Rated R version but I was extremely happy by the end of it.</fullReview>

To be honest, I kind of fell in love with Harley Quinn in this movie. And that's interesting because she' crazy. But I don't care I loved her. I think everyone else did a good job too. Especially Will Smith as Deadshot, he really surprised me. Jared Leto as the Joker is not in it as much as I wanted him too but that's fine. Jared Leto plays the Joker kind of like a modern day Cesar Romero but more twisted. Like I said before Margot Robbie was great as Harley and a I hope to see more of these characters in future DC movies. Overall I had a lot of fun with movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cast, but where's this story going????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved everything dealing with the cast, action, production, and the dark humor in this film. I also enjoyed the bantering between the actors throughout the story. But the writing and pacing of this film seems to fall flat very quickly in this film. This is not much of a spoiler, but I feel like just what they did in Batman V. Superman... They're rushing everything to get to the point of the film. Within 30 minutes of the film, everybody was at the end of the film. I wanted to enjoy the ride of getting to know each actor as they transformed into their characters. But sadly I felt that they rushed into completing the film. I can see 2 more films of Suicide Squad if done right and not make the same mistakes as they're doing right now. Marvel movies speaks to my nerdy soul when it comes to pacing the film and also having more solo movies that leads up to the main attraction (i.e. Avengers, Civil War, etc.). I think that DC needs to do more solo movies instead of cramming everybody that's new to the audience (whether they know or not know the origin of the character). But that was the only thing that I found wrong with this film. Which was the pace of the beginning, middle and end. But of course not every movie will be perfect. So an 8 out of 10 seems fit for the rating I think most people can agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters in this movie have so much potential but unfortunately the film has probably killed them all. And the cast was pretty good on the whole and more than capable of making a good film, but someone messed it up.I'll deal with it in bullet points.It wasn't funny. The timing was off, and with Harley, croc and the joker as excellent comedic sources. Their lines were either not funny, badly delivered/undecipherable or simply hidden/ruined by poor editing and direction. Even a good line (not many here) needs timing and directorial confidence. The soundtrack was lazy and unoriginal.The script was poor, and at times the actors saying the lines appeared tonally embarrassed. Especially Kinnaman.The joker was underused and although well portrayed by leto, his lines were not great.The squad was meant to have become like a family willing to die for each other, but for no real reason.Nothing against Cara, but I could think of many other actresses that would have suited the role better.The film looked like it was desperate to be R/18 rated but was cut to be seen by younger audiences. This was a shame as it may have worked a lot better by being darker and more graphic, after all we are dealing with some seriously disturbed characters.It came across like lots of scenes had been left out. Leaving some character choices and lines looking a little out of place.Most of the film's failings have already been done properly (see Guardians of the Galaxy)shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have known suicide squad long before the big screen debut news was out.I really appreciate director David Ayer for preserving the core values of suicide squad while giving it a personnel touch. This movie very well serve as a continuum to upcoming dc movies. Talking about the story it's pretty formulaic it's good versus bad, but what makes it different is here good ones are actually the bad guys. High octane action sequence, along with power packed performance from a magnificent cast sets this movie apart from other super hero movies.When someone like Ayer is behind the camera, and a team lead by Will Smith,Margot,Viola alongside Jared Leto as clown prince himself.Its a great moment to watch them on screen. Special mention to members of the squad Joel,Cara,Adewale,Jai,Jay,Adam,and Karen(big screen debut)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is visually stunning with some great performances. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are fantastic as Deadshot and Harley Quinn and are the two characters that are paid the most attention, and whose backstories we see the most of. However, that doesn't mean the rest of the cast aren't as interesting and fun to watch. Jai Courtney did a nice job as Captain Boomerang and was actually pretty entertaining. Cara Delevigne is good as Enchantress, though she wasn't a stand-out like Robbie, and Jay Hernandez did a great job as El Diablo; he brought an unexpected heart to the team. Jared Leto's Joker was a wild card, and not as prominent as fans were expecting. However, his joker was a lot of fun. He admirably portrayed the Joker's complete psychosis and brought a colourful Mob Boss aesthetic, in contrast to Ledger and Nicholson's portrayals. Some people won't be a fan of Leto's Joker, but I found him engaging and want to see more of him. The film is very action heavy which, while entertaining and beautifully shot, was to the detriment of the plot and pacing of the rest of the movie. Background information had to be revealed to the audience through characters telling other characters, rather than have it play out visually and naturally, and there were flash-backs spread liberally throughout the film because there wasn't enough time evolve the events linearly. The flashbacks weren't uninteresting to watch, but there were so many of them that they did make the film feel disjointed and a little patch-work.Overall, I give Suicide Squad 7/10. It's a wonderfully shot movie; great action, entertaining, with witty and engaging characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Listen to the Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to believe that the critics and I watched the same movie. This is easily the best DC movie since TDK. Everybody is saying that the villain is terrible and Cara Delevingne is a terrible actress which I do not understand at all. She had barely any lines in the movie and was perfectly fine considering the material she was working with. Her performance was nothing amazing but I do not know how critics can sit there and say she was terrible. Everybody makes that same argument about the villain yet in every marvel movie ever (excluding The Avengers) the villain has been 100 times worse. I enjoyed Enchantress for what she was. Jared Leto's performance as The Joker was very refreshing and different. With only about 15 minutes of screen time I still believe that this Joker is the most true to the comics incarnation yet (aside from the way he looks). I enjoyed the fact that he was this big mob boss with businesses etc. Of course there are always going to be the unfair comparisons to Heath Ledger's performance which is obviously very hard to top. I can't say Jared Leto had a better performance because he wasn't in the movie nearly long enough to judge. However, I can say that I enjoyed this version of The Joker far more than Heath Ledger's.In my opinion the characters that steal the show are Deadshot played by Will Smith, Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie and Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis. I even enjoyed Diablo played by Jay Hernandez. Will Smith is extremely charismatic as always and actually makes you feel for him which is strange because he is a villain. Margot Robbie is the definitive live action Harley Quinn; after seeing her performance I cannot see anyone playing the role better. She is straight out of the comics. Viola Davis is one scary woman as Amanda Waller. I would not want to mess with her. I would be more scared of Amanda Waller than I would be scared of Enchantress. In my opinion, she is the main villain of the movie, and her performance is near perfection.As always, do not rely on the critics' opinions when going into a movie. Everyone has their own opinions and it is up to you to form your own. Remember, these are the same critics that said American Hustle was better then The Wolf of Wall Street. The same critics that gave an aggregate score of 73% to the absolutely horrendous Ghostbusters(2016). Please do not listen to the critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all the bad reviews about suicide squad i was starting to think that it was not all that it was made out to be, but after then watching the movie i do not understand what would make people say those things about the movie. To start of i should say that i think everyone should go and the see this movie as soon as possible. If you have not heard of suicide squad before it about a group of Gotham's worst villains who are taken out of the prison they are currently in to get a second chance to help man- kind by using their mega- human powers for good. By becoming a team (suicide squad as they call it.) they can fight off more powerful villains like superman if he had decided to be evil but as they find out the government wants no part in it and if anything goes wrong they are ready to throw the team under the bus if it means no bad press.Reasons i think everyone should see it: Where do i start there are so many good thing about this movie like for starters Harley Quinn is finally in a movie. Harley Quinn is played my margot Robbie who did an amazing job with this part she absolutely killed the role her acting was great and i don't think they could of ever got someone better to play Harley Quinn. will smith did a great job with deadshot as well but i wouldn't say it was all that different to the other roles will smith has played over the years, still good but pretty basic. I think the actor who really stole the spotlight was Jared leto (the joker), i am not usually a Jared leto fan but in this case i am. Ever since i heard who was playing the joker i have been wanting to see his performance he has big shoes to fill after heath ledger in the dark knight and jack Nicholson in batman but Jared leto did not disappoint his performance was spectacular the best joker yet in my opinion the only downside was he wasn't in the movie enough for my liking. The costumes where another thing i loved Harley Quinn's costume was a change from the comic book costume but still good, the costume really showed her personality and looked like how i imaged it would feel to be Harley with the bright eyeshadow and the smudged make up, and who can forget the jacket that reads 'property of the joker' what i thought really topped it all of was the baseball bat, still staying true to the original character by giving her an unusual weapon instead of just giving her a gun or something normal. The joker's costume was something else completely, still with the green hair and purple jacket but this time with a twist, the joker had tattoos all over his body of faces and smiles and things that you would guess the joker would have, his costumes was great too this time looking more like a gangster then a clown. Over all i think the movie was amazing i give 10/10 and if a second movie comes out i will be the first in line for tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the DC Comics antihero team of the same name, 'Suicide Squad' comes with BIG hype &amp; expectations, but sadly, this superhero flick lacks the bite. No, its not as lifeless as Batman v Superman, its much better than that, but overall, the zing &amp; the madness are missing here. It has merit, but not enough to camouflage its flaws.'Suicide Squad' Synopsis: A secret government agency recruits a group of imprisoned super-villains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency, which inevitably leads to chaos.'Suicide Squad' begins awesomely &amp; the antiheroes are introduced with style &amp; flair. But as soon as antiheroes step out into the city to stop havoc, the film just falls flat. Thats mainly because the film doesn't do much with its characters. The supposed "Worst Heroes EVER" (as promoted in its posters), are reduced into normal heroic tools, who indulge in ultraviolet confrontations with the opposing rival. Oh and coming to their rivals, The Enchantress, is a weak antagonist, who doesn't emerge powerful or intimidating enough. Also, why is the Legendary Joker reduced into a cameo? The Joker isn't a part of the 'Suicide Squad', in fact, he appears as a minor sub-plot for Harley Quinn, whom he's out to save amongst the violent state.David Ayer's Writing &amp; Direction weaken 'Suicide Squad'. Though Ayer succeeds in making the film look comic-bookish &amp; begins the film with on a really strong note, his Writing stagnates after a point. As mentioned before, the characters remain underused &amp; there is a sense of potential being shun away. Ayer's Writing needed to be far stronger. His Direction, on the other-hand, is fine at places, but isn't consistent, as the pacing shifts as does the narrative. Roman Vasyanov's Cinematography is decent. John Gilroy's Editing is alright. Graphics are fantastic &amp; so are the Action-Sequences. Steven Price's Score is excellent. Art &amp; Costume Design are top-notch. Make-Up deserves a special mention.Performance-Wise: 'Suicide Squad' has a huge ensemble cast, but its Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn, who steals the show completely. Robbie is absolutely sensational as the whacked-out yet sexy &amp; unpredictable Harley Quinn, who's romance for The Joker appears real. The terrific actress owns the screen, each time she appears on. Following her up in a surprisingly short &amp; under-written role, Jared Leto puts up an impressive portrayal of The Joker. Comparing him to the Mighty Jack Nicholson or the Late/Great Heath Ledger, wouldn't be fair, as he's barely given much time here &amp; he's not giving the same personality, this is a very gangster version of The Joker. But, overall, he can surely be looked forward too in another, bigger role of the legendary villain. Will Smith as Floyd Lawton / Deadshot, plays it right, &amp; its good to see him loosen up a little. Jai Courtney as Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang, gets limited scope, but he does well. Jay Hernandez as Chato Santana / El Diablo is barely there, while Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Waylon Jones / Killer Croc, who's completely under make-up and graphics, is wasted. Cara Delevingne as Dr. June Moone / Enchantress, doesn't work. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, is alright. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, is authoritative, as always. Ben Affleck returns as Batman for a cameo &amp; he looks the part even more now. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Suicide Squad' disappoints, despite a few pluses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a superhero movie based on the DC Comics antihero team written and directed by David Ayer. According to Director David Ayer "Bad vs Evil" is the theme of the movie. It's a dark and gritty movie followed by lot of humor.The plot of the movie is quite simple but there is lot of humor in the movie . The time line of the story is after the death of superman Death in Batman v Superman . In the comics The Suicide Squad, officially designated as Task Force X, a secret team of super villains who have been imprisoned by the United States government. The movie's source material is same as comic book . Just like the comic books, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller assembles a team of dangerous criminals and antiheroes in the movie and places them under the command of colonel Rick Flag played by Joel Kinnaman . The antihero hero consists of Harley Quinn aka Joker's girlfriend played by Margot Robbie , hit-man Deadshot played by Will Smith who never misses a shot , El Diablo played by Jay Hernandez, Captain Boomerang played by Jai Courtney, cannibal Killer Croc played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Slipknot played by Malcolm McDowell . And later they are joined by Katana as a Flag's bodyguard at the time of departure for a mission . Amanda Waller also recruits Flag's girlfriend , Dr. June Moon played by Cara Delevigne . Dr. Moon is an archaeologist who is possessed by a witch-goddess known as "Enchantress" . Besides that Suicide squad has our beloved "Joker" in it . He appears later in the movie and in few flash back scenes . Speaking of 'flash' backs there are cameos of two members of justice league too . There are flash backs of every character's origins and past life too like Harley Quinn's origin which is brilliantly introduced on screen There are lot of jaw dropping , little bit of nail biting moments in the movie too like the Deadshot's audition , high wire act by Harley Quinn , lot of Joker's moments , El Diablo's final act . The first two act of the movie are quite entertaining but the final act didn't impress me much . One of the reason is villain was little lame and story was simple . In the first act i really liked the way Amanda Waller gathers the team members . The pace of the movie little fast but it was tolerable . Although I feel like few characters in the movie were pointless . They were just there because of source material and DC fans . I personally enjoyed the movie . I really respect the bold creative choices that Director David Ayer made for the movie . But it really disappointed me that they cut so much stuff from the movie . They showed us lot of other scenes in the trailers but it wasn't in the movie particularly the Joker's scene . Joker was in the movie for only 10 minutes which was little sad for MR. J's fan like me. I have heard that movie went under re-shoots too and there is an alternate version of movie with an alternate ending .I think Director David Ayer had some pretty good ideas but the execution wasn't that good . the story maybe quite simple but I feel like it's worth watching .The movie is worth your cost for ticket with some popcorn. I think it's a good start for DCEU (DC Extended Universe ) knowing the fact that there are studios like Marvel in competition .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad. Just BAD.(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was extremely disappointing. Overall, the pacing, plot, and characters were mostly just horrible. 1) Leto's Joker was obnoxious as hell and served no purpose apart from backstory for Harley. 2) Slipknot, Captain Boomerang, and Katana had zero reason to be there and added zero to the movie. 3) Enchantress was a HORRIBLE choice for villain. I'm supposed to believe that two beings that are damn near demi-gods are going to be beat by two guys with guns, a gal with a bat, two folks with knives, a strongman, and an unwilling to fight walking inferno that doesn't want to fight? Diablo was the ONLY one remotely near their power level and even he showed that he was beaten by just one of them. 4) Related to #3, why the hell would Enchantress, who can pretty much wreck anything on the planet with her machine/spell, not just fry them like chickens as soon as they said no, they wouldn't join? 5) For that matter, why the hell would she decide "Oh, let me give them a chance and just fight with some blades." 6) If Enchantress could teleport, as they showed her teleport across the world and back in a second, why couldn't she teleport and grab the case/her heart from Waller once Waller had opened it to stab at her? Or just take it while she slept? Even with a motion detector, she grabs it, teleports, motion detector shouldn't set off. 7) If Incubus pretty much took out everything the military threw at him, why would a simple bomb (one that barely blew up about a 10 foot radius) take him down, even if weakened from Diablo? 8) After seeing her brother fall, why would Enchantress even bother not to just off the Squad if she is so angered by humans? The only metahuman among them had just died, so why bother? She doesn't need them apart from just making her army even stronger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fun movie and in my book that counts as good. Yes, the pacing was a little strange, but that didn't bother me and it shouldn't have bothered you either. I feel like people just love to hate on DC? Like you guys act as if this was the worst movie ever, and you KNOW it wasn't. CGI was great, acting was superb, and I was able to keep up with the story line just fine. Are you Marvel fanboys so mad that none of your movies will ever surpass the greatness of The Dark Knight that you have to hate on every new DC film? If you are thinking of watching this movie, you definitely should. It was an awesome ride the whole time, and I fell in love with all of the characters, ESPECIALLY The Joker, Harley, and Rick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really had a great time with this movie! It may not have been absolutely perfect, but I thought it was a really good time. Besides, I don't need a perfect movie, I just wanted a fun time and I found one. The cast was great, I thought they had a very natural chemistry with one another and I totally bought it. I know that people have a huge issue with the third act and I understand it, but there was something about them all fighting together that really sold me as well, I really loved all of the action in the movie. It felt like as close to a cohesive unit as possible within the context of the movie. It was a really good ensemble movie with good action, I laughed quite a bit, and am looking forward to seeing the movie again.Also, personally as someone who really loves Harley Quinn I am beyond happy that her live action debut was as pitch perfect as this was. Margot Robbie was incredible, as was Will Smith and Viola Davis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Goals Reached!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well for starter this is my first review. I will keep it short but still as good as i can.For starter (technical): The movie has his good and bad moment. Its true the pacing in the first part is bam bam bam bam, and the second is more good. But to give credit its a movie about bad guys and nutheads so the pacing kinda clicks with that. THere are some very beautiful technical shots.The actors all did a good job, yes you can see the cast just loved to make this movie in particular Margot Robbie, its like she just had the time of her life. Will Smith is a good cast for deadshot has his hard (badass) edge and his soft core. THen you have Jared Leto. Well to say he nailed it right on the head. He's creepy and mentally in a good state of mind to play this character. He makes me think about the animated series. Compared to Heath (wich doesn't really make a case) in my opinion they are equal but different. I think Leto struck gold and in my opinion needs more screen time in Batman flicks or maybe a Solo movie (killing joke esq) Diablo and boomerang just nailed everything on there part. FOr the Plot and villain. There are some holes in the story where i didn't really know why it happened. That asside it clings together.TO conclude: The critics made some arguments that aren't to be discussed with. But To say its a bad movie and another fail for DCEU -&gt; ITS not i think this is a very good step forward for the whole DCEU. Comparrason with BvS: Its lighter, funnier but in a way still dark and thats what makes DCEU apart from Marvel. The darker theemed movies and somethimes more reality.I hope this review helps you in a way to choose to view this flick. I'm in love and cant wait till Ayer releases a Directors Cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The name of the movie gives it away, SUICIDE! If you lack the courage to commit suicide, don't hesitate to buy a ticket to this film. Should get the job done after the first 40 mins (which is how long it took to introduce the characters). Thank Christ Tom Hardy opted out of this for I?árritu. Shame about the $10 I will never get back.Also a shame about the 120 mins of my life I will never get back.Quite appalled that they thought they can pull off a Queen song in this garbage. The 1 star in my review goes to the sound department who clearly have a good taste in music but an atrocious taste in jobs. Margot Robbie is also good to look at.All in all, absolute dog s*it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't get over how awful this movie was and it's been 12 hours. I still have that tinge of leaving the theater after watching a terrible movie feeling. That feeling that you just blew three hours of your life. I wanted so bad to like it, but I can only say I liked Will Smith in it. Other than that, it was easily the worst movie I have seen in the past six months. The worst parts of this movie include the acting from various characters, writing, plot and lack of character development, which is understandably difficult in a film that incorporates this many characters. I am not sure if it was Margot Robbie or the writing, but Harley Quinn was cringe worthy for me. Do not see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go see this movie. It plays like a DC comic strip. Brief backgrounds of characters, excellent action scene's and Margo's Harley Quinn was perfect and funny. Some of the poor reviews show how many 'critics' have no true understanding of genre movies.I am 50 years old and have been going to the cinema/theater since i was 11 years old. I have over 300 movies in my personal collection. It is a movie for DC comic fans and I can see what the director did here, general movie goers because of general movie formats probably wont like it. Im glad the movie played to 'die hard'comic fans because movies that try to do both, fail miserably. If the movie is so bad, how is it making good money at the box office?I am not easily convinced or entertained with movies and I have walked out of some, the 1999 Inspector Gadget movie for instance. I give this movie an 8/10, would have been a 9, only because it could have had another 30mins of possible background or plot development and more 'Joker' time. I am going to see it a second time in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot didn't have any buildup or development. I mean really, it was 2 hours of random nothing. The characters didn't have enough coverage of their actual back stories. It didn't seem like it was directed by someone who understood them and looked into the comics. Will Smith was given the typical funny kind of role which was disappointing. I wanted to take him a little more seriously. That also goes for the film in general, I wanted to take it more seriously. But with all the cheesy jokes I couldn't. The amount of times I scoffed every time the crocodile opened his mouth. Why was he given any lines? BET? Really? It had to be a black guy playing him. I wondered why they wasted Jared Leto's time. They didn't showcase his adaptation of the joker enough, he was just a part of Harley's backstory. Margot's acting was great as expected but Harley was completely objectified. We all know Harley had some sex appeal. We all can see Margot is very attractive. Scenes of her dancing on poles, licking the jail bar, and guys ogling at her was total overkill to me. We should've seen the real crazy that Harley is. Was there anything else they could've aided off of her character other than a few funny lines, her looks, and some voices in her head? Come on. We should've seen the twisted relationship between her and the Joker not some romanticized fairy tale version. The Joker kissing? LOL. And texting? Omg! Some characters did absolutely nothing for the plot. Cara's acting is bad and the hip twisting didn't save her. My conclusion is that this film was a underdeveloped and cliché mess. Only teeny boppers would find that kind of humor funny. Only simple minded people would thoroughly enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually almost loved it. I am in the squad :3 Joke's on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEWARE! I will write a huge spoiler below all...I have seen a lot of reviews for this movie and a lot are destroying it. I actually almost loved it...It has flaws, of course. But sure is better than Superman: Man of Steel (not kidding I hated that movie), and let me tell you that better than Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (but this one I liked it, and loved Affleck as Batman, and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman).There is not much time and poor development of the characters except for the main, that are obviously Deadshot and Harley.I am so in love with Harley since her first apparition on the animated series, I just felt so happy for a character like her. Don't misunderstand me, I loved her because she is so damaged that is brilliant. And must say that Margot Robbie was awesome in character, so much her... so much in love of Mr. J.Cara Delevigne surprised me, not a fan of her and I thought she wouldn't convince me but she did. Anyways, Enchantress was not that awesome as I expected, but was OK, and Cara did her best on it.I almost didn't recognize Jai Courtney! He was not the cute baby face dude I am used to see in him. Damn good and really misused. It could have been more, really.And "Diablo" character was underdeveloped, his backstory was kind of hurtful, at least for him (and me). Other thing underused that could bring more. He was the hurted soul that took the lives of those whom where his life, just for being pride of his power... He is not anymoreAnd Katana, the actress Karen Fukuhara is fantastic and fit the role perfectly, is a shame that poor she have in the movie. That was a backstory to develop, and a sadness that could give a great story.The biggest flaw was the use of Joker. Jared Leto was amazing! So disturbing and clownish. I don't know, I just loved him as Mr. J! but it was so little we have from him, and not initially intended to. I mean, I was expecting the mastermind that I love in that damaged and creepy character, some "manipulating things behind scenes" you know? I needed more of Joker, and with more "coherence" if my words are understood.But for all, the scene in the bar was my favorite in the trailer, it is a shame that was cut in the theatrical release.The action was pretty good, the story have his stupid things (lik, how the hell Wellar thought she could control Enchantress? even I saw that coming... that's was really stupid), and some clichés, but overall was great and from now on one of my Not heroes favorite movie (being Deadpool my true love).I would love a Uncut, or Director's Cut, or Extended version of this movie, with more scenes and a little backstory for the entire group and not only Harley and Deadshot. I absolutely need a sequel!And so sorry Slipknot died so early! That wasn't fair! I was so surprised, not good to mess with Flagg (no Stephen King pun intended)The Worst: Not enough backstory for the other in the group, a story line for fighting the enemy a little slow. The Best: action was great, SFX were awesome, Harley was amazing, and Joker was stealing camera when he appeared, and Deadshot was pretty cool.9/10 for me.Watch at your own risk, if you do: Welcome to the Squad</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last time a woman wowed me with her bravado was Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver in Kill Bill. Since then no one's even come close until Robbie who is spectacular as the crazed Harley Quinn. Though she's hardly a heroine here, I'd love to see her star in a spin off. Somehow her role gives me inexplicable joy and I was smiling thinking about her a long time after the film was over. What a pleasure! Restores my faith in women! Robbie is wild, gutsy, playful and unforgettable. And pretty much both quirky and gorgeous.Of the rest of the crew I enjoyed the Australian, played by James McGowan, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag the most. The story is about their origin as a team. And considering how difficult it must be to bring a comic book to life, I can't help admiring this mostly successful effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what's wrong with the critics nowadays, are they so jumpy on the Marvel Hype Train that they must hate every single type of competition, or any other reason, all I can say is that movie extremely pushes the DC Cinematic Universe into the fray alongside Marvel and that the movie is a Cinematographic marvel and that the casting is perfect.Margot Robbie is the best choice in the world for the psychotic Harley Quinn, alongside Jared Leto as her counterpart love they are an amazing couple, with the scenes of them together in their classic clothes, are just awesome. Jared Leto could have had more screen time in the movie as he feels unused and underrated. Will Smith also shines as Deadshot and I see no better choice for that role cast. The other characters while also underused are a very good addition to the squad, with El Diablo being my personal favorite.The comedy in the movie is spot on, no "cheesyness" like others would have you believe, and the whole theater hall laughed out loud a couple of times. In conclusion, the movie is an amazing adaptation for the Suicide Squad comics and we can only hope for a sequel. Never listen to the cancer sites like Rotten Tomatoes, and if you really have to, read the audience reviews rather than the critics, because all they really do is, criticize.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do people keep on insisting this movie is bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved it! I don't understand all this complaining from the bad reviews. I was so ashamed going into this opening night with fear of it just being absolute garbage, but I had a blast watching this movie. Now don't get me wrong, there are definitely issues I get what people are saying. The editing seems choppy at times and it's evident a lot was left out, in particular scenes with Jared Leto's Joker. I just read in an interview with him that they cut so much out you could've made a whole movie alone about him. I'm saving the judgement on Joker until we see more of him in another movie, you should too! The other thing I disliked was it all seemed too fast once the action started rolling, there was never really a time to breathe at least until the bar scene which was one of the most excellent scenes in the entire film. People have a problem with how the music fits into the movie and that it acts like a cheap knock off of the formula used in Guardians of the Galaxy. I loved the music, I thought the random songs were a good fit for the chaotic tone of the story, these are damaged people being thrown into a chaotic war zone, and I personally feel that music choice fit the maddening pace of the movie. The clear standouts from the cast are Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn who just totally remind me of the animated series I would always watch as a kid. Anyone saying Robbie is not a good fit for Harley Quinn should ask Paul Dini who I think has a more credible opinion considering he helped create the character. Everyone else was in it very little but I still enjoyed their performances as well. Rick Flagg was fine for the leader position and he didn't bother me as much as he did in the Robocop remake. Viola Davis played a good Amanda Waller but I wonder if they maybe took the character a little too far. She's a nasty lady in DC history and Davis played her well but maybe a little too well, one scene in particular made me question if it was out of character for the decision she made. I thought Kitanna was really interesting but I definitely wanna see more of her in a sequel because she wasn't in here very much either. I hate Jai Courtney and I don't understand why he's still working in Hollywood but shockingly, he blew me away in this movie as Captain Boomerang, funny and just a really fun character he completely surprised me. Jay Hernadez brings some heart to the role of El Diablo and I really enjoyed his character in the second half. David Ayer has some background in past movies bringing some relatable traits to a character we would classify as a gangbanger, and Hernandez does such a good job bringing a tragic back story we can feel emotion for. If you're a fan of Slipknot you'll sadly not get much out of him as he's just a plot device in the movie. Killer Croc was fine for a supporting role but I still think King Shark would've been more intimidating to use. Enchantress was awesome, I hope this isn't the last we see of her, Cara is just stunning and the character felt like a big threat the team really had to overcome. The team together was almost perfect to me, I really saw the humanity in these characters who are just bitter and angry with the world that outcasted them, and yet by the end they all had the courage to help Rick Flagg save the world. I can't believe I'm saying this but these bad guys acted more heroic than Batman and Superman have in the last two movies! I felt for Deadshot and they pulled off his personal life very well. I could hear someone in my theater yelling at the screen in a particular scene when he's being prevented from accomplishing the mission because of a personal memory of his. I laughed at the jokes and I just had a giant smile on my face in a lot of scenes and at some of the great cameos that I believe were handled soooooo much better than the ones in Dawn of Justice. It seems like there's a lesson to be learned here at WB and DC to not interfere with the director's vision and let them make the film their way(and I'm looking at you Wonder Woman). However I realized if this is the rushed version the studio cooked up out of paranoia, then David Ayer's cut has gotta be really good because this was still good. This version that's supposedly not as good as Ayer's was still better than Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I'm telling you guys this was the best thing they've put out in this universe so far, and I think the only reason critics are giving it a hard time is because the movie relies on fans having knowledge of some of these characters. So what if Killer Croc didn't have depth to him he served as a supporting character, and he was fine. The movie was suppose to be a simple DC passion project and because of the failures of Batman v Superman people expected this to be the better movie, it could never have lived up to the hype people created and I'm deeply saddened by all the hate it's received. I'm being honest here, I want more DCEU movies like this, not like Batman v Superman. It's not as bad as you've heard, but for some it may not be as good as you hoped. I for one though will be seeing it again and hope Ayer can give us another cut when the Blu Ray comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a messy attempt to cash in on the edgy humor that made Deadpool so popular. Unlike Deadpool, however, this movie has a difficult to discern plot and 9/10 jokes flop. A big chunk of the movie's philosophy is what edgy weeaboos use to justify their pointless obsession with hating on people who they perceive as "normal". But what really bothers me about this movie is its portrayal of women. Harley Quinn is ~madly in love~ with the Joker, rather than being a victim of manipulation and abuse. June Moon has her autonomy taken away from her almost immediately, Katana hardly talks, and Amanda Walker has no redeeming qualities. One of the weirdest parts of the movie to me is when Amanda Walker walks into Harley Quinn's cell, and Harley, who apparently doesn't know her or anything about her, immediately asks if she's the devil. Harley Quinn sees a black woman who she knows nothing about, and the first thing out of her mouth is "Are you the Devil?". And in the movie, that's okay. The movie doesn't do anything to address how the Joker abuses Harley. Everyone is just okay with it. Harley's deeper character is taken for granted and she's just turned into this man- candy with excessive booty shots every two minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>no point in describing this movie. you just have to make up your own mind about it. some parts are better than awesome and some are meh...lets start with origins: really poor! i think the original cuts were better and the reediting turned it into a joke(pun intended). batman appearance in Deadshots origins is acceptable, except the guy who lost his parents in the dark alley wouldn't haunt anyone with the kid in that type of dark alley. next Harley's introduction was way too simplified. the real gem here was the acid jump scene that was done better than any flashback i have seen before. just awesome.next the joker! i feel like the laugh was just not good! the only moments this guy looked like a real character was when he had a serious face! just watch him when he says careful! and you'll know what i mean! Jarred did great job, but they didn't let him shine the way he could, given more screen time and better lines.now as for Deadshot: every scene where he is shooting are awesome, but when he shoots on top of the car, i was taken by surprise. it was cooler, than i expected.music through the movie is a bit too much! i get it it's supposed to b fun, but know your limits! it's not a music video! it's a movie! but i'm saying this only about the songs, used! and their over usage in the beginning of the movie! but the Ost-s were awesome. particularly the one during the squad walk and the Diablo outrage! just epic! speaking of it, i felt like every scene after the bar drinking scene was from the directors cut, cause it was much better, than the rest! just pure cinematic ecstasy! overall: next time Warner Bros. let the directors do the editing! stop messing with their work! you messed up one movie this year already - BvS, was it necessary to mess up the other? cause you managed to mess it up badly! i hope you'll have courage to release director's cut later, cause this story deserves it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First they drive you mad, and then they drag you to war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a DC fan since the 90s, read thousands of issues, including every Squid Squad comics EVER. It' s my favorite US team comic of all time and the DCEU now produced the 3rd source accurate, yet critically despised film in a row. John Ostrander, the creator of the Squad (look him up!), "loved" this movie, yet it is being ripped apart for every sin under the sun. Including being an insult to the comic? I was deathly afraid that the same insanity would tank BvS (read my 9,5/10 review for the UC) but it didn't. I am now happy that the critics hated this movie as I can't see myself liking a DCEU film they would. I am also a big Marvel film + comic fan, but why do they get universal acclaim for producing inferior movies that radically change the source material? NO comment, to the review:The narrative has a 2 act structure. The 1st half is an over the top black comedy with constantly changing "theme songs" to give quick characterization in a crowded cast. Guardians of the Galaxy had pop songs too, but so did Watchmen and the Crow. Stop the rip-off comments, and i liked all 3. The editing is universally criticized and was so fast that even i needed 5 minutes to adjust, and then it HIT me. The director tried to drive me mad, to get inside the character's heads, who are mostly mentally unstable convicts. Genius! All but Flag, Katana and Waller (debatable) are villains, yet the film is being ripped apart for having "bad role" models and violence. The film logo has bullet holes, and features the Joker! WTF? The films isn't exactly a feelgood movie either, never blindly compare it to Guardians again. Deadpool is the only US comic movie with similar ideas. Than hell on Earth, literally, breaks loose, and the mission starts. The 2nd half is a borderline bleak war movie, with the Squad and a Special Forces unit cleaning streets and rooms for about 1 hour. A few, universally spectacular flashbacks still occur, a few songs, outside of the well done score, still play but things get dark. That drove critics mad. A war movie about unwilling convicts being dark is a plus! A lot of action in an action film is good! A light in the sky, faceless hordes of enemies and an end-of-the-world plot show up. Just as in the hit comics or Raiders of the Lost Ark. Were these by Marvel too? That's the story. Simple and clean, yet twisted as a pretzel, including a few JLA cameos. Now, the very diverse Squad in alphabetical order:Amanda Waller: Davis nails it, and she ends up being the worst human in the movie, outside of the Joker. The body count on her head makes her the deadliest DCEU (anti-)villain to date. Let's see if she can redeem herself later. Captain Boomerang: Courtney again reminds us that he can act, if the script is good. He even comes back like a? + 1 for the safety Unicorn. Deadshot: The 70s version is played well by Smith and his well-used daughter has a comic counterpart. You can see how happy The Fresh Prince of Belle Reve is to be in a good movie, for once! El Diablo: Hernandez made a mostly unknown villain a highlight, as such characters are Ayer's forte. The way he was forced to "power down" is fascinating and very daring for a (hard) PG-13 movie. Enchantress: Delevingne's ability to go from creepy to deliberately campy inside the same scene is impressive. Certainly the best version of her, critics can suck it. Another great DC big-bad and her romance with Flag had heart, hehe. Who further cares that her "brother", who serves as muscle in cool action scenes, is left unexplored. He is an enforcer, based on a 2 issue villain. How can this be a MAIN criticism? Good on WB for daring a witchcraft-based villain, despite knowing that it would get the film banned in China! Harley Quinn: Robbie played the New52 version, who is a child-killer, so let's stop the role model criticism, and her creator liked her. This version also said that another character needed to "own" being a child-killer here. The Joker (Azzarello's grounded mobster + Morrison's Thin White Duke), also showed genuine love for "his creation", so this movie nailed their dynamic. Especially during her chemical transformation. The movie's best moment and a highlight for the genre. Joker: Leto was the best part of the movie but I am glad that his constant presence was trimmed down by the constantly misreported (surprise?) re-edits. Longer scenes with him would have derailed the picture BEYOND recognition and only 1 whole scene (a short 3rd act gunfight) appears to be left out. He is also the most comic accurate movie version to date and our second perfect interpretation in a row. Katana: Fukuhara did well for a debut perforce and I hope that her backstory will be further explored later. The cracks in the dog on a leach persona were already telling. + 1 for Japanese dialogue with subtitles. Killer Croc: Akinnuoye-Agbaje's inhuman make-up deserves an Oscar, and he is based on the Azzarello version. These movies aren't afraid to dive deep! Rick Flag: Kinnaman played the no-nonsense soldier with conviction well and hints of inner darkness were a pleasant surprise. His repertoires with Deadshot were spot on. A straight man and shooter. Slipknot: Beach did the one thing the character was supposed to do right, 'nuff said.The action-driven black comedy will ultimately please fans of the DCEU and haters will continue to be baffled by their popularity. David Ayer ain't a perfect, yet innovative, director and delivered his best movie, together with End of Watch. He now earned a life-long fan with me. The DCEU's future never looked brighter and don't forget to read this month's Suicide Squad Rebirth. 8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Negativity is over-thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch this film in the cinema yesterday (07/08/16) and went with high expectations of the movie as the trailers were so good, however before hand i had read some reviews on here and that knocked my confidence in the movie. i went to watch it, and i cant deny that it is an absolutely brilliant film, and reviews should not put you off to go and see it.The plot was different to what the comics were, and the story line was very choppy, however the film was filled with brilliant actors who knew how to make an enjoyable and action-packed film. performance wise, i thoroughly enjoyed Jared Leto as the joker, he did a great, chilling performance as the joker and pulled it off really well (despite having about 5 minutes total screen time) Other brilliant performances were among Cara Delevingne, Margot Robbie, and Will Smith. Katana;s performance was quite poor as she was the only non-English speaking character, however that didn't change my thoughts on the movie.I think the soundtrack was very well thought out and Bohemian Rhapsody, Heathens and Sucker for pain fit the movie very well.I really would go see this movie again tomorrow if i could, i don't know why there is such negativity about it, as i really enjoyed it and can't wait for it to be available for DVD.Don't be put off if you would like to go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pro: The actors were OK.Cons: -The story is not so good, -The characters are poor defined - The hole thing is not linear. -The director just did not knew how to tie all the things together. -The enemy soldiers are so badly created.After Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was flushed down the toilet by film critics everywhere; this massive burden was suddenly shifted onto director David Ayer's (End of Watch, Fury) Suicide Squad. Ayer's dark vision for the DC Comics adaptation was altered into this lighthearted romp filled with "humorous" one-liners and a soundtrack filled with nothing but mainstream musical artists. With Wonder Woman and Justice League set for next year, Warner Bros. and DC panicked in an effort to make Suicide Squad a safe bet for a crowd pleasing action film. The end product is yet another disjointed mess from DC that disappoints on nearly every level. Forming together during the aftermath of Superman dying at the hands of Doomsday in Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad has a secret government agency run by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembling a team of criminals and super villains and forcing them to work for the government rather than simply living out the remainder of their sentences in their jail cells. Lead by Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team consists of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Also a part of the team is the unpredictable witch Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and Flag's soul-stealing and sword wielding bodyguard Katana (Karen Fukuhara).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun factor trumps its few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun-filled, action-packed movie with all sorts of eccentric weirdo characters and story elements and outrageously exaggerated over-the-top performances. My theater audience was laughing the whole time. I was laughing. We had a great time. We loved it and so will you, unless you're a curmudgeon.Plot/storytelling: On a surface-level, this may seem like a typical simplistic super-hero movie story - big threat arises, our "heroes" must work together to stop it. But to look at it that way may be missing the point. This is a movie where what's technically the main plot of the movie is less important than the individual stories of the characters themselves, and their backstories, motivations, interactions, etc. It felt like at least as much, if not more, of the movie was devoted to their backstories as on what they're currently doing in the movie, which felt almost less important. It's an interesting approach to storytelling. I liked it.Action: Pretty good overall, except for some flaws. This is not Zack Snyder-style meticulously choreographed smooth artistic action, but instead, a lot more chaotic, standard Hollywood-style action quick- cuts, especially towards the end, when it may have gotten a bit all over the place. Here's where I'd normally knock a star or two from my rating, if the overall fun didn't boost my rating back up. In general, the action/fights in Suicide Squad don't reach the superb quality we saw in Man of Steel &amp; Batman v Superman, but at least this movie doesn't do the annoying shaky-cam thing, a la Batman Begins, Captain America: Civil War, the Bourne movies, etc. where you can barely see anything in the a lot of fights. The best action moments go to Harley Quinn, easily.Characters/Actors: Deadshot: Best Will Smith role I've seen in a long time. You will feel for him and his sad story. You will laugh at his sarcastic remarks. You may wonder why a guy with guns would be on a super-powered team, until you see what he's capable of, and then you will be in awe. Harley Quinn: This may be the most perfect comicbook to film casting choice ever. Margot Robbie embodies this character completely and she steals the show. I've been a fan of this character since Batman the Animated Series of the 90s and Margot nails this role.Joker: This one's interesting and may divide opinions. Here's something I noticed: this is the first on-screen Joker to not have an upward-rising red smile actually painted onto his face. For the first time, he's actually able to frown and give other intense expressions. He's totally creepy the way he instantaneously switches back and forth between intense and grinning expressions. I'll say, I loved this Joker, even if there were many Joker moments seen in the trailer that seem to have been cut from the movie. I wanted to see more Joker in this movie.Enchantress: One of the weird unexpected characters you'd only get from an unusual movie like this. She's like she came straight from a horror movie. The most visually impressive effects in this movie are for the Enchantress's magic.Amanda Waller: I've seen some complaints about the villain of this movie should have been better. I don't know what they're talking about, because Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was intense and intimidating. She will scare you. Other characters: Everyone does such a good job, even if they don't all get nearly enough screen-time.Other thoughts: An unusual number of scenes from the trailers didn't make it into the final film. I can only wonder why, because the ones that I noticed were missing seemed like fun and interesting moments. Without knowing what was originally in those scenes that were cut though, we can't really judge whether cutting them worked out well or not.I like what these DC movies have been doing and I like where they're headed. They're not afraid of pulling inspiration straight from the comics giving us something different than what we usually see on screen, instead of following the tired old movie formulas. Keep it up, DC. I look forward to Wonder Woman (2017).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never seen a movie that has kept me grounded. What i mean by that is a movie with a good story, amazing characters, a very good director David Ayer is one my favorite directors . Critics are always talking trash but the movie just showed that critics are dumb and got nothing better to do then trash talk something that was a instantly classic. Its up with marvel if not better. Dc have been stepping up there game for awhile now. People are going to have there opinions on the the film. Go see it for yourself and stop judging a book by its cover. A terrific cast the cast today really bought from the side characters to co staring to the main stars everything was terrific. The visuals and special effects that went in to into. as much as the costumes, the makeup, the props and props weapons as well even the sets. The lighting camera work everything. Even the music im buying the soundtrack for sure. I saw it twice you got my money and i got my moneys worth.i will buy it on DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into this expecting it to be an utter mess, based on what I'd heard so far, but I was incredibly surprised by how good this movie was. I have to say, I wasn't sure how much I'd like this version of the squad, considering there has been a version in Arrow, which I also loved. With that being said, I loved this movie. Particularly Deadshot and Diablo. I loved the way the backstories of each character was played out, without spending too much time on them (the Flash cameo in Captain Boomerang's was one of my favorite parts). I was wary when it came to the Joker because, like a lot of people, I was worried that Jared Leto couldn't play the character nearly as good as his predecessors. I have to admit, he did a pretty good job. Harley Quinn had some cheesy lines, but other than that, I enjoyed her performance too. One last thing, was the way they kept the BVS story line. They added in little things referring to Superman's death, and how the whole squad exists because of that one event. Overall, I think this was a pretty solid movie. It had some greats parts, and some strange/bad parts, but the latter is drastically outweighed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Condition Critical: DC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review of "Suicide Squad"To combat the potential threats from the metahumans of the world, The US government has formed Task Force X, which is comprised of supervillians."Suicide Squad", the third entry in DC's extended universe features one of the most promising ensembles for a comic book franchise but unfortunately for a film that promised to flip the superhero genre,the film fails in its execution. You're constantly beaten in the head repeatedly that the Squad are bad guys as if the audience must have a short term memory or ADHD. The first act was executed very well introducing the various characters in a very unique way that gave you a look into their life before their incarceration combined with classic songs that surprisingly fit.Although it started off promising, it simply doesn't juggle the large ensemble properly and the film suffers for it despite the efforts of standouts Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, who's arc is quite honestly one of the best in the film and Deadshot, played by Will Smith, is the closest to an actual protagonist you'll see on screen without actually being referenced as one. Unfortunately,Many of the trivial cast members stumble with finite screen time, secondary prequels and sandwiched benefactions. Jared Leto surprisingly managed to create an incarnation of The Clown Prince that truly stands on his own. It reminds me partly of "Scarface". Might not agree with me but I got that impression. Most of his performance was seen through Harley's prequel and I wish he was used more in this film because his portrayal shows promise if given a proper film. If The Joker had been utilized more in this film, he could have added that layer of chaos that the film was sorely lacking. The Joker holds a double edged sword in this film unfortunately. He is the personification of the film's best concepts as well as its worst proclivities. Like Deadshot's story and El Diablo's, Joker's love affair with Harley Quinn is told through flashbacks. The majority of the film's most powerful emotions are encased in flashbacks. One example of a major flaw:The villain's gripe with Humanity is exposed in one single line of dialogue.It's quite ironic that a film that celebrates the protagonists features the worst villain I've ever seen in a comic book movie. There's no denying that factor. The Enchantress along with the other villain I won't mention to those who haven't seen the film could easily be forgotten and mistaken for something out of Gods of Egypt. It was a wasted opportunity to craft a villain that can stand out in a pack of disposable villains we constantly get in the genre. I seriously have to question the concept of the eyes of The Adversary. For those action setups which weren't jaw dropping with the one exception to Deadshot's one scene, I thought every time I seen a minion I was seeing a cross between a Lovecraft concept crossed with some crazy Resident Evil zombie. The concept looks out of place with the film. The film score I felt was great in the first half since many of the songs are truly classics but it felt odd with the second half shifting to a traditional film score. The plot isn't honestly that great. This film had a great opportunity to do things outside the box but it played safe well too safe and by doing so it lost the initial spark that it had in the first act. Plus the haphazard editing didn't help the film. It's reluctantly disappointing that a such visual spectacle was wasted on a ghastly plot, haphazard editing,insipid action and yet again a Lackluster villain in a film coincidentally celebrating villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! WHAT UTTER RUBBISH!!! Seriously, this is one of the worst action hero movies I have ever seen... nope, it is THE worst. An abysmal insult to the intelligence of an average person. Every move is totally predictable. It is filled with clichés and has absolutely nothing one could say in it's favour. The roles played by the villain heroes were all cardboard cut-outs and you felt you could write their next line before they even spoke it, it was THAT BAD. One becomes so conscious of the contrived, staged nature of this "badass team" that you can almost hear the director/hairstylist/set dresser running around just off camera. Suspended belief is usually because a story is so fantastical that you make allowances for the way laws of physics can be broken, and you still become enchanted, wrapped up in a movie that has merit. This movie has none, and the suspended belief I found myself having to constantly endure and overcome was the belief that this was a story worth caring about. So shallow and vacuous is this plot that all you can see is a movie that fails dismally at drawing you in. I did not care at all about the characters, their loved ones, their children... 1/10 is generous.</fullReview>

I don't know how people can enjoy the movies without at least any character development at all. Showing them isn't enough. The humor was eye-rolling and gutwrenching.

		<fullReview>Suicide squad...I've been waiting for this movie since I saw the first trailer released six months ago. After seeing it, I can say that I was pleased with it, but not completely. This movie did many things right, but it did some wrong too.One of this movies pros, and cons at some points, is its character portrayal and development. I loved Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie portrayed Harley just like I remember in the cartoons, and she stayed in character throughout the whole film. Will Smith's performance is standard Will Smith, but that's fine, because it was good. I also think Jay Hernandez didn't do too bad as Diablo. Viola Davis was very tough and scary as Amanda Waller, she did very good. However, others, such as katana and killer croc are just put in as filler characters to look cool and be entertaining. Of which they did neither. You may have noticed I didn't previously mention Jared Leto. He deserves his own paragraph. Jared Leto was a very good joker. He was not at Heath ledger status, but I wouldn't expect anyone to be that good. His joker was more excited and talkative. He was unpredictable, and I liked it. The movie did a good job showing his relationship with Harley, such as the helicopter scene and the final scene when he broke her out of prison. I can't wait to see what dc does with Jared Leto, because he has something good going. The main thing that gets me about this movie is the pacing. The first third of the movie was FANTASTIC. When Amanda Waller introduced all the characters and their names and powers came up on screen, that was fantastic. I was a huge fan of the style put in during these scenes, as well as the music incorporated within them. However, once the squad goes on their mission, the movie gets serious with a joke sprinkled in every few minutes. This part of the movie is okay, and just okay. The part that hurts is the obvious change from fun to fists. It left me hoping for more of the first act. However, the action is fantastic.Enchantress was terrible, she was a horrible, ugly villain. Her character wasn't developed enough. When the squad killer her, I didn't care, and when Rick Flags wife came back, I still didn't care. Joker would have been a MUCH better main villain, but her was only in the movie for about 25 minutes, another massive mistake.My comments on this movie may seem mostly negative, and that's true. But that's from a movie standpoint. For a fun standpoint, this movie is it. I was never bored, I laughed during it a lot, and I really did like it. See this movie. Don't expect a perfect film like you would have thought a month ago, but don't expect a terrible one like critics are saying. Suicide squad is an good movie, but it's great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Suicide Squad Review - I'll say it, Its Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by saying I went into this movie with pretty high but also controlled expectations with all of the negativity surrounding this film and I came out of this film and well I thought this film was awesome. Is action packed and just fun to watch. I don't get the very sting negativity toward this film and I just hope people will go and see it regardless of what the critics say. Lets start of with the positives, the Squad members and their chemistry is great. From Will Smith's Deadshot to Margo Robbie's Harley Quinn to Diablo and Killer Croc and Jai Courtney is great(for once) as Captain Boomerang. They all have their moment to shine from just a funny joke to being a complete bad ass when you don't expect much from the character(Diablo was a standout). Will smith as Deadshot was fantastic and I knew he would be good but was worried he would try to make it the Will Smith show with some guys in the background and surprisingly enough he actually shares the screen and doesn't try to take away from anyone else. Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn, Not since Robert Downey Jr. Has there ever been a more perfect casting of a character that perfectly embodies the character as Margo Robbie does as the Clown Prince of crime's girlfriend. She was amazing and and was a big stand out. But you already knew that from the trailers. Let's talk Jared Leto's Joke, is he the best joker ever? How does he compare to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicolson? Well the best thing I can say is he's different and in a good way. He's doing his own thing taking different and is a more modern take where he's this mob boss, gangster-type clown that everyone is terrified of. Every time he shows up I felt very uncomfortable. That's all I can ask for from Joker so he succeeded but I'm not ready to say he's the best. But he is great. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the woman who puts the team together, is just a straight up bitch and that's really the best thing I can say about her. I hated her so much but your supposed to and what she does really makes you sympathize more with the squad and root for them. The man in charge of leading the team is Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag, I was actually really surprised how much I enjoyed the character and Kinnaman's performance. Let's get to the action cause this is something that I heard was one of the issues going into the movie especially the climax which someone made comparable to Fant4stic's climax in 2015. I'm happy to say this is something I disagree with. The action in this film is fantastic especially in the climax. The storytelling of certain characters though flashbacks worked for me. I had a problem with the storytelling/editing in BVS it went as far as ruinous to the theatrical version . However the way they showed certain characters as what they were as opposed to now I actually thought worked and added more to the characters. I think they could have been done better but I think they worked in the context of introducing how the characters got imprisoned. Now let's get to some of my issues with the film. All movies have them and let's start with the villains, for a movie where the Director went out of his was to show off that DC has the better villains he sure failed at giving us a compelling villain for the squad to go up against. Now not to say the villain ruined the movie but the villains and what they trying to do isn't very interesting and just sort of happens. And with the villain comes the mission. It's just not as interesting as I had hoped but the squad' back and forth make up for it. My other big criticism with the film is the soundtrack. I felt they just threw in a song every other scene and I felt it undermined Steven Price's score, which was fantastic because WB or Ayer were trying to make a memorable soundtrack like Guardians of the Galaxy's (sorry to bring up Marvel) I enjoyed the music but I think there should have been far fewer songs and more score, it's a great score. I loved that theme and so disappointed they kept playing rap music when the theme should have been playing. Guys I had a blast with this film. Ayer nailed these characters where Snyder wanted to change characterizations, which is fine but it's refreshing to see a DC film where they got these characters right. They got Harley Quinn right, they gave us compelling characters with Deadshot and El Dioblo. I thought Croc and Boomerang were funny. Joker?, yes he's doing his own thing but he's Joker not this Jason Todd Bullsh*t, Red Hood re-imagining that a fan got from playing a video Game. He creeps me out and made me uncomfortable with what little scene he had and that's all I can ask for after Ledger and Nicolson. The villain yes is not good yet I enjoyed the "swirling trash in the sky" action sequence. The action scenes involving the villains were great. Yes, Even the issues I have, have redeeming qualities to them. I'm going give Suicide Squad a 9/10.</fullReview>

There are some pacing issues, and it doesn't flow super well. But the overall result is a great movie: it's funny, it's action, it's emotional. And some of the most lovable villains there are. We've been wrapped up in comfortable Marvel land for way too long. DC is finally bringing us some super-hero/villain movies with some real meat. I'm impressed that DC has been able to throw all these incredible characters at us this quickly...and I can't wait to see them expand on the universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a story about redemption. The anti-hero formula is becoming a popular trend lately in literature and cinema, and even though it didn't work for Superman, it really works for these guys because they didn't start out good. The reason why you root for the Suicide Squad is because they feel guilt; and they really seem to want to atone for their sins.Will Smith absolutely stole this movie as Deadshot both for his dramatic scenes and action ones. I was surprisingly brought to tears on several occasions because of his performance and story arc. Even is action scenes were the best. One of the disappointments I had while watching this film was in the action department because there weren't any jaw dropping scenes like you got in Civil War or even BVS for that matter. However, Deadshot kicked ass! My next favorite thing;--Margot Robbie. Oh baby, she was a maniac in this movie, and I was surprised at the passion she brought to this role. There were many instances however, when she was used for comic relief and it I found that it really offset the otherwise serious tone of this film. Her best scenes were when she got serious and rallied the crew. Loved her, absolutely looked, sounded and acted like the Harley Quinn from the cartoons. Brooklyn accent was SPOT ON!The 3rd standout was Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. I found myself rooting for this guy, despite his degree of villainy and his dark past. There's a lesson to be learned from him in that we can all grow from past mistakes. Each of the members of Task Force X AKA Suicide Squad will leave you rooting them for one reason or another, as we are given glimpses of their dark pasts in many flashback scenes throughout the film. But all in all, great chemistry between the characters, especially between Deadshot and Rick Flag.Enchantress, the villain in this film, without giving away too much, is kind of a representation of each character's own inner torment, one they have to overcome in order to redeem themselves and grow as people. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the main villain in this movie, and many would've preferred the main villain to be Joker, but I didn't mind. I thought the villain and villains added a spiritual aspect to the plot. In a sense, the main villain represented each member of the Suicide Squad's dark past.Now, the cameos. DC fans...be ready! I know you're expecting Batman, and his scenes were pretty bad-ass. But be ready for more Justice League members to kick some ass. That's all I'll say! And if anyone thinks Jared Leto is rehashing Heath Ledger, be ready to be proved wrong. Leto really made this Joker his own. He was hip, sexual, burnt out, and just sick! And I do admit with a shame face, that I was rooting for him in the end.If I had to nitpick though, it would be in the editing department. This film is another example of a director's art being mutilated by the studio for the sake of greed. There were some really choppy editing issues in the middle of the film, and I heard that a lot of film was cut. I am starting to think that studios force directors to cut their films so that a director's cut may be released, increasing the amount of rentals, Blu-ray and digital purchases. A lot of people, including myself, felt that the Joker felt out of place in this film. He had nothing to do with the plot at all, but yet, he was so brilliantly played by Jared Leto, that many longed for more of his screen time nonetheless.I hope a director's cut will be released. Perhaps the Joker might matter a bit more because of it. All props to David Ayer though, for creating an eerie atmosphere in this film, that was clearly inspired by the Arkham Video games. The entire 2nd half of the film took place during the course of one night, in parts of the city were evacuated so that the Suicide Squad could deal with the threat in secret. It really felt like I was watching a live-action Arkham City video game. DC fans will eat this movie up. And judging by the cheers at my theater, non-comic fans will too. 9/10. Not a classic piece of film making by far, but a gem of a comic book film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad would not have been my first pick as the next DC Film following Batman V Superman. I would have gone with Wonder Woman, The Flash, or another Batman before I would have decided to release Suicide Squad. But with how well Disney/Marvel did with Guardians of the Galaxy, WB/DC wanted to do something similar and see if it worked out. Meet DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, and it delivers.Suicide Squad is not a perfect movie. Between having a slightly underdeveloped villain and a semi- jumbled third act (I say slightly only because of the whole subway flashback, the rest made a lot of sense and worked well), this film is not a 10/10, but it certainly deserves an 8, and maybe an 8.5.Suicide Squad brings together Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Rick Flag, Katana, Killer Croc, and El Diablo as Task Force X, created in the wake of Superman's death to combat superhuman threats to the USA's national security. It's a concept that I always liked in the comic books and the JLU episode "Task Force X" and I think translated well to the big screen.This movie is more lighthearted than the previous two DC films (though I'll still argue Man of Steel is a hopeful film) and ups the humor in a way that is satisfying to the viewer but not over-the-top as other comic book films have done. Deadshot, Harley, and the Squad are definitely the focus of the film and redemption seems to be a fitting theme for the movie. Justice League members do in fact cameo in the film, but their presence does not at all out-shine our "heroes" who continue to be our main focus throughout.Jared Leto's Joker also does not outshine the Squad members, though is an important part to Harley Quinn's story as well as the overall DCEU. While I personally did not like Leto's Joker as much as Heath Ledger's from The Dark Knight (he was too gangster for me honestly), Leto did deliver a great performance and his Joker is definitely a character that I want to see explored more throughout the DCEU, whether in a Batman film, Suicide Squad sequel, or Justice League.Last but not least, Suicide Squad is fun. Batman V Superman was not a fun film by the standards that films like The Avengers have set, but Suicide Squad is about enjoyable as Guardians of the Galaxy is, though obviously set on Earth and having a slightly more serious tone to our more grounded world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I AM A DC FAN, most of which were disappointed, aren't real DC Fans. Here's why. Suicide Squad was judged too quickly off of the trailer, plus the failure of Batman v Superman. What seems to be thrown around too much in these critic articles is that DC and Marvel are alike. No, they aren't. DC is a darker world, of course you're going to see the use of guns. In a world where the protagonist is against weapons (batman), the villains are obviously going to use them. NO SPOILERS. The movie is great, I loved it. I failed to see what's wrong with it other than the costume design (which we already understand from the trailer). Sure it was over hyped in the trailer, but that was the pitch, we were given that hype during the duration of the film. More towards the story line, it was basic to start with, we get our intro. The intro expands on the antagonists' back stories, due to certain events involving a dark entity (totally DC) and uncontrollable circumstances, they're forced into a squad. Due to the traits/powers each of them hold, it reflects their personalities. And like magnets, opposite personalities take time to mix. In certain scenes you start to understand how they bond over small things, it makes you feel for these bad people. A lot of critics have gone off of the quote Bad v Evil with this film, I don't necessarily think that's the case. I feel it's more Convicts v Demons. DC is entirely based around God V Man and I feel that Marvel has stolen the spot light with the lead up to that (our wait for Thanos). Suicide Squad has skipped that wait, which I feel is a good thing because it doesn't give us a cliff hanger. It's giving the fans what we want instantly, no money schemes for upcoming films like Marvel. Back to the film, I didn't think it was cringed or overly dramatized. Most of the characters lines came directly from the comic books, so these critics are idiots. If you've watched Batman v Superman, you're getting an improvement. Not everything starts perfectly. I believe DC is working its way up, and Marvel isn't happy. I recommend you see this film guys, it's worth it I promise.One more thing I thought I might add... Heath Ledgers joker was extremely different from the comic books Joker, don't be surprised if Jared Leto's Joker is also. Heath's was serious and dark, Jared's is the humorous balanced of brightness we get in this cinematic universe. 10/10, I walked into this film afraid of the reviews, I came out confused as to why. It's an incredible film DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED Batman V Superman but the Critics got SUICIDE SQUAD Right, What an AWFUL Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Actually Think The Critics Were Too Generous With This Film!!I LOVED THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, MAN OF STEEL AND BvS. I'm not that knowledgeable about the comic book worlds for DC or Marvel, but i do love watching movies. I was looking forward to this film even with the poor critics response.What a mess, right from the start. Awful film. It was a roadrunner way of filmmaking, the structure and editing of scenes didn't give a chance to connect with the films story or characters. It was like a unentertaining mtv music video. For a film with such a frenetic style of storytelling it was boring, i was counting the minutes, the end didn't come soon enough.The dialog was embarrassing at times.The few shoot'em up action scenes were unremarkable and unmemorable. The finale was a joke of unbelievability, even for a superhero film, a cgi heavy ending that was like a damp squib to an already unexciting movie. Like a really rubbish supernaturals vs humans confrontation.I love Jared Leto but The Joker's scenes weren't created right or edited to show the pure evil he is. His scenes were so random and nearly irrelevant it was a shame to watch. Leto's talents were wasted and utilized incorrectly in this film, not like in Batman and Dark Knight, where they savoured his menace in each scene and built on it. This just looks like rapid fire weird faces. And they should have chosen a different look for the Joker too, to be honest i liked it before i actually saw it in the movie.Viola Davies character was not convincing at all as a goody-baddie.As soon as the gang get to Midway City it turns into the Will Smith show. They may as well have called the film 'The Smith Squad.' All these so called ultimate baddies who follow no one but themselves, who defy law, order and hierarchy and anyone else tbh turn into a bunch of little sheep. The film makes him out to be the leader of them. And he's the least nutso guy! When have these kind of ultimate baddies/mentally deranged characters ever followed an average bad guy! I'm not a fan of Will Smith so maybe it stood out more to me but still it made no sense. He did most of the talking throughout, besides Harley Quinn and Boomerang who mainly had a bunch of one-liners. He was the voice of reason here!Boomerang was my favourite character, he seemed the most interesting and was cool enough to expect a solo movie from, not that DC would.I'd like to see Jared Leto's Joker in another film also, with more of a storyline. Besides those two though, i wouldn't care if any of the others in this appeared in any future DC films again. Only because they weren't presented well in this.I hope there isn't another Suicide Squad film only because i'd rather see a different DC comic movie get a chance.Fantastic Four was more entertaining and well made than this for me.And the use of hit songs just felt forced. Not like say Guardians Of The Galaxy where the hit songs were few but important and elevated the scene and film.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets just be honest, the only thing good about this otherwise terrible movie Harlequin's smoking hot behind. That is worth $150,000,000 in box office alone. Otherwise this movie was really really bad... Was it edited by a 3rd grader?No surprise there will most likely be a Harlequin sequel, they can ditch the rest of this crew and keep Harlequin.In Summary, bad movie, nice latex covered bottom on Harlequin.Margot Robbie should get all the profits from this movie, everyone else was terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go! Another DC cinematic universe movie pooped out to make nothing but money. Yes WB don't want your respect just your cash. But they are to lazy and or stupid to work out how to do it. A great director and stellar cast are let down (again) by pathetic WB management's decision to cut the guts out of a movie in a knee jerk reaction to Batman v Superman being a T&amp;rd. Is this better that Batman v Superman? No not really. It's more colorful but it's just plain badly put together. Here we have some of DC's baddest bad guys doing the dirty work but wait. They all have hearts of gold and by the end of the movie become super-friends fighting the most generic villain you could ever get. DC/WB if you just focused on making good movies and not building words and franchises you's be a lot better off. Make the good movies. People will want to see them, the shared universe comes later. F%&amp;king idiots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is embarrassingly bad. The plot makes no sense, the characters beyond Deadshot and Harley Quinn are criminally underwritten, and the whole thing is just embarrassing to watch. The villain is so cartoonish and thinly written you'd think you were watching an old Ghostbusters cartoon. I feel bad for everyone involved with this. The editing of this film is some of the worst I've seen and the dialogue is pathetic. This is Green Lantern bad. I miss the days of Nolan's Batman trilogy when Warner had competent people running a franchise. What they are doing now is truly awful, and I hope this movie tanks after its massive opening weekend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst writings I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, the writing is so bad I don't even know where to start. I think the main problem is the witch, who is not an appropriate villain for a squad that uses guns and bats. Also, if Waller had the witch's heart the whole time, why didn't she destroy the heart and stop the witch from destroying the city? That would have cut the movie time in half and saved me from having to watch another hour of this dreadful movie. There's a whole bunch of characters that don't do anything-- like the Japanese lady, the bank robber, and the crocodile. It would have been best to stick to fewer characters and develop them. This movie is just a mess. I don't understand how this writer got so much money to write absolute crap and the crew went along with it. At one point, you would think someone would be like 'Wait, this doesn't make sense... throwing a dynamite into a whirlpool of magical crap is gonna stop it?' I literally started laughing at some parts because it was just so ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie in my Recent Memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>its my first review on IMDb, but SS (Suicide Squad) compelled me to do so. Its probably the worst movie ever with this high budget and good cast. You may realize in the first ten minutes that its a BORE. Story is a mess, plot is a mess, illogical and stupid ideas and it is extremely annoying if u go all excited/Jolly with high expectations (like me) to watch it. I still cant believe that Will Smith worked in this movie. His presence in the movie was kind of an assurance for me that it was going to be good. The trailers also seemed good because trailers do not show the kind of crap which there is in the movie:). Acting of Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) is probably the only good thing about the movie. Despite all these negative reviews i'd still want people to watch this movie once or at least send one person from friends circle to watch this movie/waste money and then come back with a review like this one so that next time makers of this movie do something better or at least digestible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must say what a disappointment for a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah I don't like to agitate anyone who liked this movie, but to be honest I agree with the critics on Rotten Tomatoes. This movie was a worthless piece of garbage. I mean the casting of this movie was off and it was sort of laughable too and the guy who played the Joker in this was nowhere near as good as Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill. Jared Leto is the worst Joker ever. He doesn't even deserve to play the Joker again in future DC films. I mean he can't even laugh as good as Heath Ledger or Mark Hamill and both Ledger and Hamill are legends. Jared Leto is nothing more then an amateur. Also the Joker doesn't need tattoos or bling in his teeth. Joker is fine with just his purple suit, green hair, white face and creepy evil smile or scars. Also Will Smith just sort of lost his way of acting and he was much better off being in Independence Day and Men in Black. I also like his role in the Pursuit of Happiness. Also Joker usually doesn't care for Harley Quinn that much, but it looked like he did care for her a lot in this. What's up with that? I also know in the game Batman Arkham City Joker got Harley pregnant. Also how the hell did Joker survive drowning in the ocean and that helicopter crash? There were no explanations for either of those things. I also still don't care about Ben Affleck being Batman and the only good part of this movie was that he was only in like 3 parts of it. Also the main villain in this movie reminded me of Gozer the Traveller from Ghostbusters and that scene where she was using her powers to take over the world was just like the scene in Ghostbusters where Gozer and her temple were on top of that building except that it was inside a building like in Ghostbusters 2 where Vigo was trying to come out of his painting but the Ghostbusters slimed him back into it. I mean this Enchantress person was exactly like Gozer from Ghostbusters and after she is defeated, that wife of Flag came out of her skin just like Dana and Louis came out the shells of Vintz Clortho and Zuul after the Ghostbusters defeat Gozer and Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Also I understood most of the lines in this movie, but still there wasn't very good dialogue in this. This movie is so lame that it proves that Marvel will always be better then DC. The only good part about DC is the Dark Knight Trilogy and Christian Bale still makes a better Batman then Ben Affleck. This is film is worse then Batman vs Superman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I have ever seen. It is AMAZING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far my favorite movie ever. And I am quite surprised. I was looking forward to seeing it but was a bit put off by the horrible reviews it received. During and after the movie however, I marveled at the amazing acting, costumes, special effects, and overall story line. My favorite characters are most definitely the unstoppable duo that is the Joker and Harley Quinn. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie nailed their performances to a t. I know how intimidating it must have been to portray Mr J after Heath Ledger, but Leto was amazing (and very intimidating). The portrayal was believable, intriguing, and incredibly scary. I loved it! He only appears quite briefly but in the scenes he was in, he was outstanding! As for Robbie, she was a star and lit up the screen every time she appeared. The only "negative" part of this movie was Cara Delevingne's acting, which I felt was not up to par with the others and the importance of her character. Though in the end it didn't matter because Suicide Squad was amazing! I have no idea what the critics were thinking and am very confused as to why they hated it. I await the sequel with anticipation and hope that Mr J and Harley make more of an appearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What movie did the critics see?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first go excited for this movie with the trailers. The buzz was great, but the negative reviews from the critics surprised me. Out of all of the superhero/comic movies out there, this one looked different? Why the sudden negativity. Still, I decided to catch the 6 pm early showing of it.I'm left wondering what film all the critics saw because the one I just walked out of was awesome!I go to movies looking looking for one thing: entertainment. Boy did this one deliver.The actors were amazing. I was already impressed by Jared Leto from the trailers and he did not disappoint. Some say he wasn't in the film enough, however, this isn't about the Joker. I think Waller would agree, Joker would never be able to join the Suicide Squad. However, what scenes he is in are great, he really shines. I felt like he was in there just enough for him to be interesting and totally thrilling, but it also left me dying to see him front in center of his own movie. You can tell they have Joker in here as a teaser for for more to come with him.Magot Robbie was fantastic as Harley Quinn. Out of all of the Squad, I found myself feeling her emotions. You really got to know Harley in this film. I would love to see her and Joker together in another film. Will Smith was great as Deadshot. Sure, we've seen Will be the sarcastic, fun sort of hero (or I suppose sort of hero in this film) before, but he plays the role well. It certainly was interesting knowing he is not so much a superhero as he is a reluctant antihero with crack shot skills.The actor that most surprised me was Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. Now I thought she looked good in the trailers, but her character was one I didn't have much interest in. Boy did that change. You found yourself sitting up straighter when she was on screen. She is scary in her own way, and despite the fact she's one of the "good guys" you certainly don't trust her and you really don't want to get on her bad side.Now with all movies, this one does have it's flaws. The girl who plays Deadshot's daughter is perhaps the weakest actor of the crew, but she's not in the film much so that's very minor. The villain's motive is rather typical "take over the world" sort of thing, but that's true with most villain in superhero movies and even in comics.The flashbacks were all great. Some came bit later in the film, but that only was to better enhance the emotions of the characters. For the first time, you were really connecting with crazy psychopaths and killers in a superhero movie.Bottom line, don't listen to the critics. If you want a movie that wants to entertain you with really great actors, awesome action, and even surprise you with some feels, then you will love this movie.</fullReview>

The way how it used Harly and Deadshot and built its plot around it was absolutely amazing, and this is coming from a Marvel fanboy. And Jared's performance as The Joker, wow. It no Heath Ledger, but it's amazing. Heck, even Jai Courtney was good. There were some flaws in the plot, but character development and build up were on point. Diablo was an amazing character, shame he had to end up gone, The Flash and Batmans cameos (well Batman not so of a cameo) were amazing and told us more about the story (Flashes cameo was class).

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all this is my first review and I'm writing it on my phone so please, don't kill me.I saw the movie yesterday and at first I had really mixed feelings. There are few things that still bothers me, but the more time passes and I go through the movie in my head, the more I start to like it. Sure there was too many "jokes" for my liking and in someway the soundtrack (as good as the songs are) annoyed me, but in the end those are minor things. Where was the mess and whatnot that some critics/reviewers are writing about? Simple plot and lot's of action with some great performances by the actors equals a good and solid comic book movie in my book. OK, if you are waiting for some deep and complex plot with unseen twists and turns, then you may/will be disappointed.Overall I don't get what the h*ll were the critics waiting for? A new American Beauty? Suicide Squad was entertaining and I'm already waiting for the Blu-ray to come out. S.S. delivers a good basis for some aggressive expansion within the DC universe character-wise!...However with all that said I still do hope there would be a more darker director's cut version released with the blu-ray/DVD as this movie has the potential to be even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guardians of the Galaxy-like fun hits all the right keys, just not in the right order to gain access to greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's now two days until my birthday, and I really wanted Suicide Squad to be my early birthday dream come true. What I got was not as bad as all the critics have been saying, but at the same time it just feels like it misses the mark somehow.First of all, let's deal with the obvious: this film is basically DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Both have criminals band together to face a powerful enemy (both with a combination of swords and guns), both use classic pop and rock songs, and both end up establishing the direction of their respective universes.So the music, in the trailers for this movie, the editing acumen to meld action with music was nothing short of genius, but in the finished product, while all the songs are good, they come up so often,so unnecessarily, and sometimes as a very odd choice. Literally, Bohemian Rhapsody plays at the very end for no reason at all over the exact footage of the second trailer.Moving on, though, this film is not necessarily about the action, of which there is plenty of but you doesn't really engage you. It's about the chemistry between the cast, and they fall in three categories.The breakout stars of this film, Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, and Jared Leto's Joker, all steal the show in every scene they appear (of which, Joker appears much less than you might think). In short, Suicide Squad is basically all about these three, the rest of the cast just supports them.Then there are the perfectly competent characters who are there and make for great action sequences. Chief among these are Diablo, played by Jay Hernandez, and Katana, played by Karen Fukuhara. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller is meant to be a chief player in this film, and in all honesty she pulls off her performance wonderfully, but her lack of screen-time in much of the film's action leaves her just shy of making the first tier.Finally, there's the characters who were either supposed to be important but really aren't and those who are incredibly forgettable. Case in point: the relationship between Special Forces officer Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman, and June Moone/Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne, is supposed to be one of torn emotions between saving their love or saving the world, but when it all plays out the resolution does not feel satisfying. Also, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang's only cool moment is him sipping a beer during an intense firefight.In summary, let me say that this film is NOT as bad as the critics say it is. They lambaste the poor editing, shallow characters, and rushed pace, and while there is ground for criticism in these ares, Suicide Squad delivers more than enough thrills and laughs to make the price of admission worth it. If I were to change one thing, though: I would go back in time and tell the marketing department to not give away so much of the film in the trailers, because really a TON of stuff in the trailers basically sums up the movie and there's not as much left to find out in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this is an amazing movie!!I don't know why the critics says otherwise. Probably they got paid by marvel because this is really amazing. I have been watching movies all my life and very few of them worth the time to see them twice and pay for the ticket. I will probably go again and watch it because of the characters, everyone is great especially joker and we didn't see much of him, amazing actors, funny, not at all boring like the first hour of batman v superman (which to be honest i really really like it despised the fact that it was boring at the beginning and the Martha thing ) and also great introduction to the characters. I will expect more if there's going to be an extended cut coming out on bluray but only time will tell. Also amazing mid credits scene, gives the road to justice league. Just wait 2 min after the end of the movie. Just Amazing!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously? What DID you wanted to see? Dante's inferno on screen? Divine Comedy? Iliad? It's a freaking comic book movie, some guys fight big evil. End of story. I'm not a hardcore comic book fan, but I do know my stories and characters, I have an idea how they should be portrayed, and the movie did justice to that. Mr.J was more accurate than Ledger's, despite the looks, Harley was great, Deadshot was cool, the others did their parts.The big evil was acceptable, I know far worse villains in comic book movies. So, please, stop complaining and enjoy something for once, just plainly enjoy it, don't overthink stuff, don't try to be some critic, judging people's hard work, I know most of the people who are "professional critics" didn't do half of the work the crews, in all the movies they bashed, did. I would normally rate it 9/10, but Mr.J and Harley were too awesome, so I added an extra one point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the initial critics led me to believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've learned not to trust professional critics too much, doing so had me bored witless watching A Girl With a Pearl Earring and potentially avoiding Suicide Squad. Which in itself kinda explains why the initial movie wasn't to my liking.Having been disappointed by BMvsSM, I was holding out hope that SS would improve on that disappointing excuse for entertainment. Especially since Marvel has had me firmly in their grasp, and Deadpool which I waited many years for, reigniting my passion for those beyond Marvel's firm grasp ... Even if it is in the neighbour's yard.SS starts off at an intentionally and somewhat unavoidable slow pace for a movie, the only way this could possibly have been sped up is if the characters had been introduced in previous movies and this outing being their group debut. So you have to accept that for a large troupe there is character background to go through, although not enough to slow the movie down too much.It's hard to work out who the main antagonist is in the movie, but generally speaking there are 3. The Joker, Enchantress and Amanda Waller herself. Enchantress arguably plays the main antagonist, but without a huge amount of screen time, which is one of my few issues with the movie. It was far too busy with too many antagonists and running story lines to stay focused and engaged and even passionate about their mission. The only person you do actually want them all to take out, ironically is Amanda Waller - which fits with her comic book character anyway - so in that respect, she us true to story. The Joker story-line for me just distracted from the rest of the story. It was obviously a set up for another outing but didn't need to happen here.There is great chemistry between the key SS members and some funny lines that keep you laughing, even if a little nervously. This isn't however an Avengers ensemble type of humour. Margot Robbie and Will Smith both do admirably, with Margot Robbie even producing a very Harley Quinn sounding voice. Overall, I loved it. Would have preferred a slightly less convoluted story-line but otherwise I thought it was great and well worth that first midnight viewing in NZ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comic book pasted onto your Screens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was great. It is a comic book just converted to a video format. Critics' expectations in a movie will be different from comic book readers. Overall, It is a treat to comic book fans. Critics refer a lot for complicated "Nolan" Movies and then rate them, why not read a comic and then rate this movie? But, it would be better if a normal audience had a comic book reader aside, just to inform about the depth of the characters, otherwise they may end up confused. Expected a lot from Mr. J but news has that some of his scenes have been cut. It will be a musical experience than a film. Background story could have been a little more clear and other than that this movie is just a treat. Watch and Judge the movies, don't read reviews and judge them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the critics fool you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went to see Suicide Squad yesterday. Let me start by saying that DC has taken a step in the right direction. What they have started to do is make the continuity of their movies work so that every movie is starting to tie in. Much like everyone in the past few weeks with the release of the Batman V Superman: DOJ I watched the movie again. I still have no love for Zack Snyder. It is apparent that he has an intense dislike for Superman and that he has a darkly smudge soul so he has no happiness but it is glaringly apparent that he has some kind of direction. He just needs to get the proper coordination. Moving past that David Ayer, who is a fantastic director has a very dark and funny look on life and his take on the Suicide Squad is a refreshingly view at what makes a bad guy. Is it what they do or is it what they are? The answer may surprise you. The movie tries in ways to be fun and other times darkly serious. If you are looking for a Marvel funfest of bright colors and showy fights then you are in the wrong movie. It is dark and scary. Gruesome and gritty. I wouldn't let a kid see this because it is exactly what you would expect a movie about villains doing villain things to be like.Positives: 99% percent of the featured cast. Stand outs were Will Smith, Viola Davis, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. The action scenes were dynamite and the cameos by the 2 heroes were perfectly shaped into the plot. The dynamic of the Joel Kinneman and Will Smith was very interesting to see. Viola Davis captured the essence of Amanda Waller. My wife thought that Margot Robbie's turn as Harley Quinn was not a stretch for her because she can't be that cute and not be crazy. (Arleen Sorkin should be proud of her). Jai Courtney made me like Captain Boomerang and not think of him as a cheesy villain that fights the Flash.Negatives: Katanna seemed to be a forced character in the movie. The story lost a little pace and the marketing department used too many of the great scenes as trailer bait so there was a lot of spoilers due to the trailers. Overall as a comic book fancier, I give it a 8 out of 10. The DC universe will have to bring everything back together in the upcoming years to correct the missteps that they have started to make up for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT Movie! The critics are being ridiculous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critical response to this is absolute NONSENSE. I genuinely thought Batman v Superman deserved it's low rating, but this movie DOES NOT. I went into this movie TRYING to be hard on this movie. At the end, I realized I could only nitpick a few things.NONSPOILER REVIEW: Screw the critics. This movie is fantastic. GO SEE IT!!SPOILER REVIEW:The movie had an EXTREMELY basic plot line, which some critics can't seem to follow. The movie begins with the main characters being introduced as Waller flips through the briefing notebook. Then the main villain is introduced and explained. The main villain gets out. The squad is released to deal with villain. Main conflict. Resolution. End. How does it get more basic than that? Margot Robbie was the PERFECT Harley Quinn. She really nailed it. Deadshot, though a bit different from the comics, was really great in this movie. El Diablo was also another very pleasantly surprising character that I enjoyed. Enchantress and her brother as the main villains worked rather well and were very creepy. Going into this movie not really reading the comics, but knowing extensive background knowledge, I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. My only critiques: 1) Killer Croc was written poorly. His character was kind of cheesy, hard to understand, and stereotypical. 2) A lot of scenes in the trailer were cut; however, I would rather they cut scenes that didn't fit vs. try to jam them in there like in BvS. This is only my critique because I was looking forward to seeing them. What was released was still great.Overall: I would give this movie a 9-9.5/10. I really enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. There were no parts I thought dragged on. They wasted no time. Loved it! PS. Screw the simple minded critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely amazing! A MUST-WATCH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hardly ever do reviews, but after hearing some misplaced criticism i see myself compelled to defend this movie. First of all, the acting is absolutely outstanding. I must admit I did not know what to expect from so many crazy characters but it definitely worked. Jared Letto did an amazing Joker, he was like a mafia boss all psychotic, plus the introduction of a love interest (Harley Quinn) added much to the plot. Margo Robbie, Will Smith and Jai Courtney were incredibly funny. The rest of the characters were also great but the 4 mentioned above really stole the spotlight. The characters are incredibly interesting, and I would like to see a movie focused of each of them. The only character i thought was a bit of an extra that (for me) kinda ruined the vibe was the Japanese sword woman (but she doesn't appear that much). Also, the plot was also very well formed and made sense, it was well put together. Yes, there's like half an hour dedicated to character introduction, but honestly, the characters are the essence of the movie (which is why it's so good). In addition, The movie is just hilarious. I laughed all the time, the characters are just so charismatic. I don't get why people hate on the movie. It's FANTASTIC. Seriously... go watch it.</fullReview>

All the actors played their characters perfectly and I really want to see them pop up in other DC films! Margot Robbie and Jared Leto did not disappoint and they both smashed it out of the park with these roles, Will Smith also. Jai Courtney was really funny and Captain Boomerang was a great character! Amanda Waller was superb! Viola Davis was born to play Amanda. Enchantress was cool and it was interesting to see her character on the big screen.Treat yourself, and go see this movie, I had a smile on my face for majority of the film, the action, humor and development of characters will all make it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god! What a wonderful movie! I really don't know what's wrong with the critics. Definitely, we didn't see the same movie. Suicide Squad is one of the best super-hero movies I ever saw. Amazing script, amazing actors and amazing direction. It's incredible the way that David Ayer made the interaction of the characters between themselves. I will write below about the "stars" of Suicide Squad. (KEEP CALM! THERE'S NO SPOILERS!)The Joker: Jared Leto is one of the best living actors. You really think he's crazy on real life because his voice, his maniac look, and his facials expressions are not from a sane person. I'm sorry Cesar Romero and Heath Ledger, but Jared Leto is the real Joker, he seems that he escaped from the comics, like Jack Nicholson did, and is on the real world. I cried like a kid who earned his first bike. Amazing, amazing and amazing!Harley Queen: I'm in love with Margot Robbie. Her sweet voice, sweet face and sweet personality made her a personification of the Animated Series' Harley Queen. At the right moment she's very violent. Her interaction with Jared is beautiful. Although he treats her as a tool, he loves her. Deadshot: The classic Will Smith from action movies: tough, make us laugh a bit, and worried with his family. I remembered his character on "I Am Legend". I really liked.Captain Boomerang: Man, this guy deserves to be on the Flash movie. He's very very funny, a real troglodyte and a crazy bastard. A perfect villain.Batman: I though he appears more, but what really matters is: Ben Affleck is the best Batman. The scene where he persecutes Joker and Harley will make fans cry of emotion. I won't explain each character because you must see them with your own eyes. Please, don't listen the bad critics and go watch Suicide Squad! You will not regret!P.S. If you are asking yourself if Suicide Squad is better than Batman vs Superman, the answer is YES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jared Leto didn't get more than 10 minutes of his 30 minutes screen time, though in all honesty The Joker didn't need anymore time in this movie as it wasn't about him. Any more in the film and it would've thrown off the film. The second reason was that Batman Vs Superman sucked, well for the morons that didn't know it sucked?. Yes Batman vs Superman sucked, but what does that have to do with Suicide Squad. The 3rd reason was that movies like this don't follow the actual story?. Well I've not saw a movie at all that followed the original story since I was born. Example "The People vs Larry Flint" was a nice film which portrayed Larry as a loving husband, though it left out how often he beat his wife. Every movie is a film based on a story, it's not the exact story or it wouldn't have such a dramatic affect.Suicide Squad is a great ENTERTAINING Film! It's exactly what it shows in the trailer, if you're expecting it or any film to be the story from it's origin then stop watching movies so you don't cry every time you watch one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Rotten Tomatoes reviews for this film, I was shocked and not giving f**k. And now I can truly say: f**k rotten tomatoes! This movie was fantastic, but with very little minor issues.Let's start with actors. They all did good job. Even villains (that I get into later) who were disappointing did okay job. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and etc. nailed their roles and characters personalities. "How about Jared Leto's Joker?" you may ask.. He did good job, no near Heath Ledger or Mark Hamill, but still really good.. He was still tiny little better than Nicholson's Joker..How about plot.... Okay, it's not best in world, it's not original... But its simple... yea And villains? They are bad.. As many have guessed, Enchantress was villain and brought her brother, Incubus to wipe out humanity and take over a world (OF COURSE!) in my opinion they are not bad in good way, but in bad.. which is little shame. But those false things are replaced with good action, actors, atmosphere, chemistry between characters and so many things more.. Even just quick cameos of Batman and Flash were really cool and mid-credit scene has gotten me more hyped to DCEU.So, after all this.. It has earned its place in my heart as "best movie of 2016" and definitely better than BvS or Man of Steel.But don't take my word of it. See it yourself, but I'm quite sure that you will find at lest something you like about squad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with couple of friends on premiere day in my country. I was very excited to see it and I'm not gonna lie, I was not disappointed. One of the biggest movie's strengths are characters. I loved every Suicide Squad member - their presentations were really good and enjoyable to watch in my opinion.I know this may be controversial but Jared Leto as a Joker delivered A+ performance and the chemistry between him and Margot was amazing. Too bad we didn't see him for a long time.Enchantress(Cara Delevingne) - I'm in love with Cara and I'm really proud with how she performed. Maybe character development was pretty meh but Enchantress had her bad ass moments for sure and Cara was perfect as an Enchantress.OVERALL 10/10 characters, good action, basic but interesting plot line with some humor. I highly recommend this movie and DON'T LISTEN to these critics. It's definitely worth your time :)</fullReview>

You will have a great time with this movie, just as the cast did makin it. The only thing i had a problem with was that the story and main villain could have gotten a little more time and work on it because it didn't feel as good as the rest of the movie. Other than that it is a wonderful ride with colors, explosions and great action. Without it feeling like a Michael Bay movie... Suicide Squad is a true comic-book movie and it is hella entertaining.

		<fullReview>Thrilling, sophisticated and dark-toned, Suicide Squad delivers a big improvement over the DCEU, with Margot's portrayal as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto's joker. What the critics say is a lie, the film is awesome, exciting and definitely fun to watch, it definitely improved over Batman v Superman, adding some humor and a less darker cinematography.Enchantress was certainly my favourite, the surprise she turns out to be the main villain and her powers are just extraordinary! Cara Delevingne's portrayal was fabulous :) Amanda Waller just demonstrated such ruthless power, determination and antagonistic behaviour which I was extremely pleased about. Now.. Will Smith. Many thought it was a disaster he was cast as a villain / anti-hero but his acting was pretty impressive. Same goes with Jai Courtney, both showed a big surprise to their acting. I wouldn't really listen to what the critics say, this film is extremely dark and hilarious but I only gave it a 9 out of 10 because I thought it could've improved slightly, particularly the Joker's screen-time. He had about 25-30 or more minutes which wasn't enough but other than that, one of the best films of 2016 and certainly the best out of the DCEU (possibly till Wonder Woman &lt;3)However, there were some weak plot holes. Especially when they revealed that Enchantress is the villain of the film. The worst part is that Joker's screen-time was limited and most of the movie was cut out, the majority of the trailer scenes were not even in the film itself. Especially the car chase with the batman, it was so short, not as long as I really hoped. Still, the film did deliver a wonderful masterpiece with its CGI and acting. Suicide Squad, a film which displays a talented cast and adds humor than previous DCEU films but needs to improve its plot and writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never listen to the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to say it, I listened to the critics. I knew it was wrong thing to do because when I read the critiques I get caught up into it but truly the film was amazing. A definite must see in 3D, IMAX if your lucky. This action pack, star studded lineup demonstrated that DC Comics was not ready to rest after "critically panned" Batman vs. Superman. With the highly payola Marvel critics bashing another DC Film, this one was not uncalled for. Ayer displayed a fresh new look on villains, not the best heroes, but somehow cooler than most. With graphics to die for and a soundtrack to live, the film truly display a cast so fun to watch. Smith (Deadshot) and Robbie (Harlequin) won in this film rather than their flop, Focus, displaying their versatility as actors. Delevingne (Enchantress/June) showed us how modelling again wasn't destined for her entire future. I loved her double act between the demonic possessed villain and her human character. The Joker (played by Leto) was mixed amongst the crowd, but as much as I knew it was big shoes to fit after the Oscar winning performance from late Heath Ledger, to be honest I didn't hate it. He obviously brought a different take on the Joker. A more psychotic rather than manipulative tone to his character. Wasn't as much of him in the film, because we know that there is more to come. But you will either love or hate him.There were parts that I knew weren't needed and I'd happily point them out on a second viewing. The plot was a messy plot, but again I'd say at times you could be lost but still catch up if that makes sense. You'd have to be super dumb to not what is happening, but also super smart to know they had some messy hiccups. Overall I found the film very enjoyable despite the early hate. It does open up the question will these unlikely heroes take a cameo appearance in the next DC films? But to be honest, I wouldn't mind watching Suicide Squad any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded very, VERY high expectations. LOVED IT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to an advance screening of Suicide Squad at Event Cinema George Street Sydney on Monday with my brother and mum.Between us; 3 completely different expectations.I've read comics my whole life (from ALL publishers). Big comic book geek. Huge fan of Harley Quinn from as far back as when she was first created for the 1992 Batman Animated Series. I know everything there is about these characters and had high hopes. This movie gets the characters perfect. I absolutely loved it.My brother is 21, never read a comic in his life. Never watched the Batman or Justice League etc cartoons but has watched avengers, Ironman, Dark Knight and most of the comic book movies from the last 10ish years. Didn't know really anything about the characters coming into the movie. He absolutely loved it.My mum; never read a comic in her life, hasn't watched any of the other superhero movies. She loves romantic 'the notebook' type movies, not really into action, comedy or sci-fi at all, and definitely not the comic book movie genre. She loved it, can't wait to see it again.The standouts for me -Margot Robbie absolutely nails it and does tremendous justice to one of my all time favourite characters in fiction. Could now not imagine anyone else in the role of Harley. Exceeded expectations of a live action Harley Quinn, which I've been waiting for for over 20 years for now. Did not disappoint. Harley Solo film ASAP please.Jared Leto is the most true to comics, true to the character version we've had on film - he's awesome. My favourite Joker (well, behind Mark Hamill's animated joker). Looking forward to seeing more of Leto's Joker in future DCEU instalments.The whole cast is great, so I won't go into details about how great they each played their respective characters, but they all knocked it out of the park. Would be happy to see any or all of them turn up in future movies.I'm gonna see Suicide Squad at least twice more in the cinemas, probably more and then buy it on blue ray the day it comes out. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Worried About This Film - And I Was Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I had never heard of the Suicide Squad before this film was announced, but that's not necessarily bad as I had not heard of Guardians of the Galaxy either, and that film was outstanding.I had a bad feeling about this film, so much hype normally means the studio is trying too hard to publicize it to make up for a bad film. But a buddy talked me into going, so I did. I was very disappointed to say the least.Without giving away any spoilers on plot, the characters just do not gel - no charisma between them at all. Margot was the best of the group, but even her character became irritating after a while. I found it hard to root for any of the characters in this film, good guy or bad, as it would not have mattered if every character lived or died. Each character would have a moment that was interesting, then poof, it was gone. Even Leto's performance was a "Wow", then "Meh", then confusing. What a mishmash - no flow or continuity at all.Then there is the special effects. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 90s the CGI was that bad. For an action movie with characters like this, the film gets an overwhelming failing grade on effects.For a popcorn movie, it is not completely horrible - but as a comic book movie in today's world, it was just awful - much worse than Batman v Superman.Rating is a 2/10. For this type of movie, you must have either top notch special effects or a first rate script and this film had neither. The only reason it gets a 2 is that some of the action sequences were decent, but certainly not enough to carry this film.</fullReview>

But then I've came to realise that these are the reviews from fans of DC rival comic-verse. So I request you all to please ignore such reviews.Now coming to the topic, I am a movie enthusiast and would like to share that the movie was very good overall. Tone of the movie was dark, however it also had very good humor added to it (unlike Batman v Superman). The effects were good, the acting, the story-line and the pace with which the story-line went, although for first couple of minutes, the story was rushing a bit, but then it slowed down and started getting "really, really "interesting"!' I would not like to spoil the movie much, but *spoilers alert*, some of the scenes by Joker, Margot Robbie and Will Smith received great applause from the audience, and then obviously there was this Flash scene. I would grade the film, a solid A+ and give out a score of 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

It isn't trying to be the serious like with Man of Steel and Batman versus Superman, the team behind it just work to make it enjoyable and introduce half a dozen characters of the comics and in general it worked! I was nervous for this film and when I came out of the theater I was smiling.To the story after the events of the two previous films Amanda Waller suggest a plan in order to be ready when another superhuman person or event comes in to view : To take some of the most dangerous criminals they have and use them as a special team for this kind of threat. And because they are criminals if the operation goes south they are totally expendable, thus the Suiside Squad is created!So to the characters, they are all of the memorable, even Jai Courtney's, of the Terminator Genisys, character Captain Booomerang was well played! But the girl that stole the show was Harley Quin,brought in the big screen by the great Margo Robbie with her craziness, unpredictability and sexiness oozes from her and I really get fun of her! As for Deathshoot ,Will Smith portrait him better than the guy in Arrow (yes I said it!) and the rest of the team were well cast for their roles and remember at least one of their quotes by each of them. My only issue was Jarec Leto Joker, I didn't really like his suit,his character but over all he was OK. Not awful ,surely not the best and just a OK casting.If I had to compare it with the MCU films it is for me in the same level as Antman, a smaller funnier film,which exist in the same universe with bigger flicks from it. The funny part is that it took convinced fellas in order for Warner Brothers produced a solid film of the DC after the Dark Knight Trilogy (and Green Lantern of 2011 is awful). Now does that mean is an excellent film, no but for the goal it was made, did pretty well and unlike BvS I was trying to find things I didn't like in a flick that was good(!), when in Dawn of Mediocre I tried to think what I did like! Now it is time to analyze why critics hate it ,in my personal opinion and if you disagree no hard feelings. I think that the fact Joker was a secondary character and not the center of the movie, when for months the actions of Mr. Leto were more or less the main subject of debate of the movie ,hurted it significantly, combine that with the look of some of the suits and the mentioned minor editing problems and the previous two films of the same franchise being average at best and you have the perfect storm for critics to hate it!Over all I recommended go see and if you don't like it as much as do, fine just don't be the ass that tries to ruin the fun for the rest of the audience, say simple you didn't dig it and leave to that! For the rest it is two hours of good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacrificed darkness for comedy, and it really softened the bad guys to the point where they all seemed like the good guys.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In a world of flying men and monsters this is the only way to protect the country." After the death of Superman Metropolis is struggling with finding someone who will protect them from the new superhuman threats. When Amanda Walker (Davis) comes up with an idea to offer criminals the chance to join the fight no one is sure this is a good idea, including the unstable cast of villains recruited. When they see what they are up against even Harley Quinn (Robbie) and Deadshot (Smith) find it difficult to say no. I have said for a long time now that I am tiring of comic book movies. I really liked Batman v Superman though because of how dark it was?and with that in mind I thought this could only go darker. When I head about the reshoots to make it funnier I got a little worried, and after watching it I realized my worries were well founded. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, but it tried too hard to be a Marvel movie. By that I mean it sacrificed darkness for comedy, and it really softened the bad guys to the point where they all seemed like they could team up with the Justice League and not have any animosity. To me that hurt the whole idea of the movie. Robbie and Smith were great in this but Leto, to me, was a little disappointing, but that's not his fault. It would be impossible for anyone to follow Heath Ledger. Overall, not a bad movie at all, just a little disappointing. To me the comedy hurt the movie. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first: Jared Leto's supposedly controversial performance as the Joker? Not a big fan. To quote a friend, he's basically playing the role as a tweaker with a violent streak. Leto is OK in this, don't get me wrong, but he is not the reason to see the film. Leto is still a pro and a talented guy, so he's not the reason to skip the film, either. Is the movie worth your time? Well, I was a fan of Ostrander's original Suicide Squad run from the 90's, and for the film includes most of what made that series fun, including Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Boomerang and Killer Croc. And the "new girl" Harley Quinn is pretty much done right also. So if being a fan of those characters is your main motivation to see the film, you'll probably be happy. On the other hand, it's too loud, too long, half the soundtrack choices don't work for me, and this was the wrong "first mission" for the way the original Squad was conceived. Seriously, it's like watching a grimmer version of the original GhostBusters, crossed with Resident Evil. To me, Suicide Squad was always about politics, covert ops, super-villains perishing anonymously and uselessly in far-away lands, and snarky, cynical humor.Good to watch as a popcorn-munching Summer blockbuster to kill an afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved every joke, every nuance. I never read the comics, so I had no fan girl-expectations to be crushed.Right at the top of the awesome that is Suicide Squad, there is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, first introduced in Batman: the Animated Series back in the 90's. Sometimes I can still forget that, relatively speaking, Ms. Quinn is the new kid in the Rogue's Gallery (or one of them).Robbie is beautiful, batty and all bad as Harley, bad in the best possible way. Harley is a BAMF and a total boss, perhaps figuring out how she can exist with the Joker. Or learning that she can exist without him.The nuances of pure madness are perfectly portrayed by Robbie, adding new dimensions to the formerly 2D character and rounds them out into a pure and whole 4D image of a woman who lives in world apart from ours, yet can still feel love and devotion and loyalty, can feel sadness and joy, and even make friends.Yes, Harley was who I loved best in this film, it gets a 10 from me just for that.If you want to know more, watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You be the Judge, but I loved the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would of never watched this movie, but my daughter wanted to do I watched it too. I'm an occasional superhero/comic movie watcher, some of my faves are Spider-Man, Iron man, Thor, X-men, etc. I'm not a comic book reader but I do enjoy the movies. Now as someone who is not a die had comic book reader, as an average person who enjoys good movies, I know what's good to me, what I watched, I really enjoyed this movie. It just grabbed my attention from the very beginning to the very end. I didn't want to close my eyes, didn't want to miss anything. I laughed at the jokes, I was at the edge of my seat when it got intense, and I wanted to know more. Harley Quinn and the Joker were one of my favorite parts of the story. I would just watch the movie, give it a shot and see for yourself if you love or hate the movie. I never listen to anybody's opinion when it comes to movies, food, or books, we all have different likes and dislikes, I don't expect to let anyone make that decision for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Fun Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all every one is entitled to their own opinion and this is mine.I was not that excited for Batman v Superman, the trailers didn't wow me so I was not that surprised when it wasn't that good.The trailer for this film however were amazing and for me the film lived up to the hype.Will Smith and Margot Robbie were perfect in their roles of Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Actors that surprised me were Jay Hernandez as El Diablo (who I haven't seen anything from before), Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang (who is pretty bad in almost everything he is in) and Jared Leto as The Joker.The plot is simple enough, a group of villains are forced to team up and fight a bigger evil. There is great chemistry between all of the actors and they all seem to have a blast at making this film.Although there was not a lot of The Joker I liked the portrayal of him and look forward to seeing him more whether in a sequel or a stand alone Batman film. El Diablo was the biggest surprise for me, knowing nothing about the character he had the biggest arc and became the most sympathetic after hearing his backstory about how he killed his family. Slipknot is a character who is marketed as part of the squad which he barely is, he is just there to die (which was hilarious) to prove that the squad has to do this mission or they to will die.The story is straight forward and the film stands on its own unlike Batman v Superman which crammed in way too many plots and character.All in all I really enjoyed it, it was a fun film and it seems like DC is heading in a good place after a bumpy start and I look forward to seeing these character again and future installments in the DC Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun time at certain times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say that this is definitely a step up from BvS but it would seem that DC just can't get it right ever since the legendary Dark KNight trilogy. BvS had clear issues of trying to fit in way too much story while Suicide squad had really messy editing topped off with a clichéd and poor third act. The best part about the film was by far its characters, because really that's all that Suicide Squad has got. The entire first act consists of a couple of scenes where Amanda Waller talks us through the backstories of each of the characters which seems pretty ridiculous to me and a pretty odd choice. While the last act basically has the clichéd faceless army battle where the main characters fend off hordes of 'faceless people' just as we have seen time and time again.Harley Quinn and Deadshot were pretty good , Deadshot as the leader of the team was given an emotional backstory to make him seem like more of a redeemable character. Harley Quinn as, well Harley Quinn should be it was like she stepped right out of the comics and the Arkham games.Other members of the squad including captain boomerang was quite funny as a sort of comedic relief but that is basically it. El Diablo's backstory was quite intriguing too, as this man who has so much pain and fear of his own powers makes him also quite relatable and sort of down to earth despite being one of the only metahumans on the team. I do feel that Katana id quite underutilized as she has so much more potential instead of just being the crazy woman who talks to her sword?.My biggest problem was with Enchantress, now from the trailer I would've said that Enchantress was the best part. Her transformation between June Moone and the Enchantress couldn't be handled better, it was really cool. However her powers and her as a villain was handled very poorly. For example her summoning this brother person and summoning the faceless legions and all, seems quite pointless and all. There wasn't really a purpose in which this villain is pursuing which makes her pretty meaningless. It is also quite ridiculous how everyone is fighting all around her while she spends more than half of the film wiggling around doing some sort of yoga thing. This whole Enchantress thing and the fact that we never understand the significance of this city that is being destroyed makes the entire film seem pretty pointless. If you think about it what is the point, Enchantress doesn't seem to care really and neither does the Suicide Squad so what is the point really? Another controversy is Jared Leto's Joker, this whole mobster look is quite a creative take on the classic joker, a spin on the great performance that Heath Ledger has gave us but we really didn't get enough of him to make much of a judgment as to how he really did, but I would say that as far as what we got to see he seems pretty good. Overall I think that there are redeeming factors but the storyline is extremely jumpy and messy and the story is quite meaningless and poorly crafted..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie received many unnecessary over the top analysis from critics when in fact it's just a fun time movie. Why do they want to compare it to a serious Nolan movie. Or why not compare it to the Avengers. Almost same plot same villain resulting an expected ending. I suppose the jokes were flat at times but watching Will Smith &amp; Margot in the same scenes was always a blast. They had extremely great chemistry. I'm really looking forward to seeing a sequel or a movie with Deadshot &amp; Quinn. This is not to say that the rest of the cast were bad, but the contrary; they were fantastic. Sadly the script was not that great. On the other hand CGI were good too and the action was spot on. Watch it for fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Harley. She steals every scene she's in. Reviews I've read that said the Joker sucked were wrong, he didn't suck, he just got outshone by Harley. We're used to seeing a Joker who owns every inch of celluloid real estate he comes close to, and that wasn't this guy. In this movie it's Harley in the spotlight. Also I think reviews that said the Joker / Harley relationship was too nice were wrong. There's a scene near the beginning of the movie where she's still Dr. Harleen Quinzel and Joker says he's going to hurt her a lot and then he zaps her brain with electricity and the next thing it cuts to her being Harley and totally insane. It's pretty clear he drove her nuts by hurting her; I don't think it was "too nice" or "not abusive enough to be true to the comics" at all. I mean, how graphic do we really want to see that in a movie with live actors? This was plenty to get the point across. Besides Harley, the two other characters with good character development and an arc are Deadshot and El Diablo. Deadshot, Will Smith's character, is clearly the star. El Diablo is almost a nonentity right up until the bar scene, but then he's great. Since the beginning of the movie had a lot of characters' backstories I get why they held off on this guy's backstory until later. The final strong character is Waller, arguably the real villain, as several other reviews have said. On that point I agree with most of the reviews I've read. Plot? What plot? Just toss the characters on the screen and let them kick ass. It's fun. I think this was the best DC movie so far. They just let the action be action and the characters be themselves and it worked. Yeah, I could wonder why a character like Boomerang who doesn't have any powers is trying to fight alongside mutants, and against mutants, er oh excuse me "metahumans" like whatever DC. Anyway, never mind the why, that's not what this is about. Waller just opened her crayon box of cray and scribbled all over the city, never mind why anyone would think Harley belongs fighting alongside the crocodile from the sewers and fireball guy. Oh, and that fireball stuff: yeah I like. Destroy, destroy, destroy! Burn baby burn! Mwahahahaha! And if it's still twitching Harley can smash it with a baseball bat. The action is fun, even if we have kind of already seen most of those effects before. The creepy bubble head things were different, though. Don't bring along your squeamish friend, but do see it if you like fighting and things being burned down and cool villains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop listening to Rotten Tomatoes!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the DC Comic, the government gives a team of supervillains a chance at redemption. The catch: their mission will probably kill them all. With a 20 days delay i finally saw Suicide Squad and as i expected it i loved the movie. Now Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice had 2 or 3 little problems but it was nowhere near as bad as some people made it out to be and that comes from someone that went 2 times in theaters and saw the film then saw it 2 more times on DVD and just to let you know i also saw the Ultimate Edition and i loved it even more now this 3rd installment of the DCEU is the most different one since it brings more laughs that they're actually funny (cough Civil War cough) the cast did an amazing job Will Smith gives one of his best performances as Deadshot since 2012 Men in Black 3, Margot Robbie was great both as being hot as hell and being crazy and she is 100% Harley Queen from the Animated Series as for Jared Leto? He was amazing the man took the best of both Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger and owned the part because he is different is a 2016 Joker not a 1989 or a 2008 one just respect the past and embrace the future now the rest of the supporting cast did an amazing job as well Jai Courtney, Viola Davis was creepy as hell she is basically Amanda Waller, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje, Cara Delevingne was nowhere near as bad as some people said and yes the final battle does look like Fan4stic but it has an epic soundtrack and awesome slow motion action moments and Joel Kinnaman was also great. This movie made me care about a bunch of villains that they are insane and a soldier that loves a girl which turns into a Witch. Now let's talk about cameos as you all know Ben Affleck is in this film and he continues being the best live action Batman of all time and Ezra Miller appears as Flash which is not a spoiler actually cause many websites spoiled it already and well the man was really good way better than his BVS cameo. Although the biggest problem i had was that in the beginning i felt that Joker and Harley came out as forced but they truly weren't that was also in my head cause my experience was kinda painful because of a bunch of annoying people behind me kicking my seat and laughing in weird parts such as when El Diablo talks about his kids and his wife. I do understand about this whole edited part where they cut many of the Joker's lines such as "I can't wait to show you my toys" or "Bye Bye" but honestly he wasn't the main guy to begin with it's time for the critics and fans to stop all this hate against the DCEU both this, BVS, X-Men Apocalypse and Deadpool were 5 times better than Civil War which was an overrated mess in my opinion i love both Marvel and DC but i won't defend every movie they make Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy was great but move on this is straight outta the comics people and not a dude that has throat cancer. Also don't blame Snyder or Ayer blame Warner Bros for cutting out half of the great parts from their own movies and please don't trust Rotten Tomatoes i mean they gave a 73% on Ghostbusters that was enough. Suicide Squad is definitely worth your money if you haven't seen it if you loved the previous 2 movies you will love this one too if you hate the DC Extended Universe well just wait for Civil War to come out on Blu-Ray and DVD i give Suicide Squad a 10 out of 10 we're bad guys it's what we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing more than once!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer before Deadpool back in February, I had high hopes for Suicide Squad, since DC films have needed their dose of energy and variety lately, with no humor and not a lot of compelling storytelling. The actual movie itself, however, did that and more- while watching this movie, I tried to find any flaws, but I didn't find anything that I disliked. Everything hits the right notes- the amazingly vintage song choices the trailers promised, the increased number of jokes, the cameos, the character development, the action sequences, the performances- the list goes on and on. One thing that needs to be addressed- Suicide Squad is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, I laughed out loud more times in a theater than any movie I've seen this year- even the audience was cracking up, too! The action sequences are infinitely fantastic- I watched this movie both in standard 2D and 3D with IMAX, and the movie looks great in either format that can be chosen. I loved this movie so much, I'm already seeing it a third time with one of my best friends, and I barely see a movie more than once in the theater! Don't listen to all the haters on the Internet- it's what you want to watch, not what others instruct you to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one factor that saves this movie is the actual Suicide Squad itself. When I heard that they were doing reshoots for this movie, I became worried, because we've seen how studio intervention can screw up a film before (fan4stic!). It shows, because so much of the movie feels disjointed, and rushed. The script does feel like it was written in 6 weeks, and from David Ayer, who directed Fury, a near perfect movie, I expected so much better. I still don't believe that it is his fault, it is WB and their sickening need to water down movies based on brilliant source material into toothless pg13 generic action movies in order to appeal to a wider audience and get more money. I only liked this movie because of the cast performances and the team dynamic (and JL cameos), and THAT WAS IT. After BvS (Ultimate Edition), despite loving that movie, I was expecting a far better movie that would exceed my high expectations, and I got... meh.Cons:- Main villain: In a movie where the traditional bad guys are now the protagonists, the villain should equivalent to a worst nightmare. What we got was some weird witch who we found out had a brother and they wanted to make a hole in the sky and take over the world and... ugh, such a lazy and uninteresting character. This wasn't Cara Delevigne's fault, most of her voice was dubbed over and she's actually not a bad actress.- The story: Stupid. Amanda Waller creates a team of villains to fight terrorist threats, and then one of the team members ends up becoming the threat? Amanda Waller is meant to be incredibly smart, so how did she allow this to happen. Also, it was explained that Enchantress would die if her heart was stabbed and when Amanda stabs it, she doesn't die? What? Also, her plan to cover up the giant beam in the sky attack was to blame it on the Suicide Squad? Who's going to buy that Deadshot created that, or Harley Quinn, or Croc, or any person other than the Enchantress that half a room of intelligence officers saw, and would probably link to the hole in the sky? Also, the Squad's mission is just to rescue Waller? Which wasn't really made clear at all to me until after the movie when I had to read Wikipedia to work out why they just left Enchantress in the city to destroy everything after they got Waller back, I thought their mission from the start was to take Enchantress down? Goddamnit this movie had the chance to give us one of the most awesome plots ever, a bunch of bad guys taking on an almost unstoppable threat, and they just get a stupid rescue mission, there were no stakes, it was boring, why did they only give Ayer 6 weeks to write this? If they had made the Joker the main villain, and they had to go up against a plan of his, that would have been cool.- The Joker: I thought he had a great look, and the lines in the trailer already had me excited to see a live action Joker that I would be freaked out by and also more faithful to the source material than I had ever seen from a DC movie... still waiting, because he was hardly in it at all, and I feel just as angry as he is that half his scenes were just left out. How can more Joker in a movie be a bad thing? Leto put some real effort in, at least show us if it was worth it! I liked what I saw, but can't really make a judgement, because I didn't see enough to judge. I've seen people saying that Leto could have put on a performance as good as Ledger's, given that we were amazed by Ledger's joker in the space of a minute after he was first introduced, but I still don't think that's true. Ledger got to say so much in that minute, and to give us that 'how about a magic trick' moment that we still love, and said so much about the character in the space of a few seconds. Leto gets to say hardly anything or do anything meaningful, so no amount of acting skill could have done what Ledger did, Leto needs a 'why so serious' moment of his own to show us if he is a good Joker or not.- Diablo dying: he was interesting, so why?- Joker and Harley's relationship: In the comics, Joker uses Harley, like a tool, for his own ends and amusement. There is so much interesting psychological depth to this relationship, in terms of how screwed up it is, and it, like everything else, was watered down and rushed, so that the general audience wouldn't be too upset at - A FAITHFUL ADAPTATION OF SOURCE MATERIAL? All we got was Joker missing his girlfriend, which didn't make it a memorable relationship, and didn't make the DCEU joker stand out at all, because this abusive relationship is part of what makes these two character stick with you. The one thing that saves this movie, and gets it to 7 stars is the actual squad. I would love to see them again, just in a better movie. This one was lazy, with jokes that fell flat, and a painful lack of meaningful storyline. That one scene with Deadshot taking on Enchantress's army by himself (yeah you know) was one of my favorite movie scenes of the year. You can tell the studios at least let Ayer direct that. I don't buy that the theatrical cut is his cut for a second. The man just wants to keep his job, and I only hope that he gets to make Suicide Squad 2, and to actually direct it on his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, not bad, just the beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there is too much hate on this movie, because Will Smith is in it... and since a few years people has been saying his career is over, people who don't like him will simply down play everything he does (how can somebody be over when just a year ago played that amazing Concussion movie)... well they are wrong.This movie overall isn't great, and seems to be along the lines of Bat vs. Super Man... Complicated script (Suicide Squad - is less but is still a little all over the place), and too much fantasy, but is meant to be fantastic... but again that is the DC universe for those who know it... I would say the script could have been simplified (5.5/10).The effects - This is one area that nowadays if you miss, then you will miss the whole movie, example last fantastic 4... This one doesn't miss with special effects, but at times it seems to try to accomplish too much (6.5/10) Character Chemistry - I have read some reviews on this and I think most people missed - there is not a lot of interaction between characters so, there wouldn't be much chemistry too, but - there is one that definitely misses the mark in my view - Joker and Harley - in my opinion it simply didn't click, I couldn't have the tiniest feel for Harley Queen been really in love by the joker and the opposite... everything else the characters do play their part individually as needed... Will Smith and the daughter - are some touching moments. For this reason I don't think this is to be rated... this is not meant to be a drama is a fantasy action comic based movie. It is meant to be fantastic not Oscar worthy acting. The same applies for the acting - individually they act as needed and play well their parts - obviously some get more screen acting time based on the character they play and I think that is normal and expected.Batman - good cameos.Amanda Waller - The acting wasn't bad, but I just think she didn't portray the cold person people are saying... but still good.Boomerang - small parts but nicely done, funny, gives a light touch to everything.Diablo - I think he had a decent acting, didn't quite like the scene where he fully transformed, but still OK. The director misses with him on the parts he is on screen, I think the shots didn't value his true power - the jail scene is stronger than the one in the building when he finally unleashes himself.Crock - Good voice work, and fine to do what he needed to do on screen.Enchantress - probably the best costume and nicely done when she was still the "dirty Enchantress". The final version didn't impress as much.Katana - Simple and reliable performance.Harley ? I individually simply great. Funny and light, when alone and thinking about joker very sincere, I just think the scenes with Joker didn't work out perfectly.Joker - I would say the same as above for Harley. And people need to stop continuing comparing Jokers, if the late great Heath Ledger hadn't played a Joker role, this would have been the best so far. Without Harley he did a good job as Joker.Rick Flag - just great, true emotion display about his beloved witch, true grit as a soldier, true human when needed, I think he was great.Deadshot - when the first trailers come out, do you remember it seems that Harley was going to be the number 1 character? Well they decided to have Deadshot as the number 1, and I think they did great. I think he rivals with Rick Flag and Diablo for both had the most interesting back stories to hold on too and bring drama. But they benefit exactly of that, every other characters didn't quite had anything to hold on to if needed to showcase emotion, and Will Play it well, he does a good job as the father, and does even better - and this is when I think people can be unfair - as the action hero... the first encounter with the monsters, man, if you didn't become trilled with him on top of that car shooting like if he was possessed by some gun machine devil, then you are probably trying to be movie expert or simply you're just not seen it without prejudice... I think he acted fine, just like any other action hero needed too, but he still was able to bring the drama, and honestly the bonding elements to the movie...Overall the acting - 6.5/10 Directing - this is what was almost ruining this movie... 1. The script as I said above 2. The pace - it gets too quickly on it but the opposite could have ruined it too (Bat vs. Super Man for example). But here the quick pace is too visible and really almost ruins the movie. 3. Characters On screen time - I think the director shouldn't try to do (in case he did) as Marvel's everybody gets their "moment"... this for the DC universe isn't going to work fine, and certainly didn't work here.. 4. Villains - too weak, really bad. 5. Villains vs. Suicide Squad - the villains almost posed no threat; the fight scenes seemed more rehearse scenes.Overall, I think he tries to achieve a too big of something... Is fun to watch for the Squad itself and if you understand this is action movie and you're not heading to the theater to see "the pursuit of happiness". So I hope they will be down for a second Squad, but need to rethink the directing. It is worth watching 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disappointing, but still entertaining summer feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the 2015 Comic Con trailer of Suicide Squad, which included the Bee Gees song I Started a Joke, I thought that this is going to be an excellent blockbuster DC film. After I heard the reviews about it, my expectations fell down to a very low level. The fact, that David Ayer (Fury, Sabotage) is in the director's chair, and Zack Snyder's (Batman v Superman, 300, Watchmen) participation as an executive producer also worried me. I doesn't like his movies movies, especially not 300, which I think a highly overrated history film, compared to Ridley Scott's Gladiator and Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. I watched Suicide Squad in IMAX3D just a few hours ago. Let's start with the few good things. Overall, the movie is entertaining, and you not getting bored for even a minute. The visual effects and the soundtrack are amazing. Margot Robbie acts very well as Harley Quinn, except her fantasies, that are completely not matching with the plot. Viola Davies also pretty good as 'the Boss'. There are plenty huge mistakes in this film. The script is a hilarious mess. The characters are extremely underdeveloped, but what should we expected if all of them one by one would need a single movie? The direction and the visual style of this film are extremely awful. It can be clearly seen that David Ayer was a marine, just look for the precisely shot helicopter landing and departing. The actors are very bad, except the two of them which I mentioned above. Jared Leto is one of the most talented actors (watch Requiem for a Dream or Dallas Buyers Club), but his Joker is a disaster, if you saw the performances given by Heath Ledger in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) and by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's Batman (1989). The other actors also didn't brought even the minimum for their unwritten characters, especially Will Smith. The DC's cinematic universe is heading down in a very wrong way, and it's sad that they can't see this in the studio. I really hope that 2017's Wonder Woman and Justice League Part 1 (featuring Zack Snyder as the director) will be much better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. If you saw Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy or you had enough form the last three years DC movies you better avoid this picture. If you just want to a watch a summer action comic book movie, than you can give it a try, but don't expect a marvellous story telling or such an artistic director's vision than in The Dark Knight Trilogy. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunate disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was one of the most anticipated titles of 2016 and as most of people, I had high expectations. I knew that Jared Leto wouldn't disappoint as Joker, nevertheless, I was disappointed. Not because of Leto, but for the editing / cutting. Joker was a mild character that didn't really have any impact on me. Hopefully an R- rated movie of Joker (&amp; Harley) will come out.. and I hope he has a big role on the upcoming Justice League and untitled Batman movie.Suicide Squad was mostly dialogue and some arguing between Deadshot (Will Smith) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). Action and fighting was uninteresting. Character development and initializing was nothing to remember. There were virtually no heavy/emotional scenes that would hit you. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was good, but again, it should have been something more.I am pretty sure David Ayer and the producing team could have done better. I am also fairly confident that the studio backed out and wanted to tone down the violence, gore and dark tone of the movie. I so wanted to love this movie, but now with the thin plot combined with buddy-team-western style of setup and PG-13 rating, this movie failed in the eyes of the fans. I am fairly confident that the BvS success (or failure) defined what they wanted out of this movie. BvS was too dark and hard to chew for most of the people, at least if you have no background knowledge of the DC universe. This is why they made Suicide Squad easier to the public, thus failing this film, damn. Of course there were some enjoyable moments and at least a directors cut version could fill out some of the holes. Overall I am happy that DC is trying to expand the universe more and more and bring out some lesser known characters alive. Suggestion: studio and marketing people, stay away from the artistic process and trust your people. This is why Deadpool succeeded. You don't have to compete with Marvel &amp; Avengers. Let them have the light-hearted buddy-western style, it suits them perfectly. Can't imagine Ayer being at the premiere going "aw yiss, this is exactly what I wanted out of this movie!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am greatly impressed by this movie it was great although some deleted scenes were a bit of a disappointment. It seemed Margot Robbie didn't like her costume but it did make the character look that perfect for the joker, the combination of the film was amazing but for the funding the movie was a bit of a waste. The story line was short and had lesser meaning, and most of it wasn't as nice as the comics. Although this movie had great actors and i enjoyed it, it could use a couple of improvements and add back some of those deleted scenes. Altogether i would give this film 8/10 stars This was a great film to watch with a older audience of maybe pg 13+ and the story line could have been improved compared to the budget spent on the movie. I believe the reviews of this film are wrong and misleading compared tot he effort and great story that has been put into work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a DC fan I liked the movie. I've read the Suicide Squad comics and it pretty much follows the same story line for gathering villains to combat other villains. I like origin stories and getting to know characters so I appreciated that they did this. There is enough action in the movie as well as a bit of romance (between the Joker and Harley). Although, they did downplay the abusiveness of the Joker (probably to appease Joker and Harley shippers). I think Enchantress is a good female villain. It's the usual bad guy wants to destroy the world theme, but that's just to be expected. The soundtrack made the movie, there's a lot of good songs in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Bad Guy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK folks, I don't see what everyone is complaining about I thought Suicide Squad was excellent. The beginning of the movie with most of the backstories was played out very well and was written well. It was awesome getting to know the key players that we'd be falling in love with if it's possible to fall in love with bad guys which since I did it is! I especially love Harley she was a source of humor throughout the movie but don't let her out of your sight just yet she's in trouble ten times over but she handles herself with ladylike grace and some punk Kick butt in the middle. I liked Will Smith's interpretation of Deadshot, you knew why he was taking part in this suicide mission and he really turned out to be the leader we expected him to be. As for Jared Leto's Joker, I don't know why he was complaining or saying that he was fooled into making this movie. He was the complete package makeup and all lipstick fetish notwithstanding. While he had a small part in the film there are no small parts, his "death" was what gave Harley her turn into a good guy, not that she wasn't always., She seemed to play as the heart of the suicide squad. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje did a hell of a job as killer croc I loved the Cajun accent he had going on and really did the character a lot of justice. This whole film was an excellent and fun ride and I'd highly recommend it five stars! I love the bad guys and it made me so happy to see these bad guys kicking butt and possibly taking names.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit when I first heard the reviews for this movie they were pretty dire but when I watched it myself I really do not see what was so bad about it. The action was perfectly fine, character development was unique and the humour and romance was kept to a substantial level. The only things I would complain about and is probably the reason so many people rated this movie low is that the Joker was hardly there. He was pretty useless to the plot which was disappointing. Also it was a bit too supernatural for an action movie I felt and rather awkward to watch for religious people. However all in all it was a brilliant film which deserves an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw all the bad reviews online, I was afraid I would be disappointed by the movie, but I had a pleasant surprise: none of the bad reviews were accurate, at least from my point of view. I found the movie quite different from the other DC films, and in a good way. They tried something new and nailed it. The beginning may let you think it was going to be messy, but not at all. Margot Robbie was amazing as Harley Quinn. The interpretation of the joker, though it was slightly different from the comics, was aced by Jared Leto. No characters were the same and all had depth, which was something I really liked. And of course, the plot was great. It's mostly an action movie though, so don't go there expecting a lot of side stuff, for example don't think that the relationship between the characters will be extremely developed, for it isn't the theme of the movie. My advice is not to take the bad reviews under consideration and watch Suicide Squad so as to build your own opinion, whatever it may be :) Hopefully we'll get to see Task Force X in future films.</fullReview>

They way the characters are introduced really tells a lot about them. Harley Quinn was by far the best character as Margot Robbie plays her well. Also boomerang was pretty funny too, and the actor also played him well. Cara Delavigne was great at playing enchantress although thats the only part i didn't like. I expected enchantress to be part of the squad instead of being the main villain. It was pretty stupid to have her dancing around the tornado.

		<shortDescription>Tentamen Suicidii*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Latin for a suicide attempt. It is often referred to as a failed suicide attempt or nonfatal suicide attempt. A secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency.Nevermind Deadpool: Suicide Squad is the bad boy of superhero movies. Defined as "F****** insane" in promotional interviews. it's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice's nasty little brother. On paper, Suicide Squad was summer's last best hopes. Its premise was interesting to anyone who's ever found Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader more interesting than Clarice Starling or Luke Skywalker. Intended as an antidote to the rest of the DC Cinematic Universe. If Marvel has the best superheroes, so the prevailing geek logic goes, then DC must have the coolest villains. How ironic then, that a superhero story determined to celebrate the genre's villains should feature the worst villain that the genre has ever seen. Director/writer David Ayer opens the film by attempting to compress origins stories, unique abilities and how they were captured for nine different characters into the film's overload first act. Blasting Hip-Hop songs to show how gangsta they are. In fact, each character is introduced with an instantly recognisable song, helping to ground these super freaks in the world as we know it. While also confirming suspicions that the movie is DC's answer to Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy. Amanda Waller starring Viola Davis, whose self-interest eventually poses the film's only provocative moral dilemma, is going to use those villains: she's going to use fire to fight fire and she's going to get burned. Every character is missing someone. Deadshot misses his daughter, El Diablo misses his wife and Rick Flag his girlfriend. Beside that there's Cara Delevingne's Enchantress, a humanoid crocodile who doesn't contribute much to the team and my old friend Jay Courtney: a dumb Australian guy who contributes even less to the team. And THEN, there's Dr. Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn aka Margot Robbie, who is sexualised as hell and a caricature of male fetishism. Plus, she's "potentially" a poor representation of psychological abuse. Though I loved her character. Moreover, Will Smith hopefully has been given good characterisation within small but thorough lines and some touches of humanity, just like Harley Quinn underneath her unhinged insanity. Will Smith charisma and wit unable him to throw one-liners like no one else, giving the movie a comic aspect without it turning into full mode comedy. This is not the Joker's film we were all waiting for. But must surely be a taste of things to come in future sequels. Attempting to honour the history of the character without stepping on Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson's toes, Jared Leto creates a surprisingly sensual Joker. He's part gangster, part clown, but nor really part of the movie unfortunately. His character is reduced to a long cameo of some sort. Giving the audience a feeling of second movie within the movie they're currently watching. The brief Batman's appearances are awesome, Ben Affleck is amazing as Batman and I can't wait to see this man again in new Batman features. Blame it on Batman, but the DCCU has gotten awfully dark in recent years, especially compared with the candy-coloured party they're having over at Marvel. Finally critics often complain that overcrowded comic-book movies don't devote enough energy to psychology or performances, focusing instead on action and big CGI set-pieces. But Suicide Squad strays in the opposite extreme. Though this film is full of fancy action sequences in which our anti-heroes fight off a bunch of anonymous CG baddies (like the Avengers) while exchanging witty one-liner (just like the Avengers) and using their various abilities to emerge victorious without breaking a sweat (like, guess who? the AVENGERS!). I don't really like to trash a movie and you know that but certain aspect of the second and third acts reminded me of Fantastic Four, yes, it is that messy. Overall, Suicide Squad flips the script around and forces the audience to root for the bad guys. But is this enough? Clearly: NO. This film is not half as badass as you wanted it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure why people hate this, maybe the bandwagon effect? But I know my friends and I loved it and so did my BF (saw it twice) but I do agree the plot was lacking and they could of used more joker scenes because I'm a long time fan of Jared Leto and his arts especially his music, which by the way he did fantastic as the joker! All fan-girl comments aside I still think the movie deserves a better rating due to the casting, art, acting, action, and even the effects and character development throughout the film. OK, to fill the minimum I noticed a few "Goofs" during the last quarter of the film that where small but still fun to see on the big screen, not sure if that counts as a spoiler but it involves the way a phone is being held. I might just end up marking this as spoiler just in case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep pace with this swirling storytelling while cool in a theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gonna catch Suicide Squad? Consider bringing ear plugs. Don't attempt an understanding of all the subplots. Keep your 'suspension of disbelief' intact throughout (there are also some non-comic book elements).Early in the flick I thrilled to the styling-black hat Will Smith wore - - because it made me hear Agent J saying "I make this look good," in my ears. The opening tune reminded me how badly I attempted to sing HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN in a high school talent show, but the song works perfectly here.Licensing usage of The Stone's classic hit, SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, was brilliant. Used when Harley fabulously performs a bachelor-party routine in her cell, these lines are her persona deliciously defined: "But what's puzzling you - Is the nature of my game." The plot twists began arriving like an intense meteor shower. No Joker can have a love-hate relationship as a loner. Ours saves Harley from the vat of 'whatever', when he realizes he needs a female foil; two antagonists beat (or are stronger) than one in any, um, card game. When Amanda confesses to being the cat that ate the canary, she's not kidding: she's a great keeper of secrets.Deadshot's references to Phil Jackson will remain mysterious to many. If you're not an NBA fan, it might be better to quickly focus elsewhere. Cara Delevingne wonderfully brought to life the 'Enchantress' role. Karen Fukuhara has lots of acting offers coming her way. Cast and crew alike, performed a number of miracles to bring this work to the screen. With luck, they'll all further sustain their careers due to their involvement in the project.Be prepared for a LOUD final sequence. I know what approximates a 110 dB sound level (and have unfortunately proved this numerous times). In our theater, the sound pressure level reached at least 120 decibels. Protect your hearing and enjoy as much of this meandering summer fare as you can. Technically, it's quite a ride with some enjoyable high-points.</fullReview>

Ultimately he has failed the character almost as bad as Ben afleck fails batman. The plot is poorly constructed and editing is mistimed. Yes we get it will smith is a family favourite hero but don't change the characters bio to suit that. It turned the movie into a will smith fan film. If you've seen the clips/ trailers you've seen the best of this film.

		<fullReview>You will like every single member of the Squad, with Harley (obviously) stealing the show. She's a star and everyone will love her. This is the type of movie that demands a sequel. I'm sure critics will find ways to hate it (it's basically a gritty action movie with comic book characters and a Hot Topic aesthetic, which honestly might turn critics off), but DC fans will like it. The BIG thing is that the movie literally saves DCEU Batman. This Batman is BTAS personified.Deadshot is the movie's emotional heart, and it's Smith's best role in years ? he gets to showcase some of Concussion's deep emotion but with that old Independence Day swagger. Jay Hernandez similarly impresses as El Diablo, a fiery L.A. gang leader with a horrific backstory.Harley, a psychiatrist turned unhinged moll with an undying love for the Joker (Jared Leto), is finally Robbie's star-making turn. And Leto's weirdo take on the Clown Prince of Crime is a far cry from the late Heath Ledger, though it definitely works. A tattooed Tony Montana type, this Joker is a nightclub owner with a thing for bling and a psychopathic determination to find his main squeeze. His relatively brief screen time leaves you wanting more, and Leto and Robbie make a distinctly dynamic duo in their fleeting scenes together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd give it a C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a house (or asylum) in New Orleans where some of the most notorious DC Comic villains reside. They call it Arkham Asylum. Maybe you're familiar with it. The film opens with a glimpse into the daily lives of imprisonment for the most marketable members of the cast, Deadshot played by Will Smith and Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie. Deadshot stands in his cell undoubtedly wondering where he went wrong with his life while Harley Quinn begins her descent into constant flirtatious death threats. These are two of the members of the Suicide Squad who the movie chooses to focus on the most; while I thought they had interesting backstories, I wish that the rest of the squad had gotten expanded instead of compacted.Suicide Squad is under the impression that this is a story-driven movie. But when the characters are cut down to make room so that a complicated, unexplained plot can commence, it leaves a comics-ignorant viewer (such as myself) pleading ever-so-slightly to care about what happens to the characters. I cannot speak for the viewers who attended this movie as DC comics fans, but I heard some laughter in the audience of the screening I attended so maybe this film plays out like an inside joke I wasn't in on.After we get our introduction to Will Smith and Margot Robbie, the plot commences when Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, also known for her work in Doubt and The Help) meets up with who I'm assuming are government officials to tell them about the other members of the Suicide Squad. Davis speaks about how Superman's death is a tragedy of unpredictable proportions. Not only does his loss leave a hole in the heart of the good people of Metropolis, but this means that the next Superman could be the ultimate weapon. As one military official puts it, "if Superman had decided to fly down, rip off the roof of the White House, and grab the president right out of the Oval Office, who would have stopped him?". Could this kind of behavior be the product of the next Superman's ideals? Our main characters aren't sure, but they know they need to take precautions against that now. "This is World War Three" as Amanda Waller puts it. So who better to call than our main anti-heroes? Probably Batman since he is responsible for rounding half of them up and he competed against Superman in Batman vs. Superman. Or maybe Wonder Woman because she is Superman's female equivalent. Or Aquaman even if he is useless on land. But this isn't a movie about them, this is a movie about the some of the most powerful villains in the DC Comic Universe. That is who the audience paid to see.And for a film made specifically to center around these delightfully devious people (or in one case, creature), I surprisingly did not learn a great deal about them. We saw how Deadshot and Harley Quinn fought and interacted with everyone else, we got brief backstories on each of the others, and we even got the Enchantress who became a villain because of Amanda Waller's task at hand to get the Suicide Squad together. There were fights and plot-points galore, but why would I care about these ultimately confusing plot-points that hop out of nowhere when I have great characters who I'm dying to know more about? I'm not asking for Christopher Nolan type exposition, but more than I received.Let me put it this way. Of the year 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy was one of my favorite movies. Why? Because the story was everyone wants a purple orb and it's up to our heroes to make sure that none of the villains obtain it. This simple plot line enabled the movie to focus on Peter Quill and Gamora's lost childhoods, Rocket's sense of humor and sadness that he is not entirely connected to any species, Drax's inability to pick up on metaphors, and even Groot's optimism and willingness to help. Suicide Squad briefly focused on the main characters but then hurried in an unnecessarily all-over-the-place story. One of the characters became a villain trying to destroy the world, Rick Flagg was ordered to keep secrets from the squad for unknown reasons, the impending "World War Three" was never explained but was the main point propelling the movie, a subplot about having to save Amanda Waller and her crew, and a subplot about the Joker trying to break Harley out of the prison.Now, does any of what I said above mean that the film was bad? Not at all. I loved watching the characters and learning what I could about them, the visuals were the right amount of DC universe-dark, the fight sequences were decent, the soundtrack was perfect, and it even gave us Jared Leto as the Joker who, in my humble and nonofficial opinion, gave a better, more unsettling performance than Heath Ledger did. I'm glad I saw this film and believe it deserves a 75% score. All I can say is I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel.PS: Rotten Tomatoes? I want to ask you something personally. You gave a genuinely entertaining film like Suicide Squad a 26% score, yet gave Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates 38%? Is someone paying your critics to dislike DC Comic movies? Or were you drunk while watching Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates and therefore much more forgiving? I don't get you sometimes?

David Ayer wanted to make a good movie and Warner Bros. didn't order Joker scenes to be cut, David Ayer did. These reports about expensive reshoots and alternative cuts are wrong. The difference between the released version and the original are the small amount of reshoots and they have 20-25 minutes of deleted scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer it actually looked like it would have been a very popular movie with kids and teens loving the idea of what it's like in there favorite Gotham hero's villains perspective, but after I watched the trailer and the film did some research on the movie and found out that not everyone found the movie appealing or that it was bad because they had to cut the film short, but that's really not there fault, originally nothing was supposed to be cut and it was only cut down short due to (i can't remember who) someone who wanted the film to be released right on time, and while that was happening, sadly not all the takes were shown, which to my view seems as if you guys think it's bad. Nothing was ever supposed to be cut, and being there some flashbacks actually seems cool so that for those watchers who don't know anything about the character can understand what that character is going through.Maybe it would have been better if Jared's parts were also shown. I think this movie was honestly great, funny, action packed and had the best story line ever! And I should know about story lines, I'm a writer after all.Don't get mad for what you can't see and let others enjoy what you couldn't.Who knows maybe sometime soon there could even be a movie plotting the story line of Harley Quinn and the Joker, which would be a fun idea of what they've been going through.This movie was indeed good, I just don't see how anyone can make a bad statement on a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing adaptation from comics to cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Suicide Squad in theaters, I was very satisfied with the movie &amp; little to complain about. And despite having everyone I know completely hating the movie for lack of plot and character development, I personally felt the opposite of what they did. I'm a huge DC comics fan and I felt that the movie was everything I hoped for. I admit walking into the movie with low expectations, but the movie still blew me away. The movies villain was unique and added a nice touch to the movie. ALL of the characters (even Captain Boomerang) were adapted perfectly into the film as well. The movie itself made me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's VERY DISAPPOINTING to see how many fans and critics outright hated the film. I know that everyone has their own opinion, but I don't feel that everyone gave the movie a fair chance after the somewhat of a disappointment that Batman v. Superman was. In short, I found the movie was incredible and I loved almost everything about it. My only complain with the film is that Killer Croc should have been replaced with King Shark (a much better animal based DC character).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a kind of sequel to superman vs batman Suicide Squad is jam-packed with action, star power and mayhem, with director David ayer who likes his gritty action films like training day and fury he combines his film into 2h 3mins Min's of frenetic | Action, Adventure, Comedy so we see this is a follow up to batman vs superman the world thinks superman is dead and the world powers believe this and there worried who might take his place with meta humans getting powerful they wonder who they can turn to or control so they wont run so we see the government agents putting together a team and we get to see backstories of all the main characters like a brilliant on form and comical but has a heart but turned bad Will Smith ... Deadshot Will Smith portrays Deadshot and the costume for the character and all of his weapons will have written on them the phrase "I am the Light, the Way", an obvious reference to Jesus. his daughter is his heart but this plays on his mind with Bruce Wayne's batman having a vital cameo appearance getting to grips with two characters he might be able to control he batman is doing a tony stark for the justice league we have jokers girlfriend on the side Margot Robbie ... Harley Quinn and her trusty baseball bat she is creepy just like the joker played by Jared leto he gets a cameo he uses his skills to mess her mind up in arkam but I like to see him more as pops up from time to time keeping up with his gal we have katana the samurai lady who is on kill orders for these bad guys she is bad ass.we have the rest of the motley crue story Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ...and of them diablo character and boomerang are cool character with their fiery stories and their tech gear to kill Killer Croc Jay Hernandez playing a laid back character.. Diablo he gets his role down to tee because his character is fiery but learned to control but it takes a pivotal moment for him breath fire back into life just in the nick of time saving the crew we also get the flash cameo looking forward to seeing his film Ezra Miller ... The Flash Jai Courtney ... Boomerang Common ... Monster TAdam Beach ... Slipknot all these character get great songs on the soundtrack to the film during the action with the head played Viola Davis her character takes no crap Amanda Waller from any one asking her superiors to support her so we see the explorer Cara delevigne character June Moore/enchantress going cave hunting only to discover the wrong cave and accidentally gets taking over by a witch so fast forward to the story were she can shape shift and fly anywhere with getting caught so with but Amanda Waller has enchantress under control with a heart in the box so she has her on a tight leash so with the group together the army has Scott Eastwood .playing.. Lieutenant GQ Edwards and Joel Kinnaman ... Rick Flag who plays the head of this rag bag team of mist fits with him in the lead the suicide squads find out their mission as there is a giant terrorizing midway city so they leave from there jail in bel reve and seeing them on the chopper as Alain Chanoine ... Businessman / Incubus this incubus is in cahoots with enchantress so as the team comes under attack the action begins as all hell brakes loose the team don't want to be there but haven't got a choice so as enchantress has a team of weird baddies between them and the mysterious lighting object they have to battle themselves keep rick flag alive and deal with Harley Quinn absconding with her boy and her craziness and a sniper shot to kill but dead shot as he say he never misses but unfortunately her chopper goes down not knowing is this a ploy who knows fool them as well along with great special effects rick flag has his issues with enchantress to so this weird film is just punk enjoy Worst. Heroes. Ever Mid-credits scene: Bruce Wayne has dinner with Amanda Waller, offering her his protection in exchange for one of her top secret folders on meta humans enchantress has her chance also with an evil monster that she created in toe but fighting with the squad diablo uses all his fiery arsenal going to for toe visually this is just about matching the tall monster but his friends have an ace up there sleeveThe acting was more than I expected out of this movie. In terms of acting, I'll go in order of my top 3: Robbie, Leto, and Smith. All of their portrayals are excellent. El Diablo is a nice surprise, his character made us feel for him, maybe even more-so than the top stars. Leto knocks it out of the park. As a Ledger fanboy, I was dreading his performance, but his character was amazing down to the slightest movement. No amount of dialogue is wasted nor any simple movement is wasted. Overall, the movie was great, again, some awkward script, but the action scenes are done extremely well and the acting is great. 8/10.just below the great Batman v Superman in my opinion but its set it up nicely for a sequel and the rest of the justice league</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction for DC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't give half rating on IMDb, but for all intense purposes I give this movie a 7.5/10. It's not perfect, the script is pretty standard for an "anti-hero" film (though the dialogue is spot on), the overall plot is fairly generic, and as far as the story telling goes, things are choppy. The plot moves quickly, so if you step out for a second you're likely to miss something. But it is funny, and has great visuals. The effects used for the Enchantress are some of my favorites. The comedy snuck in is in good taste and well timed. It's not like Deadpool, where it's all about the laughs and watching the titular character shoot people (not dumping on Deadpool, I really enjoyed that movie). SS is more like a humorous version of the Avengers. You've got the powerhouse (Diablo), the two conflicting leaders (Rick Flag and Deadshot), the femme fatale (Katana), the muscle (Killer Croc), the seemingly useless one (Boomerang), and then there's the wild card in Harley Quinn. The characters backstories are kind of thrown at you very bluntly, but overall the writers did a decent job on each. Would really be interested in seeing more from Boomerang and Katana in the future. Acting is top notch, Will Smith leads a great cast and gives a solid performance as Deadshot. The real scene stealers are Jared Leto and Margot Robbie, whose chemistry as the Joker and H.Q are superb. I'm hoping they go through with the Harley spin off and include more of the Joker/Harley story (throw in Poison Ivy and I'm sold) All in all, this is a good movie. Not perfect, not terrible, and not to be missed. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. It's not nearly as "bad" as all the critics say it is. It stays true enough to the comics, and the cameos from Batman and Flash are nice touches. Hopefully the cast and crew will learn from the mistakes they've made here and deliver a great sequel in two years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mix of the good, the bad and the awesome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every DC superhero movie is under an extreme amount of pressure to deliver a performance equaling or surpassing TDK. Mainly because they all take it upon themselves to bring us the gritty reality that is our world only with the superhuman in it. Suicide Squad however gives that vision the finger and runs along its own path. Or so I hoped. Just like deadpool it goes crazy. From the first release of the teaser trailer (how good was that thing btw?) it promised fun and explosions without worrying too much about realism. We heard crazy tales of Letto and the crew and the visuals kept on getting fresher and fresher. Why oh why did they not send the memo to Viola Davis? Her portrayal of Amanda Waller seems to be the exact opposite of what the rest is doing. There is no fun when she is on screen. Every time the squad gets the funtrain going, she either derails it with insanely long introductions of the squad (who needs to hear her say 4 times that she wants to form a team of the most dangerous people in the world?) or she sucks the fun out of an otherwise ass-cracking situation. Overall I liked the movie a lot. Truth be told, the story's a joke, the villains do not impose a sense of threat and the moments of apologetic 'it's not just about violence, there's a reason for everything' are probably counterproductive. But past that, there is a true gem of a movie. The relationship between Joker and Quinn is the most tangible relationship in a movie in recent years. Harley Quinn is epic and insane, exactly what you wanted without knowing it. Will Smith delivers a solid Deadshot when he is not fussing over his daughter. And DC even manages to get the right angle on the humor at times. It brings colour to an otherwise bleak DC universe. One last point I would like to mention is how feminist Harley Quinn is. She devours men, does her own thing, beats bad guys to a pulp. She is fearless enough to go into a gunfight wearing nothing but a sweatshirt, hotpants and a baseball bat. And the reason that drives her? Getting to her Puddin'. So in conclusion, this was a movie very much worth a view. It has extremely high highs and some deep lows. During those I suggest you just close your eyes, the soundtrack will numb your pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well finally saw Suicide Squad. On the IMDb scale of 1 to 10. I can't give it anymore than a 6. Better than I thought would be, so that was encouraging. Movie was kind of all over the place. Joker and Harley were awesome. Also really liked the way Killer Croc was presented. Will Smith wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. Batfleck is turning out to be the best Batman ever. I didn't expect to see a lot of Batman going in since I had already seen the animated version. The movie had some good moments though. Not enough to give it any more than a 6. Not really happy with Zach Snyders work overall doing DC movies. I could say the same thing about my movie reviews. Doesn't seem to be where my talents lay.

		<shortDescription>Better than most movies nowadays, but simply because the bar is extremely low</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw it and I already had low expectations, so I wasn't utterly disappointed. We were all interested in The Joker, the most popular supervillian in the world, who was also in most of the marketing for this movie... What went wrong there? I didn't exactly like the performance (and laugh) but the looks were cool, more scenes with him would have been cool too. Everyone else's performance was also pretty poor. I see they hired a bunch of hunks and hot chicks and an obligatory unattractive, "empowered" black female character to please the feminists, but those people really fell flat on the acting. The characters being written in the most shallow of ways didn't help things either. "Here's this person - feel bad for them because of this and that." Great. Even Will Smith, who's probably the most experienced actor in there didn't shine, he was way more believable in movies like I, Robot for example. This whole movie was merely a show for the eye and nothing else. And not even a man's eye, but women's. Which is why all the 12 year old girls are now shouting that Leto's Joker was good merely because he has a good body. That's how you win 'em over, right? Too bad it doesn't work on normal people who have an IQ above that of a french fry.I understand there's a lot of dirty business and pressure in the movie-making world, and sacrifices had to be made, but that's not an excuse for an overly-hyped but rather disappointing generic Hollywood action movie. Much more was promised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third time in a row (their third movie in this sequence too) that DCEU has messed up the plot flow.+ Lovely VFX. One of the most important things for a comic based superhero action movie. + Acting. The trailer got most of us to fall in love with Harley Quinn already. Everyone else did a pretty decent job too. + Soundtracks. Nicely adjusted popular rock songs like Iron Man, Seven Nation Army, Bohemian Rhapsody etc. + Humour. Saving their ass by making people laugh.- Bad plot flow. It's gripping in the start. Keeping you entertained and stuff. But it becomes such a drag later. The second half is like one long dragged episode of Arrow. I really really really hope Justice League isn't another consecutive drag. - Lots of new important characters with no introductory movies. This is the biggest and the most annoying problem with DCEU. They're rushing too fast, giving introduction very little importance. It is important for the audience to build a bond with the characters before a crossover movie. And not just the characters, but the actors playing them too. They did the same with BvS. - Very few situations and locations. They stay in one situation and location for painfully long times. They did the same in BvS and pretty much in Man of Steel too. It's an action movie, not a drama movie. The story needs to progress on a fast pace. - Dark colour tone almost throughout the movie. I'm not sure if that was an Atrium Cinemas problem or a cinematography problem. But anyway, it was physically stressful to watch at times. Same thing was with BvS.Also, all those complaining about Joker's part being too little and too serious need to realise that.. 1. Joker sure is a legendary character but he was not a main character in this particular film. He's obviously going to have more films to prove his importance. 2. His seriousness, which was very nicely inspired by the story, doesn't represent his character entirely. It wasn't an acting fault. It was merely a cameo. Jared Leto is bloody remarkably brilliant. I'd give the movie a fair 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have read all the reviews and negative waves on this movie. So I was not interested to see this in big screen. Past weekend, I had a lot of time to kill, So went to this movie with half interest.But the movie is a lot better than I thought. A speed 2 hour trip, with a lots of comedy and action. Two things, I liked so much. One is Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Queen. Perfect selection from the cast. Next one is, Music and Soundtrack awesome. After a long time, I have felt so much energy via music. Done a pretty good job.Absolutely, the screenplay is predictable if you are following up with DC Comics. Still, this movie is far better than Dawn of Justice and made my weekend wonderful by villains.</fullReview>

I felt compelled to write my very first movie review ever because I felt terrible by the bad rap. We talked about the movie all the way home and can't wait for a sequel.

		<fullReview>The film is about the formation of a radical team of antiheroes and how they unite in order to end an act of evil against the human race. The squad members face their own unique conflicts, which many of them face throughout the mission, and we see them bond and come together as a force to be reckoned with.Harley Quinn, as portrayed by Margot Robbie, is the breakout star. She did not disappoint. In fact, I would have liked to see more of her and her beloved puddin' Joker. A movie could easily be made chronicling their story together and that could be the Harley Quinn movie Margot wants. I'd love to see it! Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) was an instant favorite, but I would have loved to know more of his back story. Jai does an excellent job as playing a cooky, crazy thief, and I want to see more. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) actually was a character I found most relatable. There is symbolism within him and his inner rage destroying those he loves the most. He was able to redeem himself in the end.Underutilized Killer Croc and Slipknot almost didn't matter. They were there in order to advance plot. Slipknot was used as an example of what would happen if the squad disobeyed Flag or Waller. I also didn't see the need for Katana. It's a shame she felt just thrown in so they'd have another cool female.I loved Viola Davis' portrayal as Amanda Waller. I couldn't have asked for more. I feel quite similarly about Joel's Flag. He is such a complex character that commands the screen. I would have liked more back story on Flag so I could have connected a bit more to him in the end. I feel the same way about Deadshot (Will Smith). More back story. The snippets with his daughter were nice, but more about what led him to become the killer he is would have helped.The tone of the film was surprisingly light hearted and comical juxtaposed against the darker, more sinister setting. I loved the coloring and lighting in the film- it was just right and gave it a comic book feel.The enemies in the film were two-fold. The Squad had to deal with ARGUS AND Enchantress. I feel that due to their success in defeating the latter, it helped them to advance their relations with the former a bit better. The person that voiced Enchantress really made the character for me. That voice made her convincing, whereas her appearance didn't really frighten me.Overall, I found SUICIDE SQUAD to be entertaining, fun, and funny. I would like to see more, or at the very least, A Harley Quinn film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad will remain as on of my newest favorite Comic Book film, falling behind the likes of Civil War, and even Batman v Superman. It even beats the likes of some of MARVEL's films in my opinion to include Iron Man 2, and even the Second THOR film. It gives a light but gritty tone, while giving laughs as much as possible. The acting was amazing, and I wish there would've been more Jared Leto as the Joker, as personally I like him even better than Ledger as the Clown Prince of Crime to be honest, only for the fact t hat I think Leto pulled a bit more from the comics with a nice twist of Ledger's style, but not to the point of being a copycat. Margot Robbie served as an amazing first live action Harley Quinn, with a decent outfit, and even the right amount of crazy, with just a bit of humanity left from the old Harleen she was. The hero Cameos were amazing, even if only brief. How Batman was pulled as the bad guy in a way for the villains. I also love how we are finally getting the Batman villains we deserve, with the likes of Deadshot, Harley, and even the infamous Killer Croc! I hope to see a lot more of them in the future DC live action films. The plot definitely seemed to jump right into it, seeming a bit rushed but semi appropriate I suppose. Other than the lack of Leto, and a bit of a rushed plot, Suicide Squad falls as one of the best zero to hero (or anti hero ig) films we have, personally even better than GotG.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Characters are great, but the story and damn director..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there wasn't for the great advertising and good character players for Deadshot and Harley Quinn, this movie was a catastrophic box office failure! The Joker character was vague in the movie you could barely sense its existence, which for such a great movie full of super villains I think it was a bad idea to make just a small side love story for him, not in the main story, as if you delete the Joker scenes, there wouldn't be any noticeable change for the whole movie.. Anyways, it was the problem of the Writer of the movie, which is the same person as the Director of the movie! I really think of the parallel world which on it the Hollywood Producers decided differently, the Suicide Squad movie has been Directed by Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino, just think for a second, such a great movie it could be! There were so many problems with the story line and scenes which shows how a weak writer and director could make a disaster out of a great movie idea! For example, he just don't pay attention to the details and thinks audience wouldn't notice too, in the last encounter of the Suicide Squad with the Enchantress what happens to those Big Guardian soldiers beside the Enchantress? Thay suddenly disappear and only her brother remains! If you decided to remove them from the movie why you showed them in the previous scene right before the Squad entering to the Main hall? Almost half of the movie spent on introducing the Suicide Squad and they were supposed to defend the country against some probable super power, but suddenly, such a lame story is that! One of the members of the previously introduced as the Suicide Squad becomes the one which they should fight against! Anyways.. Let's talk about the perfect Character in the movie, Harley Quinn, I think almost half of the audience attraction was for her great role playing, one of her cool quotes: "we're the bad guys, this is what we do!", I loved her personally, because her favorite cocktail was the same one as I love, "Adios Mother F..", Deadshot was another perfect character, you wouldn't remember so much of the other characters after finishing watching the movie.. By the way there is a last scene in the end of the movie after animation cast.. Don't miss, it is for the next sequel of the movie..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun filled ride. Way too much hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start this off. I'm not a DC fanboy. Civil War, Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy are very good films. Now, Suicide Squad is written and directed by David Ayer. Which was very exciting. And for me, and everyone I saw this with. It was an awesome, fun ride. The best part was definitely the Squad's chemistry. Some characters did not have enough to do, for sure. But the team itself, was what sold me. To introduce and explain like 8 new characters in one movie is no easy task, but did work for the most part. The story is something you have most definitely seen before. The third act is quite cliché, but the execution of it was beautiful. By end, you care about enough of the characters to really get behind the mission. It did seem a bit rushed and meshed together in the second act. But the characters take you through it with actual stakes, because none of these actors are slated for other movies till 2035. People can actually die. This isn't Marvel, and I think that the guts that Ayer had with the direction of the movie was risky and did pay off. The Joker was a great addition, but serves little purpose. Don't go expecting to see Heath Ledger, because he does not get enough screen time. But his scenes do illustrate the abusive and weirdly romantic complexity of his relationship with Harley, which was a very nice thing to see, which could've been so much longer. The Acting was way above sub-par. Will Smith as Deadshot is by far the best casting work in this movie. His performance is a blend of his own Will Smith charisma, and the heart that he has that drives his character. Margot Robbie kills it as Harley Quinn, she gave such a great and nuanced performance that I wished to have seen more of. Jay Hernandez surprised me so much, he brought a layer of heart that I didn't see coming in a big blockbuster like this. Jai Courtney was the biggest surprise in my opinion. After Terminator, Divergent and Die Hard 5, I lost faith in him as an actor. But he brought such a comedic presence that I didn't know he could bring. He has a bit of chemistry with Karen Fukuhara's character Katana. Which was a really good layer to add to this mix that really grounds the movie. Adam Beach has little development but still had some good reactions with Jai Courtney's Boomerang. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Killer Croc, he had a good presence, but I wanted more development in terms of his backstory. Cara Delevigne was really bad. They relied on her facial expressions more than dialogue so that was a good thing. But Joel Kinnamen's Rick Flagg, is so underrated. He had small nuances that brought the team together and made me trust him as an accomplished soldier. And Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, she was more intimidating than the actual villain. Enough said. All in all, I loved this movie. The pacing was off a bit. The second act is very confusing, the villain is generic. Some characters needed more development, and I just wish it was longer. But it has enough positives to outweigh the negative. I am excited for the rest of what DC has to offer. Overall rating: 9.2</fullReview>

In my opinion there is one thing wrong in the movie, i mean horrible, i hated it, and its Jared Leto's Joker. The Joker here is the worst of all cinematic jokers, its like a punk gangster and oh my god his laughing is terrible. I think that without his metallic teeth it could been better. Suicide Squad is a success. Will Smith is great, Margot Robbie is great and everyone is great in this crazy film. It has a very good soundtrack and i think you will love it.Sorry for my English, i hope you understand what i want to say.DUNANDSON</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that I was really disappointed in, was the fact that the trailer was a false advertisement. The trailer showed so many joker scenes and the movie barely had any. Aside from not having enough Joker scenes the movie was pretty good, but would have been so much better with what we all thought we would get, more Joker. He is my favorite character and I was hoping to see so much more, but that is not what they gave us. I just think that it is unfair for Jared Leto himself and the fans. They shouldn't have cut so many of his scenes. He was definitely the best part of the movie and the only reason why I even watched it, and I know plenty of other people who feel the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to D.C Movies?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was waiting for this even more than Civil War. I liked Civil War, but this one.... Let me start by saying that Margot Robbie was great, she was the character that saved this movie of being worse. Will Smith was OK, but i don't think he was the right choice; Deadshot is supposed to be this serious dark hit-man, but they turn him into a "funny" character. That's the main problem with this movie, they try so hard to be funny like Marvel. People criticized Batman V Superman for being dark and humorless, which i think is ridiculous, so they copied Marvel, WHY?! They stole the essence of the film, with the PG-13 rating and stupid jokes; i'd rather to see a dark movie than this "trying so hard to be Marvel". Now, the characters: the villain is beyond horrible, just a one- dimensional "witch" with her brother trying to destroy the world by no reason with the giant spectacle in the city like a Ghostbuster's scene. The villain is not the only thing, the character of Diablo is not good, with a terrible backstory and racist Mexican dialogue. Slipknot, was a complete useless and wasted character, he's killed 5 minutes after he appears, WOW! Boomerang and Katana are horrible too, with no development; well Katana had a backstory, a cliché story of her dead husband, really forced. Also the backstory of Deadshoot, his daughter, was so forced, i didn't buy any of that; and when he is about to shoot the villain, we see the girl "talking" to Deadshoot saying to him not to shoot, i mean seriously!! In the beginning of the film, when Deadshoot is about to shoot Batman, the girl stops him, which makes sense, but not in that final scene, if he doesn't kill the villain, the world ends, simple as that!! The daughter's backstory was very forced. Now, the most anticipated thing of this movie: The Joker; wow, he was horrible. I can see if people like Jared Leto's performance, but it din't work for me; that EMO and gangsta style was bad, really bad; and he is not even important in the film, with an appearance of not even 10 minutes. Harley Quinn and Deadshoot make this movie worth the ticket, they saved this for being worse as i just said, and the relationship of Harley and Joker was good and charming, but the movie as a whole, is disappointing and mediocre. What a shame, for a movie that could have been great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, what's all the negativity about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide squad was a very highly anticipated film which is good but also bad for any film because there will be people who can't appreciate the amazing acting and skillful writing and work that has been put in to make this film much like the comics in my opinion yes the story-line wasn't amazing but it was different not the same old good guy gets bad guy i also agree with the argument that slipknot was a unless character but they needed a character who people wouldn't get attached too to show how the villains may die and how ruthless the cooperation they were in it. I thought the jokers character was amazing and very well connected to the comics of him and Robbie was amazing as Harley Quinn, every character had their own purpose and it all came together to make a brilliant atmosphere in the film, good job to everyone who helped make this film what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, is not as bad as a movie, but it sucks because we all were expecting so much more.The best thing about this movie is the music, the worst is that is PG-13. I feel that we can't really judge the acting since the actors are really limited and forced to make psychopaths, killers and cold blooded assassin fit the PG-13 rating, this also limits your scrip. They could've save the joker for a standalone movie and use that movie time to give more depth to characters like Diablo, who's dead would've been more meaningful. (Like quicksilver on age of Ultron) It just really suck that, they missed a great opportunity to make an awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but left you feeling like it could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is the story of a shady government organization gathering together a group of arrested super villains to act as a covert force against super-powered threats. As always happens with Shady Government Agencies, a problem soon arises that was pretty much their own fault to start with, and the extremely reluctant members of the Suicide Squad are activated to stop it.In the end, this movie delivers an okay, somewhat enjoyable experience that leaves you feeling like it could have been so much more.Performances are mostly good to great. Margot Robbie stands out as Harley Quinn, Will Smith does a decent job as Deadshot,and Jay Hernandez does a great job as Diablo. Even the often-maligned Jai Courtney, in the extremely limited time he's on screen, delivers a great Captain Boomerang. The only performances that really left me wanting more were Cara Delevingne as The Enchantress and Jared Leto as The Joker (who was okay in his limited screen time, but who felt more like an eccentric mob boss than The Joker to me).Despite the overall good acting, the movie falls over on two hurdles: the script, and the editing. As far as the script goes, it's a pretty generic 'Prevent the Worlds End' plot which makes you feel as if the movie may have benefited from a smaller, more focused threat for the Squad to fight against - making the Joker the main villain, for example, might have made the threat to the Squad seem less removed and more immediate.The real problem, though, is the editing. I almost never notice editing in a movie. In this movie's case, the editing is really, really glaringly bad. There are scenes where you jump to something that's just not connected to the surrounding scenes, scenes where a couple of members of the Squad are marked as unimportant due to being introduced in throwaway lines, and near the end you have characters acting like they've come to important life-changing decisions due to events that you're sure have been left on the cutting room floor.There was one scene, for example, where a character bravely walks towards the damaged glass frontage of a building and opens the door. An obvious bit of humour starts as you hear and see a brief split-second of the damaged glass door start to shatter apart in their hands, only for the film to cut to the other characters. That was a shot that should have either lingered for another second or two to make the joke, or cut out earlier to delete the joke entirely. It's also glaring in at least one part of the movie, where music jarringly changes between short scene switches. Really, the editing is some of the worst I've ever seen in a major movie.All in all, though, if you can put up with these couple of issues the movie is enjoyable. It may be worth waiting to see if there's some sort of Director's Cut or Extended Cut before watching, in case those versions mitigate the editing issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will smith is one of great actor and i have been looking forward to watch his movies. All of his upcoming movies were about average. When this movie finally got released, me and my friends were very egar to watch it. This movie was amazingly funny and awesome. Just like Marvel's deadpool, DC's anti hero movie Suicide Squad. All characters in this movie are crafted well. Especially the Jokers's character is really very well played by Jared letto. It was ambiguous that no one can ever meet performance of Joker other than heath leadger. But jared has performed that superbly. One of main attraction in this movie is of course Harley Quinn. perfect role played by morgot robbie as insane joker's girlfriend. Well, the story was well written. and visual effects were really great. Batman and flash sequences were also great. Overall wonderful movie and very good to have fun watching with friends.</fullReview>

As a DC fan I was worried about this new take on a lot of the characters but my god....the unique music choices, the chemistry between characters, fantastic. Harley and joker scenes alone carry this movie. I LOVE this new take on the Joker. We want MORE!Jared leto gives us around 8-10 mins of Joker, its a little more than a tease to what we can expect in the future but man. What a badass joker. Will smith however....doesn't come off as deadshot, it feels more like will smith is playing...will smith. They have some fantastic cameos in backflash scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that squandered so much potential despite an abundance of source material, a multitude of great characters to play with and a brilliant cast at its disposal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{SPOILERS!!}Suicide Squad fails to deliver a memorable story line and at times failed the most interesting assets they had, the characters. Having said that, Suicide Squad is an okay, watchable movie ? not as bad some of the critics reviews would have you believe, but no where near as good as you wanted it to be. The film begins by briefly introducing us to a few of the main 'villains' in prison, accompanied by a sometimes out of place soundtrack, before quickly diving into Viola Davis' character, Amanda Waller, explaining that she "Wants to build a team of some very bad people, who she believes can do some good", which unfortunately doesn't extend much past what you will have seen in the adverts. In fact, a couple of the 'back stories' are reduced to sequences stretching to just a little over 30 seconds, including Killer Crocs' - one of the movies most under utilized characters, whose entire contribution to film comes down to a few grunts and incomprehensible words (not to mention the fact his head regularly looked far too big for his body). The film then continues on for a while to basically just be a sequence of strangely pasted together sound clips of popular songs, but not much more.Eventually, Enchantress (played by Cara Delevingne, the TopShop model), who I guess is the antagonist, takes over New York City and creates a massive energy ball around herself for a reason I'm unsure of (Maybe it was explained, maybe It mattered so little that I didn't take note) and patiently awaits for the Suicide Squad to arrive ? who have been brought together and sent to fight what they have been told is a 'terrorist' - an element of the movie I felt could have been utilized more, it may not have been the directors angle but having the Suicide Squad be the answer to a more relatable 'terrorist' could have engaged a bigger conversation and related to current issues in a way that the X-Men franchise has done in the past ? just my opinion. They've been sent to save one unnamed individual. This individual turns out to be Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) herself, who has sent them to save herself. I'm unsure of why she was near the Enchantress in the first place, or why she goes on to kill the team she was working with there. My main problem with the movie was not the uninspired plot, or the senseless destruction and presence of the antagonist and it wasn't even the sub standard story telling methods by the director, but the lack of both character development and character relationships. The only members of the Suicide squad that really interacted with one another were Will Smith and Harley Quinn. When it comes to the scene where Deadshot is asked to Shoot and Kill Harley Quinn, as she attempts to escape with the Joker, he misses (on purpose, given that he 'never misses'), but even by this scene the movie has failed to development any sense of loyalty between the characters so Deadshots' decision appears out of character to the point it could almost be described as a plot hole. Another moment, later on in the movie, that really emphasizes the lack of development between the characters, was the moment Diablo finally dives into any action (minus his one other fire scene earlier on in the movie that Deadshot aggravates him into, which you will have seen in the trailers) and exclaims 'I've already lost one family, I won't lose another'. This statement seems so out of place given that Diablo at this point has not properly interacted with any of the members of the Suicide Squad, minus his aforementioned run in with Deadshot. I can only assume that in an earlier version of the script we would have seen the members form some sort of allegiance to one another, but watching this final edit I would never have guessed that was ever the movies intentions. With all that being said, the movie does have some redeeming qualities, most noticeably in the casting. Will Smith plays, well, Will Smith, but nether-the-less gives a charismatic performance of Deadshot, who I think, if anyone, is meant to be a protagonist. Margot Robbie delivers a great and unpredictable performance as Harley Quinn, but much more could have been done with her screen time. It felt like Margot "got" Harley Quinn and is more than capable of making Harley Quinn her own ? but the story and script let her down and failed to make it a breathtaking performance. Jared Leto brought his own Comic-book inspired take on The Joker, which again I felt was let down by the direction, rather than by Leto. In this movie The Joker is portrayed as no more than a strangely decorated mafia man, with a noticeable absence of any 'dark humor' or mental complexity, which is what usually makes The Joker such a fascinating character. What I would really like to see is Letos' Joker and Margot Robbie' Harley Quinn have a film of their own under a new director, because the potential is there. A little less jumped up Mafia Hit Man, and a little more of their relationship in the "Arkham" series of video games, and we might be on to something great.Overall it feels that DC and Warner Bros have absolutely everything they need to create brilliant, even cult-classic movies but are consistently failing to deliver on even the basic levels of blockbuster storytelling ? and on this occasion have produced only an okay movie, but with zero re-watch value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could of been better !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film the day it was released and read a few negative reviews before hand so knew what to expect, I personally thought the film in general could of been better, the plot was pointless, some characters had no place in the film and the CGI was terrible,Deadshot: was probably the best character in the film, had most screen time, I liked the beginning when deadshot was handed his guns again and showed Rick Flag and co how to shoot was pretty cool..but..I just feel like its will smith, he doesn't act, its just will smith in a deadshot costume but he can pull that off because his such a big name in the industry, I cant help thinking if Will Smith played Killer Croc would Killer Croc of had more screen time and a better back story?Harley Quinn: Maggot Robbie played Harley Quinn really well, I liked they showed her back story with The Joker and how she become Harley Quinn but seemed like they could of made a whole film on this story line, could or would be such a good film, Maggot clearly done her research and looked into her role (unlike above), surely we will see this Harley Quinn in future DC moviesThe Joker: Jared Leto is a fantastic actor, he has taken a different spin on the Joker Character, you cant compare him to Heath Ledger, heath's Joker was more dark and evil and Jared's is twisted and crazy, both blokes gave great renditions of the Joker, only annoying part was his only in the film for a hand full of scenes, you want to see him more, maybe its DC's big plan to rope you in to see the next film they use The Joker in to pull in the audiencesAmanda Weller: Viola Davis done fantastic, was a cold and chilling character, when she kills all of her colleges because "There not needed" just showed how dark she really is, disappointed with the ending tho, I wont give it away, hopefully you see her again in future DC filmsEnchantress: started out a very interesting character, when Amanda Weller introduced her to the National Security Council was really cool and was looking forward to her in the rest of the film then it changed, Cara Delevingne couldn't handle the acting job, without giving to much away, her salmon dancing towards the end was shocking, maybe the CGI didn't help her but overall when the acting had to be good she was below par,Rick Flag: was a massive part of this film, was probably the character with the most screen time but why not cast a big name to go with the part, someone which could take the acting burden for the role, Joel Kinnaman was disappointing.....Killer Croc, Diablo, Katana, Slipknot was all back ground characters, didn't do much, Diablo was the only one which may get another cameo in another DC film but cant really see where and whyI have given this film 5/10 mainly because of the Characters not the Plot or CGI, this film wont be remembered for it's Plot but for Deadshot, Harley Quinn and The Joker, hopefully this is a platform for bigger and better films in the futurestay after the credits and you see a scene between Amanda Weller and Bruce Wayne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted this movie to be good. It was not. Waste of my time and money.The bad: - The pacing was off and there was no consistency in the tone. - The ending was like x-men apocalypse or Ghostbusters (2016). It has been done to death. No music in the end fight and over the top special effects! So boring. - The bad guys become good guys for no reason. They should have called it "Deadshot and friends". - The Joker was a joke. Not real bad acting but this character had no story significance what so ever. The good: + Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Hotter than a baked potato. + Good music (oldies)Advice: Don't waste your money in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie, but bad plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen Suicide Squad this morning it was better than I thought. But there are some problems with the plot, and I will show you right now.Positive: 1/Acting: The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jai Courtney,... all did a great job portraying their characters. The movie could have been worse without them.2/Fun: Yes, SS was so hilarious! I just couldn't stop laughing. Harley Quinn was the funniest.Every time she showed up I LOL. DC should keep making funny movies like this one.3/Action: The battle scenes were way better than those of BvS. The whole team was bad-ass!Negative: 1/Plot: David Ayer was the wrong choice for this film. His plot felt a little rushed and there were many plot holes. For ex, why didn't Enchantress started her plans long ago. Cause she must have known that the Suicide Squad could stop her, right? Or why didn't super heroes do anything when the whole world goes chaotic? In Batman: Assault on Arkham, Batman showed up to stop SS, so why didn't he show up in this movie???2/Joker The trailers made Joker look very promising, but Jared Ledto didn't live up to the heights. Heath Ledger is still the best, I guessed.3/Enchantress Just one word: Shazam!That's all for my review, hope you found it useful and if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only 2 good things came out of this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was everything to suggest this would be the movie of the year and nothing to suggest it delivered. I loved the trailers and the concept was good but it never amounted to much.First and foremost there was the shoddy plot line. Then the mediocre acting followed by about a thousand clichés. Will Smith was supposedly one of the bad guys but he was basically Will Smith in every Will Smith movie. Think Will Smith in Hancock, that's what DeadShot was. His origin story wasn't too great either. Jared Leto's joker was a disappointment. Granted he had to follow a tough act in Heath Ledger, David Ayer didn't help and neither did his supposed 'death' do much to help the film (like they're just gonna kill off the Joker). Cringe is the only way to describe his performance. With a whole lot of cuts and generic jokes intertwined with cliché moments and an average plot line, probably not worth seeing it in cinema. Of course if the kids are desperate or just want to watch a superhero movie without much depth, then Suicide Squad fits the bill.The reason I gave it a 6 is because of the great soundtrack and Harley Quinn. Soundtrack was great with good songs but that's about all that needs to be said. Margot Robbie however did a great job in portraying the real Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie alone lifts the entertainment value at least by half. It would be wise for them to have a separate Harley Quinn movie.Overall the each scene was shot as if it were a trailer, there wasn't much continuity, the origin stories weren't compelling and the overall plot and execution was pretty ho-hum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is cut to shreds and its very apparent. Editing is some of the worst I've seen in a while, it gives the viewer no sense of time and space and butchers the structure. The original vision for the film can be seen under the surface and is even clearer if you look up what was cut. Feeling a little lied to, the advertisements don't reflect the final product and Joker has second billing but is reduced to barley quarter of an hour. His scenes in particular are so ham-fistedly altered and cut to their bare-bones that its very jarring. Dead-shot and Harley Quinn were strong and I enjoyed interactions between the characters yet ultimately came out frustrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Ratings doesn't say how much I want to watch this movie again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave it 6.5 for conventional rating but don't shut it as a bad movie yet if there is a fun meter I gave this 7 and for its surprisingly emotional scenes I gave it 8, (so that's why Will Smith is here).Why just 6.5? I didn't understand the main characters' muddled backstory because it is short and unelaborated. There is more concrete reasons why Harleen became Harley, it is not as capricious as this movie made it out. Joker never even had a punch line, no jokes at all, he is supposed to be entertaining with all his crazy antics instead Jared Leto looks like a lost drunken pantomime. Harley is not vexing enough, she is supposed to be annoyingly loud but funny, Captain Boomerang is not pestering enough, he is supposed to be the loser who is trying so hard to be on par with Deadshot instead he was reduced to a timid and hopeless romantic extra. There are some unexplained stuff as well, like why Didn't Rick Flag shoot Harley Quinn while she was dangling in the helicopter? Why all of a sudden the squad feel sorry for Harley? Why don't they shoot or break the tablet and get rid of the bomb trigger? Why this movie is not bad? It is not your average comic book movie and those who say otherwise are fooling themselves. I mean C'mon! villains as heroes how often do we get to see that? Even though they are criminals and we shouldn't be caring whether they die or not this unsung squad found empathy among each other which made this movie surprisingly emotional and I'm sure anyone felt that genuinely unless you were predetermined to hate it from the start.Conclusion: The introduction for the characters was boring, it should've been more compelling if they started it with a grueling scene like New 52 Suicide Squad issue# 1, it would surely have kept everybody on their seats. This movie made me realized that ratings doesn't say how much I want to watch this movie again and how much I want more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world needs superheroes. But what are they without super villains? *SPOILERS AHEAD*The prime super-villain, Enchantress and her machine-god-like bro, is way too comic-al. Yes, pun intended. But why does the sis-bro duo want world domination? Unclear. And the loony bin turns upside down as Amanda Waller begins recruiting. She plays one go-getter, twisted character, someone whom you'd not want to be pally with/mess with in real life.Splash of neons like a breath of fresh air, a cheer leader with a baseball bat, waddling her cute pigtails and twinkling eyes, and a combo of minxy madness and toxicity, Harley Quinn is played by Margot Robbie. You want to live her idiosyncrasies, you want to jump in joy and sink into despair, and fall in love with a madman, her Puddin', her Joker ? just because. She wisecracks, she shows off her inner child, yet she's confident with her sexuality. "This is just a whole lotta' pretty and a whole lotta' crazy," as they say about her. Whole lotta' love for her, I say!Jared Leto's Joker has no character development and appears sporadically like all guest appearances go. Barring the scenes where he's lying on the floor surrounded by knives ? in all sorts of varieties, or where he plunges down after Harley Quinn into a pool of gooey, toxic stuff. The metal teeth, the method acting and the tattoos don't help. I can scream Heath Ledger's name out aloud and state that he was, to me, the creepiest Joker ever. Think Jim Carey or Jack Nicholson ? way better. Sorry Leto, you were a letdown.Will Smith's Deadshot plays it cool, funny, quirky, wherever necessary and as you guessed, as expected. He almost appears like a vamped up version of the dad from 'Pursuit of Happiness'. The other villains are Diablo with his pyrokinetic powers and a tragic backstory, the super angry Killer Croc, a clichéd Captain Boomerang, and the sword- swinger Katana ? so hugely underdeveloped a character, and almost a sorry sight.What's good, sorry, great? The brilliant soundtrack which takes you back to your childhood ? Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, Without Me by Eminem, Sympathy for the Devil by The Rolling Stones, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap by AC/DC ? and to pep it up there's 'Purple Lamborghini' by Skrillex and 'Sucker for Pain' by Wiz Khalifa, Imagine Dragons and Li'l Wayne. Yes, give it a listen. I bet you'll fall for it.A film that acts like a filler between 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' and JLA, what else is there to say? As Killer Croc says, "Got me a sewer to crawl back into". Here, I go back to work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't forget, we're the bad guys.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Suicide Squad' was undoubtedly this summer's most anticipated movie since it's announcement a couple years back. Does it live up to the hype and break the critical curse of DC? For something to start with such promise, it sinks faster than the Titanic:(1. From the moment the film begins, we get a rather cohesive introduction to all the villains imprisoned at 'Belle Reve'. I was impressed to see how well things were balanced as we get flashbacks and brief back-stories of all these characters. It's obvious at this point that Batman (Ben Affleck) appears in the film, and it's also no surprise that he's the reason why most of the inmates at 'Belle Reve' are locked up. We especially see how Batman captures Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) in flashback sequences. There is also a pretty cool cameo by 'The Flash' (Ezra Miller) in the segment where Cpt. Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is captured by him. All in all, the film has a strong opening that really pulls you in.2. The initial plot follows the events of 'Dawn of Justice' in the wake of Superman's death, which prompts ruthless government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to assemble a response team called 'Task-Force X', in the event that other threatening super-beings were to invade earth. Coincidentally, a new threat emerges in the form of a possessed bitch called 'Enchantress' (Cara Delevigne). At this point the foundation slowly starts to crumble, beside the fact that the character of June Moone/Enchantress is so f#%king unlikable and that there is a sickening love-story between her and Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnamen). I also hate Cara Delevigne as an actress, and she really adds to my belief here from all the popping' n lockin' bullsh#t choreography the Enchantress has. 3. We never really get a proper understanding of how or what Enchantress is using or doing to destroy the world apart from the fact that she creates a green halo in the sky. If you think what I said sounds clichéd, the bitch also unleashes her brother 'Incubus' (who is just a tall and terrible CGI creature) and transforms the remaining people of Mid-Way city into black, face-less (literally) and non-threatening mutants, who's only purpose is to serve as a reason for there to be a couple action sequences in which the squad haplessly takes them out. The threat in this film just proves that the story was terrible on the part of writer/director David Ayer. It's sad, cause you'd obviously expect more from the guy who wrote 'Training Day, Harsh Times &amp; Fury'.4. Viola Davis seems more like the real threat in this film, because she plays Amanda Waller as ruthless and cunning as she should be. Will Smith as Deadshot connects you more than any other character in this film. Smith has a natural charm that he brings to every role, and it's hard to not feel for him when you see his story and the struggle he has to be with his daughter. Joel Kinnamen (Rick Flagg) had a good structure at first, but he proves to not be much of a badass as we think, and we soon realize he's literally just chasing the p#ssy. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) had some promise latter in the film until he (for no apparent reason) bursts into a flaming CGI monster at the climax and leaves you utterly confused.5. For the one person that hardcore fans have been waiting to see since Heath Ledger's portrayal, might have to wait a little longer to be honest. The Joker (Jared Leto) unfortunately has less than 15mins of screen-time in a movie that's 123mins long. He appears in a few flashbacks as well as being intertwined in the initial plot, but we still never get a proper grasp or feel of what his character is all about. Jared Leto is undoubtedly an amazing actor, but he is completely sidelined in an already clustered film. Harley Quinn falls down the middle for me cause she was never really a character I cared for even in the cartoons and comics. However, the relationship between her and the Joker was by far the most interesting aspect of this film btw.Talk about falling short of the glory, a saying which perfectly summarizes this film. I can honestly say that 'Dawn of Justice' and 'Man of Steel' were by far better films than this (no matter by how little). Zack Snyder can no longer be solely to blame for lack- luster DC films, but here's to hoping Patty Jenkins, James Wan and Ben Affleck can save this cinematic universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll begin with a few strong aspects of the movie. This was an entertaining movie, with a nice colour scheme to boot. I was really digging the bright neon theme! And the soundtrack was alright.The big-bad-guy for this movie, despite having the usual goal of bad guys which mostly involves world domination and other similar things, was entertaining! Visually, pretty cool.Harley Quinn was cute! Could've done without the mediocre back-story, but I like how she's a mixture of silly and psycho.Now for a couple of weak aspects... When I saw the trailer for Suicide Squad, I immediately knew that it wasn't going to be funny. The humour was forced, to say the least. If the theatre had been packed with a bunch of my clones, the after-joke pauses in the movie would have been filled with awkward silences rather than the few dispersed chuckles I'm fairly sure I heard. That's for most of the jokes though. There were a few laugh-worthy moments in the film.The plot was fairly lame, but what do you expect from a movie based off a comic? I mean, there's usually only two teams: the good guys and the bad guys. And, well, they're usually fighting one another. So don't expect anything too profound in that respect, other than the fact that now bad guys are fighting other bad guys for the good guys.Despite these things though, I would probably watch the movie again, even if the writing was perhaps a little awkward and the characters not quite as insane as I would've liked. There were some intriguing moments which I wouldn't mind seeing again.</fullReview>

His character was more like a small time gang leader with bad teeth than a mob boss. The sounds that he kept making were annoying at best.El Diablo's back story was the best and his fight at the end while predictable was fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's only OK. The story is somewhat boring and contrived, and there are more than a few plot holes. Margo Robbie is pretty good as Harley Quinn, and Viola Davis is very good as Amanda Waller. Will Smith was pretty much what I expected, which was basically every character he has ever played, but without the hair. The other characters are never fully explored, although the first 40 minutes of the movie is spent introducing some of them. I have to say that the biggest disappointment for me was Jared Leto's Joker. I tried to go into the movie with an open mind about his look (which, when it was first revealed, I did not like), and I liked it even less after seeing the movie. His take on the character's criminal insanity is good, but I couldn't get past the ridiculous grill and tattoos. Overall, the movie fell flat on story and character development, was only OK on visual effects and character appearance (Killer Croc and Enchantress looked awesome), but was saved by the performances of Robbie and Davis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad will be remembered as a failure for some fans and I understand the complaints about it. The positive side of me is trying to be forgiving to the DC universe because I know they are rushed and trying to play catch up to Marvel. The negative side of me was just baffled at a few things. Spoilers ahead.-The CGI. WTF is all I can really say. I get it for the most part, it's a comic book movie, yeah yeah, but come on. The diablo effects were laughable. Most of the scenes with Enchantress and her minions were as well. Will this be the theme of all the DC movies? Are they doing this intentionally to try and have more of a comic feel? -Enchantress is the main protagonist was the best they could come up with? A weak villain does not keep the interest of casual fans. I know this movie was designed with the thought of having the Joker used for future films, but this angle with Enchantress really didn't click. And why does every villain need to design a "machine"? A few of the positives I noticed were: +Margot Robbie was incredible and perfectly cast for this Role.+Although they had limited screen time, Batman and Joker were excellent.+Good to see some continuity within the DC universe. Small details matter, like mentioning Superman &amp; Batman, metahumans, etc. This will pay off for DC if they keep working! Overall, it is clear DC still has plenty of work to do to please their fans. I was still pleased despite some plot holes and will continue to look forward to future movies.6/10.Rob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good and enjoyable movie that would better with a little bit jokes less, not the best movie of all time but still very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a really good movie, the first part was very dynamic and fast, the characters were introduced very well on my opinion and the cameos of Batman and Flash were amazing, I liked how some of the characters where described showing us that they have a life at long of the movie in order to make us feel empathy with them and their motivations, just talking about Deadshot, Harley, Diablo and a little bit Katana but really little, if the objective was to make fell identified with her it missed more of backstory of her in my opinion, we know almost nothing about captain boomerang but it was not necessary in my opinion because his personality is pointed since the beginning of the movie the same for killer Croc, the dead of Slipknot was to prove a point, it was not wasted for me, I mean they are bad guys, and obviously they are going to try to escape if they have an opportunity, it was necessary to make us see that they were not born yesterday and just they believed that they have a bomb inside them. I like the funny and light tone of the movie, the humor was good and loved that it did not reach the point of being ridiculous, just I think it would be perfect with little bit less jokes because some parts that supposed to be serious lost the idea of the scene because of a joke, for example the scene in the bar, they are discussing things about each other and suddenly a joke from Harley, but still some other scenes serious despite the tone funny of the movie and it really helped to the movie to feel emotions about it, example the final moments fighting enchantress when Harley hit her and Deadshot shot the bomb, I totally agree with the idea of having different kind of movies in the DCU, BvS had to be dark this one had to be funny, we do not always want the same just the tone than is needed depending of the kind of movie, but always keeping the essence of the characters in each movie without change them as it was for Batman and his brief appearance, and talking about Batman, why in BvS he did not have problems killing bad guys and in this movie he strove to save Harley, I mean she the worst of the worst that's not logical.The Music was Awesome, the mix of music hits and the soundtrack itself helped to feel a lot to the immersion of the movie, except some parts of the joker were I felt they were trying to force us think that he is crazy, I felt even in some parts Harley crazier than him because of it, but despite this for me the joker was actually very good although we didn't see him too much, I think we see him enough for the effects of the movie, because it was necessary to describe the past of Harley and he is part of it, I mean his apparition was not as forced.I think it was necessary to the suicide squad to have more moments among them, to share, to feel empathy, because we as audience felt it (or at least I did) but not them, this in order to understand the final decision they took, for example why they stayed, it was understandable for Deadshot, but why the other, this also leads into the exaggerated final decision of Diablo when he sacrifices himself referring to the team as a family, I did not felt it credible, their relationship was not too strong to said that, at least that something in the bar or before was erased, now, why to release a extended version (if they think to release one) they are wasting a good movie in the cinema that could be much better and could avoid too many bad critics, if they just show the extended version directly in the cinemas, believe me, if the movie is good enough WE WILL BUY IT and you do not have to "force" us to buy a blue ray to see the extended version just to you to earn a little bit more money. The action scenes were just amazing, also the camera shots were incredible and very satisfactory, Too many people described this movie as disappointing, disastrous, bad movie, dumb, with poor plot, messy and similar adjectives, but the movie is far from that, it was not the best superhero or antihero movie, but definitely it is not that bad, it's sad to know that too many people hate a franchise of movies just because, it is important to point the bad and good point of a movie but not with that hate. So as a finale verdict,The worst: Some situations little forced, like some scenes of the joker, the fake union of the team and some moments lost by the jokes.The best, Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, the action moments, the music, the funny tone of the movie and Jared Leto despite his brief apparition and I am very excited about the next movies of the DCU, the work of WB and DC has been despite the critics very interesting because of its controversy, that does not mean it has been bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but messy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the critics have been very harsh on this film, it is not as bad as people are making it out to be, but it is not a great film either. It is entertaining, but messy as hell. The editing in this film is dreadful, and like Batman V Superman, you find yourself watching it, and know instantly that something is missing. They must have cut a lot out of this film, as some scenes make little sense, and jump between each other, making it quite confusing.It does start off very well, the first twenty minuets are very good. The Batman cameo, and Deadshot character was very well done. Will Smith did a great job as he carries this movie. His charisma is perfect and suits his role very well. Now Margot Robbie was ideal for Harley, she was perfect, everything she did was well thought out, and you truly believed that she was insane.The main villain in this film, is a little letdown. Without spoiling anything, the villain felt more like a video game boss. But the most interesting thing, is the Joker. Jared Leto is a fantastic actor and he was ... very underused. We were given the impression that the Joker would be a big part, as they kept his character quiet. While Jared was fantastic here, you truly believed that he was mental and loved Harley. There was some sweet moments with him, but he was given barely any screen- time. No one should compare Jared's Joker with Heath's Joker, they are two different characters. But Jared does a fantastic job at making you want to see more, and I hope we see him as a major villain in the future movies.This is a good film, but it is all over the place. I want to see a completed version of the film, which I believe would be a lot better. 5.4/10</fullReview>

Especially Harley Quinn, personally my favorite out of all. Now the biggest question on most people's mind was, will jared leto live up to expectations? my response to that was YES! he wasn't trying to outdo, Jack or Heath he was a whole new joker, would love to of seen more of him throughout. My next topic is the story line, the only thing i would say that let the movie down. No spoilers but the ending could of been different then i would of had a different opinion.

Actually really enjoyed, not at the level of GOTG but different and exciting enough to easily warrant the spend. Kudos particularly to WS &amp; MR - top performances.Think at outset Warners would have been pretty happy with this $ start, and if they get a hammering for large falls from now on, well isn't that the game now pretty much? Even supposed more 'respected' franchises like Bourne &amp; Star Trek have suffered average starts/poor holds, but enjoyable nonetheless - and this will make a decent return. 'Bigger' teams like X-Men would kill for these figures! Overall a big win. And the Marketing guys deserve a raise! If there HAVE been issues with rushed production, maybe there ARE lessons to be learned, but overall - thanks Guys, enjoyed - bring on WW... and SS2...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide squad is more fun than the serious tone of Batman v Superman. It has a lot more humour. Characters are surprisingly funny and there are lots of jokes and one-liners that are total hit. Even Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang is a likable presence (yeah miracles do happen).Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller are the stand out performances. Will Smith does a decent job as Deadshot. He is one of the few characters in the film who has been given any bit of characterization. I did enjoy watching the new portrayal of Joker. But his appearances were few, made no sense in the context of the plot and felt very random. So don't go to the movie expecting a lot of the Joker. Out of all the characters in this movie, Katana's character was the biggest wasted opportunity. But the weakest point of the movie is the antagonist. None of the fight scenes have any real tension or meaning. In short, you will like the first act, but will find it hard to stay connected in the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film. And you will be annoyed with the finale. I'm giving 7 rating only because of some awesome acting from the previously mentioned characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By Far the Best DC Movie in A long time. Super Villains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning this comment may contain a brief spoilerSuicide Squad was amazing. My friend and I had been hoping for someone to create a super villain hero type Where the villain has to save the world. Jared Leto was very good as the Joker. Fans of the second Joker, Heath Ledger saying bad things about this Joker.. Heath was good. But If not for Jack Nicholson, the first big movie screen joker paved the way. He was the best to lead. As was Michael Keaton, who played the first big screen Batman also paved the way. If not for these two characters we might not have seen those two characters get even better through ( those that followed were not so good and C.B who played Batman was alright... Now Ben Afleck takes over the role and he is actually better looking batman/Bruce Wayne..... I like the flash back story with Harley and Joker. She committed herself to Joker and dived backwards into the same type of chemicals as Joker dived in as to save her. It was awesome. All characters did a great job. What do everyone expect from a this DC Film 3 hours to tell a intro story and create more badder villains to stop and rescue the world. Now they need to give them each there own Lead film. Tie it into others.. Freak- the critics and haters of this joker and too much expectations. You didn't get as much with the first of many films from Marvel and DC ... They had to build them up. We are going to see it again. I actually saw it twice, opening weekend. Will go see it again with friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gonna make this short and sweet. If you didn't see any trailers for this film it would be much better. It really doesn't leave out any of the entertaining bits in the trailers. The film felt congested of songs and jokes. It seemed as if it was aimed to have it be a good experience instead of a film. Joker scenes were edited so tight you almost couldn't see his face. They were also flashbacks and it really just felt rushed.Will Smith proves he can't do a villain. He was bad and kept talking about how bad he was or threatening to fight but it just wasn't there. The acting of the entire film was on point and the added color did look cool. Just wasn't what I thought it would be.When no one important ever dies it doesn't feel like the idea of real threat weighs down; and it didn't. Tired of all the CGI villains. Civil War did it right, this just eh. It was too Hollywood and they should have made it more unique. Again, not horrible but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad for many people was supposed to be the movie that would make them fall in love with DCEU after the disappointing results of its predecessor known as Batman v Superman. Unfortunately, seems like this movie will do the opposite of that. This movie is not terrible like critics made it to be, but it's nothing really exceptional either. It's average. It has good ideas, few good performances, some kind of sense of humor, but it lacks heart and consistent storytelling.I liked Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jay Hernandez, and, I don't believe I'm saying that, but Jai Courtney was hilarious in this movie. The Joker was... He was not supposed to be in this movie. The Joker is too big of a character to be used as some unrelated to the story plot- point that has nothing to do with the story itself. Jared Leto is not Heath Ledger, nor people were expecting him to be, but his version of the Joker, even if we don't compare it to previous incarnations, is very bland and superficial. And people will be extremely disappointed with him. Mainly because he was so over-hyped in the trailers and marketing for the movie, which made him look like a prominent character, but he wasn't even a secondary character in the movie. I also loved the score for this movie. I thought this movie should've been score-driven instead of soundtrack-driven. Steven Price is a great composer, and he elevates a lot of mediocre scenes with his music.Didn't like lack of character development, the lack of imaginative action scenes, the unimaginative sets, claustrophobic feel, waste of the Joker, the main villain, the last action scene, and the inappropriate usage of music in certain scenes.Overall, this movie is worth seeing, but that's about it.</fullReview>

No coherent story, only 2 real characters (Deadshot and Harley), good humour, good music, OK action scenes, and a ton of plot holes. Some good performances (Will Smith and Margot Robbie) some bad (Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney). I did, however, really enjoy overall art style of the movie and the CGI art direction, it was good. I guess I got a little misguided by the trailer though, I expected something darker with interesting characters and dark humour, but it ended up being as generic as possible. Basic characters, basic villain, everything was by the book. I still enjoyed it in a theater though. Good watch, but don't expect anything new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a good watch, but not worth to die for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie centered around villains, this is a moderate start for DC and Warner Brothers. It was nice to see some of the villains to gain some backstory, such as Harley Quin's obsession over the Joker, Deadshot's loss of his family, Diablo's lack of his heat control, and Flag's desperation in eliminating demon witch within his girlfriend. Plus, the humor does give me a chance to see how the characters interact with each other, along with the action to let them have the spotlight. However, with all of the positive this movie has, it still cannot be considered perfect with its loose ends. Although we do see focus on most of the characters, there are still a few roles that I believe need to have more development on.One of the characters I was hyped to see in this film was Katana, and I was hopeful to know how she is characterized (since I've never read any of her comics). According to the movie's official website, Katana's bio states that, as second in command next to Colonel Flag, her duty is "...to keep the others in line." But, after watching the film, I was disappointed to see that she doesn't do much to keep the squad members disciplined. All she did was lamented for her deceased husband, and slashed a few minions. I never saw her ran after the protagonists when they make a mistake (ex: In the middle of the film, Harley attempts to leave the squad for Joker, and Katana didn't even move an inch to stop the madwoman). This is the same feeling I got with Killer Croc, whom I was also interested to know about. I haven't any of his comics, yet was still curious to understand how he got his scales. Similar to Katana, Croc doesn't get a lot of back story. Both of them did fight throughout the second-half of the film, but that was all I got out of it. Slipnot was another character that didn't get a lot of attention. You know, the assassin who was recruited in the squad, and was later tased internally for his disobedience. He is the guy whom I remembered punched a lady at the villain's prison camp, and that was it. Although I wish the writer could do more with Slipnot, he really didn't need to be part of an over-sized squad. Viola Davis' character, Amanda Walker, was very difficult to understand. As far as I know, she convinced the government that the squad members can be contained, shot some of her working clients for no reason, survived from a aircraft crash and ward off some the minions, and is still a part of the government. You can correct me, if I'm wrong about her actions/character in the film. It's just that I expected a lot of her that the result made me care less of Davis' character even more. Finally, we have the main villain: Enchantress. A witch whom over a thousand years was trapped within a voodoo doll, and escaped thanks to her alter ego, June Moore. She's the same witch who wants to destroy humankind because of one thing: technology. Yep, that is the only reason, the ONLY REASON why Enchantress wants to wipe out humanity. Humans shouldn't use technology, even though SAMSUNG IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS FOR THIS FILM! Yeah, nothing like shaming the human race for doing a bad deed, when the film itself is a part of it, too. Sounds familiar (The Lorax)? With all that said, this isn't the perfect comic flick for the summer. I'd rather watch Captain America: Civil War again than to see this suicide mess. But, at least "Suicide Squad" did held some water make it through. So, is worth the watch? Maybe, if you haven't seen it and wondered what everyone's talking about. While I may not want to watch this movie again, it was a good way to end the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With an ominous worldwide threat coming to the fore and no remaining options to put it to an end, no-nonsense government official Amanda Waller decides it's time to fight fire with fire and recruits the most heinous, imprisoned supervillains to complete a black ops mission. The only question is can this 'team' of unpredictable, unhinged sociopaths band together and get it done? The setup is good, the cast is game, and there are some visually impressive feats, but the execution is surprisingly mediocre; action scenes are redundant, key characters are either never developed or left completely in the background, and the film never really gives you anyone to root for. Smith is in good form, and Robbie really goes for broke with her giddily insane persona, but beyond that it's a loud, uneven mishmash of music, action, and gratuitous cameos, with occasional touches of colorful dialogue and humor. Starts strong, but all the fun drains away long before the finale, making this another miss for the expanding DCEU. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>=======this review contains minor spoilers=====I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed Suicide Squad, and am genuinely mystified by the hatred it is currently generating, especially from film critics. This has got me thinking over why this would be the case and I have come to the conclusion that critics are expecting too much from what is essentially a two hour bit of fun and escapism.This is why I am blaming HBO for those responses. They have the time and space over five/six years to develop characters to such a level that the simple scene of one character 'holding a door' is brilliant, inventive and gets the viewer to reassess almost six years of development in one scene. A two hour film doesn't have that time or space, and I get the impression that critics often forget this when they point out an underdeveloped character brought in for five minutes with the clear plan to kill them off within that time.What you get with Suicide Squad is an enjoyable comic book Dirty Dozen ( well not quite that number but you get the drift) where you are never going to get all characters with a full backstory nor an equal number of lines or scenes, but all make their mark as required and I do include Slipknot in that.Now I'm not suggesting that it's perfect. It suffers from the usual ending of quick cut blowing things up school of filming and the end decisions of the big bad to engage in hand to hand combat is just plain stupid, but on the whole a cracking rompGo in, settle down and don't try to overthink what's on the screen and you'll enjoy as wellPS....as a little aside I've read comments over the misleading trailers which suggested that Joker would be the protagonist. I often complain about trailers giving too much away. This trailer has served a big red herring and I applaud the makers for this. More of the same pleaseThat said more of Leto's Mr J would be very welcome and I look forward to his involvement in The Batman</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most awaited movie of the year arrived with great expectations among the audience and speaking truly, I was just enough satisfied to watch Suicide Squad. The cast do their best to flesh out the characters, and Ayer seems to enjoy finding songs for the film's soundtrack, but the action scenes were not so remarkable. The biggest problem with the movie is that, despite all the villains, the main antagonist ? wisely hidden in the advertising ? was not so appealing and ridiculous. Fans will probably appreciate "Suicide Squad" for trying something different ? and it gets bonus points for diversity ? but the weaker characters and generally weak plot keep it from being one of the better comic book movies. I would go with 3/5 as it was not excellent but good enough to watch with new idea of villains fighting villains.</fullReview>

What it was a "grey dark movie" became a "pink sparkling friendly". I'm so disappointed with Suicide Squad, the movie had a great potential. And to be honest, who wrote the the joker lines and actions? That is not what Joker look like, hes looking like just as another spoiled teenager that just got his toy stolen. And the villain... he was literally created in 10 seconds, and half of the things that were happening with him were not even explained. It turns out that, Arrow's Suicide Squad is way better then this "film".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had too much high expectations to hit the mark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is my first time reviewing so I'll try to keep this short. I've seen people hating it and I've seen people praising it.I'm in the middle.Pros:Great variety of characters. Great visuals and special effects(better than BvS). Cool action sequences. Great soundtrack.Cons:Poor plot. Some characters were underdeveloped or felt out of place(e.g: Katana) Jared Leto's Joker, although has a nice attitude, it doesn't feel like the Joker.Also, his appearance doesn't contribute in anyway to the story.Rick Flag's and Dr.Moone's romance didn't convince anyone.It's a solid 7 out of 10. It has it's high points but it also has many flaws. Definitely a step up comparing to BvS. Some characters really felt out place like Slipknot but especially Katana. This movie focused mainly on Harley Quinn and Deadshot and little bit on El Diablo but Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc were left in the dark. The villain's weren't memorable either and Cara Delevigne's character has no substance to it. Probably only had like 20 lines in the whole movie. It's a good summer flick to watch with friends that could have been great if it was a little more polished. Sorry for any grammar mistakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Characters In A Untidy Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I have written a review, and with the split between fans and critics for this recently released film, I feel I should throw my two cents in. My experience with Suicide Squad comes from the animated film 'Assault on Arkham' and reading the first few volumes of the New 52 series. When this film was first announced, I was of course excited to see this movie. Unlike a few people I had few problems with the casting choices. Viola Davis I trusted would play a good Amanda Waller as I had previously seen her in the series 'How To Get Away With Murder' and she is effectively playing a character similar to Waller in that show. Margot Robbie's scene in 'Wolf Of Wall Street' where she teases Leo DiCaprio instantly sold me on the idea of her playing Harley Quinn and Jay Hernandez for me was ideal for Diablo having seen him performing as this unlike-able character that you grow to rout for when he's against worse people. This film ironically so was Hostel. My favourite character from the comic books is El Diablo, so I was determined to see his character done justice the most. My only gripe with casting was Will Smith as Deadshot. I knew from 'Pursuit of Happiness' he could do a good relationship with children, but Deadshot in the comics is, to put it nicely, a bit of a douche bag. I felt that Will Smith would make the character way to likable, and lack the ability to play this smooth, yet terrible person. Spoilers for a new 52 comic story Deadshot straight up kills another member of the squad for expressing their desire to kill Waller, because he wanted to be the one that kills her. But enough about my original views on cast and my connection to the franchise. Its time to talk about what I thought of the film. To put it honestly, as a fan of the comics, I enjoyed it. However, as a film, this one in particular left a lot to be desired. Getting my positives out the way first, the cast absolutely nailed their characters, and those that were barely in it, were interesting enough to want more of. Diablo,Waller, Quinn, and even Captain Boomerang were played fantastically, with each actor matching the personality's of their comic counterpart. Even Will Smith proved me wrong as Deadshot. Yes, there is a fair amount of Will Smith playing Will Smith, but he got Deadshot's bluntness, and passive aggressive nature down to a T. Some scenes in the trailers seemed to be Will Smith doing classic Will Smith lines, but in the context of these scenes these moments fit Deadshot's mannerisms perfectly. Kitana and Killer Croc were both side characters who were interesting enough, that I want to see more off them. That aside, the rest of the performances were everything from bland to shockingly bad. Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman were absurdly bad in this, and alongside Smith, Robbie's and Davis performances, they stood out as the worst. The soundtrack, was fantastic. However, it didn't always work. I would buy the soundtrack in a heartbeat, but the opening changes songs repeatedly with no real sound transitions in between, and it just feels like they are trying to capitalise on the success of the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack. The following will be my only comparison to the Marvel Universe. There is a difference between a good soundtrack, and one that works with the film. Guardians soundtrack worked, because each song had a vital part to play for the tone when it was used. I will never forget how they opened that film with a depressing death seen and then follows with a moody dramatic scene of Star Lord landing on this planet, with dramatic, serious music, and for a second you think this will just be a generic marvel movie. Then Star Lord presses play and 'Come and Get Your Love' starts. Instantly the tone shifts and you know this will not be just another generic movie. With Suicide Squad, they just seem to throw these big songs in there for the sake of it. Sometimes the music choices work, but with the others it just feels like they are throwing as many widely known songs as possible. It doesn't help that the soundtrack is also marred with very choppy editing, clear scenes thrown in from re shoots to brighten the atmosphere, a plot that goes all over the place, and some jumps in character development that come out of nowhere. I could talk about the bland villain, who I will not be spoiling in this review, but its not like that other big universe has the best villains, so I give the bland villain story a pass. Also, I haven't talked about Jared Leto's performance as the Joker. All in all, I was pleased with what I saw. This isn't Ledger's Joker or Nicholson's; this Joker is more of a crime boss/wild card. He's not in this much, and while lot's of reviews complain about that, I never expected to see him much. You needed him to help introduce Harley Quinn and while the film could have done more to embrace their seriously messed up relationship, I enjoyed their dynamic together, and Leto even gave me a stand out thing to remember which I will not spoil, but it involve's a flashback. Oh yeah, there are a LOT of flashbacks! and the opening while doing well to introduce the characters, may as well have been a ring announcer for MMA or Boxing, coming out and introducing each member, as that's what the start felt like for me.The reason it gets such a OK score from me is despite its problems, this is a fun summer movie, that comic fans will enjoy, flaws and all. 3 1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an Oscar winner but who expects that!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Felt compelled submit a review after reading all the poor reviews that (almost) kept me from going out to see Suicide Squad. We have to be realistic with comic book movies folks, these are NOT Oscar worthy movies Never will be. What a comic book movie is is a popcorn gnashing, soda or beer sipping good time in a dark theater with your friends that allows you to escape reality for a few hours. Does Suicide Squad accomplish this? With flying colors! Now is this movie perfect and set a new standard for comic movies? No it doesn't. It has its weak points with some character development and utilization, some questionable editing and jumping around with the plot (maybe a rated-R ultimate edition Blu-ray in the works again?) But nothing so terrible that it ruins the experience. Will Smith and Margot Robbie were AWESOME, and Jared Leto, while I would have appreciated more screen time, makes a great Joker. Overall I walked out at the end satisfied and felt my money was well spent.I love both studios so I have no bias but I do feel DC is still getting going with their new universe and it is unfair at this point to compare it punch for punch with the well established Marvel universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I anticipated it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews for this movie were pretty harsh. I don't think the movie was awful like a lot of people made it out to be. As you would expect, Margot Robbie stole the show as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto's Joker had mixed reviews (I thought he did a great job), Will Smith as Deadshot was great; I was expecting to like him as much as I did. I feel like there were some characters that should've gotten more screen time or character development, but a lot of movies are like that these days. The plot line is a little dull, boring, and whack. The movie strays from the plot line at points, but overall it was okay.I give this movie a 7/10, and I would definitely recommend people seeing the movie because in my opinion it is better than BvS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>K, here it goes. I liked it, I didn't love it. It's a 6.5/10 for me so I'll round it up to 7. Technology wise, the CGI was pretty bad on the Brother, he looked like an orange Electro from ASM2. I get that they didn't have very much time for character development, so they tried the Guardians of the Galaxy thing and do character development through music, which became messy. It worked in Guardians because they were using different songs to develop one character so there was a continuity of style. Here they attempted one song per character and there were so many characters it felt disjointed. I really like the graphic intros to the characters but I felt either you do them all or none of them. I wanted to see the Slipknot and Katana little baseball card thing. Enchantress needed more clear motivation, she was such a generic "I want to destroy everything and rule the world!!" Character with no passion behind her. It would have been more interesting if she were making this a purely personal attack on Waller. That would have been easily done. I do miss the concept that I originally saw where enchantress' machine was opening a wormhole for Parademons. I liked all the performances, I liked Joker much better than I thought I would. Harley was great, except for the bar scene where she fell flat, something about her delivery just didn't work there. I like that they didn't make Croc a stupid brute. He was intelligent and funny. I even liked Jai Courtney, I hate him in general as an actor, here he was pretty good. Deadshot, wasn't bad enough. I wanted him to be more of a cold blooded killer. The best character with the most depth and a great subtle nuanced performance was El Diablo. Jay Hernandez was fantastic in the role, he was the most real out of all of the cast. Viola Davis was bad-ass, as always. Rick Flagg was just American Soldier template #23 I really didn't feel he had any reason to even be there. The batman stuff was cool and the flash scene was a nice surprise. Overall I had fun, it was a definite improvement on BVS, it's not bad, it's not great it's good, and that's good enough for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent effort, and much better than BvsS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the hype I was expecting better from DC/Warner, but this latest effort suffers from similar overhype as BvsS.Starting with the positives:Each character of the squad had very decent portrayals from the actors ? granted splitting screen time amongst them proved a little problematical at times, but the essence and motivations were brought out for all to see.The little plot twist in the middle defined the character of the squad's controller, Amanda Waller, and gave us a very ruthless character with little enough to redeem her ? delicious.The not so positives:Batman rated very little time in this paeon to the canon. His presence was more throwaway than supportive. I was expecting more of a story arc where he either has a different mission or motivation to see this outing succeed or not. To get around this plot detail the writers put the action in a different city than Metropolis or Gotham (I mean really, Metropolis is across the bay from Gotham? Not in any DC universe I know) thereby giving Batman little stake in the feature.The soldier and the archaeologist being lovers is a plot device with very little credibility, doesn't follow any DC background history for the characters and although portrayed by Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne with gusto was forced and totally against type.What little background history scenes there were were only for the four main Suicide Squad characters.The downright inglorious:The Joker was downright distracting at times, in fact as a motivating factor for Harley Quinn it was too much, and took way too much screen time from the development of the other members of the squad. His flunkies were downright 'normal' instead of over the top crazy ? as a different 'reality' than previous incarnations in live film I would have to say I was left severely disappointed in his portrayal here.The really Bad Guys, once it developed who they really were, had virtually no background development, if indeed at all. Not enough time to show why they were so menacing or develop how they came to be. Hint: they have a vaguely similar beginning like the villain in X-Men Apocalypse.The 'magic' the Enchantress used was the plot device used as the reason for the squad's mission with little explanation and motivation for its use.Overall: It could have been better, and it is certainly entertaining. Will it stand up to contribute another score in DC's universe? Not really, but it's only a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough but a missed potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much after the critical disappointment of Batman v Superman, the next film in the DC universe Suicide Squad had gotten a similar thrashing of negativity from the critics. I disagree with the critical consensus of Batman v Superman (Love the Ultimate Edition, which is a much superior film to the original theatrical cut) but I don't think the critics are very wrong about Suicide Squad.Starting off with my problems with the film. First is Jared Leto as Joker. He wasn't Jokery enough for me. He looked pretty serious most of the time. But the amount of screen time and the kind of role he had wasn't enough to make an strong impression. Secondly, it tried too hard to be like Guardians of the Galaxy. I know some people made this comparison before the film was released but I never believed it or cared about it except then until I saw it. From the tone, the soundtrack, the brand of humour, a bland villain and the relatively simple nature of the plot. Except this one didn't work as well as Guardians. Thirdly, a rushed change in Dynamic between the Squad. For being untrustworthy bad guys they turned into a Fast and Furious like 'family' pretty quick. It feels like a lot of scenes were chopped up sacrificing the storytelling. The final fight has a 'been there done that' syndrome. The villains looked interesting visually though.As for what I loved- The Suicide Squad, the cast did a fantastic job. Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn single-handedly saved the film for me. She was absolutely brilliant and reminded me of the 90s Batman, the animated series from where she originated from. Will Smith has some funny dialogues. Character development for Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo was well done. It also contains Jai Courtney who is an otherwise a very bland actor give an entertainingly energetic performance as Captain Boomerang. I found it to be well paced and events occurring in real time added a sense of danger. It also has a unique sense of style.It contains a ton of DC related fan-service and Easter eggs, which may it tough for a DC fan to dislike the film. The film is pretty darn entertaining. There are a lot of flaws but none of them prevented me to walk out with a smile in my face. But when you think about it, it falls apart and feels like a missed potential to do something great. Overall, a disappointment.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Shines With Harley Quinn, But Lacks With Narration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly anticipated superhero flick in the list, after Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad amplified high assumptions all over, but coming to the point the 2 most salient features of the film was A team of bad guys taking lead job &amp; Jared Leto's Joker re-incarnation. The cast of bad guys suited up perfectly, but glooms in their light-toned characterizations.Star of the show Jared Leto's joker role made fans as well as movie-goers enthralled in the trailers, but coming to the scenario, his takeover was not distinct, despite joker's lady-love Harley Quinn shined the screen in every moment she steps in. Margot Robbie as harley was the film's main merit and makes us wants more of her titillating witty.Moreover, the film lacks in authentic narration which every fan expects, Director David Ayer's notion of storytelling was fine, but conveying lead roles past-present relating events, origins and the squad's team up events messed up &amp; makes this an average superheroes gone wrong flick which shouldn't happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoped Worst Turned Out Good.... "my rating 7.2/10."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well Suicide Squad one of the much hyped movies this year has finally arrived. I went to theater with least expectations as I was not hyped by its trailers but wanted to see because it was a part of DCCU. Seriously BvS trailer was much better than SS's trailers.BvS 3 hr ultimate edition was good than theatrical version anyway I will talk about SS. Critics have this movie a big THUMBS DOWN&#x1f44e; as they did to BvS but it was good.Unlike BvS WB injected some comedy in this movie and that's what pretty interesting plus the acting of Margot Robbie and Will Smith added a blast in this one. Rest of the cast was good. Ben Affleck's dark knight special appearance was very good as I liked him in BvS.Visuals and Graphics and Fight Scenes were good. Story was not as gripping as it would have been but that's OK it's usual with Superhero Movies. At least BvS (3 hr version) and this one doesn't let me down and i can look forward to WW and JL. I don't know why WB's movies are being compared with Marvel's as both's tones are different. I mean you know WB has its own flavor. But WB has still have to work hard in comparison to Marvel but that's OK it will do.Overall the movie was good and i am recommending you pls don't go with high expectations. It is strictly my personal opinion other depends upon you guys.My rating 7.2/10 (enjoyable yet forgettable).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good as a movie, not so much as a comic adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the theatre with pretty low expectations considering BvS, but I was hoping this would be better. Sadly the many things that made me cautious came true. 1. Will Smith as Deadshot; I love Will Smith, but when it comes to Deadshot I feel making him a snarky character with humorous lines takes away part of what I love about him in the comics, his professionalism amongst all the crazy people. "That's yer problem, lady. You believe people can be cured, be made healthy, be made normal -- that they can be saved. That they should be saved. But maybe the only way to cure some people is with a bullet between the eyes." -- Deadshot It's thinking like this that makes Deadshot who he is.2. Jared Leto; I had hoped that Jared Leto would do great as joker, but I was sad to discover that his performance left me wishing that he wasn't in it. He acted like a gangster and not like the multi- layered clown that Joker is. Now you can argue that this is because it isn't his movie, but I felt they took the clown part away and left us with a normal crime boss.3. Joker and Harley relationship; Now to make it clear I don't condone the type of relationship I'm about to make a case for. The relationship between them in the movie is one of crazy "love" where they both genuinely care for each other, but in the comics and most other versions it is a very toxic and abusive relationship where Harley eventually gets away from him and is better for it. The Lovey thing in the movie doesn't feel right for the characters.4. Slow motion; My final thought is about the use of slow motion especially in the final scene, Where Croc throws a bomb and Deadshot shoots it; this little scene takes about 5 minutes because its all in slow motion my companion and I both were dumbfounded when this happened because it was out of place and really annoying.Now because some might look at this and go "He keeps saying whats bad and nothing good." Well I thoroughly enjoyed Margaret Robbie as Harley, El Diablo was actually pretty good, same for Amanda Waller, and boomerang was acceptable also. The main reason I didn't mention this all at the beginning is that aside from Waller and Harley none of these characters were really fleshed out enough to mention in any depth. In conclusion, I don't think it was a horrible movie, but as a huge comic fan it disappointed me that it was as bad as it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically this movie kills it self, most of the time is overloaded with characters, music and plot that never seems to have a proper balance, you get a lot of unnecessary scenes/characters and just a peak of interesting and profound ones. The charm of this movie resides heavily on the Joker and Harley, while Deadshot motivations and background are a good and solid complement. But on the other hand there are a lot of weak links starting with Katana which is unnecessary and has a horrendous personification ( basically your typical Asian stereotype) followed by Mr. Boomerang, the Crocman and the underwhelming presentation of enchantress, cut down this characters and you will have a better movie. It seems that DC is rushing and trying too hard the "marvel model" that at least this time presents a huge missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start by saying I hate Batman Vs Superman. I really do, it is by far one of the worst superheros movies I have ever seen, but that is just me. But this isn't about that movie, but it does make a point of, I am NOT a fanboy. I think DC has had a bad start so far. Onto the review...Suicide Squad was FANTASTIC, by no means perfect, and certainly not a work of art, but a great summer movie and it did its job excellently. This move had plot hole, a weak villain, and some exceptionally cheesy moments, but Jared Leto did well as Joker, not perfect, but well enough where I am intrigued by his take on the Joker and look forward to seeing him be the villain of a DC movie. Will Smith, he was awesome. Made me laugh, not to mention, he had some really cool scenes, and Margot Robbie is exactly what everyone expected to see. As far as characters go, it didn't leave much to be desired (aside from more screen time with Joker, but this movie wasn't about him). Now, his movie is getting bashed by critics, and I can't see why, it isn't perfect, but it is better than Batman Vs. Superman (which it is currently ranked lower than). The reviews from the critics are so illogical at times that one can't help to wonder why (made me think of Birdman). I would also like to address a common critique from the critics, this movie was NOT choppy, but it was VERY rush at moments, an example (no spoilers) is a shot of a helicopter going down. No buildup to it, just falling. It was things like that. Some shots were too fast, and would have benefit from just a 4 or 5 second extension. But this does not make the movie bad. This movie is to me, just a little under Guardian of The Galaxy, because this one lazily jabbed all the characters backstory's in, almost felt like watching a PowerPoint presentation with their introductions. All in all, watch it. It is FUN, it is not Shawshank Redemption, or Heat, but it is a good action movie, not to mention it was very stylish with it's credits. If you don't enjoy comic movies much, this isn't going to change your mind. But it is a fun popcorn flick. Watch it, have fun, and leave it at that. Don't expect anything that puts you in awe, just look for a good time, and you'll have one.</fullReview>

I seriously don't get the doom and gloom of critics for these DC projects. Now that aside Suicide Sqade was pretty fun and you felt for these bad villains.Robbie and Harley Quinn , AAA as Croc and The Diablo Character stole this movie. Amanda Waller was the real villain really. Anyways the movie has some minor issues and thats what keeps it equal rating too B V S. The Director set up characters in this movie better then Marvel does because no Marvel Villain do you feel for. David Ayer needs too give Marvel casting and villain creating pointers.However The Joker Just was a miss for me. Im sorry but Leto made The Joker a over sexed looking Painting Clown more then A Real Joker. Affleck needs too maybe consider a different Joker for His Batman movie.The Villain Witch or Goddess stuff needed more story work really but the movie does not suffer any effects by story plot because the cast is so good. Wanna see A Sequel with a batman reluctant team up because of Deadshot and Batmans dislike set up in this movie. Movie was fun but still liked Deadpool a bit more. SS is 3rd Favorite comic Film Of 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful but not good either (spoiler free)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I apologise if I show any bias as I enjoy these comic book films however even my heart cannot make me ignore the problems. The biggest issue I think is the editing and pacing. There seems to be 2 very different conflicting tonnes. Whoever was in control couldn't seem to make a clear decision as to what kind of direction they wanted to go in for the film, whether that was the director's or the studio's I am unsure, but it makes the film suffer. The way the story is put together is very choppy, a lot feels out of place and pieced together incorrectly. Other moments seem to have missing parts that have ended up on the cutting room floor because several scenes feel as though they are incomplete. The plot is strange. Even though reasons are given to why things are happening, there never feels as though there is a reason as to why these events are happening and why the characters make certain decisions. Soundtrack I'm still undecided on, some of it worked, other times it was very cliché. CGI wasn't as atrocious as whispers have been saying but it does look off. The colour palette stood out for me and i found it quite pleasantly unique, very 'comic book' which worked in it's favour. The action is very...pedestrian and not that memorable the day after. Also some cliché formulas and cringey dialogue HOWEVER what the actors do with some of the material they are given is very talented, which brings me to the positives, because there are positives.The casting was spot on in my opinion. The characters and the performances are by far the strong points and what carries the movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is perfection. She isn't necessarily as scene-stealing as you'd think she'd be but my word you can't deny the charm and brilliance she brings to the character even with some of the dialogue and direction she is given, its just a delightful performance that feels like a psychotic hug which you cant help but grin at. Viola Davis also does so much good with what she is given, such poise from a gifted actor, the same goes for Will Smith, he is great, so is Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang as small as the role was. Jay Hernandez good. Jarred Leto good for what was given, it is a small role and not enough to base an entire review on but he was doing something and...it was intriguing enough. I even liked the look of Enchantress, not necessarily the direction it went but you'll see what I mean if you watch the film. The characters do feel overstuffed however and their arcs and backstory's crammed in. What was needed perhaps was if it was a "Deadshot" movie or a "Harley Quinn" movie in terms of back story given as cramming multiple backstory's into one made it overbearing.It is a shame as all the ingredients were there, something clearly went wrong somewhere because there is a good movie in there amongst the chaos. But I personally found it enjoyable, the characters and actors carried the film for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the dark comedy it was marketed as, it fails. If the story of two different cuts being merged into one is true, then the tones must have canceled each other out, because the movie ended up being dull. A lot of the entertainment value is from Will Smith and Margot Robbie as Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Most of the other major characters are visually interesting, but forgettable. Diablo is a walking cliché, being a Mexican-stereotype bad guy who redeems himself in death. Scott Eastwood and Common's characters ended up having no impact on the film at all, and there are a few moments that just don't work. There are some serious moments ruined by poor execution, such as the final battle using slow-motion to the point of boring me. Ultimately, I was disappointed, but I wouldn't say no to watching it again. I just wouldn't go back to the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad was a fun movie with a messy way of telling the storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie does not deserve the reviews they have been getting from the critics. I mean 27% ?! That's too harsh to judge on a decent comic book film. Yes there are some flaws, but throughout the entire movie, it was very fun. These characters are just hilarious and they crack up jokes throughout the entire movie. Margot Robbie was brilliant as Harley Quinn, Will Smith was fun and spectacular as Deadshot, and Jai Courtney was actually really funny as Captain Boomerang. Also, Jared Leto was also good as the Joker, although I prefer Heath Ledger's by a mile. Not only the performances from these people, but the story was not bad (except for the villain). The story gave them backgrounds and show the viewers who these characters are and I thought Deadshot's flashback was the best because it shows his love for his family, which brings to one of the best scene of the movie including Batman. Finally, the action sequence were mostly great, and the soundtrack of this movie are just brilliant. Although the movie was fun, the telling of the story was not good. It was a mess. The Joker was there (who we originally thought was the main villain), and the suicide squad itself, the flashbacks, the main villain Enchantress, and scenes with Batman and one of the justice league characters. It was too much to be shown into one entire movie. The Joker did not have to be in that movie, as well as Batman. But these are the things people want to see so they did put them in the movie. And WOW ! Enchantress was horrifying in this film. She was half stripper half evil... I don't even know. And Killer Croc was just useless. After all, the overall storyline of Suicide Squad was good, but because the writer includes these people who just do not fit in the movie, it makes the telling messy and cramped together. But hey, I had fun. It was certainly better than BvS in my opinion. This movie gets a C+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rant/Rave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I admit, I'm a little biased. As someone who's been an avid Harley Quinn fan for years (as well as a Jared Leto fan), I will attest to the fact that Robbie and Leto were the main grab for me, as I'm sure they were for 85% of audience members. That being said, I have a few qualms about how these characters are portrayed. Let me start out by saying this movie was DA BOMB . The soundtrack is great, the cast is diverse (although I could've done without Cara Delevingne's poor excuse for acting), the characters are strong, and, despite extenuating circumstances, altogether likable.However, being of the 85% who saw it for two main reasons, I was a bit disappointed. I am not here to compare Jokers (to be honest, I'm in the small minority that didn't enjoy Nolan's version of the DCEU), but to analyze the complex, and infamous dynamic between Harley Quinn and the Clown Prince, himself.This relationship is not one to aspire to, built on lies, abuse, and manipulation. Harley Quinn is an inherently feminist character, not because she's subject to such abuse, but because she is a well-written, relatable, anti-hero who, at the end of the day, is actually brilliant (she is a doctor, after all). Yet, despite having the body of a 10 and a psychotic super villainous boyfriend, she is just like us?those who would do (almost) anything to attain that love and validation we so desire.With that in mind, I was very disappointed to see so little backstory between HQ and MJ (Mistah J). On-screen, the relationship between Robbie and Leto's characters actually comes across as love. Robbie even becomes "dumb," or as Liz Lemon would put it, a "sex idiot." She's there for the box office?she possesses little to none of her characteristics that have brought her character such appreciation over the years. She is literally just there to look sexy, and get punched in the face, and run into poles as a gag. "Haha, watch the hot girl run into bars. Isn't it funny?"HQ has, unfortunately, become a character that exists strictly for the male gaze; a sex pot in hot pants that can beat people up and is probably a freak in bed. Yes, I am disappointed that this is what she's become. But more disappointed for the women watching it, thinking that she's someone to aspire to?someone who's worth is based solely on her looks, and who has found "real love" with a green-haired, lipstick- wearing sociopath.That being said, this movie is more than worth the $20/ticket price tag, for the enjoyment alone. Will Smith is charismatic beyond charismatic, and we really get a feel for the humanity of these villains (and the inhumanity of the "good guys;" re: Amanda Waller).7/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before reading further I want to layout my movie c.v Movies which I find excellent in this genre1. The dark Knight trilogy2. The avengers Movies which I find alright, with high potential going further1. Man of steel2. Iron Man 1 Movies which I frankly do not like1. Batman v superman2. Hulk 2008Now to review this movie. Characters1. Very well introduced, we know where they come from, what they are capable of, and why they are there.2. Dead shot and Harley Quinn are the leads and they not disappoint even for a moment.3. Joker is just pure awesomeness, people say he had very less time, I think he was in it for just the right amount of time. This joker is more crazy than the Dark Knight joker. 4. Amanda is the boss, Flag does what he is supposed to do, nothing too delightful, because his character was just a middleman between Amanda and dead shot frankly. 5. Supporting squad members all are entertaining especially Diablo &amp; Boomerang. Katana and Croc were just there and wouldn't have made much difference if they were not. 6. Cameos, Flash and the Batman make appearances, but they were negligible. 7. Motives were clearly laid out for the villain. Action1. All of the actions were clean and easy to follow, not forgetting entertainingStory1. Story was easy to follow. Everything had a reason to occur, and whatever was unclear, were negligible. Emotions1. Some parts were however this isn't meant to be a serious movie, its more like a fun movie with a serious take on magic. Characters who are serious or fun are what they are because of who they are. Flaws : a bit of spoilers1. During the climatic scene at the end, questions were raised as to why the flash didn't turn up. 2. Part of the villain history is not clear which is a very integral part of the evil side in this movie. Summary This is the guardians of the galaxy of the DC universe. If we look at the movie from that perspective i.e its mostly meant to introduce characters and entertain you, you will be more than impressed as it delivers more towards realism and a grounded approach than it's competitor. The hate that it's receiving, 26% on rotten tomatoes at this time, is hilarious. I would question my movie review critiqs or websites on their neutrality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was a movie that at the start of the year I wasn't all that hyped for. But as the months went past and the marketing started to kick in, a week before the movie I was completely pumped to see it. Fast forward a week later however, and we were faced with negative reviews from the critics, a fan petition to take down Rotten Tomatoes and director David Ayer having to come out to defend his movie. I'd be lying if I said that all these external influences didn't play into how a viewed this film.Overall, I had fun with this movie. I'm someone who sits on the side that really loved the dynamics of the team and loved everything about the Suicide Squad itself, but the story, villain and some of the directing choices really let the film as a whole down. With reports now coming out that there is another version of this film floating around somewhere, which seems to be something the the DC films are starting to have in common. Like I mentioned, there were many scenes from the trailers that didn't appear in the film which I really want to see, so hopefully, there is going to be some form of ultimate edition on the Blu Ray like BvS. On a side note though, this is my favourite theatrical DCEU and this was one of those situations like BvS where it was expectation verse reality.7/10 - See full review at thenotsonerdynerd.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

Harley Quinn stole the show with her acting and craziness.Dead shot was good and had few gags.Enchantress was good but could have been better in both CGI and acting.And CGI at most of parts were really bad and mostly at climax,it was like they used something outta early 2000's CGI.Joker was good a different one from Heath Ledger joker , well acted but had really very less screen time. Overall a fun-action movie,but don't go with high hopes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the movie... 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch the movie? Suicide squad, as the title reads, the movie delivers as expected. However, the movie does ?like many, have its pitfalls. It's everyone's desire to walk into these movies wanting to feel power, evil, good, heroism, defeat, power, hatred and most of all see their favourite villains i.e., the Joker ?flawlessly perform psychotically. The movie deserves an 8 for a number of reasons. The movie is entertaining, humorous and thrilling to watch. Scene transitioning is excellent and at no moment will you feel bored or lose interest. The director makes sure to keep your attention at all times and ensures the characters steer towards the plot.The only flaw in the movie is the growth of all characters. Not all characters get equal time in the spotlight, as such, certain characters lose their purpose in the story. The climax's focus is on a fictitious character with mythological powers which certain audience members may not really connect with. This may perhaps, be the downfall of the movie. However, if you really love comic book movies then you will appreciate all characters and their purpose. The overall movie uses the power of evil for good at every turn, brings audiences of all ages together and fulfills your comic book cravings.It was a good movie.Cowsi http://superstarmoviereview.blogspot.ca/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I am really disappointing. The beginning was promising as it introduces our heroes (villains*) and how they previously were put in prison, it gave me chills after briefly featuring The Flash and Batman, which, along with the good editing, was no match for the disappointing remainder of the film.My complaints overall: - Slipknot being introduced in several different articles and trailers before, only to be featured in the movie to be killed off for the purpose of scaring the Suicide Squad.- Enchantress being the villain after being shown previously to be a member of the squad.- Killer Croc probably had less than 5 lines in the whole movie.- Deadshot hardly wore that awesome white mask of his.- Harley Quinn did not change at all, and remained the same crazy character which appeared funny and interesting in the beginning-middle -ish parts of the movie, but soon died down.- The middle of the movie.- The end of the movie.- The mutant creatures that were clearly easy enough to be killed by a wooden baseball bat.- Enchantress as the second villain form.- The brother, an ancient god, easy enough to be killed by a bomb.- Rick Flag, the special ops trained soldier, easily dragged away by the mutant creatures as oppose to a woman with a wooden baseball bat.- The Joker survived the helicopter crash/ jumping out from the helicopter, especially without any kind of visible wounds.Overall I am glad that I got to see the movie, and also glad that we had free tickets to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Fun Despite a Seeming Lack of Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big problem with this film is a problem Batman vs. Superman had: instead of introducing characters in a stand-alone film, they tried to cram multiple characters' backstories into one movie, leaving it feeling disjointed. So at the very beginning of the film, we're shown something similar to a trailer for each of the members of the Suicide Squad, leaving us little time to set up a conflict for our characters to go through. It's rather unclear what the motive even is until half-way through the movie. The second half of the movie is a lot better than the first, since most people will be able to pick up what's been happening, plus we get to know our characters even better. That's the one thing this film does well; we're finally able to see a more human part of the villains in a comic-to-movie adaptation. Even though the villain is rather lame and has no setup, a lot of the fight sequences are fun. If nothing else, this is a fun movie that tossed out a lot of jokes that earned laughter from the audience. One last thing to praise is the diversity of the cast, that not only featured multiple ethnicities, but also let them speak in their native tongue, which was a refreshing change. Despite feeling rushed, it was a nice movie to help take your mind off things for a while.Also Deadshot stole the show. Joker who?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part, I hate super hero movies. Absolutely hate them. All of the Marvel characters; Superman, Batman, etc. I've never understood the appeal. However, my kids wanted to see this movie and I agreed to go along.I wasn't expecting much, but I was quite surprised, as this wasn't your typical (anti) superhero movie. Still a lot of silly characters (Killer Croc, what the heck was that?), but the story line, action, and dialog were pretty good.Margot Robbie stole the show however. She did an amazing job. I was very impressed. Will Smith was pretty good as well; not his usual over the top arrogant character. Well, maybe a little, but not as much as some of his movies. All in all, a pretty good summer time flick. Kids will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't what we came for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that the movie belongs to Robbie, giving a flawless performance of a demented, eerily likable Harley Quinn. She's the only truly satisfying thing in a deeply frustrating film. Since late 2015, we've been flooded with sneak peeks, clips, extended trailers and interviews with the purpose of letting people know that missing out 'Suicide Squad' would mean to be left out of a movement of unprecedented proportions. This new concept of a anti-superhero movie left everyone wondering just how such a group of psychopath misfits fighting for their lives would be. Jared Leto as The Joker had everyone losing their minds. The hype was huge. And then came Batman V Superman, also belonging to the DC universe. BvS received massive criticism for its 'way too dark' atmosphere, when compared to other similar blockbusters such as Marvel's Captain America:Civil War. And then came the re-shoots. With the purpose of reaching a wider audience, Ayer ('Fury','Training Day') tried to smooth things by introducing more comic moments and making it a PG-13. And that's the thing: at times, it ends up being too soft. This is a movie that supposedly features the worst people on the planet, and yet it doesn't make you shiver once. The scariest character up there is Viola Davis's Amanda Waller, a US government official (got the irony?), that comes up with the plan of assembling a task force to fight the next Superman, we're told. However, when 'Suicide Squad' gets it right, gets it very right. We're introduced to the members of the squad through flashbacks of their lives, and that's when we get to know the bad romance featuring Harley Quinn and The Joker. Robbie and Leto's chemistry is out of this world, and so is their life together. The Clown Prince of Crime ends up making Arkham Asylum's psychiatrist Harleen Quinzel fall madly in love with him, to the point of her throwing herself to a pit of acid for him, leaving us wondering: is she only acting out for her puddin or is she mad crazy for real? The doubts quickly fade as we see present Harley hanging from her cell's sheets. This girl is crazy, very very crazy. He did torture her though, but she never seemed very bothered about it anyway. Will Smith's Deadshot is one of his strongest performances lately, as the hit-man that also happens to have an 11-year-old-girl that means the world to him. Both Quinn and Deadshot are brought in by the Batman (or as Harley calls him, batsy), played by a still-recovering- from-the-trauma-of-negative-critics Ben Affleck. Jay Hernandez's El Diablo and Jai Courtney's Boomerang also get their own flashbacks, as well as Cara Delevingne's creepily beautiful Enchantress/Dr. June Moone. We also get to know Colonel Rick Flagg, a surprisingly sensitive Joel Kinnaman, who is in charge of the mission they're heading to. So you get the point, the best part about the movie is the characters. What follows is a sort of a boot camp, where the bad guys prepare to the mission that will probably get them killed. It turns out that the mission is actually a kind of stupid one, fought against kind of stupid creatures, but aren't all superhero missions? It's a blast, and that no one can deny. Although numb at times, David Ayer comes up with incredible shots, mainly the ones featuring Harley Quinn (I really can't get enough of this girl, she could turn on a married mother of five. That elevator fight scene is glorious). Although the CGI isn't perfect, far from that actually, every single one of them seems to shine in their own way, making us forget the crappy show we're watching with strangely satisfying performances, particularly the villain (can't say won't say). And between almost dropouts and lacks of motivation, they do end up being the team we all wanted them to be. At the end of the day, they're just normal people who just didn't get what they wanted in life. And that's the problem, you know? We do end up feeling for them, rooting for them, like we do in superhero movies. There's a bunch of people who aren't evil, they're just good guys who do bad things, and that wasn't the whole purpose of this thing. Damn it, the only genuinely bad guy here is reduced to a 15 minute cameo-like performance. That's right, The Joker shows up three or four times, and most of those times you can't even tell where he came for or why he's there. So much of what we saw of him in clips or trailers didn't end up making the final cut, and how can you decently play a character like that in 15 minutes? How could he have matched the likes of Ledger, Nicholson or Hamill when he is almost reduced to a guest actor? Overall, it's great movie. One of those where you laugh and are entertained, but you can't stop feeling unsatisfied, that wasn't the deal. Not with this one. This wasn't what we came for.</fullReview>

I think that the people who comment that didn't like the movie will propably see a SuiCide Squad 2 because the people are stupid and like to complain. I'm complainning too but I'm right. It's because of those people that movies like that and like Batman vs Superman have a huge audience. But its OK. I really didn't understood the meaning of the last part of the movie when Bruce Wayne talks with Viola Davis. Its a good movie to be forgotten. The popcorns were delicious by the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full T.C. Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest addition to the DC extended universe, Suicide Squad, bears all the hallmarks of its predecessors, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. It features widespread destruction and the deaths of countless unnamed extras, while the only bright colors are those in the title sequence and end credits. The plot and character development feel very rushed, probably because this film attempts to fit the introduction of TEN main characters and their mission into two hours and three minutes. This makes it hard to empathize with the Squad members, who can't seem to decide whether they want to run away or fight an impossibly powerful CGI foe. As for humor, it was immediately clear that the execs wanted to capture the success of Deadpool without the R rating. Unfortunately, this fails for the most part: many jokes awkwardly fall flat and even the best ones aren't funny enough to really make you laugh. True to form, all of the main characters inexplicably survive, which makes you doubt whether any superheroes will ever die in any movie ever, but there were a couple redeeming qualities. Will Smith (Deadshot) does a good job as the unspoken leader of the group, especially compared to Joel Kinnaman (Rick Flag), a cardboard cutout of an army grunt. Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Jay Hernandez (Diablo) also turn in fine performances, and Jared Leto's Joker is solid, though not nearly as scary or convincing as Heath Ledger's. Overall, any easygoing moviegoer or serious fan of the DC movies will be pleased, but I personally found Suicide Squad to be decidedly average. Considering that this was my most anticipated movie of 2016, I left the theater disappointed. On a final note, please appreciate the ridiculousness of the bar scene towards the end of the movie where our heroes(?) decide to walk into the nearest abandoned hotel for drinks despite being in the middle of a destroyed city occupied by jungle zombies.</fullReview>

They tried to address weak character development this with a "hockey card" (excuse my Canadianess) type bio at the beginning of each character introduction. Also the villain/villains were not interesting at all and should of been 1 and not 2. Someone needs to let the producer know that sometimes less is more. Seemed like they tried to introduce too many characters at once. Avengers was more successful at this because most avenger members had a previous movie, letting us know who they are and creating an attachment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was at least as much fun as Guardians of the Galaxy. I gave GOG a 6, gave this a 9. Instead of an irritating raccoon we get a delicious Margot Robbie plus the Joker. It never ceases to amaze me how every Marvel movie gets rave reviews and all DC movies have "bad script" etc etc. The soundtrack was great. From the Rolling Stones to Credence Clearwater Revival. Songs from my radio listening days. Most of the leads did a very good job, especially Robbie. She really stood out. Great supporting cast. And this is always what makes a good movie. It felt like a comic book, not some convoluted mishmash from the bent mind of Stan Lee. And thank God, no cameo from that incorrigible HAM. Really Stan. Go some where and sell tacos or such. Stan, see Alfred Hitchcock. He knew how to make a cameo, and did it with class.For a summer fun movie I'm guessing this is going to be the no. 1 fun movie of this season. It was so good I may go see it again. Something I haven't done since movies became available on DVD. I got most all the jokes. Maybe it takes more intellect than most critics have-or they're just all Marvel fans and WON'T ever say any thing good about my boyhood heroes.Go see it. If you don't get the jokes; read more real literature then go see it again. It should make a real difference. Boog</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harley Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is not as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe. I had zero expectations for this movie and I was pleasantly entertained.Why was I entertained? Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Robbie was absolutely fabulous as Harley Quinn. I had reservations about her since I could not see her as Quinn; yet she was perfect. She channeled the essence of Harley Quinn beautifully. Now I am not a Will Smith fan at all. I have not been a fan of his recent movies. In this film he is very likable and charismatic and both he and Robbie steal the show.The script is below average and the action is so-so. The big baddie is laughable and most of the movie looks like it was poorly planned out. If it were not for Robbie and Smith I would not have liked this film at all. Add to it: Jared Leto is awful as The Joker - just plain awful. He is as annoying as Lex Luther was in Batman VS Superman and you just want his character to disappear. The other performance that was beyond bad was Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. Kinnaman is worse than he was in Robocop - and that was pretty bad. I feel that different actors would have been better as the Joker and Flag - though The Joker really did not need to be in this film and his parts took away from the whole project.Recommended only for the Robbie and Smith characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad, deserving Near Perfect Movie, blundered upon a standard Fun/Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie ladies and gentlemen, was a good fun action-packed summer blockbuster movie. I rate 6.8/10 and most people would agree since I've seen most reviews linger their rating of the film from 6-8/10 tops.Now the ONE thing 90% of the people who has watched the movie, considers that the characters are the foundation of what might have been a FANTASTIC and NEAR PERFECT summer movie (near perfect because every movie has flaws. The characters and the actors portraying them was splendidly impersonated and let me elaborate MY thoughts:STRONG Char:Deathshot: Will Smith DID EXPONENTIALLY well with portraying this comical hit-man character into something that could be his stamp upon the DCU or even in comic film history. The way he acts upon a cliché but reasonable cause is what drives the audience to root for his succession even though he plays the bad guy.Harley Quinn: No need to tell you men, and ladies of chaotic nature, this Crazed, psycho diva is what probably drove the entire film, IF NOT Deathshot himself. Margot Robbie was FAN-TASTICAL in this movie, two words for DC, MMOARRRR PLEEEAAADDDGE!ElDIABLO: Ohhh wow, when I thought they couldn't get any other character to withstand the onslaught of Harley and Deathshot's scenes in the film, I was proved wrong by this Character's involvement throughout the main plot. Jay Hernandez, the actor did an astounding job!Cpt. Boomerang: Being someone in Australia, this guy, played by JAI COURTNEY, the actor that I thought wouldn't deliver to any roles given to him.....actually... delivered. WOW. I was blown away to how renowned he was upon setting this character INTO the DCU, even though "Australia" is hardly recognized in the DC comics.Joker: I'm one of those people who loved different variability in individuality. The new take I am fascinated in, AND I CANNOT WAIT for Jared Leto to capture his TRUE Joker moment.Weaker Chars:Killer Croc, this character is actually played by Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje, and if you don't know who that is, he's one of my favorite English actors to date. And although he played as a monster, he actually gets his personality right, JUST WISH WE HAD MORE!Flag: A Tactical Specialist Soldier, nothing too sophisticated to care about really..Dr.June Moone/Enchantress: Possibly what most people hated about this movie, on how the actress Cara Delevingne played her and her STORY progression wasn't reasonably the best and not slightly enforced upon the viewers, she was more of an asset to her own agenda and I never felt the worrying matter for her to come back.Slipknot: What can I say.. this guy was seen to be expendeble when he was the only one without a sophisticated flashback/backstory sequence in the group, HECK even Kitana had a few lines and action. You could say he couldn't "climb" out of this one.I'm not going to talk about Amanda Waller, she wasn't the VILLAIN she was suppose to be.The plot point is what hit this film the HARDEST. DCU is faltering with it's story telling, editing and writing. If WB can FIX this and change the way they're making DC films through story, then DCU might pull through the long haul. Suicide Squad was possibly disappointing for fans/critics alike seeing as it was MEANT to be a film of near perfection or at least be CLOSE to being Great film with little flaws, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.And yes, some of the music editing were obnoxious, even to me. Unreasonable placements of irrelevant music was also what killed the movie for some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that spectacular.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all those Marvel movies, DC opened with Suicide Squad. In a world without Superman, we need bad guys to protect us. Yes, Batman caught some of these bad guys, but still, we need them. I guess Batman was too busy, with what exactly? This movie Obvious has some major flaws. But if we don't look at all those flaws, we see what this movie really is made of; a mixture of good and bad actors and actresses and some cosmetic make-up of special effects which made this movie a bad Marvel look alike.The movie starts with retro introductions of the bad guys. That was a bit awkward. Margot Robbie was a terrific Harley. Will Smith had a great come-back. Very beautiful his bond with his daughter. I did not get this Australian guy with his boomerangs, like I did not get the guy of The Avengers with his bow and arrows.The thins about these movies is that these actors and actresses have to act like they are scum. IRL they are very rich and have a rich life. So while watching the movie, it just does not make any sense. I did not feel the hurt or grief of the characters.I like Jared as an actor. Has been watching his movies from the nineties. But the Joker is still Ledger. If you can't make a better sequel, just don't. The end of the movie, I just did not get it.The movie as an intro for a better movie is succeeded. This movie as itself is not worth watching a second time. First time is painful enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a dumb, shallow, non-unique, full with flaws but sometimes fun B- movie which is expected to be a A-movie because of it's brand and budget. It's one of the worst comic book adaptions of recent memory, and it could and should have been better. However, I came with zero exceptions and the bottom line is I mostly enjoyed it. I'll note some of it's flaws: -The villains are unique-less, weird magic-zombies led by an annoying and overly-sexualized character with a boring and pointless side story about an affair with the squad's leader. -I didn't like the new Joker, who had a completely useless and pretty small part here. -Harley Quinn is an annoying slut. If I wanted to watch a movie about asses, I would have stayed home. -The final battle was 10 minutes of dancing silhouettes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sooo...I just came back from the cinema where I watched this movie. My first quick impressions are:1. I never want to see this Joker. Please, don't make a film where he will be the main character. I honestly was glad when the helicopter crashed and he "died", thinking that my ordeal was over (unfortunately, I was wrong). I liked Jared in other films and I think he's a great actor (and musician), but for this role it seemed he kind of overacted.2. Margot Robbie and Will Smith saved the film. They seemed natural in their character and they succeeded in making me care about their character. 3. Some scenes didn't feel good at all (ex. the moment when Harley breaks a display window to take the purse - felt like that scene was randomly placed there).Overall, the movie was entertaining (with some good jokes slipped here and there), while having its flaws. Definitely not the best film of the year, but it deserves a view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Start Flat Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was probably one of my most anticipated titles of 2016 for the summer ever since the announcement and my love for both Marvel and DC and especially after the amazing animated title Assault on Arkham which if you haven;t seen you definitely should a great animated title with the suicide squad and batman and joker all together. It's hard to say what exactly the issue was here but mostly it feels like the start of the movie it's going to be fun but falls flat afterwards. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy which was a surprising hit for me and others this movie seems to lose it's fun afterwards.First off lets talk characters. Will Smith was obviously the star as was Margot Robbie who stole the show as Harley Quinn and nailed the character perfectly, Will Smith played..... Will Smith he didn't encompass the Deadshot I know and love from the comics which I can accept but he just didn't play anything other Captain Hillard, Agent J with a new set of weapons and skills,IE it's nothing new to the role and he doesn't bring much here. Viola Davis does a bang up job as Amanda Waller she's psychotic horrible person, who's either your best friend or worst enemy, not good not bad but she'll do anything to get what she wants. The rest of the cast does a great job also and their chemistry is bang on and then there's Jared Leto's Joker..... I remember when people bashed Heath Ledger for the role of it and ended up being amazing in TDK, Jared Leto when he got the part I have to admit was excited to see how he'd bring life to the role, and even after the backlash of how his character looked, I still wanted to give him a chance, as I would with any character. Sadly The Joker is not only underused but the character is just off and seems to be there as a selling point for people to go see the movie as The Joker is one of the most popular villains of all time, yet here he's given not much time, and not much to do with the role. The rest of the squad are OK El Diablo is fun and Captain Boomerang is a very guy, all in all their chemistry together is fantastic, the quips, jokes and fun they have, shines on the screen. The Story is easy, a bunch of criminals are set up after the death of superman to be controlled by government to do missions no one else will do and if they die, so be it they're criminals anyways, and if they survive they get benefits and time knocked off their sentence. Of course one of the squad decides to disobey and cause a ruckus ( Enchantress) and then decides to let her brother out and start building a weapon and destroy everyone so it's up to the suicide squad to take her down and save humanity. Sad part the villain is very boring... both of them are, and this would've been good to have maybe used the joker as a means to be the villain much like Assault on Arkham, but we get a very bland villain with silly motivations and while the first half of the film has a unique style and flare, the second part drags and stops using that fun throughout. Guardians seemed to use the formula correctly whereas SS seems to have tried to make it fun dark and fun. It could've been good but in the end much of the film suffers from just pacing issues, being bland and story dragging out. It's not to say the movie is bad the cast works great the characters are fun but the movie as a whole just felt in one word very meh... Not bad not memorable not great just OK. Decide on yourself if the movie is good or not you may hate or love it, but in all just felt there could've been more done, here's hoping much like the BVS extended cut the Suicide Squad is given extended look when it comes to home video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbalanced, Yet Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me state this very clearly. I'm not DC fanboy nor Marvel fanboy. What I stated in my review is just a personal opinion from years of watching both DC and Marvel movies.Now, let me first stated this. Suicide Squad has the potential to become a good movie, if only the director put more time on the production and not rush things. Unfortunately, it's the opposite that happened. The unpolished gem with lots of potential in it, has been wrongly polished into a flawed gem. For me, below is the main weaknesses of the movie: 1. Plot that was too thin, shallow and dense. I might say, it's just too dense and too random for me. There's not enough background story to actually support the movie. Sure there's a bit of explanation along the way, but that still doesn't help much, given how little information they give us so far.2. Dialogues that don't make sense. For this one, I have to highlight the reasoning that were uttered by the outlaws. The reasoning seems unbelievably shallow and the action afterward also doesn't make sense. Another reason why the director should have taken his time to develop the story.3. Overshadowed members of Suicide Squad. Given the name as a squad, you should at least tell the tale in a fair manner and fair portion, right? But throughout the movie, seems to me, only Deadshot and Harley Quinn get the spotlight. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew (Croc, Boomerang, El Diablo, Slipknot and Katana) were only there to make the actions more interesting. Too bad really.4. Unnecessary appearance. Talking about this point, bring us to the appearance of Jared Leto as Joker. Sure, all fans have been waiting to see how Leto perform as Joker. While I'm pretty happy with his performance in Suicide Squad, I failed to see the significance of his appearance in the movie. Personally, I think even without Joker showing up, the movie could still progress smoothly.5. Inspiration that came too late. I admit, this one point is a bit random, but I got my reason. Throughout the movie, I saw some resemblance with Marvel's story telling. In this case, I'm going to compare Suicide Squad with Guardians of the Galaxy which also consists of former outlaws and also used lots of classic songs and some dark humor.Now, of course it's not fair if I'm only telling about the negative points. Let's see the positive points:1. Will Smith and Margot Robby. Ironically, one of the down side of the movie, also serve as the savior for Suicide Squad. Both of these marvelous actor and actress are doing really good and (David) Ayer was lucky that these two can carry the flow of the story.2. Non-Stop Actions. Without this point, Suicide Squad will turn into a very boring movie. Lucky for Ayer, this one point also managed to save the somewhat standard story out of the dark hole it almost fell into. Not the best one, but definitely enjoyable.3. Jared Leto as Joker. While I lament the unnecessary appearance of Joker in the movie, I'm actually relieved to see that Leto has shown yet another interesting version of Joker. Leto's version in this one was shown as someone psychotic crazy and yet charming. Of course we can't just compare his appearance in this one to those of Heath Ledger's just yet, as Leto's total screen time is probably not more than 8-10 minutes. It's actually interesting to see what kind of Joker will come out later on to make Batman's life a living hell.All in all, even though it's dense and shallow, but truth be told, it's still quite interesting to watch the action. At least the action is quite good (though some of it are unbelievable) and both Will Smith and Margot Robby have performed wonderfully as Deadshot and Harley Quinn.If you're looking for a movie with complex and dark story, than this is definitely not for you. But if you're the type that can go easy on the movie and just enjoy what you see, you will not regret watching it. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but not as expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I want to make a shout-out that:BEWARE OF SPOILERS!!!At first I believe that DC universe can be as good as Marvel, now I doubt that.What should be the holy grail of the DC universe, the movie's begins with an enjoyable first act. The introduction of the huge cast is good enough for people to know their backstories. But once it enters it's second act, it's safe to say that the rest of the movie is a chaotic, all-guns-blazing action scenes and weak dialogue, which makes the movie not as expected as the trailer says. The acting of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Viola Davis are the best out of the cast. The three, who played Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Amanda Waller really stand out and the only ones who saved what was going to be a disastrous movie. El Diablo's backstory is great and he's a good scene stealer alongside Quinn. The Joker is great but it's disappointing that he appeared for only about 20 minutes when the trailers shows a lot of his scenes. I also liked the Joker-Quinn side story. The action scenes are great but for me it's a little excessive. The CGI was good but it got worse on several scenes, some even seems really fake and simply ridiculous. The story is the worst of all the comic book movies I've ever watched. The story makes no sense that I don't even know who's the baddie here. Some characters were simply a well decorated background, they had small screen time and little backstory, which is a waste of great talent and a great letdown. Killer Croc and Katana were an example of them. Katana even spoke Japanese here and only has ONE English sentence, which is truly disappointing. Oh, and who's Slipknot?Is it a great action movie? Yes it is, but is it a good superhero movie? I don't think so. Suicide Squad is an enjoyable action movie, but one of the worst comic book movie adaptation. Actually it can be better, but well, money of quality, they said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but a generally disappointing and empty affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd think that a film with no less than nine major characters would be jam-packed, even overstuffed. That was a problem for DC with just four players in Batman v Superman, so I was hugely surprised to see what an empty film Suicide Squad is. Despite a decent start, the film descends into generic blockbuster territory, and we never get the zany, manic entertainment that the premise suggests.However, before I get into what disappointed me so much about this film, I want to touch on the best part: the performances. For all the mistakes that David Ayer's screenplay and directing make, the lead actors do a great job at injecting some life and energy, with Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Joel Kinnaman putting in both an impressive, and most importantly of all, entertaining show throughout.In fact, the strong performances make for some a good few enjoyable moments throughout, moments that save this film from being a total mess. When we're not focused on the overall plot, and in fact centre on the members of Suicide Squad either quarrelling or banding together, there's a lot of fun to be had. The contrasting personalities make for some pretty entertaining clashes, and the fact that there are so many characters gives good variety too, which I was very glad to see.Apart from that, however, Suicide Squad comes off as a bit of a nothing film. For starters, the story is almost entirely stationary for the first twenty minutes. The characters of course need some background to set up the film, but that can be done whilst advancing the story along. Anyway, the first act isn't that bad in comparison to the rest, as we do get some good insight into the characters, and a good few laughs too.What really disappointed me about this film is its main plot. A generic premise it may be, with a group of characters going to defeat a powerful being, but what you need to make that work is fast pacing, good humour, and entertaining action, and Suicide Squad had none of that.Apart from the fact that the film features one of the least threatening (and often most laughable) villains ever put to the big screen, given the way that the villain ends up standing in a building flailing their arms about for the entire movie, the story essentially features a team of a dozen or so people walking through a dark city, only with the goal of defeating a faceless and uninteresting adversary.The few moments of squad joviality did make for good fun, but that just didn't save my interest given the way that the film simply watches them move slowly through the city, with such little tension. I tried to keep my spirits high, and I expected the craziness to ramp up towards the final act, but I was so saddened to see how the film continuously got worse and worse, and never managed to provide a truly exciting and entertaining blockbuster experience.Another thing that the film promised was Jared Leto's Joker, so let's talk about him for a second. On the plus side, Leto makes a very menacing villain, and I'm hugely excited to see him tackle Batman or others in a future film. However, Leto's rather serious and dark performance feels hugely out of place in this movie. Suicide Squad attempts to interject humour amongst its dullest periods, but that really clashes with Leto's Joker, who seems much more at home in a gritty gangster thriller.Finally, I want to talk about David Ayer. Ayer is a great director, and made films like Fury and End Of Watch. Unfortunately, his rather gritty directing style feels very much at odds with both his more comical screenplay, and DC's typical visual palette. Ignoring the emptiness of the plot for a moment, Ayer's normally visually thrilling style is undermined by a greyish and dull colour palette, whilst the more intense action moments (which worked beautifully in his other films) don't work when the film tries to be funny too.Overall, I was very disappointed by Suicide Squad. It's a film that first and foremost lacks a strong screenplay, but is also a mess given its failed mixture of comedy, grit and action. On the whole, I felt Suicide Squad was a generally dull and empty blockbuster, and only the strong lead performances brought a glimmer of the craziness that we all expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat story with entrancing performance.(Spoiler free review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the so hyped 'Suicide Squad' today and man oh man, it is absolutely ravishing. From the very first scene till the credits rolled, the movie was a roller coaster of uber action, emotions and amazing character transformations. The comic book based flick had loads of pressure of delivering and living up to the expectations of crazy fans and indifferent critics. However, It was not able to suffice the latter, for which nobody is to be blamed. Apparently rotten tomatoes doesn't hate DC as their ratings come from aggregation of reviews from various newspaper and websites. The fact might not be digestible because that would suggest that media, as a whole, intricately is somehow disagreeing with the work of DC. But that all might just change with the launch of this offbeat cinematic story of Bad vs Evil. The story is pretty simple to fathom. Since always lurking evil finds a new way to rise in Midway city (centered in BVS timeline), mean Amanda Waller, brilliantly played by Viola Davis, who is a high government official takes up the herculean task of creating a team of maniacs, cons and metahumans to hit evil back to the ground. The character execution by Will Smith, Margot Robbie and fellow actors will seriously convince you to sit tight till the very end. Joker, played by the Oscar winner Jared Leto, goes hand in hand with her on screen love interest Harley Quinn, to which Margot Robbie has done justice to. Their chemistry is off the hook. There were few scenes which slowed the execution of the movie (first few scenes from the second half) but it picked up the pace gradually. The mix of comedy and despair can be scene when Captain Boomerang(Jai Courtney) and Deadshot(Will Smith) get screen time. All things considered this movie can mark the work of David Ayer (Director) in History, when in the first time ever Antiheroes take the stand as Protagonist to ward off evil from the face of the earth. At the end of the day DC can finally take a sigh of relief as Suicide Squad puts them back on the map.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film with some problems! Deja vu with a DC film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this film I was hoping that it would be better than batman v superman, which i never thought I was ever going to say, and steady the Warner bros / DC ship. Did suicide squad steady the ship and be a better film than BVS, well yes and no. It seems i am repeating my thoughts towards both DC properties that have been released this year, good films with some/ a lot of problems. Now i believe that suicide squad has similar problems to BVS, which are story, structure and the third act. However there also some different and more worrying problems about this film. The first problem with the film is the villain, who is incredibly weak and not threatening in anyway. I really liked enchantress early on in the film when she was more of a witch, however when she turned into this "arm waving" queen thing it didn't work. This really bugged me especially once she started turning people into this weird and meaningless creatures just for the squad to kill. The other problems of the film are the structure and the third act which are both all over the place. It really shows that director David Ayer was reportedly only given 6 weeks to write the script, the ending is very predictable. However there is a lot of promising and good things in this film, which for me tips the scale to make this film good. The performance all across the board are fantastic, Will smith wasn't "will smith" he actually played a character that I cared for. Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn, she absolutely nails the spirit and the craziness of the character. Those two are a step above the rest, even Jai Courtney was likable in a film, hallelujah!!! Now lets get onto to the Joker, who I can't really comment on because I haven't seen enough to judge the performance. I think Jared Leto did an good job but I just need more, like appearing in a batman film, for me to appreciate and acknowledge the performance fully. Talking of batman, once again in the DCEU his is absolutely fantastic and Ben Affleck is brilliant, although his only in the film for about 5 minutes he is one of the best parts of the film. Another little side note is the Flash, which was surprising and makes me more excited to see him in Justice League and his standalone film. Finally suicide squad has a lot of problems with script , structure and the third act however the characters and the performances for me just about out weigh the negatives of the film. However I can see how the critics have torn this film to pieces and the reaction of people who really enjoyed it. DC have had 2 strikes this year lets just hope that Wonder woman next year can safe the day and its not 3 strikes and out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as the movie ended I became pleased about the overall of the movie. I'm only gonna spoil at the end of this review with pros and cons, so feel free to skip the pros and cons! I've read that Warner Bros. had 2 versions of Suicide Squad, a darker tone from David Ayer and a lighter tone from the studio. They decided that the best thing to do would be to merge the two versions together. The result? It was OK but not that OK. In my opinion, I believe that you can only choose one version when editing the movie. You either make it softer and lighter or you make it brutal and darker, (the one I wanted). I wanted it to be just brutal, dark and serious because that's what I recall from the Suicide Squad Comic-Con Trailer (2015). The problem of the movie was not just that. They put a lot of characters in just one movie. That's not bad for me, because I'm a DC/Marvel comic-book reader, but for others who have little or no knowledge about the DC Characters. The movie, for me (as a fan of DC/Marvel/Superhero Stories), was fantastic (despite some flaws) but for someone who is trying to enter into the superhero's universe of DC is HARD since they will question during the movie "Who is that? , why is he/she there?" and etc. And for them the story might have been boring.Here are my Pros and ConsPros: - Some humor moments - Good Character Interpretations - Awesome Action ScenesCons- Moments where the story was irrelevant and uninteresting - The villain</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missed opportunity but still entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sometimes I could just kill myself' said Jack Nicholson's Joker in 1989 before putting a gun to his head and pulling the trigger, frightening the bejeezers out of Kim Basinger. We've come a long way in 27 DC years, because now we have a whole team of nutjobs all willing to put their necks on the line in Suicide Squad (2016; 123 mins). Kinda willing, anyway, if willing means doing what Viola Davis' Amanda Waller tells you because you have a Snake Plissken-style head exploder inserted into your neck. Thus coerced, and commanded by goodie Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), baddies Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Capt. Boomerang (really?) (Jai Courtnay) and a host of others form the squad and set out to?do stuff. Warner Bros/DC really needed a pick me up after the critically- mauled Batman vs Superman earlier in the year. That film has gone on to make $870 million and change worldwide, but there is an extended universe to consider and fan faith can only take a series so far at the box- office. Have they got one? Well, kinda. It's a film that starts very strongly. For a good half hour there is heaps of fun, actual fun, to be had as the squad are introduced, quirky stats and titles coming up alongside them as they are fought and caught by certain familiar vigilantes. It could have been annoying but it works and it promises much. It felt like I wanted to learn more about this world and I was enjoying being in it. The cast, too, works for the most part. It is inevitable that some members will be squeezed in order to make room for the big guns, and an opportunity for some real inter-team sniping is largely missed, but everybody gets a scene or a bit of a scene, and Robbie and Smith are very watchable, the former pretty much stealing the show as expected. Director David Ayer (End of Watch, Fury), a pretty sombre character himself, doesn't sell all of their moments as seductively as he should but neither does he drop too many clangers. The only two that come up short are Kinnaman, a man who must have a terrific agent because he is quite simply boringly awful in everything ever, and Jared Leto. The latter's Joker will be a matter of personal taste. He does a decent job selling nuts and his goons are great but I'm not his biggest fan at the best of times and, having loved Heath Ledger's incarnation, this was not the best of times. So the team is mostly decent and a good tone is set?one that is consistent with the darker DC world and at the same time brighter; the film's look is pretty good, so we're all set and?then someone lost focus. Just as with BvS, coherence is this film's biggest problem. There is a WTF? moment to challenge Batman's crappy dream sequence about half way through, and suddenly we are in a story that just doesn't work well enough. It still feels enjoyable because of all the personalities and the fighting and whatnot, but it's all over the place, and the central plot ends up feeling and looking like something from 80s flick Masters of the Universe. Not a comparison anyone at WB would want drawn, I'm sure. There is an inherent schism in the DC world due to the vast power variance across its chief heroes and there is some of that here. Marvel had the same problem with The Avengers but it was overcome with ease by concentrating on the inter-team dynamic. With villains this should have been easier and there are flashes of the same but not enough to stifle creeping realisations that some of the characters, in fact most of the characters, are actually a bit pointless and ill-fitting for the story they went with, some elements of which appear lazily written (there are some shenanigans with a bomb that are just lame). But hey, you know, overall I liked it. A super-powered Dirty Dozen is a great concept and there is a lot to like in it, it's just a shame it goes wonking its way into la-la land rather than doing something more interesting with a good set of characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big potential left unfulfilled, but still well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a potential to be a milestone and one of the biggest successes of the genre in recent years. It has superb cast, very cool characters, a refreshing idea that psychopathic villains are the stars - everything looks so cool and promising in the beginning of the movie (and the trailers). The ground is well setup.However, a lot of it is left unfulfilled later and it feels like it could've been much better. First, characters eventually don't show enough of that "craziness". The studio should've just unleashed them, let them go wild and do the crazy things they're supposed to do, even if that means it would be R rated.Then, the script is so so, and the directing and editing jobs leave a lot to be desired. Something doesn't work as smoothly as it should've.Still, it's by far not as bad as critics portray. All of the major cast is doing an excellent job, especially Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. Dressings and make up is superb, it's like watching a comic come to life. Soundtrack is cool. All of these are enough to make it interesting and enjoyable. Don't miss it, well worth watching despite the issues!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really frustrating because it had serious tone issues and plot issues that distract from a great movie. When it's good it's amazing but every time I got on board there would be weird editing or such that distracts. I don't want to say the people who liked the movie were wrong because it is fun and does have a dark vibe to it that are great. On the other hand, David Ayer was made a dark movie which was then mixed with the studio throwing in more Guardian style scenes. I like both styles, just not together. It tries too hard to be Guardians, even using a song used in Guardians, to the point where it doesn't have a focus. A lot of scenes were edited a little too quickly and felt out of place. I think if this movie were edited right, it would be amazing. The entire squad, Harley and Deadshot, is charismatic, likable and has a story with individual traits. If you go in looking for that and fun action, you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harley, Croc &amp; Lawton were really good. Really wish there was a Croc vs. Batman fight scene flashback like an epic waterwheel fight perhaps with Croc falling off a waterfall n disappearing &amp; so ending up in an ARGUS prison cell.Arrow/Flash did Amanda Waller, Katana &amp; Captain Boomerang better I think. Still wondering why they even used Captain Boomerang. Really did not add to the plot when u have a major hit man like Dead Shot in the mix. Clock King would've been more interesting and u could have done a bit more interesting tech stuff to wow us tech geeks in the audience. Really did not care for the portrayal of the Joker. Too much gangsta - I mean bling and gold teeth? REALLY?!! He just didn't seem like the ultimate Batman arch nemesis. Would've appreciated a more Mission Impossible feel rather than such a CG rich movie - just didn't feel like a Suicide Squad sort of Mission. I kept thinking Batman or Flash should be showing up to save the day from worldwide epic doom.#SuicideSquad #IamaDCFangirl #DCIexpectbetterofyou</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad | Worst Heroes Ever with great potential, but wrong execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is an all out entertainer, a movie filled with fun. But if you take it more seriously and go in riding the hype, you are going to be disappointed. Go in with low expectation and you will have the greatest and most entertaining movie experience of this summer.So Let us dissect the review and let me tell you why the worst heroes ever are not a part of worst movie ever that many people seem to be saying.First of all, Suicide Squad is about a group of criminals banded together by Amanda Waller played by (Viola Davis), and the team of villains involves Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney ), Diablo (Jay Hernandez ), Killer Croc, Captain Flag and Enchantress (Carla Delvigne). And joining them is Jared Leto as Joker.The thing that we need to remember is that there are hell lot of characters involved in Suicide Squad and most of them have never been seen on Movie Screen across the world. So every character needs an introduction which makes the first 40 minutes of the movie as just introduction to various characters as their name is shown in fancy colors with Flashbacks covering the introduction. Now this marks up the theme of the movie and the movie never loses that theme. Its clear that the director wants you to know that the movie is not taking itself seriously.This lead to another complication, the lack of time leads to lack of good base to form characters on, and without a good base, a character can not stand. This is what happens with most of the members of Suicide Squad, they are forgotten after a few scenes and are added just for a few gags in every few minutes or so. This soon becomes a little annoying and boring. The Director David Ayer flourishes the character of Deadshot and Harley Quinn, but in the process leaves behind others, especially Boomerang.The Good : Moving on to the good parts of Suicide Squad : Jared leto as Joker : Jared Leto did his completely original Joker in Suicide Squad, He takes the fun of Jack Nicholson's Joker and the insanity of Ledger's iconic performance and multiplies them together to form this highly insane and utterly charming antagonist. The movie has very less Joker, but the amount of screen time he gets, he makes it worth it. I cannot wait where his character leads to and would love for him to get a much broader open role.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn : Harley Quinn is Joker's Queen, she will do anything for Joker. She will die and even live for him. Once the psychiatrist of Joker, she fell in love with Joker and left everything for him. Margot Robbie not only is gorgeous and her seductive remarks brilliant she is completely unpredictable as Harley Quinn, just like herself in Comics.This bring me to another great thing in this movie, The chemistry between Joker and Harley, they are born to be together. The queen to the joker as they are made to go together in a game of Solitaire. The genuine obsessive love is drawn out by both actors brilliantly and kudos to director for creating that chemistry in between all the actors in the movie.Will Smith plays Himself, he fits right in as our lead actor he is brilliant, he has more back story which solidifies his character even more than others. He has his humanity with him, and a loving father to her daughter. The interesting bit is the sort of 'father-daughter' kind of relationship that Deadshot and Quinn has, they understand each other more than anyone else. The bad Let's see, Joker is not even in 30 minutes of the movie, that makes the best thing in the movie also a the bad thing . The overly sexualised Harley Quinn does not go well with the flow, especially regarding the PG-13 rating it got.Weak Villain: I won't spoil anything, but the motive of Antagonists to go against 'the world' is a laughable one dimensional plot device. The choppy editing makes it even worse. You can easily see that many scenes are abruptly cut, probably due to the re-shoot they did and the pressure after the failure of Batman v Superman.Bad Camera Work and Direction: Now this is the point that took away all the score of the movie. David Ayer forgets that he is directing a Superhero Flick driven by action, we get a lot of close up and not even a single good enough wide angle shot throughout the movie. Now this is the fatal flaw in his direction and Suicide Squad, he relies too much on few characters which isolates and separate other characters from the movie.What Avengers and Captain America Civil War and Even Zack Snyder's Batman V Superman did was get all the characters which are part of the team inside the frame. In almost every scene in Civil War, more than three characters are together, this gives a momentum and stillness to the story that is hard to achieve. It also solidifies the team. Suicide Squad does not feel like a Squad because of this reason.The excessive use of Shaky cam is another down point in Ayer's Direction. Conclusion 7/10 Fun Summer Blockbuster with few brilliant performances. Full review and other reviews at www . filmicsite .com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(The Sequel Slasher) CRIMINALLY Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is the latest DC Movie and lets just say that the DC crew have not been doing so well with the Critics lately. With BVS being beaten down by critics and fans alike. Suicide Squad the the DCCU's last chance to secure the cinematic universe and In my opinion it succeeded. Sure it has a lot of flaws like the great but odd soundtrack with seemed to play songs left and right. Also some pieces of rather cringy dialogue with a less than stellar villain and her throwaway brother. That was It, I enjoyed everything else, If you're looking for a good harley quinn, deadshot, killer croc e.t.c, It's all here. If you want to see a grounded, life changing, emotional experience of a movie, what the hell are you doing coming to a movie called Suicide Squad, geez. Not to sound defencive but I feel the critics are hard on this movie because they don't get it and they don't understand it, because it really wasn't made for them. Now a movie should try to appeal to everyone but the critics are giving it crap because they're focusing too much on the downfalls that I mentioned before, I mean go see the film, make up your own mind. In my opinion, Its got some hiccups but also some real strong points which makes this a damn of an entertaining movie. If you've ever seen the movie Commando, you'll know both movies don't care what a film should be and focus all their energy on entertaining the audience. Shouldn't that be enough</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad suffers from Zacification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Margot Robbie! TADA!! That should have said it all. That should have been the one thing that mattered. After the masterpiece trailers showed just how great she was as Harley Quinn, I knew I was going to see this movie. No one else, nothing else mattered. Harley is a sexy, twisted, bad girl that I know I would never get close to in real life. Thank God for fantasy out of reach in this real world. Thank Margot for her portrayal. I hope she gets a chance to take Harley on again.You can thank someone else for the fact that even Robbie could not save this perfect example of a typically poorly directed super-hero style movie. While Harley had me glaring at every move she made for the first half, she lost her allure in the second half as she became less appealing. The whole movie seemed to have lost its character in the second half. Joker was not needed. 11 minutes of gratuitous joker seemed a waste of time and I feel his presence dulled the movie. Yeah, Leto put a lot into the character but, for what? I imagine his absurdity is what softened the impact of the other characters. All of the characters were interesting but not so desirable as Harley Quinn. And while I am at it, Amanda Waller was bad-ass enough, but she had to destroy her employees? WTH? Totally uncalled for. Sure it's only a movie, but that move made no sense.My suggestion is to accept the fact that any movie that has Zac Snyder's name connected to it is going to suck as in Sucker Punch and everything else he touches. If you want to see Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, even for only the first half of the movie, then you should go.When DC and Warner realize how shallow Snyder's movies are then they might be able to get on track for quality movies. I just have to wonder if Snyder is so lacking in personality himself that he does not understand how lacking his characters are in his movies? (Yes I know he was an executive producer). Maybe DC and Warner should give total control to Chris Nolan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually, this movie was amazing. There were so many wow factors without me giving anything away, but the writing was awful. There were thinking gs said that just either didn't seem necessary, or awkward. Nothing best that bar scene, though. Awkward to the extreme. I felt like they just needed to get this weird storytelling bit out of the way, and so they jotted something down and threw it in the movie. It was so strange. Don't get me wrong, it was fairly funny but the writing could have been so much better. I'll probably see this again once it's on DVD, just because that's how nice it was to look at. My conclusion is you should definitely go see it, because you can just tell so much work was put into this. The actress who played Enchantress really just blew me away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, yet not memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not expecting much so I am writing a positive review. The characters are even quite well conceived, actors are OK, I think only the Joker was not very well explored, Jared Letho is usually an impeccable actor, here I do not think he really delivered his best performance. The plot itself is pretty weak, what really saved this movie are some of the funny things the members of the squad say, but honestly, there is not much of a story to tell and what the viewers are going to watch is a few minutes of explosions, action, gun shots, but nothing really impressive. I would suggest this movie if you are looking forward to spending some time with friends watching a motion picture that will not, by all means, drain you brain's energy. If you are looking for a terrific movie about anti-heroes, stay far from it. You may get really disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talented Cast makes a poor script worth the watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto are all entertaining and make this worth the watch, but the movie fails on almost every other level. The script is the majority of the problem here. It's bogged down by loads of exposition and backstory, the majority of the characters are suspiciously lacking any kind of personality, and a lot of the one liners are cringe worthy. David Ayers movie was in tremendous need of a rewrite here, but Warner Bros hurried him a little too much here. Maybe the movie's problem was the reshoot to add more humor. I don't know, but there is no excuse for a director as talented as Ayer to be working with a script like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best, but Sort of enjoyable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has SUPER low ratings on Rotten tomatoes and the reviews make this sound the WORST comic book movie EVER made! This movie follows a bunch of super villains who are press ganged into working for US Government and work as its on the ground assets. After Superman is gone, they don't have a first response team and they decide to use these expendable criminals for the job.I have NO idea why this movie is facing such a huge critical backlash. Articles calling it the worst movie ever made etc etc is just over the top and meaningless. It would be safe to say, the critics got it wrong this time.How cool is it to see the flashbacks of these villains and heroes like Batman and the Flash apprehending some of them! the start is pretty good, it almost like a proper comic book where you have small cameos of other heroes randomly without making it a big deal...The positives in the movie are Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. They both absolutely shine in this movie. Surprising, when it comes to performances, Jai Courtney as Captain boomerang was pretty good! This guy is usually REALLY bad in movies such as Terminator Genysis but somehow he was pretty good in this movie. other actors do a decent enough job, but nothing worth a mention. The score / music track is a mixed bag with a lot of 90's hits being played at random times.Now we come to negatives. It might seem like I am listing a LOT of them, but seeing the movie, somehow it not all that glaring.1. Joker. This Joker s just PLAIN bad. Like a 0/10. Seen better performances in a C Grade film. This is hands down the worst joker EVER committed to film, this included the 1966 version. The first scene with him and Harley in a strip joint is just cringe worthy and it doesn't look like the director actually made that scene, it seems like a bad add on. His Ha ha ha was SO bad, I wanted to shut my ears and shout at him to shut the HELL up. Which moron came up with this joker ?2. The editing. What wrong with WB movies? Same as batman V superman, the editing in this ALL over the place. But thankfully unlike BvS, this movie isn't complex and nuanced and hence the bad editing doesn't hurt it so badly. For example, there is a night scene, then suddenly without any kind of transition, it's a day scene. It jarring and surprising to see such a bad edit in a big studio movie.3. The Villain. Hands down the WORST villain ever done in a big budget movie including the fart cloud in Green Lantern. The villain (Spoilers- Minor) is Enchantress and even tho is 100% smoking HOT, she can't act at all. She is literally dancing in one major villainous scene. I don't mean this figuratively, she is grooving like Micheal Jackson in BAD. WHO THE HELL came up with that crap ? What was his villainous plan ? GOD knows, it was stupid and badly done.4. The direction. WB movies are all suffering from this. This is just badly directed or maybe just cut bad in the edit. The movie is good only because the performances are VERY strong. But they didn't get the feel of a city in danger or people dying, evacuation, nothing was done right. Wish it had more time to setup the city and what was at stake.Despite all this, the movie is not bad or UN-watchable. It's a simple plot with not many twists and its easy to keep up despite the disjointed edits and bad direction.Overall its worth a watch for comic book fans IF you are not expecting a master piece.Rating : 5.5/10 . Definitely NOT as bad as the critics are saying, its watchable and at times fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Talented Cast Trapped in a Rushed, Crowded Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad, the next entry in the ever bleak DC Cinematic Universe, is here and frankly I was disappointed. The hype for this film was big and expectations may have been admittedly very high, but this film fails on a level deeper than just a bad movie where a good movie was expected. Suicide Squad features a great cast, but falls flat in terms of story, and rushes through its already thin story. What's so sad is that the formula for a really good movie was there and the filmmakers ignored it completely.With a film that has so many talented stars in it, and Jai Courtney, it's not surprising that the expectations were very high for the film. Will Smith is not immune to bad decisions when it comes to his films, but he's pretty good at rising above them and making films better all on his own. Jared Leto is pretty great in this film, he'll undoubtedly be judged by comparisons to other Joker performances, but just on his own merit he was great. The entire cast did a good job, Smith, Leto, Viola Davis, and Margot Robbie were all excellent in their performances, but they were failed by a poorly crafted film.The biggest problem is the fact that the screenwriter and director seemed to not be on the same page, when it came to what this film was about, or more precisely who this film is about. To me, it's about Rick Flag and the Enchantress. However, clearly somebody in the process missed that and felt that every character needed an appropriate amount of backstory, which they don't. The result of this confusion is two cardinal sins, the first is that the audience is given a lot of needless scenes of backstory that we don't need that waters down the story. The second and far more egregious is that the better story was very clearly sitting within this watered down, and crowded mess that we ended up with.Without spoilers this film rushes through introducing all of it's characters and giving backstory, for almost every one of them. Frankly there are more subtle and effective ways to show us something than 5 minute flashbacks for every character. Above that we can't care about the characters, besides Amanda Waller who you will grow to hate because Viola Davis gave an amazing performance, which really hurts the film because they were on to something. The painful thing is that if the filmmakers had looked at what they had, they may have noticed that certain alternative plot points would have been far more emotionally impactful, and they just missed them.It's easy to see how some will enjoy this film, it's not boring, or unenjoyable. This film just suffers from the same problem that Batman v. Superman did, the better film rests within the mess we were given. In the end Suicide Squad is rushed, crowded, features a weak villain, and feels like a poor man's Guardians of the Galaxy. That being said kids may enjoy this film and comic book die hards like will too, simply for the spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great characters and performances, inconsistent storytelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it really as bad as the critics are making it out to be? No. But it is not too good either. It is the worst DCEU film and comparable to the lower-rated MCU films. And I will put forth why I think so.Before I start my actual review, I want to mention that I loved BvS (Ultimate Cut) and really liked Man of Steel and believe that both these movies are very harshly judged.Okay, through this review I will give my thoughts on the major things that have been pointed out by the critics.1. Characters: Once you reflect on it, this really is about the characters.a) Deadshot: Pretty good. Will Smith plays a role similar to the roles he's played before. But he brings a certain level of gravitas to the film. The character has a good arc, albeit a little cheesy but this is a really good performance.b) Harley Quinn (and The Joker): Fantastic. Margot Robbie knocks it right out of the park. There is not one dull moment whenever she's on-screen. There are some scenes in which the nuance in her performance really shows. Her arc was, unexpectedly, very emotional. Also, the criticism that she's a male fan boy's wet dream unwarranted. She is above all else, a psychiatrist and she knows what will attract the attention of the people she's with. She's not just the female equivalent of the Joker. There are layers to the character, and the film nails it. Speaking of the Joker, I didn't write a separate piece for him simply because everything he does in the movie is somehow related to Harley. That said, Leto is pretty good too, bringing to life a very different Joker than previously seen. He is simply not given enough time to shine, and I am very hopeful. The thing that is probably the best about this movie is the relationship between The Joker and Harley.c) Diablo: A complete surprise, this character is given a good arc and we totally understand his motivation behind every act of his. Besides Deadshot, Harley Quinn and the Joker, Diablo is easily the most impactful.d) Amanda Waller: The bad-ass, puppet master, even though the character is a little underwritten. Viola Davis makes the best of whatever lines she's given, even though some of them weren't great. But justice was done to this character too. She could've made a much more interesting villain than the one we got, but we'll get to that.e) Captain Boomerang: The comic relief is barely given an arc in this, but damn, he was funny! Jai Courtney seemed to have a lot of fun! f) Killer Croc: Make-up work was great, but was disappointing. He barely does anything in much of the movie and is very underwritten, considering that he is one of the two 'meta-humans' on the team.g) Katana: Another underwritten character, but she's okay I guess. Does have a couple of decent scenes.h) Rick Flagg: Surprisingly effective, is not simply an errands-boy as Deadshot calls him one time. Has a commanding but not overpowering screen presence. His dynamics with Waller, Deadshot and Enchantress are good.i) Enchantress: The worst thing about the film. After a cool introduction and some dramatic beats with Rick Flagg, the whole Enchantress stuff just nosedives and never recovers. It's a pathetic attempt, really. And the acting was really inconsistent too.2. Structure: When the critics say the structure is messy, they are absolutely spot-on. The movie starts with character intros beginning with trading-card like information and flashbacks with psychedelic, neon tinted images and abrupt editing. It was too sensory for me at first but then it started growing on me. I like experiments and I appreciate a film that tries to be different. But this tone is dropped midway and the gritty second act comes in and it just starts feeling like a different movie and then it becomes a weird, fantastical story in the third act. The villain is so lame that an act of destroying a subway train is actually more effective than one involving destruction of the world, blah-blah-blah.3.Tone: Since the structure is so disjoint, the tone of the movie is jarringly inconsistent. The film is very unsure of what it wants to be. It starts as a prison movie-video game montage-music video, then turns into a zombie movie, then finally turns into a fantastical tale. It has elements romance tries too hard to be funny at times. Now don't misjudge, a movie can perfectly be all those things, and a lot of these scenes in this work very well independently, but the transition is very rough. It's almost as if the whole movie is a big lengthy trailer, which is mostly due to bad editing.4. Music and Score: A lot of the critics have pointed out that the music feels as a cheap attempt to mimic the successful use in Guardians of the Galaxy. But I never found the music too noticeable and I believe it actually added to the story in certain parts. There is just one Eminem song which feels out of place and tacked on. The score is decent though.5. Plot: Pretty much non-existent. The whole movie is mostly just exposition. But I didn't particularly mind that. In fact, I kind of liked the small-movie vibe of it where everything in the movie exists to showcase various facets of each character.6. Villain: The villain in the movie is too generic to even talk about, so I'm going to talk about the real villains here.Warner Bros. executives.In spite of all this, I think the film is an enjoyable experience and the general audiences might enjoy it more than BvS. I am really excited to see some of these fascinating characters in more (and hopefully better) movies in the future.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the actors, music, choreography, CGI animation.. story line is a of normal super hero movie(but better then Marvel's implementation). But, you can't expect a The beautiful mind type movie in super hero genre, right? Story went a little fast. But intro to character was sufficient and fun enough. Loved the Harley and Joker. Will Smith was awesome. and twists were good. Overall it's a fairly enjoyable movie with family and friends. It's not bad at all for teens either. Batman's entrance was good and it will contribute to DCEU later surely. Please take me as a fan of DC. I love both marvel and DC. But, I like the dark theme of DC and serious mood of movies. Mature audience will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical Superhero/villain movie with an average story. But the acting is well done, the effects are good and the art style is fantastic. Some characters are more highlighted than others but the same happened in Captain America Civil War. Though Slipknot was really unnecessary and the Joker could have had more screen time. Brilliant acting by Margot Robbie and Jared Leto as the movie couple of 2016. It is also an enrichment to the genre of superhero movies because the focus isn't on the superheros like in ALL the others.In my opinion the movie is on tie with the Marvel films which are also entertaining and not cinematic masterpieces, that's why I vote 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood tried to do something new! Yeah, it wasn't perfect, it had weaknesses. But in the wake of recent bad reboots and remakes we should be celebrating this movie. For a start the soundtrack is awesome. I have an all new appreciation of bling. The first two trailers, the one with I Started A Joke and Bohemian Rhapsody could do with awards. The big supernatural element was not advertised in those which was a surprise. But I thought hey it's a summer blockbuster and they need to put CGI and destruction in it. Oh, the climax reminded me of Ghostbusters and Enchantress looks like Evil-Lyn. You still hating?So ignore the reviewers trying to get themselves attention by tearing it down. Enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad, Boom!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suicide Squad" is a great time at the movies. Director and Writer David Ayers's "Suicide Squad" makes absolutely no sense. That really doesn't matter nor I would guess was it ever the intent. Will Smith is all movie star swag with deceptive nuance. Margot Robbie is brilliant 'oh snap' irony as psycho killer Harley Quinn. Nuance is not the "Suicide Squad" strong suit. However, Smith's assassin Deadshot salvages the movie with his paternal gravity. Robbie is a revelation in her brazen self-awareness of Harley's curse ?both comic and sad. The movie critics completely misjudged the overall appeal. In a striking battle sequence the charismatic Smith as Deadshot, stands upon a fiery car shooting with Zen-like precision at an army of carbon headed soldiers. Yeah, you have to see the movie. Contrast this with a quiet exchange between him and Robbie's Harley as she genuinely asks, "You ever been in love?" He says, "No. Never." She knows that's bulls**t. Smith and Robbie refine a lot of Ayers's broad narrative strokes. Ayer sporadically inserts insight amidst the high decibel noise. He could have done more. He benefits from generating strong performances throughout, especially from Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis. Having expendable criminals saving the day has been done before. "Suicide Squad" triumphs in that we end up caring about the Suicide Squad, despite being the "bad guys". Viola Davis is at her ruthless best as CIA Director Amanda Waller, who proposes assembling the world's most powerful and deadly criminals as protectors in case heroes like Superman go rogue. They are called "meta-humans". On the upside, the Government has plausible deniability, and the Suicide Squad is expendable by design. Apparently, this reflects the aftermath of "Superman vs. Batman". Having capable Special Forces operatives alone like Rick Flag, played by strong and smart Joel Kinnaman, are insufficient for such a scenario. So it is up to Waller and Flag to recruit the Suicide Squad. Flag brings in guardian executioner Katana (tough Karen Fukuhara), the woman samurai grieving the death of her husband, wielding a magical sword. Fukuhara is good, but expressively handicapped by her mask. The Katana lapse illustrates that there are too many super criminals in "Suicide Squad", and not enough back story. Members of the Suicide Squad have heinously killed many people, mostly innocent. So transforming them into heroes is daunting. We see the ripped Deadshot (Smith) punching a bag trying to survive in prison. His daughter is his only reason for taking on this mission. Harley Quinn (Robbie) is an uncontrollable killer, who was turned evil by Batman's nemesis The Joker (creepy charismatic Jared Leto). Quinn is The Joker's lover, and he is the source of her power. The side story has The Joker beholding to her and seeking to get her back. Leto is a harsher version of Heath Ledger's Joker. There is tattooed Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who controls fire. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje) is a creature like his name, whose powers seem to be thrashing and eating people. There are more Squad members?way too many.Ironically, it turns out that the Suicide Squad must stop the Enchantress (lovely and fierce Cara Delevingne), who is archaeologist June Moore. On an excavation site, a powerful ancient deity inhabits Moore. With her god-like powers Enchantress seems omnipotent, and it seems nearly impossible for the Suicide Squad to win. But the odds matter little, much like the story. Once in motion we are enthralled by "Matrix"-like gun battles, the slick martial arts sequences, and mind bending explosions. "Suicide Squad" is visually stunning. Know what to expect with "Suicide Squad". Admire its unpretentiousness, and enjoy the wild ride. Smith and Robbie's star power and nuance make up for a lot. "Suicide Squad" is a fun summer movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a lousy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a lousy movie. Like an hour and a half of one dimensional characters, doing clichés. With really forced, sentimental sub-plots to make them seem more meaningful. All while doing obvious, stupid, overt violence. It is just sad, and I lost a lot of respect for Will Smith for doing this movie. All his characters - from the late Muhammad Ali to Agent J to Hancock were really good. Here it is all stupid violence from him, and literal evil. It made me sad to see this movie. Let's all hope there will never be a sequel. The world needs to be inspired right now (thank goodness for The Avengers and Superman and Sully the pilot and the new Spider-Man). Not given spectacles of heinous indecency and boring depravity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie as you know, centers around the suicide squad, a team of villains who are controlled by ARGUS because of their brain bombs. The plot was well paced. The acting was stellar especially Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandez. Killer CrocK was hilarious. The backstories of the characters were brief but overall well done. The action was very well-paced. The movie had an amazing soundtrack. In this film, the romances were well developed. I would have liked to see the extra parts of the movie that they had to cut because the movie did end up having less joker but the joker was not the main focus of the story. The only reason I mention this is that Jared Leto seemed more major in the trailer. That aside, the movie did a good job of staying on focus of the plot which entailed the suicide squad battling the Enchantress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the reviews that were given on this movie, I needed to make sure that I also got mine in. I am a massive Marvel &amp; DC comic book fan myself. I went into this movie with an open mind. Heath Ledger played an incredible Joker. I wasn't sure if Jared Leto was going to be able to pull off the job but he nailed it! I thought he was spectacular, pure genius performance. Now for the rest of the crew, holy smokes. Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) was sexy, fascinating and bad ass! Will Smith (Dead Shot) did the character well. He was the right guy for the part. I can't say enough about the cast for this movie, just a job well done. I can easily say that easily took the first place spot on my favorite movie list. It was OUTSTANDING...GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film, but suffers greatly in plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be honest here. After hearing all the horrible reviews this movie got from critics and fans, I went into this movie pretty skeptic. But after seeing it for the first time, I can gladly say that isn't as bad as critics are making it out to be. I have to say though, don't go in expecting a superhero masterpiece, because it just isn't. The film has a lot of strong points, which I will go into in a bit. But also suffers from major flaws. I'll go into the positives first. First off, the team, was great. Because of the team and the chemistry between the cast members, it all stays together nicely. Almost every character has given some development. Bear in mind, I said almost everyone. The two actors who outshine the rest, is Viola Davis and Margot Robbie. Both delivered an amazing job in capturing these evil, but somewhat tormented characters. The song choices were great, but forced at times. Some of them didn't even fit the situation they were in. Now the negatives. The film suffers greatly all do a weakly driven story line, that really didn't fit the tone of the film, nor the characters. I wish they assigned the team a totally different mission, because it didn't really make that much sense to me, why they would choose these people. The editing is kind of meh, but it didn't bother me that much, unlike Batman v Superman did for me. I don't have any other problems with the film to be honest. I had fun, which in my opinion is all that counts when you go watch a summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film made it likable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the characters. This film made it likable. It provided a good introduction at the beginning of the film. I think anyone who sees this film will probably feel as though they did not get enough of all the characters but I also think that we got enough information to be introduced to to be interested in what those characters will do next.Going into this film I imagined a much darker film. Had it been more silent moments I would have been a much darker film.I felt invested in all the characters. I felt invested in all the characters somewhat emotionally.I liked how much Batman was in this film.I was really surprised that I was not more scared in this film. I was expecting to be scared of Joker in this film.I felt emotionally invested in each of the main characters due to their losses.Harley Quinn acted exactly how I imagined where her main devotion lied with Joker.Joker reminded me of pimp version of Mark Hamill's portrayal Joker but not as scary in this film.I loved the music from the songs to the score.I loved that we got to see hints to the Harley Quinn 1990's cartoon costume in this film.My problem was that the way the lines were said in the trailer gave a much more powerful emotional and comedic impression than I got while I was watching the film.I thought that the main villain was not big and dangerous for film.Once Enchantress turned into a belly dancer was a weird. It did not fit with the character who we had seen earlier in the film that was mysterious. One thing I did not understand about Enchantress was what she was doing with the portal. Why was the villain Enchantress were using a similar idea as seen in films like the first two Thor films, Spider-Man 2 or The Avengers by building something to destroy the world as we know it by means of a portal. The plan was never explained enough to understand what she was up.I liked #Diablo had a great story and felt bad because he killed family.The characters, relationships, and chemistry between the characters; are the best parts of the film.The flow to the film seemed a little off.The way that #Flash and Batman were utilized in this film I felt was adequately used to only introduce them to the stories of the villains back story. I did not need to see a lot of them. And this film used them the right amount.Will Smith as Deadshot was probably was the best part to the film.I was pleased with Harley Quinn's portrayal felt like the portrayal that I imagined her to be.Some of the feelings were not as strong enough as I had imaged to feel sad or cheer like I felt like when I watched the trailers.Some songs I did feel were a bit out of place because some of the music did not give me the emotional response it could have with no music or different music such as Deadshot trying to get #Diablo. It made some scenes anticlimactic.Some cuts made scenes predictable like showing Katana's samurai sword just before Harley Quinn stables #Enchantress and I thought that that should have been not shown until Enchantress was stabbed to show the surprise.I was expecting the bar scene to be much more powerful emotional and climatic scene than was presented in the film.The Joker and Harley Quinn was like a Bonny and Clyde relationship.I think we needed more Enchantress back story as a witch.I think that there was too many songs back to back and in some ways we needed them spread out with fewer songs so that we are cheering in excitement.I thought that the origin story to Harley Quinn was not strong enough emotionally. It could have been told better with different music.The ending to this film showed by #Diablo was so important to the team because he was very much underutilized in the scene.I loved #Katana in this film. There was enough mystery in the character where I found it interesting. I loved the story behind the sword and how the hair looked on her.Boomerang happened to be the character where we had no clue what kind of character he was or why he was even in the group at all.Amanda Waller was a character where you never felt quite sure if she was a good or bad character from the beginning even to the mid credit scene it made you question where she stood.This is a film where I would be interested in seeing another film like this with different villains. This films mid credits sequence hints to the Justice League.Source: http://www.megashare-viooz.net/suicide-squad-2016.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed it! Great scenes but... cut!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this one straight, it is a superhero movie adapted from a comic book and trailers tend to 'overeact' when it comes to these kind of movies. I mean Marvel's Civil War was the same for me, so much hype about it but it actually disappointed me as well (big Marvel fan). Suicide Squad suffers from various issues that already half the planet has pointed out. Yes, it could have been better! Concerning the characters, I also believe that if Jared Leto was given more screen time, the story could have been more coherent and have a bad-ass villain combo. An Enchantress/Joker co-op would make more sense. Really didn't care for Boomerang or Slipknot's head exploding everywhere... okay that was kinda funny. Joker's screen- time made me sum it up to: "Ah... Baby where are you? Baby get ready I'm coming to get you! Baby I'm outside playing with my helicopter! OOps Baby they did it again and shot us both down. Bye-bye. The end." Leto's performance was great. He is the 21st century Joker addressing the trends of the 21st century. The character's set up was marvelous. The tattoos with the Easter eggs and the teeth made him a unique one, more modern. After all, he is crazy and doesn't care about how he looks. I wish I could have seen the extent of his inner psychological turmoil and not only the relationship between him and Harley. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was also great. Knowing that the crucial scene of her origin with Mr. J is slightly different from the New 52 Suicide Squad#7 added more agency to Harley, giving her a choice on her life's outcome, blaming no-one but herself. The chemical vat scene was one my favorite. The dive, Joker's internal conflict on whether to save her or not and the "Desire becomes Surrender. Surrender becomes Power" got me. Capturing their ambivalent relationship,though, and not only the caring part could have given a more clear picture of their psychology. The movie favored them more than the rest (Deadshot too) as well. Harley had extra flashbacks and Deadshot more try-to-be-the-hero- daddy scenes. I found that Deadshot's story was a bit strange, trying too much to redeem and justify an assassin by portraying his relationship with his daughter by neglecting Katana (she killed her husband with that demonic sword!). Boomerang did not really make an impression, Killer Croc was indeed 'beautiful' but that's it, Amanda Waller was the Nick Fury wannabe and then there is Rick Flag. I really disliked him. However, I really liked Cara Devigne as The Enchantress. She was good, the costume was awesome, but where was her "Let's have some fun" scene? Her story could have been more developed. A simple I kill you because you don't worship me mortal didn't convince me. Nevertherless, despite the confusing story-line and the extended character introduction, it is a decent movie with outstanding performances. I believe that the struggle to present a variety of materials confused things. A stand-alone movie for each character could have saved introductions and focus on new relationships, conflicts and saving the world instead.They are bad guys, why do they agree to do it? 10 years off a life sentence means nothing really. I'm disappointed on the whole cut but I enjoyed it and would like to see it again for a close Easter egg hunting. Plus it featured some great songs and a homage to Alex Ross' iconic painting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a need to know and all you need to know is: Suicide Squad is very enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>----------In this review you may find some minor spoilers-----------Suicide Squad was one of my most anticipated movie of 2016 and after watching the movie there are two sides of thoughts running around my head?.On one side there is DC fan who enjoyed the hell out of Suicide Squad, and there is the other one who was very disappointed by the miss opportunities. It could be great, it could be one of the best and most enjoyable comic book super-hero action movie instead of being a critically controversial movie.First of all I will tell about the positives of the movie?.The thing I love most about Suicide Squad is the characters and performance. Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Joker, Amanda Waller, Boomerang and nearly every characters was amazing. And the actors who portrayed those character done their job perfectly. My personal favorite was deadshot &lt;3 Will Smith &lt;3 and Harley &lt;3 Margot Robbie &lt;3. Joker was awesome too but he was misused (more on that later) Another thing I love about Suicide Squad is it's tone. It was super funny, light hearted and filed with character moment that you can attach with. I love the back story of Harley and joker?backstory of Deadshot ? Loved the batman cameos and other cameos :P ? Loved the actions and the soundtracks? -- Now let's talk about the negatives. Although the story is decent (not so great).. the editing was horrible? it look like they cut a lot of things from the movie hence the movie feels disjointed and in disconnected?specially the introduction and story of joker? &lt;3 Jared Leto &lt;3 tries to do something different with the joker, without repeating Heath Ledger's joker and He did a really good job but editing make his introduction sloppy and his story misplaced?(But looking forward to see what Jared Leto aka joker do next in batman movie). And my second negative issue with Suicide Squad is the villain. DC has great villains but don't know why, they seems to fail capturing great villains in DCCU. The trailer made us believe that villain is the joker. And than it's looks like Enchantress is the villain. But it's again looks like Amanda Waller is the real villain. They don't even know what they are doing.. --but apart form those issues, in the end I really enjoyed Suicide Squad.. I really loved those characters and can't wait to see what next. It made my hyped for upcoming DCCU movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't do justice with the Joker..!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that like every other DC fan I was hell excited about Suicide Squad. Not just because that I love the characters but because of the cast involved. From Will Smith appearing as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, to Jai Courtney as Boomerang and Jay Hernandaz as Diablo. They were all amazing throughout the movie and did exactly what was expected of them. I even liked Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. She played the role wonderfully from the very beginning to the end of the movie so did Cara Delevingne as June Moone / The Enchantress.And Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman once again proved himself to be excellent. I won't regret saying that he was born for this role. Even though he wasn't there that much in the movie except for 2-3 scenes. He still manages to prove that he is the one. The way he fits in the character is just excellent. No doubt he is gonna nail it in Justice League.But most of all.. the reason why I was more excited for this movie was Jared Leto. From the very first trailer that came out he was looking astonishing. Not to mention that he made the fans go nuts over him. He is different and looks really cool while portraying Joker. Almost all of his scenes are absolutely amazing but having said that.. he is barely seen in the movie. We only get to see him 5-6 times in the whole movie and that too just for few seconds. That is where it disappoints and ruins it all because the marketing made us believe that he has a heavy role in it which in reality is nothing more than just a cameo. There's not even a single moment that belongs to him. He hasn't even got a proper scene of himself laughing like ha.. ha.. ha.. So talking about the movie.. Its surely worth watching but not thinking about the Joker.. Don't go to this movie being excited about Jared Leto as the Joker because you are gonna regret it. David Ayyer will surely make you think if Joker was really needed for this movie or not. Watch it just for fun and you won't be disappointed much.</fullReview>

The plot was terrible and could have been written better. The critics got this one right. This movie does not deserve more than 1/5 stars. It's fun to watch don't get me wrong but it just goes to show you how they can throw a bunch of popular songs in there, with a famous actor, and try to get you to watch it. And you will. And that's all they care about. This is why they also set up the movie for a sequel at the end. It's all about money and really lacks passion for film making, that's why this movie sucked. Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many up and some downs about Suicide Squad. Due to the negative reviews, I went into the theatre with somewhat low expectations. However, I found myself pleasantly surprised. The cast is spot on, with even Jai Courtney playing a character perfectly fitted to him. Joel Kinnamon and Viola Davis are a fantastic pair, with truly riveting characters. El Diablo was surprisingly great, with a particularly unique and original character. Jared Leto is a strong Joker (if not as good as Health Ledger), whose core qualities are absolute craziness and absolute craziness. However it is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn who really stands out here. Her incarnation of the classic character is fell acted, deep and by far the best on screen Harley Quinn we've gotten so far. The problem with the cast of characters is there are just too many. Ergo many are side-tracked for the majority of the film (in particular Katana, Slipnot and Lieutenant GQ Edwards), whereas other characters (Killer Croc are just unnecessary).There are other ups and downs here. On one hand, this is a very fun, even funny super villain movie with a great soundtrack and likable set pieces. On the other hand, the villain is very poor (worst part of the movie) some of the editing isn't great and the dialogue is poor and clichéd are times. Still, this is a movie that would be difficult not to enjoy, and when it works, it really works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do have to say DC is getting better at their movies. Maybe they are taking hints from Marvel, I don't know, but I do know is that this movie was a good movie. The beginning was a solid 9/10. Middle of the movie was a 8/10, then end was a 6/10. If it had a good ending, it would've been a AWESOME movie. But they screwed the ending up. So anticlimactic. You could pretty much predict what was going to happen, even though there was a million different things happening, and at the same time, confused about what is going on.And to the person that is suing because they didn't put enough Joker in the movie - I thought there was plenty of Joker scenes. Add anymore and the whole movie is about the Joker. They ended the movie setting it up for Wonder Woman/The Flash/Suicide Squad 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this can't be looked at in comparison to The Dark Knight because these are two very different stories in the Gotham Universe. People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I know this was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don't mind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a "main character" type. It was something I could dislike easily because she's usually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended up playing a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals the show. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.Note 8</fullReview>

But thank God I didn't let the critics put me off going to see the DC COMICS SUICIDE SQUAD live movie because I had a blast watching it and I feel like the negative feedback from critics where highly exaggerated. Firstly Harley Quinn's ass was not the main spot light, she's a sexy naughty criminal and she was portrayed that way. I loved every moment and wasn't even disappointed about Cara being the bad guy, she actually pulled it off quite well.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and cool scenes in a very meh plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GOOD - Some critics have complained the movie is like a glorified music video. I feel it's actually at its best when its being the most like a music video. The introductions and backgrounds of the different characters to popular rock songs were perhaps the best parts. The movie has a number of really cool scenes, especially when it came to flashbacks. The Batman scenes were the best, but then I would say that! It's definitely a style over substance film, and it was entertaining and there was a good deal of fun to be had watching it. The scenes themselves were well directed, I think. People complained the Joker wasn't in it as much as advertised, but after reading that I found he was in it more than I expected. It wasn't his film and I don't think he should have been in it any more than he was. I was happy with the amount. As for characters, Deadshot was particularly good (although he should have worn the mask more), and Harley looked really visually striking and cool, and I mean that from the shoulders up at least, and they both acted convincingly. It was clearly a Deadshot and Harley- led film. The film was nice and colourful and I really like that, especially compared to the lack of colour in BvS. I particularly liked Harley's colours and all the neon title and end credits and 'character bios'. THE BAD - Style over substance. Scattered scenes were great, but as for the core plot it was really meh. The villain was kinda interesting to begin but quickly got boring as soon as she went bigtime. Neither the villain nor the stakes grabbed you.The 'sh*t got real' big crisis thing just seemed to suddenly happen, there was zero buildup to it. The later part of the film was worse than the first as, if not for the characters, it became a bit too generic and too CGI- y.The film really needed to be a 15. For a film about villains there was no blood and they went down the boring Marvel-like disposable monsters route. They definitely needed to make it more personable and savage and not so middle-of-the-road in terms of action. It's called the Suicide Squad for goodness sake! I know it was from their point of view and was supposed to make them more sympathetic, but the villains never really seemed villainous. Like, at all. Harley smashed a window and robbed a handbag. Ooooh, we've got a badass over here! No backstabbing, which was what the Suicide Squad was supposed to be about. The whole magic villain thing... it just seemed a bit too soon for the DCEU. It was too out there at this stage. They should have gone with a more grounded villain for the Suicide Squad, because they took the time to ground the members of the Squad themselves. The Squad are not Asgardians. Some of the characters were just too gangsterised (Croc, Diablo, Harley a little, Boomerang a little, and Joker the most egregious). Croc was also too skinny in my opinion, or rather just didn't look as threatening as he should have. He didn't have much to do, though. Next to Joker he was the weirdest seeing 'street'. The Joker's performance was.. okay... decent... neither bad nor great, but mainly because it was hard to take seriously because you were so preoccupied by his daft look. He had different outfits and when it was toned down and looked more Joker-y it was a damn sight better. The more bling he looked the more distracting it was. One outfit in particular. Still, I liked seeing him on screen but didn't want any more of him in that movie.Harley's comic lines (which were nearly ALL her lines) just fell flat. Wryly amusing moments in the film did not come from Harley, who had lines that were trying too hard and were a little cringing. Boomerang was funnier in a more natural way. No actual proper laughs though in the film, but then I didn't really expect or need them. The editing wasn't good in the movie. You could tell they'd had reshoots and shoehorned some DCEU stuff in. The film was messy, like critics said BvS was but I disagreed with. With this you could tell it was more like a network of scenes. The film was clearly more interested in particular scenes than the core plot, which was almost like an afterthought. Weirdly, the film would actually have flowed a lot better if you'd scrapped the core plot and put all the characters and their lives and backgrounds and so forth into a short Netflix series. It could have had a lot less budget and told a better story. As a movie it seemed to be relying way too much on setup and not on payoff.BvS was better.Anyway, yeah. Above all, decent and fun but not a masterpiece by any means. I don't mind if critics give it a 5/10 or whatever, even if personally I would, acknowledging my biases, give it higher. That's fine. What I hate and will always hate is critics who play it up and write about this and other decent (or even mediocre) hyped films being crimes against cinema, as though they're on par with Jack and Jill and Date Movie. Wall Street Journal called Suicide Squad "an all-out attack on the whole idea of entertainment". Attention seekers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the big breakthrough, but fun nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the overburdened messy trainwreck that was Batman V Superman, I had much doubt for this one... At the first look there again are a ton of characters and again a weird choice of changes to an iconic arch enemy (you don't wanna think of Lil Wayne when you see the Joker, okay?). Overall it seemed like its going to repeat the same mistakes as BvS. And to an extend it did. However the main difference is that this one actually manages to provide fun.As critics seem to be exceptionally harsh with this one, I believe that much of it depends on what your expectations are. If you think of this anything more than easy entertainment popcorn-movie action, you'll gonna be disappointed. Otherwise you're in for a fun ride, even though it has a few bumps here and there.Part of the reason it is entertaining to me is how stylishly it was filmed. The movie starts off almost like a montage of MTV music videos with plenty of licensed music; I'd say they even went overboard with the music. Whether you like the music or not is a matter of personal taste - personally I didn't find it all that fitting and was a little bit annoyed when they played Eminems "Without me". But it is undeniable that these scenes have a certain "coolness" to them. There is a lot of action going on, however the plot is paper-thin. It basically can be summarized in one sentence, and it's the most predictable one for most common comicbooks or action-movies. But what made me not care about that is the already mentioned stylishness that indeed provided the most fun. The way Batman was utilized, even tough in a really small portion, was effective. I loved his biggest scene, which I won't spoil here even though it is in the trailer. What's also great are the many shootout scenes and gunplay. Kinda reminded me of the 90's action movies, which is always a good thing. Even the PG13 didn't spoil it.As far as for the characters... They mostly are good and satisfying. Lets start with the iconic one first: Joker - as I mentioned, not really happy how they changed him. Lacks the sarcastic menace and intensity. Far from bad, but they could've been more imaginative and let him go all out more. His henchmen were awesome though. Harley - Pretty good actually, from the trailer it seemed like she'd be mostly about making faces and grimaces and be an annoyance, but she was fine and a pretty good movie adaptation of the character. Lots of here humorous scenes were really weak though... that was some truly lazy writing.Deadshot - this one is a bit of a polarizing one. The character definitely got the Will Smith treatment, and it's hard to separate him from other action characters Will played. Even though I love his action scenes and his gunslinging is truly badass, he seems more like a good guy than a bad guy. It is tough to escape the feeling that it is indeed because of Will. Would've been interesting to seem him play someone purely evil for a change. The others didn't get much screen time, but to me they were satisfying. Katana, Croc added to the action. Boomerang to the comic relieve (was actually pulled of well without overdoing it, kudos for that), Enchantress was really nice to look at, provided plenty of awesome imagery, El Diablo also had a great action scene and added a little bit of dept. Slipknot was the one with the least screen-time, basically a filler but his entrance was entertaining no less.All in all entertaining, carefree action-fun. Don't expect anything deep from it. It's mostly the action and spectacle parts that deliver, and they are pulled off well. There are some emotions thrown in, nothing great or new, just here to mix-up things a little. Surprisingly the humor is really weak, but it's tolerable. Better than BvS in any case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first thought when going to see this movie was, "It's not rated 'R'??" It's such a dark and macabre film. A superhero movie to change all the rules of superhero movies. And while it almost does, it's difficult to do so when you go for a PG-13 rating. Although, I understand why. Widening your audience means more butts in the seats. And those who would want it to be rated R will probably still think it's rated R.After the death of Superman, US intelligence agent, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), wants to put together a team of criminals to go on dangerous missions at no risk, since they're seen as expendable.Of the ensemble cast, the bigger names consist of Will Smith as the hit man, Deadshot, Margot Robbie as The Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, and Jared Leto as The Joker, himself.I'd like to preface this all by saying I enjoyed the film. It's not terrible. I'd watch it again, and probably even buy it on DVD. It does a lot of things right, but it's not without its fair share of hiccups.You can't help but notice that the DC cinematic universe is always playing catch-up to the Marvel one. And it doesn't have to. This was its chance to do something totally different. And in some ways it does--or at least, sets itself up to in the future. But the random interjections of jokes amidst action scenes don't feel fluid, but forced. DC is supposed to be much darker and less tongue-in-cheek. Less quippy.DC, in some sense, has far more interesting and unique characters--especially villains--than Marvel. They've grown to be more twisted over the years, and this film tries to use that to its advantage, but it just doesn't always work.That's not to say it never does. This year's Batman v Superman film uses cheesy filters to make it feel dark. In Suicide Squad it's more convincing. It's dark. Really dark. But you can't help feel like the film is torn between sinister and cartoony. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy succeeds at this perfectly. But Suicide Squad is trying to be both Dark Knight and Avengers at the same time. I'm not so sure that's possible.It could have benefited from being more serious. The film starts out comfortably fitting into its own universe, but the random bits of levity are often jarring, making it seem like the film is trying to be as appealing to its more popular contemporary. Yet, it never has to. The material is great on its own. And we won't blame writer-director David Ayer, because apparently, it was the studio who demanded there be more humor scattered throughout.This is what Marvel does very well. In the Avengers films, entire scenes don't come to a grinding halt whenever Iron Man says something funny. The humor blends into the action. It doesn't combat it. Here, the action scenes were the only times the film was free of jokes.And we don't mind levity. However, in this scenario, the jokes should have been darker--not cuter. But with Robbie delivering them, that's what you get.They seem to want her to be the focal point of the laughs, but I just wanted her to stop. You don't always buy in to her jokes, and she just ends up getting annoying. Smith, however, is the unsung comedic talent of the film. His timing is as good as ever and it never feels forced--fitting into the Marvel vibe they're going for.Leto as The Joker was perfect because he wasn't overexposed. Every time we see him, he's gone moments later, making us want more. Robbie is in almost the entire film. You're supposed to love her antihero, but you never really do. Not enough is given to us. We end up just feeling indifferent.There's a scene towards the beginning of the film where Davis' character is sitting down at a table, explaining one-by-one the backstory of each character. it takes about 10 minutes and freezes any plot progression that's going on. The normal version of me would have hated this in any other situation, but it may be the best part of this movie. We're being introduced to these interesting, complex, deranged characters. We get get excited about what's to come. The filmmakers want us to fall in love with these antiheroes, but this is the only time it truly lets us.Despite the lack of action sequences, the pacing's fairly good, and the film is entertaining everywhere else. However, it has a long way to go to be considered great.I really want these new DC films to be of the best quality, but I fear that they can't. Not as long as they're too preoccupied with trying to be Marvel. Honestly, if I never saw another Marvel film again, I wouldn't be devastated. It's time for something new, and DC can give us that. They almost had it here.Twizard Rating: 78</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Best, But Not The Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with extremely high hopes because of the promising commercials I had seen everywhere. However, I was sorely disappointed as I sat through what quickly became a train wreck of a film. I'm not gonna lie, all of the characters had definite potential upon introduction, but as they were haphazardly lumped together and thrown into a fight they were severely unprepared for the minuscule background info the audience was given about each "bad-guy" seemed out of place and pasted on. The plot was shaky, at best, and supplied me with a generous amount of unanswered questions. A few of which being: where is captain boomerang during MOST of the fighting scenes; why did Waller have workers (the ones she shot) handling information that was above their pay-grade; why did Enchantress engage in hand-to-hand combat as opposed to simply blasting them all to smithereens the first time they refused her offer during the last big fight scene; etc.The set-up for MOST of the characters was not believable in the slightest. We got NO backstory for killer croc. They spent so little time on him that there were times when I forgot he was even a part of the team at all. Cap Boomerang was completely unsuited for this particular situation at all considering that the only weapons he had to work with were his trusty-dusty boomerangs which rendered him completely useless against the supernatural forces they were facing. Katana a.k.a. silent, sword-wielding place-holder because she pretty much had no purpose in the group except to protect Flagg who couldn't be killed by the Squad anyway because he made it extremely clear that if he died then they died. Slipknot was so obviously only in the movie to be killed off. Diablo was a pacifist the entire movie in order to provide a semi-logical reason for most of the excessive shooting scenes considering he could have just roasted most of the attackers in a matter of seconds. Deadshot tried so hard to make you feel for his "I want to be a good guy for my daughter" plight that it was hard to see him as a villain bad enough for this crew at all. And I saved the "best" for last, Harley &amp; Joker. They were both a mess. Joker didn't fit into this picture at all because his entire role was built as Harley's big bad boyfriend who spent the whole movie "coming for you, baby." His scenes were forced and unnecessary. Harleen Quinzel, usually one of my favorite characters, was fun enough but severely lacking in on screen presence. Everything about this particular Harley seemed forced and fake, especially when her "perfect vision" turned out to be both her and Joker cured with young babies. Harley is classically a psychopath and for her to have a "normal" life vision left me with some serious questions about why she stayed Harley at all when Joker wasn't around. Their entire relationship was unfamiliar to me having only previously seen the cartoon adaptations of their relationship. The main villain, Enchantress, was a hot mess. Her character was unbelievable, but that could be in part due to the inexperience of the fairly new actress, Cara Delevigne, portraying her. Unfortunately, the unbelievability of her character also was a let down because of the awkwardly forced relationship between her and Rick Flagg. I didn't believe their love affair for a second. They were too stiff around each other and their "love" wasn't fleshed out enough in the backstory scenes for me. Overall, the movie wasn't the best DC movie I've ever seen, but it also wasn't the worst. It has humorous and fun-loving parts, but it also leaves the audience with a ton of unanswered questions (and not in a "I need more" kind of way). I definitely recommend that people who think they'll enjoy this movie to watch it for sure, but go in expecting a sloppy movie because if you go in expecting anything more than mediocre then you're gonna get your feelings hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Suicide Squad" is Fast and Fun But Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suicide Squad" is the pseudo-sequel to "Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice". This story takes place sometime after the events of that epic superhero showdown which ultimately sets up the "need" for the unique collection of these "bad guys" who have been locked up thanks to Batman and the Flash. The tone of this film is very dark. Much darker than "Dawn of Justice" and often feels off-kilter (which I'm sure was intentional). The writers were wise to keep the dialogue and banter between the squad quick-witted and funny. Otherwise the dark tone could have weighed down the pace of the film and took away the empathy we needed to root for the "bad guys". With any ensemble film like this one the story tends to miss having any real depth for the characters. Thanks to good back stories at the beginning, we are immediately introduced to Deadshot (played by Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie). The rest of the squad become mere by-standers through much of the movie (until Diablo played by Jay Hernandez shares his story midway through the movie). Even though the film clocks in at 2 hours I felt that it could have taken more time to develop. But with such lukewarm reviews from "Dawn of Justice" I think the studio wanted a faster- paced film with this one (which Director David Ayers has confirmed in interviews lately). Of course the Joker (played by Jared Leto) needed no backstory, but his role in the film felt like it was just there for the fans (much like Wolverine's cameo in "X-Men: Apocalypse") However, the Joker is vital to Harley Quinn's backstory. But beyond that he doesn't do much to move the story along. I believe he was there to help set up a Harley Quinn stand alone movie in the future. Leto's performance was good but it will never touch Heath Ledger's hypnotic portrayal from "The Dark Night". The stand out performance for me goes to Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the mastermind (and ultimate nemesis) of the squad. You've never seen Ms. Davis this sinister or this cold hearted (and you might just like it!) Overall, "Suicide Squad" is a fun and enjoyable action-comedy flick. But it suffers from being a late-Summer release. After seeing "Dawn of Justice", "Civil War", and "Apocalypse" you get the feeling "Haven't I seen this before?" But I will definitely see this squad again! **Be sure to stay for the credits to see an extra scene**</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad Review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Suicide Squad was released and is among us. Bringing a lot of expectation and pressure on his back, suicide squad is a movie with a simple story, with interesting characters (however complicated of working in a group), with a tone more fun - fun, the movie actually comes with the order to entertain And enjoy the viewer - and who's not afraid to use a lot of pop songs, really many, to tell his story.Straight out the movie's just throwing everything I saw in the trailers (except what was cut off, he has several things that have been cut off), since beginning got a great sense of humor and action, always accompanied by music. In the meantime, a little bit of wind-up or complexity would have made the most remarkable experience. Maybe, a road map and a more elaborate assembly (a problem of the film, he stays without timing sometimes because of her) that helped this script would have brought us a long more complete. There are reports that the script was written in just 6 weeks, what's a little obvious by the presence of a few clichés and simple solutions of script.However, all who are or have been to the movies, they want to see the squad. Well, all the characters are really very well, some have more emphasis (Harley Quinn and Deadshot), other grow during the long (El Diablo), others lose a little bit of space in the movie and some are lost - the case of Enchantress, she It is well presented, but when the film starts to walk, she don't follow.In the case of the cameos. Batman was only used to boost the squad, both in history as in marketing. And the Joker of Jared Leto? You could say that it was a cameo, maybe he's 15 minutes of screen, only used as a tool of script in the history of Harley Quinn, the clown it was character that had more outtakes - Leto said you could make a movie of the joker With the recorded material -, the film was the squad, but the marketing was abusive on top of it. But, let's wait for more.In conclusion, suicide squad is a movie a lot of fun, which could have renewed the sub-genre ("heroes") and broken paradigms, unfortunately didn't make it. Go check out simply you can see the Harley Quinn, Deadshot, etc, in action with an incredible soundtrack, you don't have what to say.It's hard to even give a note to the movie, because I had a great time, but taking to the technical side, is flawed. So, I think 6,7,8... Maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadshot and gang shoot what is another misfire for the DCEU.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the most anticipated film this year, Suicide Squad is about a bunch of bad guys coming together to do some good and take part in a suicide mission to try and save the world. This is another chance for DC to get their act together and try and compete with Marvel...does the film do that? No. I'm afraid not. Now I'm not a huge Marvel fan so before you say "Oh, you are a Marvel fanboy", think again. Let me start with the good points, this film was made for the film portrayal of Harley Quinn and Margot Robbie is perfect. You can tell she is having fun with the role, she has become invested in the craziness of the character. Her Focus co-star Will Smith was also very good as Deadshot but the surprise actor for me was Jai Courtney. I feel he gets a bad reputation, and actually I&nbsp;thought Captain Boomerang was the funniest character, he surprised me in this and I hope he gets a better reputation. Jared Leto plays The Joker and it was obvious he had to go somewhere different with the character, and thought he played the part well. Now with a film with many new characters, it may take a while to get to know them, thankfully this movie introduces them straight away (albeit in a boring, dull flashback method). There are some scenes where the characters interact and reveal some more about themselves to each other, I feel these scenes are probably the best in the film (particularly the scene in the bar). This brings me onto the negatives of the film, if the best scenes are just regarding dialogue then the action scenes are extremely dull and messy. The editing was so poor, there were times I couldn't actually see what was happening when the Suicide Squad were battling against the generic enemy army (I emphasise on generic, they were practically walking slime soldiers). Speaking of generic, the main villain of the film was incredibly clichéd with a boring "must destroy the world" plot, I won't spoil it but you'll see what I mean. I feel like a lot of the film was cut, the only reason why I say this is because there are moments where we are constantly going from scene to scene as if the part between these scenes is missing...I suspect studio interference from director David Ayer's original cut. Overall, Suicide Squad was a disappointment with some enjoyable action scenes and dialogue but an unfocused plot with clumsy editing makes this a difficult watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

It's not promising since the trailer was first released and actually I never saw myself watching this again anytime soon. I could say that Cara Delevingne's skill is a bit improving compare to her play as Margo in Paper Towns. What really attract me the most is Margo Robbie's acting.

		<fullReview>This movie had some interesting characterization, but did very little with it.The overarching story just didn't fit with the overall theme of the movie, lacked imagination and made little sense. There was serious inconsistencies with the power of the adversaries of the suicide squad and their weaknesses. The whole story played like a video game, move from point A to B for no apparent reason, and the whole story could fit in a shot glass.Perhaps the saddest aspect of the movie is the training of an entire generation to stay in their place. The suicide squad saved the world and got screwed and betrayed in the end, all with a smile on their face.Amanda Waller's characterization had some potential but in the end she just came across as a psychotic self serving megalomaniac. This could have worked with more thought put into it. Having one of the suicide squad say "The only difference between you and I is what side of the table we sit on" would have been a start. Having her survive in the end and still have her phone with the"killer app" is one of the worst cases of sequel-itis I have ever seen.And Deadshot's Enchantress fantasy wish is it kill Batman? Doesn't even remotely fit into the movie. His fantasy would be a secure and happy life for his daughter. This was only forced in for sequel potential.I won't be seeing the sequel because the story-writing will probably be even worse than this one.I was going to give it a 3 but Harley Quin was amusing enough to get an extra star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are psyched for it.....STOP, half of it doesn't live up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to be careful if you are making a comic book live action movie, specially if it's a "team movie". I was really looking forward to this, Will Smith looked like he could carry the cast and the trailers really made their job. Unfortunately the movie is weak...sometimes it looks like it's a "look what I can do kind of documentary" Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was good and funny enough to be a great Harley Quinn....Why am I addressing Deadshot and Harley? well because this was their show really, all other members are just here to support them. sadly (or not) Killer Croc, Katana, Cpt Boomerang, Flag and El Diablo are not the focus of the movie, the viewer is not led to care for them at all even with Diablo's "special sharing moment"the first half drags itself around trying to introduce the characters but it lacks interest (apart from Harley and Mr J) even with some DC heroes making cameos. after the intros are made it goes on smoothly until the last part which was a let down for me.by the way, Jared Letos's Joker still comes out short when compared to the previous 2 jokers we had... he is hardly intimidating and quite sad to look at... he shouldn't have as much screen time as he does (which is not much but still) Some of the supportive characters were surprisingly more interesting than some members of the Suicide Squad and the Villain of the movie is quite frankly boring and very very predictable.as a "super hero" movie it OK at best, if it's on TV some time from now I will watch it but I probably won't make an effort to look for it actively. It certainly is better than Batman V Superman but that's not putting the bar very high is it? a solid 6 by comic movie standards.</fullReview>

The entertainment value just in the character flashback stories made excellent use of film and was very interesting to watch. The problem comes in the story beyond that, like what the main plot of the film was. I felt that the main story and plot was weak and underwhelming and I lost some interest about halfway into it. The movie was a bit of a let down in that regard and the main story, at least for me wasn't clear for me. Because of all of that, the poor storyline on the main plot and the underwhelming overall progression just made his movie very average.An entertaining way to spend a few hours, probably worth the money to go and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film fan and comic sort of reader, the movie is not such a big hit. Was more marketing than reality. I see more of the same, DC tried so hard to beat marvel that just became a copycat of avengers with dark humor. Even the trailer portrayed the first 20 minutes, more than anything, just as Avenger's Age of Ultron. Focused here. See what I just did? wasted my first paragraph on gibberish; like these will be your first 20 minutes. After that you will have a glimpse of the so much publicized joker, but non essential to the story line. Then you will half understand the film. So much shoots, so much action... some laughs on the way. After that, awesome especial effects, some of the Squad die... Done you will go home. The movie as a whole is not great, may have it's hype, but was like deadpool to Marvel, just funny talk, great effects and so much publicity people will stand up on the movie unhappy and not believing on trailers anymore. Enchanted as villain was not the best choice, the plot was like she was ULTRON. It has it's good moments like the awkward romance on the joker and Harley, also the story on DeadShot, they are really good ones and connect with people. I went with my wife and some friends, they just found it like this.It was sort of funny, i enjoy it, I laughed, but... I am not motivated to see it again; maybe if they make a sequel¨. Come on DC, you can make more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dark, too much, too many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited when "Squad" was first advertised nearly a year ago; slowly with the flooding of super hero movies which continuously disappointed me, I lost interest because I felt it was going to happen again. People started talking, and it looked like everyone was interviewing Robby, not Leto (a bad sign). The film was disappointing to say the least.It was an intriguing concept: to have the most dangerous villains and criminals fight an impending terrorist attack. First problem is that how do we come up with such a threat when those characters are already pretty wild to begin with. Place Batman in the position of a mailman, and you have a dark and loud mess again.So the story unfolds, we see Viola Davis, looking tired and frustrated, without any of the energy she usually projects no matter what she plays. Batman flies in and out of the picture. The rest of the characters are reduced to gestures and grunts. Ledger's Joker haunts this film along with Nicholson's wild creation. I kept thinking I want to see the thing from The Fantastic Four, Bane from "The Dark Knight", anything that reminded me of a real, classic, comic book creation.The exposition is a bit clever, with a sprinkle of logic, and the only that kept me watching was Robby's twisted and sexy psycho. After that, the film degrades into a loud display of sounds and special effects. Did anyone learn anything from "Superman" and "Batman vs. Superman"? In the end, I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. I will definitely think more than twice before I see another comic book film.</fullReview>

It is well worth your time and despite what critics said the actors were great and the characters that were played had a excellent part and should have a way better rating and is by far my favorite movie of all time and destroys Deadpool. The character you will want to see the most is Harley Quinn and the Joker. They had outstanding parts and Jared Letto played a perfect Joker and Margot Robbie played a perfect part. And this is Will Smiths best performance of all time and beats Batman Vs Superman. Harleys voice switches from American to a normal Harley but it plays out perfect.

		<fullReview>The movie deserves better reviews because its not as bad as what the critics says. The combination of dark elements and humor is just perfect. What the movie lacks is the exposure of the other characters (e.g. Capt Boomerang and Killer Croc and also Katana). I want to see more from them. I'm hoping there's a directors cut for this because I'm definitely watching it. The acting is great actually, I don't get all the hate for the actors. Viola Davis did a great job. Amanda Waller is ruthless and fearless too and that's what Viola delivered. I'm sad why people are getting mad because joker didn't get much screen time, maybe because of the fact that he/is/NOT a member of the squad? Maybe if the movie is about injustice league he would have had more screen time. Anyway, He did a great job portraying joker. Very close to the comics joker. Of course the movie is not perfect but you will like it. It has many reference from the comics itself.I need to see the ultimate cut of this film. I'm definitely buying it and watch it many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie. I hope there is a sequel and spinoffs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is an excellent movie. The cast give phenomenal performances. The characters are compelling and unique and seeing them begin to develop dynamics and relationships is fantastic. The movie is dark, compelling, action packed with unique characters and humor. Will Smith made Deadshot proud. Margot Robbie is a standout as Harley. Jared Leto is amazing as joker. A dark, twisted with humor and complex take on the iconic character that is realistic and harks back to the joker of comics. I find the Joker and Harley relationship a highlight and one I wanted to see more of. I really hope they do another Suicide Squad movie and hope we get a solo Harley/Joker movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing! The cast is fantastic! If you're a DC Comics fan, you'll love this film. It's perfect. Right out of the comics. Leto is very good as the joker but there just isn't enough of him in the film to give a negative feedback. I think he was solid. Harley Quinn and Deadshot were fantastic! It was their movie all the way. Professional critics just don't understand the film or the comics so they give a negative review. I am a hard core comic book fan. This movie was everything I wanted and more. It was hilarious. Batman was in it just enough to be completely awesome. The flash cameo was really cool. All the characters were well developed. I would definitely go see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping so bad that this movie would be great and it was. I am not one of the stupid fanboys who thinks everything that dc or marvel makes is excellent. I like DC so i was looking forward for the DC universe. I liked BvS but it could be better for the name it promised. I didn't think there would be so many haters about DC and I thought DC fans Created this opinion that there are people who hate DC and don't look the movies for what they are but after the reviews for this movie I think that there are. IT IS AMAZING AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN EXPECT FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE. I am really looking forward for the Joker to. I didn't want this to be a long review so i am just telling you go watch it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than BvS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with BvS and was skeptical about Suicide Squad but it was great. The characters were outstanding and it had a lighter tone than the previous movies which was desperately needed. Will Smith was superb in it but Margot Robbie and Jared Leto shine as Harley Quinn and The Joker. It's like no other movie in the DCEU or the MCU. It's good funny moments too. I don't get why the critics rate the movie so low.The Joker is barely in the movie which was a little disappointing. I am eager to see more especially since in this movie he's just Harley's boyfriend. Which is understandable since the movie isn't really even about The Joker it's about Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Batman makes nothing more than a few cameos and a scene after the mid-credits. The villain wasn't the best but the characters more than make up for it. The soundtrack was phenomenal. This movie is better than MOS and BvS. Hopefully DC is learning from their mistakes and Wonder Woman and Justice League will also be spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anticipation was not in vain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my very first review of a movie on any site, so that should tell you something. The main reason why I am doing this is in the hopes that someone who sees bad reviews from so many other people will still give this movie a try because they will not be sorry.This movie was great from start to finish. The high points as far as characters: Jared Leto (Joker), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), Will Smith (Deadshot), and Viola Davis (Amanda Waller). I have been a huge fan of Jared Leto for many years, both as an actor and musician; however, when I first heard that he was going to play the Joker, I had my misgivings. These were put to rest during his first appearance. He played the part to perfection. I have seen many reviews discussing the three main Joker performances (Leto, Ledger, Nicholson) and comparing them. I will not do that. I loved all three portrayals and feel that they each brought their own style to the role with fantastic results. I do not feel that this diminishes the accuracy of the character via comics as we have seen it with every Marvel and DC film so far. I'm not going into a huge amount of detail here but have any of the Supermans or Batmans actors portrayed their characters exactly the same? My only complaint regarding The Joker was that he was not there enough. I have heard that the Blu-Ray will have some more scenes and am also hoping that the rumors of him being teased to lead into more of the plot in a later film (like Thanos in The Avengers franchise) is true. More Joker!!!!!!Margot Robbie was also incredible. I have seen reviews stating that she is simply there for one liners. Not true! Does she give them? Sure, but that's Harley Quinn. Her role in the film is integral. Couldn't have asked for a better performance.Will Smith ... let me start by saying that he is not one of my favorite actors at all. That being said, wow, did he deliver in this movie! I definitely liked how he walked the line between villain and family man without skipping a beat. And last but not least, Viola Davis. I am so glad that she took this role because I don't think any other actress would have the presence, ability, or facial expressions that made her role of Amanda Waller really come alive. She is a bad ass that I would definitely not want to mess with. In many ways, she sometimes came across as more menacing then the bad guys, and that's saying a lot.The other characters/actors were also incredible, not one complaint.This is the first movie that as soon as I was walking out of it, I really wanted to get back in line, get another ticket, and see it all over again!</fullReview>

I am a big fan of the Suicide Squad comics and I think the movie has done a great job at putting my favourite comic book characters onto the big screen. Personally, I would recommend everyone to ignore the reviews, including my own, and go out with some mates to see this movie and see what you think.

		<fullReview>How does one sum up this movie well you just cant. This movie has been on my mind since I first found out a year ago and I have been waiting non stop and here we are. Lets talk Amanda Waller yes viola Davis was exceptionally amazing and a great choice on creating a tact force team of the baddest of the bad and they delivered just that. First up the infamous Lloyd Lawton aka dead-shot an assassin who never misses and he was exceptionally fanatic on keeping what he values on mind. Will smith was not bad at all he even gave a side to dead-shot that was perfect. Harley Quinn was just tasteful she was perfect among words and she gave the character perfection amongst all things. Jared Letos joker was interesting to say at most he gave the joker a whole new side and yet kept it insanely perfect. The rest of the cast was among perfect from Diablo to killer croc and the boomerang gave the characters something to love. this movie was amongst perfect in many ways the movie took the baddest of the bad and made a hell of a team and I have to admit the trailers gave this movie perfect justice. Shockingly to say the reveal of the main villain was not what I expected and how the movie plays out was just grand it was truly worth the wait and would see it again.</fullReview>

Don't take my word for it, go see for yourself. If you have the chance to see on IMAX 3D, even better. It's a movie based on a comic not the Titanic sinking. Great way to take your mind off all of the serious stuff. Don't think too deeply. Just Enjoy. Have a popcorn and a cold pop and see something fun.

I did not know the character Diablo before this movie and I did not know about the actor that played him and yet it was one of the best characters in comic-movies .They made me care for them. And we got awesome villains for the future something that Marvel right now fails to do . So DC keep it bad and fight the evil . I went as a comic lover and I am happy. I believe people set the bar For Dc allot higher that they set it for Marvel and every time is not that high people go crazy . Like one of the best characters will say it.

		<fullReview>OK so...the Suicide Squad is perhaps the best DC film ever made! Heres the deal...When a movie introduces 8 new characters, Yes! You are going to have flashbacks. But in no way were they too drawn out, lost or unneeded. I have no idea what people were talking about. There was an appropriate amount of backstory, an excellent cgi team, and an excellent script. And the joker got a decent amount of screen time and hailed back to Jack Nicholsons joker. Everything was in its proper place. And the enchantress...Omg! If you did not like that...there's no hope for you. I'd suggest you stop watching comic movies. One word of advice. Do not pee. You'll be lost. Might as well not even walk back in. Wear depends if you have to. This movie is done they way it should have been done. If you are expecting a movie like Grapes of Wrath, or Jane Austen shame on you. The writers, directors, and yes the acting was great. I'm not a hardcore comic fan, but even if I were, I'd be proud of this movie. It did the SUICIDE SQUAD justice. Please keep in mind the name of the movie. If its not your "thing" then don't go see it. Don't lam-blast it as a "bad" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a great next step in the new DCEU. While it may not be a perfect film overall, there is so much fan service and truly incredible acting, that I really liked it! Ben as Batman was great to see again of course, and the film has a great take on the Joker &amp; Harley relationship! Its a delight when the film dives into these areas and it feels very natural. I do with that WB had not jumped in and edited the film so much. We know that they filmed so much with the Joker and its just left on the cutting room floor. While I know its not a Joker movie, it is a Harley Quinn movie, and it would serve to help us get to know her character even more to see these scenes! Will Smith brought his A-Game as Deadshot too! He was funny, and had some nice dramatic moments throughout the picture. Overall its probably an 8.5/10 for me. Id recommend seeing this. Its fun and the action keeps coming!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie don't listen to critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One VERY minor spoiler. So I just got back from seeing Suicide Squad for a second time and my opinion hasn't changed; it's awesome. Is it the best superhero film ever? No, but it's certainly in the top ten maybe even top five. Defiantly the second best DC film of all time after the Dark Knight. The film is getting a lot of hate for dumb reasons and I am inclined to believe that it's cause it's DC and Marvel fan boys are determined to see DC fail. The movie has a very simple plot and the villain's motivations are also very simple. But sometimes simplicity works best,case in point. Suicide Squad goes for a more humorous simple plot unlike the dark over-complicated DC film that preceded it. This is what I don't get, BvS was criticised for being humourless and over-complicated; this contains much more humour and a simple but good plot and is called childish and immature. The cast are all amazing with Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis an Jai Courtney being the stand outs for me. Without spoiling, Viola Davis kills it as the controlling, shady Amanda Waller which was fantastic. As previously mentioned there is a good amount of humour here and the jokes are very funny. It was amazing to see a few iconic comic book panels and covers be re-created here, and the brief cameos from Batman and another Justice Leaguer where amazing. My only gripe with the movie is that there isn't a whole lot of Joker, but I'd say he's in it as long as Spidey was in Civil War so it's six and two threes really. As for Jared Leto every scene he was in he stole and was amazing, although I still don't like the tattoos he is an amazing Joker and I can't wait to see him again (although Heat Ledger is still the definitive Joker). So just to wrap it up this is an amazing film and is perfect proof you shouldn't listen to critics, listen to fans who know these characters and know an amazing adaptation when we see one. I liked BvS but I'll admit it had it's problems, but this is a vast improvement, the DCEU is headed in the right direction. Ignore the critics go see this awesome movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it is a disappointment that Joker didn't had so many scenes, but I'm happy he was in this movie. Joker and Harley were so ''adorable''together. I know Joker is a madman, but this movie showed him as a madman who still has feelings, for Harley. I do not care what the others are saying, this movie is really great if you like Joker and Harley, and love DC. I hope to see more of this Joker in a solo batman movie, or for example Suicide Squad 2. We need more of this Joker to see, you can't compare him with Ledger, because Leto had about 5-10 minutes, while Ledger had more than the half of the dark knight. Do not listen to haters, go and watch this awesome, twisted film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Suicide Squad in 3-D last night and was initially skeptical with all the mixed reviews I have been reading this past week.First thing: Please stop comparing these DC Extended Universe movies to the Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy. Thats like comparing Bob Kane's batman to Frank Miller's version. Both are night and day different but great in their own aspects. That is what is going on with these movies. You have to watch these movies and not compare them to the movies from the past. Have a open mind and enjoy the fresh take on these characters because as far as comic book movies go Suicide Squad is an EXCELLENT movie. Its filled with cameos and story builders for future movies while still telling an individual story that is entertaining.Second: I do not see why critics are calling this movie a mess. As a person who went to art school and studied films as a visual effects and motion graphics artist i saw beautiful, artistic imagery and was able to follow the story line just fine. Never once did i feel lost, confused, or felt like there was any scenes that were unnecessary is developing the story or individual characters personality. This movie follows the perfect formula for story telling and future story building.In conclusion these movies grasp the darker aspect of the DC Universe, which the comics of the eighties are known for, while providing a modern feeling to the characters. Suicide Squad is definitely worth seeing in theaters, especially in 3-D. If you have even the slightest interest in seeing this movie, please go see it. Have an open mind as if seeing these characters for the first time and i guarantee you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really strong &amp; unique follow-up to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad tells the story of a group of really bad people forced to save the world. A covert government agency run by Amanda Waller(Viola Davis), wants to recruit the most despicable people, for their incredible abilities &amp; skill sets. Waller will use these group of people to take down otherworldly threats. She brings together a particular group of people including, Deadshot(Will Smith), Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), Boomerang(Jai Courtney), Diablo(Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc(Adewale Akkinuoye-Agbaje), June Moone/Enchantress(Cara Delevingne), Katana(Karen Fukuhara) &amp; Slipknot(Adam Beach). These bad guys are monitored in the field by American soldier, Rick Flag(Joel Kinnaman). If these group of people complete their mission successfully, they will get a reduction in their prison sentences. However if they fail, they will be thrown under the bus &amp; the government will blame them for all the chaos. Suicide Squad is a mind blowing film. I really cannot comprehend why the critics detest this movie so much. Except for one or two teeny tiny flaws, this film is an incredibly fun experience on the big screen. It is hilarious. This is how it successfully separates itself, from the generally dark tone of Man of Steel(2013) &amp; Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016). These two, are the previous movies set in the DC Extended Universe. The action sequences are visually, a delight to watch. The visual effects are excellent. All the CGI-rendered sequences look flawless. The 3D has been put to fantastic use, throughout the movie. One minor flaw in this film is that, all the action set pieces involve big explosions, monsters, swords, guns &amp; what not but, there are barely any hand-to-hand fight scenes. Another slightly more significant flaw, is the lack of screen time for Jared Leto's Joker. Apart from my nitpicking, this movie is crazy &amp; weird, in a good way! Director David Ayer has masterfully introduced these relatively unknown team of super villains, to the world at large. The climactic set piece &amp; the brief origin stories of all the characters, are some of the highlights of the film. The performances of this star-studded ensemble, is another highlight of the movie. Will Smith is spectacular as Deadshot. Smith showcases many subtle nuances of his bad-ass character. Jared Leto is awe-inspiring as The Joker. I still prefer the late Heath Ledger's now iconic portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime but, Leto takes his portrayal in a completely different direction &amp; owns it. I really hope The Joker has a significant role in the upcoming solo Batman movie. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Harley Quinn. Robbie doesn't just portray Harley Quinn, she becomes Harley Quinn. I am overjoyed that this fan-favorite character finally made her big screen debut &amp; Margot Robbie does not disappoint. Viola Davis is brilliant as Amanda Waller. Joel Kinnaman is perfect as Rick Flag. Jai Courtney is hysterical as Boomerang. Jay Hernandez is amazing as Diablo. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is hilarious as Killer Croc. Cara Delevingne is awesome as June Moone/Enchantress. Karen Fukuhara is incredible as Katana. The supporting cast is impressive. Watch out for unforgettable cameos. Suicide Squad is a must watch for all movie buffs. Seriously, the critics are out of their minds. Go, have a blast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why the critics are hating on this awesome movie, and I can't fathom them (Rotten Tomatoes) giving it the same score as BVS (which ACTUALLY was terrible)! Suicide Squad was a fun movie, just like Guardians of the Galaxy. That's the best way I can describe it, is FUN!If you've read any of the Suicide Squad comics or at least watched the TV show Arrow, you know that the suicide squad is a bunch of "bad guys" who are given the opportunity to do something good.The movie is very funny, light hearted and action packed. What I think I liked most though (aside from the star of the show Harley Quinn) is that the trailer DID NOT spoil everything! I won't spoil anything either, but let's just say that who the trailers lead you to believe the "villain" is (The Joker), isn't actually the villain.*****I put villain in quotes because they're all bad guys obviously, but someone has to be THE "villain" in the movie.***** I was a little disappointed that the Joker wasn't in the movie more, but at least they threw us a curve ball by making us think he was the "villain" when in fact he was kind of off doing his own thing.FINAL VERDICT: Suicide Squad will appeal to anyone who loves action OR comedy. If you Liked Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, Deadpool, etc, (AND YOU'RE NOT A CRITIC) you will love this movie! PS - Jared Leto's Joker was good, but still not better than Heath Ledger's (unbeatable) performance. I also think though, that since the Joker wasn't in this movie much, that no-one can accurately judge Jared's Joker until he's in another movie like Suicide Squad 2 (this movie was left WIDE open for a sequel) or maybe the Harley Quinn movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A box, open at the top, is to be made from a square piece of cardboard by cutting a square out of each corner and turning up the sides. Given that the cardboard measures 40 cm on a side, find the dimensions of the box that will give the maximum volume. What is the maximum volume? V= l(w)(h). Let volume be a function of h or V(h)=(40-2h)(40-2h)h. Take the derivative of the function and set it equal to 0: V'(h)=0 and solve for h which will be a relative minimum or maximum point. Suicide Squad looks fun. I've seen the movie with Will Smith where he's the only normal person in Manhattan who finds a cure. He befriends a woman who takes the cure to an outpost. Margot Robbie, in The Legend of Tarzan, is great with Will in fighting for a law enforcement agency.Quinn's gun with the 2 words Love and Hate written on the chamber. "That's a good idea honey", says Quinn. Deadshot can shoot like the time he hits a man with a bullet that ricochets or rebounds off a small surface. Holy Donut!

		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie since Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice turned out awful, however, this movie makes up for it is is so much better it is able to fix the timing issue and a steady plot that Batman v Superman failed to do and was able to combine all of these different genres into a comic book movie which is what this is straight from the pages of a Suicide Squad comic book.Of course like all movies it has some bad spots, not all movies are perfect, it has a slow beginning but that just builds up the characters more before the action begins which was amazing, I'm didn't like that the Joker was in it as much as I would have hoped however Jared Leto said that they cut out a lot of his scenes.The imagery mixed with the correct score and don't forget soundtrack made this an amazing film which I thoroughly enjoyed, also some amazing cameos!!Overall I would give a 9.5/10 however you can't do that so it will have to be a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... Critics and Marvel Trolls, chill; DC and Movie Fans everywhere, have fun with your Squad!Once again the critics have proved themselves to be out of touch and irrelevant as last night I watched one of the most fun movies in an age at the cinema and literally left the theatre grinning from ear to ear. I'm not a film critic but I believe I know movies and after trawling through some of the worst (written) reviews that I've ever read, I'm definitely confused.com. Late twenties Rotten Tomatoes score??? Not even anywhere close to representing the film I experienced.Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto et al, absolutely nailed it and David Ayer's recent twitter post played out for me throughout the entire film... Zapata quote is my way of saying I love the movie and believe in it. Made it for the fans. Best experience of my life. &#x2764;&#xfe0f; The soundtrack and original score are also both fantastic and the mid credits stinger is just the icing on the cake.If you love Comic Books (I'm a Marvel Fan too &#x1f603;), if you love movies, if you love a fun time at the cinema; just breeze past the irrelevant and go see Suicide Squad, you won't regret it.I'll be back in line soon, at least another twice. Thank you and well done David Ayer; your cut is perfect!Everybody be cool, you be cool...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad: Best Love Story since Titantic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not think I was going to like Suicide Squad very much, considering how very disappointed I was with Batman vs. Superman and Captain America Civil War recently, and I was right... and wrong. I did not like this movie...I LOVED IT!!!I actually liked it more than Guardians of The Galaxy. This is an excellent Family movie and date movie, its funny and romantic, and good action. A feel good movie. Not like Captain America Civil War. The story was good. Its a combination of Guardians of the Galaxy and The Last Witch Hunter with Vin Diesel. The character development was all over the place but I liked that. You thought you knew who the main characters were and then they introduced some new characters or told a new story about one of the main characters. Not worth seeing in 3D (I didn't notice much 3D) but I definitely enjoyed watching it on the IMAX and rich colors and great sound. If you liked the Guardians of The Galaxy you'll probably enjoy this one. So glad Will Smith choose this over Independence Day 2. This movie would be nothing without Will Smith. One of his best movies to me. He was perfect for this role. And I didn't think he would be. I thought this was going to be another After Earth, I Robot, Wild Wild West or Hancock (all movies Will Smith should NOT have done) But it was just the opposite. I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role. Will Smith made this movie better. He was right in his comedic element like in Men in Black and Bad Boys. The movie just worked because of his character and funny lines. He was a hero. And that's the problem I had with Batman vs. Superman and Captain America Civil War. These movies took my beloved heroes (Batman and Captain America) and made them bad guys. I'm old school. I like comics because the characters had high integrity, virtues and a courage that superseded regular folks. And the villains were villains because they modeled the worst behaviors and vices. This movie took Criminals and lead them on a path of redemption and made them heroes. Harley Quin was so well done. She was perfect. The actress should win an award for her performance. She knocked it out of the park, and her portrayal explained so many gaps we've always had about this character from decades of comic books, movies, and cartoons, that being she's a woman in love. She's crazy because she was so consumed with passion and in love. And she IS crazy...crazy good. Now the Joker was just awful. Not likable at all. As a matter of fact you just don't ever want to see him on screen. I don't think it was the actor's fault. I think it was the creative vision they went with. I didn't like him. Especially his makeup with braces or his costume, nor his mannerism, what he says and does, or the way he talks, its one of the weakest points of the movie--The portrayal of the Joker. Heath Ledger was a beloved villain and a brilliant depiction of the Joker. You could get next to Heath Ledger's Joker and be awed at his brilliance and creativity and frightened by his madness. He was an entertaining villain you just wanted more of. This joker is a pervert you'd see on an episode of Law and Order SVU that you hope will die soon so we don't have to see him again. BUUUTTTTTT.....the Heath Ledger Joker wouldn't have worked in this movie. No....this Joker was passionate and in love with Harley Quin, and you could feel it, and for just a few moments, for this story, he kinda worked. So the whole movie was a Frankenstein story. Dr. Frankenstein was played by Viola Davis and she was good--BAAADDD and very good at being bad. The monster was the team of misfits and they are lovable. Family Movie: Yes-13+I'd prefer my children to see the good values depicted in this movie than the values and examples in either the Captain America Civil War or the Batman vs. Superman movie. Thumbs up for Suicide Squad. Its appropriate for children 13+. There are some violent scenes of a man getting shot point blank in the head and sexual strip club dance scenes that I don't think is appropriate for under 13. Its a Love StoryThis was just the one of the best and most ROMANTIC films I've seen in a long time. Who would expect that from a comic book movie? I was was pleasantly surprised at the director's creativity to go so deep symbolically. Particularly with the falling scene and the gun Will Smith uses at the end. The whole movie is about "demonstrative" LOVE and REDEMPTION in different perspectives. **There is a scene in the movie with the Joker and Harley that is so passionate and romantic that it took my breath away. You just don't see that in a lot of movies today especially WITHOUT sex and nudity. But the writer/director was creative in letting you feel the depth of the emotion. I hope others get that. I suspect it might be overlooked because its a comic book movie, but I am grateful that I caught it. Overall I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know if I enjoyed it so much because I had such low expectations given what was presented to us with the earlier DC movies, but I really loved this movie. Very feel good. Definitely worth bringing the family to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would have happened if I gave weight to the critics.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have missed a phenomenal movie. I find the critic reviews enigmas. They have been right and we know there are some very good critics, but their just missing it on this one. I just can't imagine walking out of this movie thinking it was worse than any movie on RT at 50% (almost 2X better than SS).. So Hellboy 2 at 85% RT is just on another level compared to Suicide Squad if weight put on that score. I mean not even close...85 to 29 ? I'm in my mid 40's and no fanboy. That was a great movie! Visuals, Cool Action, Mystery, Atmosphere, overall feel and texture was great. I thought the appropriate amount of time was dedicated to the appropriate people and honestly came out with my cheeks hurting from smiling :) The Critics just dropped the ball on this one. Completely dropped the ball...to the tune of 29% Highly Recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halfway through the movie I realized why critics had such a problem with this movie. It's really quite simple: They have never picked up a comic book in their lives. The movie is very comic-book-y. It's hilarious. Corny at times, like you would expect from a comic book. Yet it is full of emotion as well. Deadshot (played by Will Smith) steals the show with artistically done scenes that will break your heart.Enchantress' CG is amazing and fun to watch. The Joker and Harley Quinn's story is both hilarious and exciting to watch unfold.The movie ties into other DCU movies as well, which is cool to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The formula for this movie doesn't match any formula I've ever seen in any movie. It wasn't plot centric because the plot was character driven. Keep your eye on the character interplay if you want to track the plot.I enjoyed the characters. I enjoyed the chemistry between the actors and actresses in this film. Each character was believable and real. People looking for a specific portrayal of a specific characteristic should read the comic books and stick with that. It is a fast paced, fun movie. The differences in the people, the way they interacted with each other kept the plot moving forward.There were no two dimensional characters in this movie. The director did a very impressive job splitting your attention ten different ways and still maintaining a central theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank you DC, David Ayer and the incredible "Suicide Squad" cast for making this comic book geek's dreams come true. I am a fan of both DC and Marvel movies, and the so-called "competition" between the two rival studios will only benefit us moviegoers because it challenges filmmakers to be bigger and better. I cannot think of any movie that I have seen in recent years that exuded such swagger, confidence, attitude, intelligence, grit and, yes, even heart like "Suicide Squad." While the villain is somewhat generic, the chemistry between the cast members is electric and worth the price of admission alone. All of the DC Easter eggs and surprise cameos made my head spin. This film continues the development of the DC extended universe, and it rightly sets the stage for the upcoming "Justice League" movie. Ignore the critics and the naysayers. This movie is a blast!!! &#x1f525; &#x1f525;&#x1f525;.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Heroes Ever? No, Entertainingly FUN!!....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a really fun, entertaining movie, not perfect but entertainingly fun. Will Smith as Deadshot is spot on fun as always. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is really entertaining, hands down the best part of the movie, makes you want to see more of her. Jared Leto's take on the Joker was different from previous portrayals, he did a really great job on his role even though he didn't have much screen time, the desire to see that menacing feel he has when he's on screen, makes you desire to see him soon in the near future. Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, with his funny antics. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc,a man with few words but, when he does say something it's hilarious. Karen Fukuhara as Katana, she wasn't explored much and didn't say much, though Karen did seem to look the part of Katana, will be great if she's explored more in a future film. Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, was really the surprise of the squad, he literally was the one who made the squad focus. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, fantastic, she's menacing as it gets, straight forward too, hope to see more of her. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag was one word, phenomenal can't say more. Now of course with every movie it will have it's flaws.... Adam Beach as Slipknot, his portrayal seem to come out of nowhere, he literally was just brought in, wasn't mention how or why, about five minutes later, he's dead, word is WB cut many scenes from the movie, hope sometime soon there is an explanation for this. Cara Delevinge as Enchantress/ Dr. June Moone, can't say much about her portrayal as Dr. June Moone she didn't really say much. As Enchantress she was a bit underwhelming as a lead villain though at least she didn't have some corny lines as some villains in other superhero films do, everything was there to have had her portrayed a convincing villain, sadly it wasn't taken advantage of, Would of been great if the main villain would of been Jared Leto's Joker right from the get go. As a movie as a whole, it wasn't amazing but it sure was great, from it's dark tone to it's lighthearted moments, it isn't as bad as critics say, i do recommend watching these Worst Heroes Ever....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be direct and simple, this was a great movie that followed the comic story arches well. Its a blast start to finish, feels like you had just sat down when it ends, and that is impressive for a 2 hr film. I want the general audience to realize that this is a comic book movie, almost a new 52 movie, and if you enjoy source material it is phenomenal. Even if you don't read the comics, this is a SATISFYING film, rare, with tons of action and tons of characters with very individual personalities. My final verdict is this is a great movie that could have been hands down the best comic movie of all time with an R rating. Jared Leto makes for a unique joker that we just want to see more of, Margot is maybe the best Harley Quinn anyone will ever achieve, El diablo, Boomerang, and Killer Croc have time to shine as well and David Ayer is a genius to get us to care about one of them let alone them all and yet we want so much more. Cant wait to see SUICIDE SQUAD 2. Flawless all things considered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-hyped but still a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With what may be the best movie marketing campaign of all time, over-hype is sure to come. This is the case for Suicide Squad. People were expecting something on the level of a Christopher Nolan Dark Knight film, and weren't okay when a good, not great, summer blockbuster was released. There is a lot of good things in this film to be grateful for. Every major character was great and a clear perfect fit for the future of the DC universe. Deadshot, played by Will Smith, was absolutely superb. His one liners were great, and he showed true poise in a position of leadership with the group. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), your all-American man, seemed like something taken straight off the comic book page. It was a solid performance with close to no flaws. Many of the minor characters seemed to hit the ground running as well. Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, El Diablo, and Katana although not getting nearly the screen time as Harley and Deadshot, all did solid jobs in securing their positions for future films. Now for the standouts, Amanda Waller, Harley Quinn, and Joker. Three brilliant performances played by three brilliant actors. Not a lot needed to be said. They'll make you feel a range of emotions while keeping you thoroughly entertained. Viola Davis shines as the harsh and cruel Amanda Waller while Margot Robbie displays perfectly the crazy within the head of Harley Quinn. Her performance was by far the best of them all and will leave the audience craving more. Now the Joker, played by Jared Leto was interesting. It is obvious there will be mixed feelings towards his take on the iconic character but personally I thought his bizarre and humanized take on the psychopath was great. Although the cast was great, of course the movie had its flaws. Without giving away any spoilers, the entire villain plot was a mess and felt extremely rushed. There was very little back story or character development for this character. Thankfully this was the only character with a shallow backstory. The CGI in this case was pretty weak as well. Although in no ways horrible, it was vastly clear that DC hasn't reached the level of CGI accuracy that the Marvel Universe has. The other major problem with this movie was the editing. Cheesy one liners followed by awkward scene cutting or weak transitions lead to a couple legitimate cringe worthy moments. The storyline had great potential but seemed to be skewered by irrelevant characters and poorly cut together scenes. All in all though this movie is still a must see. The future of the squad is promising due to the great cast and strong backstories of ever major character. Although there were some obvious weaknesses, the entertaining action mixed with real emotion and plentiful laughs came together to make a solid summer blockbuster definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as it seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying I was very excited for this movie. After the Dark Knight trilogy concluded I have been ready for the DC universe to actually become a universe instead of just Batman and now suicide squad is the 3rd movie of the DC universe movies. The critics have not expressed positive feedback on any and suicide squad followed that tradition. Now as a huge fan of superhero movies, I was very excited for a villain superhero movie to come out. With this movie it shows how different it is than any comic book movie we've seen in the past, which is something I really liked. I also feel like one positive thing that has been said about the movie is the performances by Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis in general... and I have to say those three actors took those roles and showed exactly why they were cast. With some awesome performances, a great idea, and a lot of fun action I liked this movie, but there's still problems with it. When looking at this movie not as a comic book movie and just a fantasy, action-packed movie it falls short. The movie feels very choppy with the editing that was in it, and there were many plot holes that can be seen that just take you out of the movie. All in all Suicide Squad is not a horrible movie, it's just not necessarily a well made movie, but the movie was still a lot of fun to see. I recommend seeing it if you were excited to, just because mindlessly watching this movie is extremely enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, gory and sexually explicit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 20 minutes into viewing I made the decision to leave. I didn't deem it necessary for the kids or myself to see such dark and sexually explicit, demonizing scripting. Certainly not a movie for kids under 13. My family loves action and adventure. Although this film surely included both, I refused to sit thru it with good conscious. We all wanted to get the full plot and see where it was going. I could not consent to the children seeing another minute of the film. Lap dancing, men and women kissing each other, to each his own, not for my family. Enough already. Not allowing such to be flaunted in the eyes of our kids when in my power. I realize the necessity of knowing who the characters were prior to recruitment to the squad. Sexually explicit scenes and profanity aren't necessary to make a top selling movie. I really believe the overall plot would have been great. And lastly, I'm not a fan of Will Smith's movies nor his acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final DC movie I will ever pay to see, even if it was OK in the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of Suicide Squad, I thought it would redeem DC and I'd really enjoy it. I was seriously going in with expectations around 8, and what I got was 6, and I'm highly considering a 5. How it could possibly be worse than Batman V Superman or one of my least favorite superhero films of all time, Man of Steel, is mind boggling. Maybe it's not as bad as Man of Steel, because there were parts and characters I did enjoy. I am about to list the actors/actresses from best to worst. Keep in mind, movies are art, and art is subjective.Will Smith (Deadshot): This is hands down, his best performance ever. This the only movie I actually talk about (with him in it) and refer to the character and not Smith himself. Deadshot was possibly the most well developed of the characters and as such, the most enjoyable.Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn): A better Joker than the Joker we got. Margot Robbie depicted an insane woman who fell in love with a possibly even more insane man. I would have put her over Will Smith in terms of acting, but her voice started to annoy towards the film, especially whenever she said "pudding". Overall, generally good.Viola Davis (Amanda Waller): The last "good" actress on the list (aside from the following mixed feelings one), Viola performed spectacularly in the film. I generally think she could be a military leader type thing. The only thing that kind of annoyed me was when she randomly shot people for no reason. I guess it pays to be sadistic.Cara Delevigne (Enchantress): OK, so I have mixed feelings about this one. As the Enchantress we saw in the original trailers, and as June Moone, she performed well. However when she turned into the Maleficent looking witch, and wasn't even in the Suicide Squad herself, really REALLY annoyed me. Great character, OK use.Jared Leto (Joker): Was he bad? No. Was he the best? Hell no. Jared Leto's Joker was OK, but the fact he was criminally-underused in the movie, and took up so much time in the trailers really ticked me off. If you want a great Joker, just go back and watch The Dark Knight, or play the first 2 Arkham games.Joel Kinnaman (Rick Flag): Decent. Enough said. Jay Hernadez (Diablo): Decent. Enough said.Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Killer Croc): Wasn't used enough and was one of the most pointless characters.Karen Fukuhara (Katana): Wasn't used enough and was one of the most pointless characters.Jai Courtney (Boomerang): The Australian accent annoyed me so much, I couldn't care less whether he died or not. Adam Beach (Slipknot): Was the number 1 most pointless character, who had like 4 lines and died right at the beginning. WHAT A WASTE.Aside from that, I have multiple other complaints. These include:Misuse of The Joker and Jared Leto's talent. Missing clips from the bloody trailer. The pointless characters. The horrible ending. Lack of dark tones. The film just randomly playing songs. Using the most famous promotional song in the credits. Slipknot. Making Enchantress the villain.Of course, the film did some good things to. Robbie, Smith and Davis did well, the effects were good, (even though it felt out of place) the songs were good, And some of the backstory scenes were pretty good.In the end, it's an OK film. Is it the worst movie of 2016? No. Is it the most disappointing? Hell yes. Should you go see it? If you likes MoS and BvS, then yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gosh darnit, I waited and waited for this movie to come out and then it does and it was just the biggest letdown of all time. Where do I start? I think the problem was really just that the characters were completely undeveloped and therefore uninteresting. Maybe that was the intention since they were supposedly a squad of super heroes that the American Government was willing to throw away. I hope the second half was really good, I wouldn't know as I left before the ending. You know, we suspend our disbelief to go to movies to start with so we are prepared to see unbelievable things and believe it for the sake of the movie. But, I had a hard time doing this for the Suicide Squad. They truly painted unbelievable things unbelievably and that makes me mad. Will Smith didn't help the problem much with his presence. He is like the typecast actor that doesn't get jobs because people see him as a character once beloved. Only, he continues to be cast in role after role and acts exactly the same way in every movie. I understand why Jared Leto had his role cut down - because he would have been the only interesting character to watch in this stupid film. Do not make a part two. Especially if you can't find some kind of anti-heroes that possess some form of originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total mess. But a lot of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a mixed bag. It's one of those movies that I can understand completely if you love it, and also understand if you hate it. The critics are totally right in everything they say. The film is a total mess. To sum it all up, it's post Batman vs Superman paranoia. The story is illogical. The villain id terrible. The editing is atrocious, you can tell they made so many changes last minute in order to make the film feel fun. That includes shoving 100 different fun songs within the first 30 min of the movie even if it doesn't fit. The character introductions are lazy exposition. The dialogue is pretty corny at times. The joker is completely unnecessary to the plot. There are plot elements that feel very rushed. It's obvious so much has been cut. Objectively, this is a bad movie.However, I had fun. While some characters got shafted with little development, I thought the characters were likable. I think the actual suicide squad is what carries this film. They all have great chemistry, and its fun to see them fight on screen together. The action was decent, but held back for a PG-13. Will Smith as deadshot is my favorite part. This film reminded me why Will Smith is so highly regarded. While he doesn't choose the best roles, he just oozes charisma. He's charming and carries a lot of this film. Margot Robbie is a good fit for Harley Quinn, but I found some of her one liners a bit cringeworthy at times. Nevertheless, it's really a great portrayal of that character and I can't think of a better actress for thr part. Jai Courtney might be my favorite as Boomerang. He totally steals the show. I never thought I'd say that. Jared Leto as the joker is so insanely over the top, that I couldn't help but enjoy him. I like the idea of having this kingpin pimp joker. It's a fun take.This movie is fun and kinda campy but I think it's part of the appeal. I think the main problem with the film is the editing. I think the editing choices were very poor and it's obvious that a lot was cut. I think it's possible that there's a really good directors cut lying around. I guess that's why we should buy the blu ray! Right? Screw Warner Bros. 6.5/10</fullReview>

Rotten Tomatoes was anything but accurate in its description and analysis of this movie. I think their glorified critics need to ask themselves what ever could justify their review of a meagre 22% Packed with just the right amount of excitement and a storyline that though may not blow your brains away, Suicide Squad is anything but mundane. In fact if you've read the comic books, you're in for a treat. Perhaps it's the growing number of superhero fans who have no idea what DC is about, having being force fed marvel's nauseous mix of one liners and clichéd stories. Margot Robbie stands out for her portrayal of Harley, and Jared Leto leaves you wanting for more. Definitely worth your time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE. I watched this movie on Friday, the premiere date in the UK. I walked in after reading reviews on the film saying the script was bad, the CGI was terrible and that the plot was awful. The character introductions were great. I especially liked Captain Boomerangs intro with the Flash cameo. Although these scenes took up about 20 minutes estimated of the movie, I enjoyed them. Enchantress was amazing. I was looking forward prior to the movies release to see the scenes with her in. She was the most interesting character in the trailers. Her brother/ the other villain in the movie was The Incubus. He really had a minor role in the film. His fight with Diablo was very intense. A few people in the movie do die. For instance Slipknot was killed off after 2 scenes and only about 4 lines. But he was useful I guess. He taught the squad that there was a bomb in their neck. Diablo's death scene was extremely sad. He did have a great final scene. I hated the Joker. By this I mean that Jared Leto played the character so good, I really felt hate towards the Joker. He was truly evil and I really didn't want Harley Quinn to be with him. Deadshot and Harley Quinn stole the show. Harley brought lots of humour to the movie and Deadshot was the core of the team. Katana's backstory was also sad. I especially felt sorry for her when she was talking to her sword as she believes the soul of her dead husband is trapped inside of it. The scene was quite emotional to be honest. Rick Flagg was great. I liked the friendship he and Deadshot built throughout the movie. I wish there was more Killer Croc in the movie. I like his character but he needed more lines. Boomerang brought humour to the movie as well as Harley Quinn. The only bad thing about the movie was the scene at the strop club in the beginning. Monster T (Tattooed Man) met The Joker there. But, Joker being the psychotic person he is, killed him. I wish his character was developed more and I wish he wasn't killed off. Seeing his powers would have been great. People thought he was the person smashing up the train in the trailers but that was The Incubus. Monster T was a really minor character.I give this movie a 10/10 for having a good plot and amazing characters. The best movie of 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are a DC fan you will like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't always listen to what the "critics" say. This movie is good, this movie has great characters and great action. The main problem with it is the story which is all over he place and the plot is very simple. Also, the movie seems so dark but actually it's very light which was my main problem, also my only other problem was that there wasn't enough Joker.Will Smith did an amazing job, he didn't play Will Smith like he does in every other movie, he played cold hearted Deadshot. Margot of course is hot and played her perfect, she was written very well and there was only 1 cringe worthy joke at max. The others were cool but honestly most care about the big actors. The bad guy is OK, a little too much cgi and the person gets revealed pretty early, but the action that follows is good. Sometimes there are movies with action that makes you want to fight, sometimes there are movies where the story is so good your feel happy or cry. This movie makes you want to live in the dark world of DC, I want to be a superhero or super villain, I want to be half realistic while being half dark fantasy comic. Don't believe the reviewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of this year so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this was just what I wanted and expected. I was smiling like an idiot through all the movie. It's just so much fun. I really don't know why some people are giving this movie such a bad review... I don't know what they were expecting. This is NOT a super hero movie, is about villains, it HAS to be messy, they are messy. They don't work like normal super heroes, they don't go, do the work and save the day like others. And It's good that they make character introduction that long... many people don't know ANYTHING about these villains, maybe they didn't even know they existed. It's good that they present us their story so we can somehow "connect" with them, so they no longer are seen like just "villains doing bad things ha ha", but people who made all the wrong choices but can have a second chance after all. Also, I don't know why they are comparing Heath Ledger's Joker with Jared's. Don't get me wrong... Heath Ledger's Joker was perfect, but why compare the work of two EXCELLENT actors? Jared Leto's Joker was brilliant. For me, he is a different Joker, one we haven't seen so far. I can't compare them, because they are so different and I don't understand how some people would think it's fair to do it. Jared made an excellent Joker, a Joker he was ASKED to do. Excellent work. I saw it yesterday and I wanna see it again, by myself with a remote control so I can pause and rewind any time I want. I'm very pleased with this movie, I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a dysfunctional family you love were a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After you walk out of the theater, you will develop a dysfunctional relationship with a movie that you will hate to hate. That is precisely what this movie is - dysfunctional as a whole, yet a good amount of brilliant when dissected holistically. In spite of the top-notch entertainment value, the A- acting skills, the sporadic humor, and the relentless theatrics, Suicide Squad's greatest strength still lies in DCEU's fan-base; and in turn, the filmmaker's and the studio's inherent need to satisfy this fan-base's thirst. While in SS' case, this need definitely falls short of quenching DC-fans' now entirely parched throat, it gets brownie points for trying its level best to live up to expectations. Suicide Squad doesn't deserve all the hate it gets - as a matter of fact, if it weren't for the pretext of failed DC movies and the pressure to release a hit, Suicide Squad would've fared as a considerably above average movie outside the DCEU. Many factors contribute to making Suicide Squad a successful commercial potboiler with adequate substance (yet far more outweighing style), a few of which are: 1) The characters: Everyone plays their part with undeniable panache. Jai Courtney has objectively redeemed himself of all past Terminator sins, Will Smith is as dynamic as a convicted hit-man with a sense of humor can get, Margot Robbie is a delectable treat to watch thanks to her timing, expressions, delivery, and flawless Harley Quin-ness, and The Joker is impeccable, for as long as he is permitted to be on screen. 2) The CGI: It has its good, it has its bad, and it has its terrible. The good fortunately overshadows the rest. 3) The chemistry: While not as endearing and easy to believe as GotG's characters', all of the squad share moments that bring us as viewers closer to them, and themselves to each other. 4) The theatrics: Ayer knew exactly what he was doing. While any comic book movie consists of a certain amount of pandering to its niche audience, to balance both your own ideas with the expected theatrics and heroism from a superhero movie, is a task in itself, one of the few that David Ayer nails right in the head. But that's where the upsides of a $13 ticket end. Here is the travesty of pitfalls: The Script and the Screenplay: Supernatural enchantress, that is a 'witch'? What were they thinking? It isn't like they even balanced this pastiche with thoughtful and intelligent realism - they went all out, making even a comic book fan's appetite for surrealism shake its head in disapproval. The story was terrible, the premise was wafer-thin, the screenplay a bare minimum of okay, and the dialogues were a let- down.The flaws: In a franchise that succeeds the likes of Nolan's Batman, you would expect at least a little pedantic need for perfection. Suicide Squad completely lacks this, and does not even seem to hesitate when a few of its scenes blatantly fall short of a large movie's standards in terms of story, screenplay, and direction.Yet in spite of it all, the movie is quite easily passable as a popcorn flick, and deserves a chance if you're looking to spend two hours on a movie you will definitely enjoy, but also dislike it for its many flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never cared about those arrogant critics because their reviews never influence my decision to watch a certain movie whether it's good or not. Suicide Squad became a hit on very different on many levels as we see the bad guys behaving as heroes fighting an evil entity in this dark action comedy movie. The performances of Will Smith, Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and the other actors were sublime except for Cara Delevingne who is a terrible actress and should stick to modeling. I liked the Batman cameo and the reference to Superman's death from the last movie. DC movies never disappoint and they're way superior to Marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me say that I'm not familiar with comic book stories. I used to have some comic books (mainly Superman, Batman and Spiderman) but generally I'm pretty casual moviegoer when it comes to comic book movies. If there's a comic book blockbuster that looks fun - I'm in. Plus I want to support interesting ideas, and judging Suicide Squad from its trailers and promo materials - it certainly looked like one. That's why I decided to go and see it, and boy was it an experience...Good things: - casting was pretty much spot on (with one exception - check 'bad things' section). Will Smith as Deadshot is great, Margot Robbie gives over the top performance (that some people might find annoying/stupid, I liked it), hell, even Jai Courtney looked like he had fun portraying crazy Aussie Boomerang. - story line. Now, I don't know if this came from comic books 1:1 or what. I just liked the dynamic between unconventional villain and our 'heroes' who are also supposed to be bad guys - Enchantress moments. I loved the design of the witch, special effects of her transformations were awesome Bad things: - Joker. This is the same problem that I had with Jessie Eisenberg in BvS - he's not crazy and menacing at all... Jared Leto's portray of The Joker is over the top, but in a goofy and laughable way, which, I recon, was not the general intention... As if this is not bad enough, almost ALL scenes with the joker were already shown in the trailers, what a joke :P - sloppy universe building. 10 seconds of Batman here, 5 seconds of Flash there, it's like those stupid videos in BvS, totally anticlimactic and useless. - PG-13 - so we have this pack of scum, thieves, assassins, crazy people, etc. Where's swearing? Where's blood? Where's something that would make the characters and this whole world believable? - rushed plot. This movie contains - brief story of EVERY suicide squad member, Enchantress betrayal, joker / harley quinn stockholm syndrome love story, witch plan to destroy humanity and suicide squad coming together to fight evil, few cameos (Batman, Flash), something about Superman... In other words - BvS syndrome - packing too much into one movie and setting up universe rather than concentrating on a cohesive story - too many dark stories from the past. Like that flame guy story, damn that was depressing. - weird plot twists. What up with that Indian guy who can climb easily and gets killed almost immediately after his introduction? What up with joker not dying (it's like they can't just kill joker, because he has to appear in the next 1000 DC movies, so let's just bring him back despite the fact that he DIED in that helicopter crash)... - camera work - action scenes are unwatchable. Shaky cams plus general mess of stuff flying in the air makes it pretty hard to see what's going on. You might say that it's a standard of action movies nowadays. For that I say - I don't like it :P - 'team roles'. I understand the flame guy being in the suicide squad. I understand Deadshot. I sort of understand Croc. But what the hell would they need Boomerang and Harley Quinn for? Boomerang is a thief and throws boomerang = useless. Harley Quinn is crazy and can swing the baseball bat = useless. It's like if you apply logic to this movie - it doesn't work. The problem is - it doesn't work as a mindless fun either...And the worst thing of all - the ending. Don't get me wrong, I was 100% sure that suicide squad will be a part of DC universe, but seeing them go back to prison and knowing that they are going to be used again and again and again in later movies feels so damn depressing for some reason...All in all - Suicide Squad is not a terrible movie, but it's not good either. 5/10 :/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers: The movie is not bad as the critics are pointing out but yes it's not good either... Just keep in mind when going to the movie that JOKER IS NOT THE BIG VILLAIN and I felt he should have been.Pros: +Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller and El Diablo were awesome! Jared Leto as Joker was convincing (NEEDED MORE SCENES) + First 20-25 minutes were stylish as the trailers depicted + The final parts were also awesome if you would forgive the clichéd storytelling + Great JL cameos...CONS: - RICK FLAG. I didn't sympathize with him and he was as Deadshot put it: "A crappy leader" - Not a great villain and really generic plot (That effect seriously reminded me of Fantastic Four) - The mid portions were being draggy - Some flashbacks need not have existed - Some soundtracks felt really offFinal verdict: This movie is supposed to be DC's savior and it's not... But it is also not a DC Cinematic universe killer as some point out as the actors in it are actually genuine in their character counterparts... Would love to see the villains in other films of the cinematic universe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's really not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to go into too much detail in this specific post, but I do want to make a stand here on IMDb that this movie isn't as bad as the critics are making it out to be. A score that's below 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes? Ouch! That's not a fair score for this movie.It's worth noting that most of my life I have been a huge fan of DC. And that's why I've been disappointed with the DC Cinematic universe so far. Man of Steel was a disaster and Batman v. Superman tried to do too much in one movie. Suicide Squad is lighter in tone, has a more simple premise, is a more focused movie, and is a ton of fun.Margot Robbie is as good as everyone's been saying. And Jared Leto kills it as the Joker, even though he isn't given much screen time. These two make a psychotically wonderful on-screen villain couple that I loved. Will Smith's Deadshot was also fantastic as he brings a lot of heart and charisma to the character with his backstory.I was also a fan of Captain Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc, and Enchantress even if they aren't quite on the same level as the other three villains. They're still good, though. I love the team dynamic. I love the idea of the suicide squad. Being that they're all villains, you never really know what they are going to do or if one of them is going to betray the team. In my opinion, an all-villain team has potential to be much more interesting than an all-hero team because you don't know who to root for or what's going to happen and this movie does a great job at that.The soundtrack was a bit much at times and the editing wasn't always super sharp. And no, there's no moment that really blows you away and there's no crazy twists or turns. But this is a really fun movie that's done well. It was my most anticipated movie of the year going in and even though it doesn't reach the heights I was hoping and thinking it would, it's still a lot better than many critics have made it out to be and is a huge step forward for DC that proves to me that their future is bright. My grade for the movie is an 8/10.If you do want to see a more in depth review from me, I just typed that up on my movie blog and thus you can go to this link right here to read more: http://drogemiester.blogspot.com/2016/08/suicide- squad-review.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still succeeds despite that one, huge shortcoming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And by one, huge shortcoming I mean that PG-13 rating.Wow, if ever a rating killed the potential a film had it would be this one. What an R rating could have done for this film, well... We'll all have to imagine it somewhere in the back burner of our fan-tasies.Despite that oh so obvious attempt to make the PG-13 rating work, it still has merit in being just a fun, hot mess of a film.The film gets things rolling very well right from the start. It's not a slow build up. Nice to finally see the scenes from the trailer in the correct order (probably not in the order you thought). Introduced are Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc, Enchantress and a host of other characters. For a cast this size, I'm impressed that the film neatly managed to squeeze screen time for every character without throwing any under the bus. What's more it managed to make us feel for the characters. That would also be a challenge for a cast this big, to zero in on and focus on their deeper personas, but the film manages to do so effectively particularly with Harley Quinn and Deadshot, who by the way, are the film's best characters. Margot Robbie deserves a few award nods for her take on Harley Quinn.As the trailers implied, the film gathers them up and spits them out in front of an enemy no one is prepared to deal with. They have just the right amount of devil may care attitude to carry out the job. This is where the film weakens a bit. Yeah, it's a scary foe, but we're left wondering, "With an enemy that fierce, where's the panic? Where's the wider sense of something going horribly horribly wrong." We never really get a broader scope of what it implies for the rest of the world. We see it purely from the angle of the insiders.This "insider view" is constant and consistent throughout the entire film. Whatever the world is seeing (something we often get in most comic book films) we're not seeing it. Everything is from our anti-heroes' point of view. This is one of the things that separates Suicide Squad from other films. It paints a dark but rosy outlook that we often don't see in most comic book films.In the end this is a very character-driven film. The action sequences work well, funny bits here and there, but if your'e not rooting for these guys by the end, you're obviously not a fan of interesting characters.One thing I'd like to add. Zack Synder's fingerprints are all over this film (making a film into one long music video is basically his signature), but luckily there are very few slow motion scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying too hard to be DC version of Gaurdians of the Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a fun, happy movie, don't get me wrong, but I felt like that it was trying too hard to be a very funny and special movie, but it failed to become one, and as a result it looked like a failed movie and try! Suicide Squad, as its own movie, is a good movie. Grab some popcorn, and enjoy the action, have fun and leave, and that's all about it. And I could give it a solid 7 or even an 8.But for some reason, I guess rivalry between DC and Marvel, DC wanted to have its own Guardians of the Galaxy; a bunch of misfits, oddballs, thieves, murderers, who unite to do some good and save the world or their city. But Suicide Squad miserably fails to live up to the bar set by Guardians of the Galaxy,and as a result I consider the mission of this movie a failure! But this could be a great movie on its own if they just wanted to enjoy themselves and produce some thing fun rather competing with Marvel.I could see multiple counterparts between Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of characters, dialogues, scenes, and even music. I felt like that the writer/director of Suicide Squad watched Guardians of the Galaxy multiple time, and created his version of the movie out of it! And he failed! A good percent of the jokes felt forced and they fell flat! Some of them were funny, but not all of them. Again, I am going back to my original comment; the movie was trying too hard! It was nice to see Will Smith again! He was good as Deadshot. But I think he director could give more space and freedom to Will. Will is a funny, likable man, and the Characters he play are like that as well. I think he could have more screen time. In this movie he was too much restricted and limited by the rest of the plot line, which wasn't as likable as him.Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie! I have contradictory feelings toward this character. In some scenes she was funny, but the rest not so much. Her screen time and role could be reduced and limited to just funny and interesting part. Don't get me wrong, Harley was trying hard to deliver, but they gave her too many lines and jokes to deliver, and a good percent of them were not funny or interesting to begin with! I really disliked the new Joker played by Jared Leto! Of course it is hard to live up to Heath Ledger version of Joker. I am not even comparing the new Joker with Heath. I am unable to put my finger on the main reason that I disliked the new Joker. Bad casting, bad direction, unclear role of the Joker in this movie? I don't know! I just didn't like the new Joker! I really liked Viola Davis as Amanda Waller! I hope I see her in future DC movies, and it seems that it will happen based on what they show at the end of the movie (Batman+Waller scene).Also Cara Delevingne did well in this movie. She is a model, not an actress, but she was able to deliver it.Overall, it is a good way to spend two hours of your weekend. But it could be much better if they had taken it easy and hadn't tried too hard!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there is a bunch of characters with great potential and stories that could be enough for 3 movies. instead we get a very strangely paced flick where none of these characters comes across as likable or seems to be more than an a stereotype. copy-pasted.my favorite is actually the bad black lady... as opposed to Will Smith who's playing himself and the crazy lady who's only around because of boobs. the rest of the cast is pretty unremarkable, the human aztec torch, lizard from the spider man movie, a Japanese lady and an crocodile dundee have to fight a lady with a strange accent. none of them is able to connect to the audience in any way.the sorceress is building her machine to destroy humanity for two thirds of the movie while the squad is wandering through debris where the individual members can find out for us and themselves that they actually aren't so bad after all because LOVE... and thereby quickly become a new and happy family.the fights are as bland as the jokes and the generic face- and bloodless bad guys. the soundtrack turns the movie into an overlong music video but at least many of the songs are good. not sure if the young people to which this movie is catering towards will know all the song but then, maybe they get to appreciate Bob Dylan. so after watching this for a while the music is the thing which you can look forward to because the rest pretty much sucks.the remaining question is why aren't they able to produce a good and decent movie based on a DC comic?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Individual Performances VS. Overall Plot/Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off this review by stating that my opinion is as a fan, and not so much a true critic by any means. With that out of the way we can begin.First thing I liked was the intro of the characters. Some say it was rushed and seemed like a presentation or school project in format. However, with this many people that is really the only way it could have been done without it taking the whole movie. Critics can hate it for being choppy and rushed, but I praise the creativity and doing what is necessary in the time allotted. Second things I LOVED were the performances. Now this is where the movie shines and Ayers writing shows. The way he built the character dialogue, and their backgrounds (however brief they were) allow good actors (Smith, Robbie, Leto, Davis, and yes even Courtney) to shine in their roles. These "villians" were made to show signs of humanity like fatherly love, romance, or caring about more than money/themselves. This is the area where the movie shines and the writing shows. Last thing I liked were the subtle additions to the movie. YES, batman is in it (that shouldn't be a spoiler), and the way they use him is perfect. The Jokers inclusions (however brief) are well done, and the great actors they got to play minor characters is impressive. Jay Hernandez as "El Diablo" is by far the most criminally underrated character (both in abilities and in his depth), and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as "Killer Croc" is amazing. Both actors have great careers, and here they step in as fillers. Scott Eastwood, Ezra Miller, and even Ben Affleck join in for cameo's and nail the parts (Affleck is the after credits scene).The One thing I hated is the story, and I say that because there almost wasn't one. David Ayer wrote such beautiful cast background and depth for the characters, but the story falls apart about 40 minutes to an hour in. The main villain is spotty, not to mention obvious, and the "why is this happening" is a mystery. I do not know if Ayer is to blame or if it's Warner Bro's for rushing production and forcing re-shoots and over editing, but it did not work at all. I hope Warner doesn't kill this franchise by being overly involved. I would give Ayer another shot easily. Overall: The cast saved this movie with their performances, and if they hadn't got all this depth in the characters it would have tanked. I value the performances above overall story, because even when the story started to tank and editing issues were hugely present the characters still entertained and provided laughs or enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was indeed much better than BvS with lots of comic action and a better direction overall. About the casting, Margot Robbie killed the scene as Harley! The psychopathic behavior with flashbacks of her earlier life was really good! Cara Delevingne was okay'sh, didn't like her that much. Will Smith, on the other hand gave an average performance; not as high as you'd expect of him. Ben Affleck made an appearance after the credits were rolled and Justice League was introduced and a few times during the movie. Now for the Joker, there has been lots of hatred against Leto but as I saw it, Heath Ledger portrayed the role of a psychopath while Leto was performing a rather sociopath Joker! This Joker would really be annoying and somber to those who enjoyed Heath's Joker. The movie is quite fast paced for 2 hours. They could have slowed it down and gone into details. Didn't like the music and they even cut off Bohemian Rhapsody right at the end (which was abrupt and really showed that they were in a hurry to pack up a movie in 2 hours). Overall, lots of action and hot Harley scenes (main attraction). Don't bother watching it in 3D and paying extra for not many 3D special effects. 6/10 overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You probably have to be a certain level of crazy to enjoy this movie to the extent I did. As a matter of fact, me and my two friends were the only ones laughing in the theater most of the time. At one scene in particular; when Harley is telling Diablo to man up to killing his kids. More specifically, "OWN THAT S&amp;**" we all cracked up because it was so weirdly entertaining that it was awesome. I could tell from the advertising that the producer/directors decided to get really weird with this movie, and I'm so glad they did. Instead of being serious yet funny, they embraced the dynamic of these characters, sure it was messy, and the writing was awful at times. But if you forgive it for its sins, as all these characters have done; quite a bit. It is a great time to be alive when high budget movies can go so crazy and make so many people angry. This movie wasn't made for the general public, or even the comic nerds. This movie was made for the people who relate to these characters more than the heroes. The people who see the many shades of gray. If you enjoy this movie and your friends don't, you should probably find new friends, because this is the litmus test for how crazy you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted and Therapeutic-The Risk That Paid Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Ayers's Suicide Squad (2016) is twisted as it is therapeutic. Colourful, comedic, dramatic, dark, violent, avant-garde and thrilling are a few choice adjectives to describe Ayers's work of art which reaches into the mind of the viewer.The film is fun and uncanny, running under the guise of the average comic book narrative but is deceptively deep. It plays on emotions and breaks the viewer down scene by scene. A psycho-analysis, a psychosis or a connection, I don't know what it is, but Suicide Squad is therapeutic on many levels. These are bad guys, villains of the worst kind, but you can't help but sympathize with them, understand them and later to identify with them. Admit it or not, Suicide Squad reflects the outcast in all of us.The thirteen-member ensemble is highly impact-ful and superbly cast. Jared Leto delivers a skillful performance as the joker, comparable and on par with his heavy-weight predecessors such as Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight, 2008)) and Jack Nicholson (Batman, 1989). This is matched and complimented by his bravado, psychotic, stylish and scene-stealing girl-friend, Harley-Quinn, played to a tee by the talented Aussie native, Margot Robbie. Of notable mention is Jai Courtney as the dead- pan humorous and bank-robbing kleptomaniac, Captain Boomerang, whose role though restricted, is effortlessly charismatic and emotionally poignant. Also noteworthy is new comer Jay Hernandez as the reformed arsonist and human flame-thrower "El Diablo". A comic book film with not only an emotional hook, but an emotional canvas. An impending risk that paid off greatly. A job well done Mr. Ayer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great and we'll worth it, just a few things that could be done better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really great movie, the year long wait was well worth it. Costume design and acting was above standard. The casting of each character was on point and so was the set design. After the first half hour or so of the movie however, things did get a little messy. There was not enough dialog at times, I enjoy films that jump right into the action, but the action has to be a little more organized. Also I expected this film to be dark and kind of graphic. I was upset about the PG rating more than anything else. I feel directors are too afraid to make a superhero/villain movie that's above M, people don't seem to understand that older people watch these films too. We need more movies like Deadpool. Overall, a marvelous film. Very enjoyable though some of it is predictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a really solid movie. I can see why people dislike some things in it, but it is impossible to not at least enjoy the movie. A lot people who think they are critics are giving it 1-3 stars. Really?! People are saying the plot is stale, sure it could've been better but most comic book movies have similar plots. The only problems that actually bugged me a bit was the pacing in some bits of the movie, and that the villain didn't have too much of an introduction. Overall a movie worth your time and money. It had a few laughs, dead shot was great, Harley was fantastic, the batman cameos were good and Captain Boomerang was frken amazing... and spoiler alert, A certain cameo of a justice league member was bloody great</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot better than the critics make you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading all the official reviews from the critics, I assumed Suicide Squad was going to be as awful as BvS. But on the contrary, this movie doesn't have big gaps in the story like BvS and it's fun as well. But they could've done a lot better though.I really enjoyed the character introduction. Especially for viewers not so familiar with DCEU, this was a nice touch. Personally, found it a little strange that they didn't introduce Slipknot. Even though he got killed in nearly his first scene, it would've made a bigger impact when he got his own introduction as well. After the introductions, the movie slowed down a bit and got slightly more serious.Will Smith and Margot Robbie were clearly the stars in this movie. Will Smith as Deadshot, as always, portraying el savior and Margot Robbie did an amazing job as the psychotic Harley Quinn. The chemistry between Harley Quinn and the Joker were great to watch and I can't wait to see if the two of them are getting their own spin off. According to the rumors, many scenes of the Joker were cut out off the movie. That's a shame, because although the screen time of Jared Leto was too short, he positively contributed to the movie. Then there's Enchantress... Out of all the villains in DCEU, they chose her... Her story was too obvious, the CGI wasn't that good and it kind of reminded me of the final scene of 2015's Fantastic Four when they fight Dr. Doom. Not a movie you want to be compared with. Choosing another villain and creating a better story around the villain would have easily added another point to the total of this movie. So all in all, the movie is not bad at all. Some jokes may come over a little too forced, but others will have you going. Some decisions should've been altered, as putting more of the Joker in the movie, choosing another villain and maybe go R-rated like Deadpool instead of PG-13. They are villains right?!And oh, please make up your mind for the next movie, either give Killer Croc a smaller head or give him a bigger body. This way, he kind of looked like... well you know what.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it opening night with some friends and they all seemed to love it (although if you ask me they were a little biased). I found myself a little speechless at the end of the movie but not in a good way. Watching the trailer, I expected a straightforward plot where they assemble a team while giving some back story and then they go fight something and there would be cool fight scenes with great chemistry between the characters. What I saw however, was a little messy. The beginning was pretty decent with the backstory I was looking for but it later got very messy and off. The plot developed too fast in some areas and too slow in others and I felt an imbalance throughout the whole movie. Also I think Deadshot and Harley Quinn got way too much attention and kinda stole the show. But as far as comic book movies go... It wasn't terrible, it was a "fun" movie and I was entertained nevertheless. I honestly have to say though, the post credit scene was the most exciting part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Blast Of A movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad has been a long awaited movie. It has some big shoes to fill. Coming off of widespread disappointment in BvS, and the difficult task of quickly building a formidable DC universe to catch up with marvel; the odds are stacked against it.Nevertheless, it does very well. It improves upon aspects of BvS that needed work, and still adds its own flair and style making it a brand new product. Will Smith brings a brilliant performance. He plays Deadshot, the token sane person on the team. He juxtaposes excellently with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, who is possibly the best incarnation of that character in any media to date. Gone are the frailty, weak humor, and overemphasized jersey accent. This Harley is a force to be reckoned with, because of her fighting skills, not because of her lackeys. As for Batman and the Joker, their roles are minimal. Jared Leto's performance, is intriguing though, and it is my hope that he will have a role in Batman's solo movie. This movie is very slickly made. Virtually every scene gives you that inner feeling, that just says "man, this is cool!". An epic soundtrack paired with various other rock songs set the atmosphere wonderfully. From the opening prison sequence with "House of the Rising Sun" playing, to the very end with "Bohemian Rhapsody" serving as the background for the films aftermath the music always sets the stage perfectly.But the best part of the movie is the action. The majority of it is one long battle. Set in a metropolitan setting, the Squad must make their way to the center of the city to beat the villain creating a giant laser beam in the sky. Nothing new, I know. It's how Ayer deals with it that makes it compelling. While mindless on the surface, the action is extremely involved. You know what is happening, and why its happening. The strategy involved is evident. There's a pretty powerful enemy that needs to be eliminated. Deadshot, and Harley take the Lackey's while El Diablo, Uses his fire powers to take the beast head on. Meanwhile Killer Croc, an amphibian is making his way to a crucial spot where a bomb can be planted in order to neutralize said enemy. Like I said, very interesting to watch. In the end, Suicide Squad is great because it proves that WB can learn. They scrambled to give us what we wanted after the critical failure of BvS. Not everyone will like it, but for anyone who's just looking for a good time, Suicide Squad is a blast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading many reviews I was kinda skeptical about this movie. But after watching it tonight . I am very happy with the results. The plot could have been a little better but the characters were amazing. I think part two will be great. Really good as a comic book fan. Even comparable to civil war. Not better but comparable. I hope DC improves the rest of their movies cause the direction they are headed seems to be great. I don't want to give any spoilers away but the villain could've been better. If you seen any DC animated movies you may recognize some influences from the cartoon attack on Arkham. To me these were positive influences. Also be sure to be tuned for an amazing mid credits scene. You will want to be sure to stay for that.</fullReview>

It's cool, it's action- packed, it has a great soundtrack, brilliant cast, and a great understanding of the characters. Margot Robbie is a perfect Harley Quinn, Will Smith is top notch, and Jared Leto is a really, really good Mr J. Parts were a bit more touching than I expected, and I think these were really effective. The humour is good as well, though if you watched all the trailers the laughs were a bit dampened (definitely not film-ruining though, there are some good gags left to see!) There were some nice cameos which worked really well, and wait through a bit of the credits! Ignore the critics! I am one of a seemingly small number of people that liked BvS, but whilst I acknowledge that films issues and can understand the poor reviews, I'm genuinely baffled by the critics' reception to this film.</fullReview>

Then a lot of complaints about holes in story, but if you pay attention there are no holes what so ever and it flows evenly and awesome.

		<fullReview>A very good movie that does explore the characters in some detail. The only gripe I had was the amount of screen time Will Smith has. Although he is great as Deadshot, they should have kept the jokers scenes in and cut a few of his. Leto will be an awesome joker in the future and I'm hoping will make an appearance in the solo Batman movie! Worth a watch for not only us DC fans but everyone! Not sure the film should have been a 15 rating though. Although I agree on an R rating for something like Suicide Squad, the amount of gore and violence etc. Didn't really warrant it! The minor cameos in the movie shows that DC is building a good universe for its upcoming movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go see this movie!!!!! I just got back from the IMAX viewing in 3D and have to say that Suicide Squad is so much better than expected!!! The action was fantastic, much more so than you would think a PG-13 film would be. The actors hit their portrayals of the characters almost perfectly and the tie-in to the DC Universe did not feel forced or rushed. Jared Leto's Joker was more in tune with the comic than Heath Ledgers version, and he nailed the part -- for his limited screen time. Margot Robbie was the epitome of Harley Quinn and was flawless in her performance. I was even pleasantly surprised with Will Smith's performance, he actually showed up and brought his A-Game with him. It was easy to overlook that Deadshot was white in the comic as Smith personified the character excellently. It is obvious that David Ayer knew the source material and his target audience throughout the directorial process. No, this was not a perfect piece of cinematic history, but it was a great summer popcorn flick and is worth the price of admission. Yes, Ayer had to cram a whole lot of stuff in a two- hour movie. Honestly, it could have been 30 minutes longer and have been better (I don't usually say that about a movie)! So, if you want to see DC finally get a film right, this is the film to see.</fullReview>

This movie was amazing! I can't wait to see it again. The way the interaction between Jared Leto and Margot Robbie was pure chemistry like something I have never seen before. A movie that is made in such a unique fashion that it teeters on being the beginning of something solid and fresh among the recent over saturation of comic book movies trying to tie one to the other. In attempt to be something different, Director David Ayer succeeds where others have failed by using a beautiful blend of backstory and humor to push the present day story along toward an ending that will get audiences a taste of what a sequel may bring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never read reviews before watching a comic book related movie, because it always ruins the fun, I think film critics don't always understands the story or have no idea about it, and hardcore comic books fans can't seem to separate one thing from another. I'm glad I didn't read too much about this one. It's a FUN MOVIE. It has a lot of action, super fun "one-liners", a little bit of comedy on every character. Margot Robbie did a GREAT job as Harley Quinn. Everyone of them was convincing. You can sympathize with some, specially with Deadshot (Will Smith) and El Diablo (Jay Hernández). I don't get why people were expecting this super dark movie when the trailers were pretty clear that it was going to be a fun movie with this incompatible group of super villains (or anti-heroes). I even think they did a great job trying to cover up the big mess of a relationship that the Joker and Harley Quinn have. The one thing I was NOT expecting was the real "villain" of this story. But it's a great movie, with great effects and a great cast the clearly have good chemistry. Go see it on IMAX or 3D if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from a midnight screening of this film &amp; have to say it's probably the best 15 rated DC film I've seen since Deadpool 6 months earlier! If anything, this takes the crown! This being 1st, Deadpool 2nd &amp; Kick Ass 3rd!So the film is about 6 eccentrically epic villains who have been imprisoned for their crimes &amp; get a new lease on life to save the city from an evil spirit under the name of Enchantress! Each of them are gifted in combat with few having super powers! Unlike those 12 rated DC films which have 0 kick in them in terms of style or maturity, this is one of the few greats among Deadpool &amp; Kick Ass. These films actually have a kick of Adrenalin &amp; really shift gear &amp; well is the perfect intense tonic you need after watching that pre teened crap! Films like Kick Ass, Deadpool &amp; especially Suicide Squad ooze with style &amp; class!The music choice in this film was great as well &amp; made the film more epic as it went on! Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes to Paranoid by Black Sabbath! What more could you ask for!?The violence &amp; action sequences were epic too! Not exactly gory but that don't matter one bit! This film was bloody epic hands down! My favourite character from the film had to be the sexy babe honey bun Harley Quinn!! She was damn fit &amp; made the film! Margot Robbie!! Babe alert!! The Joker, Deadshot, Boomerang &amp; the others were also bad arse villains!I overall though this film was epic! Go &amp; see this film! It'll be criminal if you don't! Screw those critics from the frauded website Rotten Tomatoes! They're talking out their arse! I give this a 10/10! EPIC!!</fullReview>

I have a feeling that he was like a drug addicted mafia guy. The only disappointment was the Batman. He was only about 2 minutes in the movie, all do the short time he was in he was very good and helped move the timeline.

		<shortDescription>A forgetful super hero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and others star in Suicide Squad, the latest movie by writer/director David Ayer. The movie has us follow a group of bad guys who are forced to work together and defeat other evil incarnations. It is however not in their nature to team up, but they are forced to with a remote controlled explosive device that is planted into their neck, if they do not follow their orders the device is activated and they die. Not obeying their leader would be equal to committing suicide, hence the name Suicide Squad.In the first hour of the movie all the different characters are introduced. This does not work all that well however as it is very hard to become invested in a character when all you know about them is information that other characters say trough expositional dialogue. Not all characters get a proper introduction however as some are just shoved in there. One of the characters is only introduced with a simple line of dialogue for example. The introductions, though lengthy, really do not provide a lot of background and when the movie wants you to care about them more it throws in a simple flashback.The actors portraying the different characters overall did a great job. Sometimes the performances felt a bit off, but I got the impression that the movies director was more to blame for this. This is especially true for Jared Leto's character 'The Joker' who felt more like a simple thug with a mental disorder rather than the bad-ass mobster he should have been. The movies main villains felt a little bit overpowered (which forced them to not use their power to their full extent when fighting the Suicide Squad) but the action sequences between them and the Suicide Squad were all fairly well done. There are a few moments where slow motion is lazily used to create a bit more tension but never enough that it becomes a major problem. There isn't really an action scene so good that you'll remember it in a few years time though, but on the other hand there also isn't one so bad that'll accomplish the same either. In the end 'Suicide Squad' works fine as a brainless action movie and fans of the characters will certainly enjoy it to some extent. People who do not know the characters will probably enjoy it a lot less though as the movie never establishes a good connection between them and the viewer and for a movie that should be just about the Suicide Squad themselves this is a major flaw.My rating: 4/10</fullReview>

After watching it, I can see why there is so much buzz. The characters are properly introduced in depth at the beginning, so I get to know who they are and have a glimpse of how they have come to be. After the introduction, the plot is tight and engaging. It is very cool to watch all the villains doing a super job, blurring the lines between villains and heroes. The evil queen is visually stunning, especially at the end. "Suicide Squad" is a good blockbuster to pass time. It has the thrills and jokes to entertain. I enjoyed watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: I haven't read any of the comics, I just enjoy superhero (in this case - villain) movies. So I can't compare these characters to the original ones.Pros of this movie:1.The visual effects are amazing 2.The soundtrack is great 3.The movie is fun 4.The action sequences are great 5.I liked almost all of the characters (on the ones I didn't - scroll down) 6.Leto is a good Joker. He is different, but I really liked him. I'm glad he was only in the movie for a short while. It's all I needed - I can't wait to see him in future DC films! 7.Good female characters. Sure, Harley could've used a bit more practical clothing, but I honestly didn't feel like she was over sexualized. She's sexy and she knows it and uses it to get a reaction out of people. This movie gives us multiple badass female characters, each different from the other, so why not add someone like this Harley in the mix? Cons of this movie: 1.Slipknot. How did that actor agree to do this movie lmao 2.Enchantress. Boring and unbelievable. 3.The Villain. The usual villain we get in superhero movies. Almost bluefaced and kinda robotic + pretty boring. 4.The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times and some of the characters' reactions seem unrealistic 5.The ending's lameIn conclusion - more than anything the movie's fun. And it made me excited for what else DC has to offer. So I do recommend watching it, just don't expect to be mindblown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie for quite sometime now and I was expecting a bit more than just random jokes ( as DC was criticized to being too dark)and poor dialogues. Don't get me wrong it is still a good movie if you wanna see you some action with couple of explosions and good visual effects with no real expectations concerning the plot line nor the characters played. Lets start with the acting. Will smith as Deadshot was perfect. ( Although I think they should have built up the father and daughter relationship a bit more). Margot Robie played her part well. though Sometimes it was obvious she was forcing herself. Jared Leto, with all the stories about how much he devoted himself to his role he did't get enough time on the screen. We do not get a real glimpse at the real joker. Jai Courtney added some fun to the movie and portrayed captain boomerang perfectly against all expectations. The others actors were just as good and the characters were well introduced to the audience. What have to reproach to this movie is the plot line. There was no real story to stand on. The purpose behind all the whole world domination thing wasn't clear enough. I'm asking DC this small favor, stop investing on visual effects, trying to mix up everything in one single movie. Invest in plot lines, dialogues, the stories. Build something up. Build great stories that would leave the audience gaping, with a feeling of satisfaction and also wanting more. It feels like it's all about business now, adding up big names and too much ads when the real work should have been on the movie itself. Man I miss The Dark knight where there was no need for this much visual effects to cover up the lack of inspiration. I've even liked man of steel. But since B vs S, it feels like there is huge thing missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad, attack!!!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only seen Smallville's and Arrow's interpretations of the Suicide Squad previously, but apparently both weren't really accurate representations. I'd only known of Harley Quinn from Batman: The Animated Series (and Mia Sara in Birds of Prey), and hadn't really seen what the big deal was, so I had few expectations of what she 'should' be like in her first big screen live action interpretation. Clearly everyone has their own opinions, and obviously pleasing everyone would've been impossible, but Margot Robbie is the MVP, her nuanced portrayal of psychiatrist, Harleen Quinzel, turned Joker's accomplice, Harley Quinn, without a doubt the scene-stealer of this movie (if it wasn't already immediately apparent from the very first trailers). Out of many different versions of the character, the one we meet here (accompanied by 'You Don't Own Me') uses her gymnastic skills/bed sheets to make a harness and swing upside down inside her cell, which seems in character. Through brief flashbacks, we see glimpses of her as a psychiatrist, where she became infatuated with the Joker (despite, or perhaps *because* of, her seeing him for what he was), strapped to a gurney and being given harsh electroshock "treatment/therapy" by him, which explains her mental instability/how she's as much a victim as a perpetrator. Those whose opinions of Robbie's Harley depended solely on whether she retained the character's traditional strong New York/New Jersey accent and traditional harlequin costume need not fret, as the former is on full display (she bounces from harder to lighter, though not because she's incapable of holding down a Harley accent, as she clearly pulled it off in The Wolf of Wall Street, but rather to show her moments of clarity) and the latter is acknowledged/paid respect in a brief clip that I'm sure will launch a thousand GIFs. The character's look/attitude is a little different, but that's to be expected when animation is adapted to live action. People needn't get so hung up on such things, as her character shouldn't be *defined* by these traits, and she DOES "have agency" (*choosing* to fall into the vat of chemicals, rather than being pushed), which should alleviate some fans' fears. Robbie knocks it out of the park, ensuring Harley's much more than "just a whole lot of pretty and a whole lot of crazy". For evidence of her perfectly suitable/twisted chemistry with Jared Leto's Joker, look no further than the scene of them riding in the "Jokermobile" together, where she calls him "puddin'"/"Mr J" and Batman "batsy/bats" (Batfleck's featured at the beginning, subduing both Harley and Will Smith's Deadshot, and mid-psychedelic end credits scene with Viola Davis' Waller). I'm unfamiliar with Leto as an actor, having never seen him in anything else, and some might be disappointed with his amount of screen time, but I think it's for the best that he didn't overshadow the movie. He's used sparingly, but just enough/when the occasion calls for it. The Joker/Harley "relationship" remains intact, and what's shown of it leaves us wanting more. Smith is basically playing himself, though his character has some "human" moments with his daughter, and his best dynamics are with Harley and Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag (himself having a relationship with Cara Delevingne's June Moone, who is taken over by an entity, the Enchantress, giving her a scary-as-hell makeover). They play well off each other, and you can tell that most of the characters, against their better judgement, have a soft spot for Harley (who can blame them?). Flag's relationship with Moone is engineered by Waller, who it becomes quite clear early on is a manipulative, cold-hearted bitch (who's more of a witch than Delevingne's ACTUAL witch character is) and, in case you missed it, is NOT to be trifled with (which the movie keeps hammering home). There's no "good guys" in this film, as evidenced by the way she treats/manipulates/kills people. Other characters are surprisingly decent (El Diablo's not only the most powerful member of the Squad, but also one of the films "heroes" at the end...although they ALL pitch in), the voice of reason/most "normal" (Kinnaman's Flag, who thankfully isn't *too* much of a stick-in-the-mud), entertaining/amusing (Jai Courtney perfectly fits the role of Captain Boomerang, the bogan with a pink unicorn fetish, who'll sneakily drink a beer mid-fight), provide arse-kicking sword action/muscle (Katana/Killer Croc), provide the film's "Big Bad" (Delevingne's effective with the creepiness, and I felt sympathy for her regarding how she and Flag were used by Waller) and are cannon fodder (Slipknot may as well have been called "Dead Meat", given how predictably doomed he was). The movie isn't the "mess" some are making out. It begins seeming more like a series of music videos than anything, with different songs playing as characters are introduced/helpful character attributes displayed on screen, but once the Squad's formed/unleashed upon the enemy, things come together. As we're constantly reminded, they're the BAD GUYS, so things are quite different to what you're probably used to (though at least they have an excuse for being a-holes, unlike certain so-called "good guys/heroes" in other comic book movies). Things might seem slightly confusing on occasion, but it's actually a pretty basic premise. Ayer's directing and co-written script endeavor to keep things from ever getting "boring", which they succeed at achieving more often than not. The overall feeling I got from the movie was a sense of "fun" (so those complaining about BvS's "seriousness" have no one to blame but themselves). There'll be those who'll let the negative reviews sway them, those jumping on the DC hate bandwagon/going into this movie already hating it, those who deem these interpretations of the characters as "not right"/how they think the characters should be...but those looking for a fun time with entertaining characters, and the added bonus of a great soundtrack, should be satisfied. Here's hoping that, despite all the Negative Nellies' criticizing, we still get the "Untitled Harley Quinn Project" that was announced, as Robbie's Suicide Blonde certainly deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Start But It Falls Apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of the biggest DC fans out there and if there is anyone who wanted this movie to be great that person would be me. Unfortunately Suicide Squad doesn't really succeed the way me and many others had hoped. To put Suicide Squads problems in a nut shell the movie had a massive lack of story structure but this didn't occur until around 30 minutes into the movie I felt the introductions to the characters were very jumbled some characters had their backstory told at the start some in the middle some even near the end.This movie had all the building blocks of success but the middle and the end don't cut it. It is basically a few scenes jumbled and bled together to make on big fight scene. I'm really sad that DC still hasn't turned around their spell of average releases. We need an amazing movie again DC soon your making us DC fans look bad. Someone get Christopher Nolan on the phone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good kind of disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I seen the movie, in an early premier at my local theater. Such excitement I thought the movie would bring. I sat down with a large popcorn and soda. My two favorite DC villains were there, Joker and Harley Quinn. But when the movie started... Oh it was a disaster. A good kind of disaster of course. First of all the prince of madness, the clown himself the brand new joker. Is a new kind of joker. Jared Leto. Is a perfect candidate to play the mad driven trickster. Astonishing performance all around. For the other cast mates astonishing performance through and through as well. Now for the movie, the movie was a disaster, I feel as if the Film wanted to have a little compromise between the marvel's light and yet action packed thriller with laughs all around. That's what I thought, It's a dark sinister film, but I feel as if they were trying to make a little more "marvel" tone to the aspect of this film. But overall if you want to see a villain movie where the villains do good things for an early prison release so in turn they can do more bad things when they release. It's a good movie. It is definitely worth the watch and buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Crazy, and I LOVED it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What had I just watched? One of the craziest comic book movie ever, yes. I most certainly did. This movie totally made sense including the humor part. Marvel movies doesn't make sense on that very part. Everyone's fighting, people are dying, and Marvel hero fights villains while cracking jokes. Totally not cool. Here, in Suicide Squad, we got a bunch of bad guys who don't give a *beep* about what happens to people or anyone, fights the villain cracking jokes, just like Avengers, but it is cool, because they're bad guys and that's what they do. What's so crazy and cool about this movie is that it made me (probably all audience) cheer for the bad guys, for doing bad things, and sometimes good things, too. I totally loved that experience, and for that alone I forgive all the flaws the movie had.I particularly loved Harley Quinn and Deadshot.Don't miss it, for you'll be missing an absolutely crazy experience, which you will love if you watch it with open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So far, one of this year's worst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ugh. What a waste. It's baffling how the marketing of this film, especially the trailers sold me on how fun and exciting this movie looked. Whoever cut those trailers absolutely deserves an Academy Award. To make this garbage of a film look any good must have been quite a feat. Lets get straight to it, the whole film is about a team that unwillingly comes together by the shady side of the government in a really long and drawn out series of flashbacks and origin hoopla that has you so bored that you end up wondering what the movie is about. Oh yeah and there's this lame witch villain, Enchantress that is handled so very poorly.On top of it, there's an unnecessary Joker &amp; Harley Quinn romance stuff going on, which weirdly doesn't end up involving anyone else. It's like a strange side story that happens while the main story is going on. It's giant narrative mess. It's very choppy, very muddled, and doesn't do a good job explaining anything within the middle of the action. There's no sense of danger and the film shoehorns in forced humor, therefore making tonal inconsistencies that took me out of the film every so often. It's very clear that WB banked on Will Smith's star power, and the popularity of Harley Quinn. Aside from those two and maybe El Diablo, Rick Flagg and Amanda Waller, no one else has anything to do. More time could have been developed for other members of the squad, but they're just in the background. I got to sympathize with Deadshot the most, but I wasn't really captivated because it was exactly the role I expected him to play. Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and the others do the best with what they're given, but ultimately decent acting from some of the cast members won't change the fact that it's a terrible disjointed film. Clara Delevingne's Enchantress was a monumental waste of a villain. The script just uses her as that tried trope of a world ending threat that we've seen so many times. The film does nothing new with it, nor does it try to do it well, even if it is a familiar trope. Her acting was just so atrocious and laughable. As stated above, Jared Leto's Joker doesn't have much to do. His arc of the film with Harley has nothing to do with the main story so it's just a distraction. I had no problem with his portrayal, but the film really did not need him at all. For me David Ayer is a hit or miss. While I have enjoyed a few of his previous works, especially End of Watch, he failed to deliver with this film. It's lazily written, with terrible dialog, the story is incredibly choppy, and even the action sequences disappoint. Don't even get me started on the finale. It's half-assed and so anti-climactic. There was no sense of danger or any tension. Ayer once mentioned how we will see the squad bond with their hatred of Batman, and that we will get the villain's perspective on Batman, but aside from Deadshot, that wasn't really explored at all. Also those eyeball creatures, they were lame. I mean visually was that really the best the filmmakers could come up with? I don't want to make comparisons, but this film made me realize and appreciate what Guardians of the Galaxy accomplished. Taking a bunch of C/D-list characters that aren't the best people in the world, and making something out of them. I don't want to start a fanboy war, but it amazes me that Marvel Studios who have been at such disadvantage since the start, pull off what they did. Making films that are at the very least entertaining is quite impressive, compared to WB/DC that have had the film rights to these properties for such a long time. I don't mind that they're playing catch up but there's a way to do them well. It is very discouraging as a comic-book fan in general, but I'm still hoping that DC's future will take into shape. I've made it clear that I am not a DC hater. I've stated numerous times I loved Man of Steel. I saw it five times in theaters and could not anticipate DC's future, but so far I was disappointed by Batman v Superman, now today, I am massively letdown by Suicide Squad. I'm hoping Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman will change my tune and that Snyder will deliver with Justice League. At the end of the day it's all subjective. If you enjoyed this movie, more power to you, my review doesn't make me the end all be all. But, aside from some okay performances, a very tiny Batman role, and a cool surprise appearance from another DC hero, you should save your money. Just go see a decent summer film like Star Trek Beyond or Lights Out. Or just go watch Captain America: Civil War and Deadpool, comic-book films done extremely right. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not At All What The Critics Claim!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**********This review may contain spoilers******************Director ? David Ayer Soundtrack/Score ? Steven Price Executive Producer ? Zack Snyder Cinematography ? Roman VyasanovThis movie was so close to getting a 10/10 but, the egregious portrayal of the joker hold it off back which I will expand later. Contemporarily, the critics have been hammering on this movie chiefly to the fact that Ayer's 'Flashback-Present' way of narrating is a little obfuscating for which isn't as a matter of fact. On the grounds that, this new way actually is convenient to this movie as it flows with it. The Flashback's are introduced at ideal and exquisite times. As it expands and explicates the movie at the same time.This Movie was well-nighly perfect. But the Joker's portrayal {Not Performance} was awful. It was the one 'Not adopted from the Comic Books'. This persona of the Joker played by Jared Leto brings 'superfluous' menace and craziness to his character. He's too concerned bout' his girl rather than threats like..Batman which is contradictory to the comics and the joker, played by Heath Ledger where he is some real enigmatic physcopath who is always one step ahead. I expected a Heath Ledger with more Menace and Action.All characters of the movie where perfectly played. When the Task Force X enters and moves throughout the city it plays as a silent thing which actually plays out like a horror film. Also during the interaction of the squad with the Enchantress at the end, the flashbacks were intense. Every character gets to show-off at at least one point of a time The score was good nothing beast like Hans Zimmer. The action scenes were also cool. I would recommend this movie 'Despite What The Critics Claim!!'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not that bad... But is not good either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I hear "Suicide Squad" the first thing that comes to my mind is "sick and dark humor with a lot of violence" but the movie is not really like that. I'm saying that just because I did no like the jokes or that there is not enough violence in the movie that makes this movie in something bad, no. Actually, the humor is on point (yes, there are bad jokes and out of context too) the history behind some characters is good (others... well, I hope there is a sequel for them), but this movie needed something to turn in the awesome movie about villains that they told us this was going to be. I'm really disappointed about that, but I can't tell this was an awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre super-villain team-up film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DC Films adds to the extended comic universe with supervillains, in this shallow action film stuffed full of characters but short on plot. The movie isn't as terrible as the pro critics made it out to be, it's just nothing special that the hype at first made it out to be. It rests somewhere in the middle of superhero films, not joining Deadpool in the subversive revelry, but not as serious a Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to make it dull and long. It moves along quickly but this doesn't allow viewers to know any of the characters and hardly lets these meta- humans show off their powers. Will Smith carries the film bringing the brightest star power as Deadshot. Margot Robbie is right behind him laughing and spouting off with a strange New Yorker accent that came off kind of weird. Harley Quinn will be one to watch but her relationship with the Joker (Jared Leto) didn't show much chemistry. The rest of the team is regulated for the background, but Viola Davis takes on the lead role as no-nonsense Amanda Waller, though she doesn't make that much of an impression as she could have. The film jumps from scene to scene pushing a villain that looks like an outtake from Gods of Egypt and Cara Delevingne as the archaeologist June Moon possessed by the Enchantress, who starts off looking cool as a horror movie monster but gets washed over with shoddy special effects.The rest of the team leave something to look forward to if they make a sequel like Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). Slipknot (Adam Beach) is hardly worth mentioning as a disposable character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) does have some shining moment, but it's short lived. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is the loyal soldier, but his romantic involvement with Moon falls flat as the attempt of emotion in this story.

		<shortDescription>Stale Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first teaser-trailer and promo images for this movie, I was largely unimpressed. As the marketing campaign unfolded, though, Suicide Squad managed to create some serious hype that I found myself unable not to join. The result, however, is mixed, for the trailers advertise another, better, funkier and more audacious kind of movie.Story-wise, things are very simple and bland here - first we get around half an hour worth of character introduction (understandable, since there are so many of them), which goes at a rapid pace and with lots of different licensed background music, almost like an advertisement or a music video. Then, with everyone onboard, the Squad arrives to some city devastated by a colorful CG Aztec-looking big dude. What happens next is some of the more disappointingly stale stuff: instead of an explosive chemistry and wit-filled spectacle we get some uninventive action scenes involving shooting and beating lots of mindless drones (a-la Avengers 1&amp;2), the supposedly "bad to the bone" protagonists implausibly bonding and becoming friends (they say that they're friends now, like, 5 times) and overcoming a lame bland CG-villain (who, despite all his powers and menacing looks goes down from a regular medium-sized bomb, yeah).Now the simplistic plot could have been saved by character interactions, but that doesn't really happen here. I'll just go ahead and list all the members with brief descriptions:Deadshot - Will Smith playing Will Smith. Nothing new, but it turns out I still like that guy.Harley - Margot Robbie is pretty and has a fine butt, but all the quirks and grimaces and the overall childlike demeanor at times feels out of place.Joker - This is a definite miss for me. Leto is overacting hard and is bringing nothing new to the table - he is just a mob boss who has a tendency towards ridiculousness.El Diablo - Surprisingly robust. The drama in his backstory didn't work for me, but overall he is fairly charismatic.Boomerang - Jai Courtney does not annoy the hell out of me in this movie, so that's some progress. Other than that, his presence is minimal and he mostly serves as a semi-successful comedic relief.Enchantress - From what I gather, Cara Delevigne is only somewhat famous because of her wealthy parents. Let's just say I wish this was not the case.Rick Flag and Amanda Waller - they play their respective parts well. Can't really add much.Killer Croc - He's alright, but I've got a feeling that nothing would've changed if he was not in this movie altogether.Katana - Read the paragraph above.Slipknot - Who?So, some of the chemistry between characters works, some of it doesn't. All of the drama in this movie is unconvincing and redundant. The Justice League cameos are pretty cool. The heavily-promoted soundtrack is underused, with the best songs just playing during the credits or muffled in the background (yeah, Purple Lamborghini).Overall I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's not a good one, either. It's just a tad bit above average, and it is sad, as this is yet another missed opportunity for the DCEU to get a solid hit on their hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me just say that the critics and the people that "hate" this movie are just people you cant please in life. There is absolutely no reason to hate anything about Suicide Squad. This movie was fun and very entertaining, which is what movies are suppose to be. I laugh when I see some of these reviews of normal people just going to the theater and analyzing every little flaw in the movie as if they are professional directors. There's no reason why this movie should have such a low critic score. If you want to watch this movie, go see it and judge for yourself. Don't let people to hate on most movies as their career to steer you away from watching this summer blockbuster. The characters are fantastic, especially Harley Quinn, Deadshot and the Joker. Seeing Batman in the movie made it that much better. I love comics and I love DC and i think director David Ayer did it justice. I personally hope we see more movies with Leto's Joker in it. He is one scary dude!</fullReview>

Dark, funny, action- packed, there isn't a lot more you could want from a Comic-book movie. They did a really good job portraying outlandish comic book villains like Captain Boomerang, someone who by all accounts should have been super lame, and making him into a very likable character. Jared Leto was excellent for the limited screen time he had, closer to Jack's Joker than Heaths. All in all, definitely not as bad as critics have made it sound. Worth a watch for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extremely excited to see this movie, maybe even more so than Batman v Superman. And it does not disappoint! It is quite dark and definitely not for a youngster but it is definitely what we want from a DC movie. It veers away from the norm but what do you expect from a Suicide Squad movie? Very different to the Marvel movies which tends to be a bit lighter. Suicide Squad has dark colors, dark characters and dark humour, which is what I feel DC is about, darkness. The story is a lot more linear than BvS but still achieves the suspense you want in a comic book movie. Margot Robbie is a perfect fit for Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is a different joker compared to Heath Ledgers but still amazing. I hope to see more of this joker and definitely want to see more of Harley Quinn! I feel Amanda Waller was portrayed very well, merciless and dangerous. The special effects were amazing and the fight scenes very well designed. The music is perfect for such a wacky and dark movie. The little Easter eggs in the movie were great and didn't feel as forced as BvS. The DC universe is really starting to come together and I am short of breathe from excitement!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I say this is the worst movie I've seen I don't mean it in the sense that 'The Room' is a terribly enjoyable movie with genuinely laughable (albeit unintentional) moments in it. This is a movie where it struggles between trying to be fun while taking itself seriously. It stumbles on all the wrong notes trying to piece together what slim portion of plot there is left wade through. I feel sorry for Will Smith, and some of the other actors as well. It wasn't exactly their fault that, although there were some cringe worthy acting. I wholeheartedly blame David Ayer, the Director and Screenwriter where he lacks both direction and any semblance of writing in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed his previous work in 'Fury' and I am only left to wonder where it all went wrong in Suicide Squad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are hoping for Leto's acting to pull-off Ledgers....then no need to watch it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had a chance to watch the early screening and I gotta say: This film is great! A very well written and good casting unlike BvS. I am glad to see DC make a big impact. I have always been an admirer of Marvel films, but DC have really impressed me with this film. Leto's Joker might not be the best joker out there, or maybe not better than Ledger's but the guy did astonishingly well! People might have a negative reaction towards his performance but it's only because Heath set the bar very high. After Heath, if anyone can perform Joker well, it has got to be Leto. So if you are in for Leto only then it's better you don't watch it. Talking about other performances, Margot Robbie tops the list with crazy and chaotic performance of Harley Quinn. That annoying voice of Harley's might not be there but her evilness and nuisance is surely there. Jai Courtney's portrayal of Boomerang is on spot! His performance will surely make you hate his character by the end of the film and that's how the producers want us to feel. And the fact that there is a bit of Batman in this makes it even more awesome! Of course there are some things bad about this film and that includes less on-screen time for Joker and an unnecessary addition of Slipknot. Verdict: Suicide Squad is a decidedly different flavor than Batman v Superman. It goes for subversive, funny and stylish, and it succeeds wildly during the first act. But then the movie turns into something predictable and unexciting. Captain Boomerang, Amanda Waller and Harley Quinn nail their roles, and Deadshot makes a fine cinematic debut. But it's not the best DC film out there however it surely is a bigger improvement than MOS and BvS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all those who prefer a dark tone in movies with some humor, this one would not disappoint. I still don't understand why so much hate from critics again. Are they trying to stop DC from making movies; if that's the case that ain't going to stop. I loved both MOS &amp; BVS, this one is also kick-ass. Packed with lots of action sequences and humor and cameos, its an absolute fun movie. Yes, it does have a different approach than BVS but both are great in their own ways. David Ayer as the director was so cool. Soundtrack and Score was awesome. Now speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is jaw dropping. She alone is the reason enough to watch this film. Will Smith is just fantastic. Jared Leto made another iconic Joker performance but he should've had more screen time. Leto's joker is good but not better than Heath's as set up a high bar in terms of performance. Amanda Waller was a mean scary agent and that's a good point as it was needed to bring the bad guys together.Batfleck is always fun to watch. The Flash cameo was cool too.Killer Croc, El Diablo, Rick Flag, Katana, Cap Boomerang; all were good. And Slipknot - why was he there even in the first place??? And as it goes for the critics, Rick Flag's got a few words "seriously, what the hell is wrong with you people?" - to which their answer is "we're the worse guys, we rate DC movies as BAD".... SERIOUSLY!Overall: the movie is good. Could've had more run time as its an hour less than BVS ultimate cut, and some more joker in it but its still a fun watch anyways. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

Although some characters are joking around (like they supposed to do) DC is still trying to keep that dark atmosphere from Bvs and MoS and it works great.

		<shortDescription>A Totally Honest Review: a few too many mistakes but otherwise hugely enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by stating that I hugely enjoyed this film. Sure, it's no cinematic masterpiece that will walk away with Best Picture come February, and there are some serious inconsistencies and let-down littered throughout the movie, but I want to set the record straight as I feel as though Suicide Squad has unjustly come under fire among critics. What I am about to write is my opinion and only that.From the first trailer I saw for this film I jumped on the hype train, which may have led some, myself included, to feel slightly underwhelmed while watching the final product. There were around 4 official trailers released, as well as shorter ones focusing on individual characters. This was a mistake as it gave away many of the movie's best bits, to the extent that when watching the movie it almost felt like an extended version of one of these many trailers. This leads into the next mistake: the trailers gave the impression that the main villain would be the Joker, which sadly was not the case. While I commend Warner Bros for not revealing the baddie before the movie's release, I do feel that the excessive presence of the Joker in the trailers was misleading, especially when the character only appeared in total for about 10-15 mins. Jared Leto's interpretation of one of cinema's most recognisable bad guys has also had mixed opinions. Personally I thought he was one of if not the highlight of the movie, bringing a charisma and prowess I feel was lacking in earlier interpretations. Nevertheless Leto's limited screen-time was a grave error on behalf of the editing team. Leto himself in an interview stated regretfully that many more scenes featuring him had been filmed, but were cut from the theatrical release. I can only hope Suicide Squad takes a leaf out of Batman vs. Superman's book and releases a DVD ultimate edition with these scenes included.I found, more frequently than should be forgiven, that the movie's editing affected ? and at times hindered ? the pace. For example the bar scene: it felt awkwardly placed, clearly someone was desperate to squeeze a bar scene in there somewhere and the result added little to the overall plot. The same can be said for Enchantress (Cara Delevigne) who's motivations throughout the movie were never made quite clear, besides the whole 'I wanna destroy the world because I can' attitude. If the film had taken more time to establish who Dr June Moone was and her relationship with Rick Flagg, maybe I would have cared about her character even a little. That being said, although being the main villain, Enchantress features relatively little too. Rather, the main conflict centres on the squad themselves and their ability to group together and put their differences aside. Here is where the film excelled for me. The chemistry between Smith and Robbie's Deadshot and Harley Quinn was excellent and fun to watch. These two, and possibly El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) carried the movie, rendering the rest of the cast to being their back-up dancers. Harley was by far the most intriguing, her backstory interlaced with that of the Joker in a relationship many fans were dying to see on screen, and were not disappointed. On a separate note the music was great! A perfect mix of original score and soundtrack that was well-suited to each scenario.From the comments I've given my rating of 7/10 may seem too generous (I'm looking at you Rotten Tomatoes), but thinking back to how I felt whilst watching I enjoyed Suicide Squad far more than many films released in the last year. It left me wanting to see more of these characters and wanting to watch it again, which can only be a good thing. So why so much hate? Perhaps some people think it's cool to hate on summer blockbusters, perhaps some thought this film was too violent (yet I don't recall seeing any blood?) and that is their opinion. Let other people decide their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of only 2 movies you should watch this Summer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you only see 2 movies this summer, it better damn well be Central Intelligence and the Suicide Squad. Both movies hands down are funny, intelligent, mind- twisting and explosive. If the point of a movie is to be entertaining - these movies nailed it and you walk away smiling!As for the Squad itself? I was completely enthralled with everything: the acting, the camaraderie, the music, the special effects and the costumes. Everything the Avengers had in their first movie, but lost somewhere along the line. The Suicide Squad returned to humor and wit; which is why we all read comic books in the first place. If you want drama, go read a 300 page Dickens. If you want perfection, go listen to Mozart. But if you want fun, humor, pizazz, action and heart - the Suicide Squad always had it. Excellent choices for cast and crew - Thank you!For the Music? WOW, I don't think I have heard a better sound score and honestly, I thought I would pick and choose thru the explicit pieces, but I could not. Each one was perfect for each scene and darn it, I am going to have to download the entire soundtrack. LolololGo See This Movie!People rate things too hard. Comic book material should never be evaluated like Gone with the Wind, so critics blow it out your.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short this movie is a great mix of Comedy, Story and Action. Way better then almost every related release in the past i'd say 5 years. These 3 characters really take the movie to the next level. Will Smiths character Deadshot is played off really well and his relationship with the entire squad is pretty fun to watch but watching his interactions with Margot Robbie aka Harley Quinn are some of the best moments in the movie. Margot Robbie's character Harley Quinn must be if not the best the second best character within the show her and Will Smith play their roles excellently and their interactions with each other and the other members of the squad are fun to watch. One of the best parts of Harley Quinn in the movie is that she doesn't just full on drop her relationship with The Joker to be come the Bad Guy-Hero. Also seeing how Jared Leto aka The Joker twisted Harley Quinn in to his puppet was something nice to see on screen. Jay Hernandez aka Diablo.. Man this character is amazing and really brings the squad together in end. Without spoiling anything i just got to say this character along with Will Smith and Margot Robbie are the 3 characters that take this movie from a 6 and bring it to a 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, must watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've now watched this movie twice and can say that i really enjoyed the movie. I read a good amount of the dc series but never really dabbled in to suicide squad, so i went in to the movie not know much other then the squad them self and Amanda Waller. i was very satisfied with Jared Leto's joker, i do think heath ledger has title for best joker as of now, but Jared Leto is the closest to the comic book joker we've had so far. The comedy in the movie was well spread out, action frequent and thrilling, and overall well balanced. my only gripe is very small, and that would be killer croc, he did almost nothing special in the movie, gave no laughs, and was scrawny for what he is supposed to be, but i can live with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated movie that takes risks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so surprised by this movie. A film that hated but also loved, I didn't know what to expect. But it all worked for me. The relationship between Harley Quinn and Joker really worked and all the performances were really really good. Of corse some characters were useless but that's just what happens when you're taking risks like these. The music also was great and fitting to the scenes. This movie isn't perfect by any means but the way it all played out in the end just worked for me and I even would want to watch a second one. Very sad that Tom Hardy wasn't in here but... you can't get everything I guess. So, I for one want to see the deleted scenes so bad which makes me excited for a Blu-ray release.I really need to see a Harley/Joker movie though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! The action and plot was great! I heard some bad reviews about it but because I am a DC nation fan I had to see for myself! I loved the characters! I mostly loved watching scenes with Harley and the joker! they really put me in my feelings! Not to mention the soundtrack is great and really upbeat. I recommended you watch this movie and don't listen to the negative reviews! The only thing I would want was more joker and Harley scenes but I heard a new movie might be made about them! I also recommend that you think about this movie as separate from the comics. Of course it stays true to the comics but some aspect involving the characters are different. However, everything was great! I wish it was a longer movie and I'm literally going to see this movie again! Worth watching about ten times</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why So Serious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't seem to quite get the hate that is going on for the DC films this summer. First Dawn of Justice and now this. Both have been slammed by critics and fans alike. In fact I found both of them pretty good. Although Suicide Squad is very different from Dawn of Justice in terms of its approach to the Justice League build up. The problem with Suicide Squad is the time and screenspace. With so many characters and so little time the movie starts off as if from the middle. The characters are introduced in a hurry and they are sent on a mission unprepared (just like the script). The concept of 'preparing for the war' is used as a reason yet again as it was in Dawn of Justice. There isn't much to say anything about the story as it is very little. It is better to go on about each and every characters which makes more sense.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller: Has a powerful role. But mostly unclear about what her purpose is. Many questions remain on her actions by the end of this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn: Undoubtedly the showstealer but most of you would know it anyway. But lack of clarity at times makes her role a bit confusing. Joel Kinnaman as Colonel Rick Flag: Apt and brilliant. Cara Delevingne: An important role as Enchantress for this young model, although she gives her best the role is not so well written. Jai Courntey and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Booomerang and Killer Croc respectively: Mainly cast to up the humor part and they do well. Jay Hernandez as Diablo: Surprisingly good. One of the best characters of the movie, hardly has any line but makes maximum impact. Scott Eastwood as Lieutenant GQ Edwards: Wasted as a sidekick to colonel Rick Flag. Unable to see much of his acting abilities. Jared Leto as The Joker: Amazing. Unfortunately we hardly see much of him in this part. Hoping to see more in the Batman or next Suicide Squad. and last but not the least Will Smith as Deadshot: Will Smith gets everything right from Humor to making sense in this chaotic of a film. I was worried that he might get lost in the flurry of other characters, but the script has given him much importance and he does fit in well.I haven't read any comic books so I am not sure if this will disappoint comic book fans but this Suicide Squad is definitely a different DC movie in the recent years. Subtle is the last world you should be looking for if you want to say something about this movie. Watch Suicide Squad for all the fun and antics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My third favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin. This movie is definitely worth the ticket price I'll tell you that. I really didn't expect much from this movie. Why? Because every movie I've seen this year has almost every movie I've seen this year have been forgettable. I've seen them with my friends, and then the next day I would completely forget about it. That's exactly what I thought this movie was gonna be like. Was I wrong? Insanely wrong. This is my third favorite movie of all time. And I don't go around saying that to every movie. With pulp fiction as my first, and a clockwork orange as my second, you can see I'm a kid with very select tastes. This easily made my top 3. How? Because this is the best movie I've seen within the past few years. How did it get there? I'll say it in 3 points. 1. This had the best soundtrack in a movie... EVER... They did the perfect blend of new, old, pump up, slow, rock, pop, and rap songs like no other movie has done before. I added more than half of these songs to my basketball playlist. 2. Margot Robbie stole the show... Ever since I saw her in wolf of Wall Street, I knew she was going somewhere. Her perfect mix of sexiness, and commitment to the roll made her completely steel the show. 3. Jarod Leto is the best on film joker... I know that I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this but to me, he is the best joker ever. He struck me as a new, hip, clean cut, well groomed, rich, gangster joker that the comics knew. I highly recommend this movie. It's amazing. Please go see it, for it gets my 10/10. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited approximately 8 months from last December to this day , I saw the movie. The first 20 minutes I thought " this is going to be great," but the following 102 minutes I felt lost , I felt embarrassed to see many scenes, and finally I was deeply disappointed .No depth , no plot, no logic or history . A partial waste of time and money. Jared Leto, the joker, he most wanted character only appears three times, yes, three miserable times. Half of the film I did not understand what was going on because there was no logic in nothing, and the final battle with the witch (I don't know where she comes from, where he gets his power) was so illogical, so stupid, and so "wtf". Totally disappointing. I would not pay to see it again and I will not pay to see the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie. Not perfect, but fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad was an okay movie. It's wasn't good, nor was it great, but it was okay. Just okay. It was enjoyable and the action scenes were highly entertaining to watch; however, it was in no way perfect.Yes, it was nice to see characters like Harley Quinn and Deadshot on screen (along with the others), but just because it was nice to see those characters, doesn't mean this movie is getting a 10/10 star rating any time soon. The overall structure of the story made it seem very much like the writers were trying to stick square pegs into circular holes, after those holes were previously carved.To put it simply, since BvS wasn't too loved by the critics (though, that's not to say it wasn't loved by the fans) and a lot of people (but not all) thought it was very 'dark' and 'gritty', they had to re-shoot a lot of scenes for Suicide Squad to satisfy those people who didn't like just how dark and gritty their last movie was, which I'm inclined to believe is the reason why there are random scenes scattered throughout the movie that make almost no logical sense whatsoever, when it comes to concerning the plot.And a lot of those random scenes were flashbacks, which was the film's way of trying to get the audience to know the characters. On some level, it succeeded. But there were way too many characters in the movie to successfully show to the audience in just a little over two hours.Everyone's backstory was basically only around five to ten minutes long, and they were all crammed into this film. (I did enjoy some of them, though!)Again, I get that the writers needed to introduce the characters before moving along with the plot, but the way they did it just added to this movie's already convoluted structure.Now, obviously this film had its faults. And let's face it: what film doesn't? But that didn't make it an awful movie. It was okay. It was entertaining. It certainly wasn't terrible. And I doubt I would have any regrets about watching it again. The action scenes were fun, and it was great to see characters that haven't been in the DCEU yet...actually be in the DCEU.It was a pretty fun movie, and I enjoyed it. A little messy, but it was entertaining to watch. (Note: I tried not to spoil the film too much, just in case those who are reading this have not watched it, but there is a spoiler warning, as a precaution.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not At All as Bad as The Initial Reviews--Good But Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the initial reviews of this movie being horrible, I decided I'd take it in at a matinée simply because it's a comic book movie and watching it would keep me up to speed with the DC Cinematic Universe. I'm glad I did. This movie isn't at all as bad as the first reviews suggested.Granted, one disclaimer to that statement would be that this isn't a terrible movie for the genre of movie it finds itself in. This is a comic book fan's comic book movie. It's a movie that introduces over half a dozen characters to the silver screen, and a movie whose plot revolves around a somewhat stereotypical "good" guys vs. really powerful bad guy type of story.Still, the movie tells its story well for the most part, and the overall production isn't terrible. The characters are likable enough, so much so that it has inspired me to want to look up the ones that I know the least about so as to learn more about their comic book versions. The acting was good on the whole (albeit Will Smith has the uncanny ability to always play Will Smith in any role that he's given), and the effects were tolerable overall, even if a bit underwhelming by today's standards.The biggest flaw I found in the movie is that some of the characters are given more robust introductions than others. Katana, in particular, shows up out of nowhere with little to no introduction outside of a flashback scene that doesn't really tell you much by way of introduction. The lopsidedness of the introductions felt a bit off to me--but I will say that the group seemed to allow for all of the characters to join in the fight scenes as the film progressed, so I suppose that helped to equal out that issue.All that said, I'm giving this movie 6/10 stars. That means that I find this to be a good movie overall, but one that just barely crosses the good/bad movie threshold. It's enjoyable enough, but not really a top notch film that you have to see before you up and die.One last note: It should be obvious enough if you know anything whatsoever about the film or its source material, but this film is violent and uses a lot of foul language--so much so that I'm surprised it got a PG-13 rating. In my opinion it's more rightly an R rated film, and so don't assume that just because this movie is based on a comic book that it's going to be family friendly. It's certainly not that at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's nothing special but not as bad as the critics say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many others had been anticipating this movie for a very long time. The trailers looked great, but unfortunately, it was deceiving. This movie didn't deliver my expectations but delivered something. The Pros: Humour: Unlike the previous DC movies (yes, including TDK trilogy) this movie offers a much lighter tone and humour, most of it worked, some didn't. But the fact the movie is lighter will make it more entertaining and fun for some. Harley: Harley Quinn was simply amazing, Margot Robbie did a fantastic job of portraying the character. She is sexy, insane, yet gave the innocent vibe Harley has. She is one of the reasons I liked the movie.Deadshot: I personally didn't expect much from Deadshot, but then again, it's Will Smith, a huge name. His character is charismatic, bad ass and delivers humour when it's needed. He was definitely the most humane out of the squad.El Diablo: El Diablo stole the show, his character arc was emotional and worked on well. What he does, (for those who watched Suicide Squad) is redeemable. The Joker: From the limited screen time Jared's Joker provided, he was still amazing. Though it is unfair to compare him to Ledger. Jared's take is different and has a mobster vibe to it. However, he is still creepy, twisted, insane and your left wanting more.The Cons: The villain: I don't want to spoil on who the villain is, but I'd say the villain is very disappointing. The villain is bland, boring, undeveloped, and to me, cringe worthy. DC is known to have very good villains, however, this time, it was horrendous. The story line: The story line is very generic, stop the bad guy from destroying the city. It's point A to point B. The story line isn't worked on and it is very rushed. The first arc is well is good, however, the second and third arc are sloppy and rushed. It wasn't enjoyable and seemed like a big mess. Overall I don't hate it, but I don't love it. It's not something special but it's not what the critics say it is though I wouldn't raise expectations. I'd give it a 6/10 or 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not DC's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was not horrible, but no masterpiece. Few moments in the movie really hooked me in. The parts that did hook me in did a good job. I thought act 1 was good. I liked the idea of learning the back stories to some of the major characters. Then from act 1 to the bar scene I found to be boring. The wandering through the city, and going against minions that stood no chance and were easily taken down . I liked the bar scene because of El Diablo's back story. The whole killing of his family made the scene more emotional. The final battle was OK. Wasn't too amazing, wasn't too bad. I found this movie to be very predictable. Some examples were Amanda Waller not dying, Harley not being shot by Deadshot, the joker to be still alive, enchantress to be the villain, and the squad to win. These are just some examples. Some pros to the movie were Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Deadshot by Will Smith, the Joker by Jared Leto (many will disagree) and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. The movie looked nice. Some more cons are unneeded characters (slipknot), scenes that had no real explaining on why they are happening, and the lack of other squad members. This movie is a hit or miss. Not the best work by DC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, cheesy, and predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start by saying I knew nothing about Suicide Squad until this movie and I still know nothing other than what I've seen from the movie. Okay, with that being said I enjoyed the movie and I may watch it 1-2 more times and perhaps buy it. It wasn't anything amazing but I didn't expect it to be. When you get into the movie it sets up everyone and their stories and I feel like this dragged on and was kinda boring, I personally only took and interest in Deadshot, Joker, and Harley's stories. The rest felt kinda unnecessary. Everyone had a love story literally everyone! I personally didn't like the cast for joker, He didn't fit the part in my opinion but he did okay for being an actor I've never heard of but I could name tons of actors I think could do much better than him. I didn't really like how they portrayed the Joker and Harley either. They literally made him an insane pimp and Harley was his only hoe. The Enchantress was a stupid enemy the entire time she seemed like she had the power to instantly kill everyone and everything. At the end they made her do a lot of weird waving around and made her look like an idiot. They fought her for like 10 minutes and then she was like... Oh yeah I have powers and disarmed everyone and said enough. So they wasted so much time with that. The comedy was very cheesy and I think if Will Smith wasn't in the movie it would of hardcore failed. I look forward to seeing a second and hopefully it is better than the first but if not, no big deal. They made it clearly obvious who was expendable in the movie so a lot of things were easy to predict. Overall I would rate this movie a 6 and say it was worth watching once. This was my first review so thanks for reading guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big budget fair movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ayer simply asked a group of professional actors dressed like Suicide Squad to walk along the streets. He degraded high potential materials to a pure cosplay show. The different plots in the film fail each other. If you got a bomb in your body, the plot to unite got no tension. Then, after relaxing in a bar, they unite. They are cool bad guys, they don't unite! They do bad things to portray their characters in comics instead of telling embarrassing jokes and cosplay. Torn between these are some helicopter crashes. Nothing major really happens for a mid-climax. You at least need a 15 minutes sequence of action instead of several 2 minutes action scenes like interruptions! The tension just lost. And Jared Leto's Joker is outstanding and unique. How come you hire talent like Jared Leto to portray such a complicated character but only gives him 10 minutes? Is it an audition ? Actually all actors perform well but the production team put them in a plot that got no chance to show off. For BvS, it clearly got a theme and direction to move on even it may not please the mass market. Suicide Squad is a messy talent deployment. It is clearly not an commercial action flick but also got no clear theme.The response of this movie is a final warning to Warner Brothers. I truly think that they should shut down all productions including Wonder Woman and sit down to rethink the whole strategy. No reason to rush in a wrong direction. Besides, do they recognize that the reverse approach from Marvel makes you losing audience who does not read comics ? Most film lovers in Asia only know Iron Man from RDJ. There were enough Superman and Batman movies in history providing enough background information. But other characters really need deeper portray to secure audience before pushing all super hero on stage in a united team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Product for our Viewing Pleasure, Succeeds at Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Batman v Superman, which I did like, the expectations for this movie went high. I thought, well BvS has its flaws and critics were kinda harsh, I think Warner and DC will save the great stuff for the summer and bring something new to the genre. Turns out, this movie only succeeds at entertaining because there's quite a lot of things that went wrong here.Directed by David Ayer, known from Fury, which I didn't like much but still think it's a good movie, the expectations were high and with so many new interesting things to give to the franchise, I was hoping this would be better than most super-heroes movies this year, if not the best. But things went wrong too soon.The writing was unbelievable at certain points. I'd like to leave here a line that the Enchatress said near the end of the movie that was so cringe worthy it took some time to sink in, let's just say it has something to deal with balls. The acting was some of the worst I've seen lately, even from someone like Will Smith who is still a great actor even though he has been in some bad movies lately. Not sure if the writing or the directing is to blame, but in the end that doesn't really matter. Although, I have to admit Jai Courtney did pull off a great Australian accent and kept his acting good, so did Viola Davis which I think had the best performance during the whole flick, and was one of the most interesting characters.Joker was great, I think it's new, it's different and I can't wait to see more of him in the movies ahead. Harley Quinn was OK. Sure Margot Robbie has the looks but her character was the most predictable and although the movie tries, it never brings a solid emotional connection. Deadshot and Harley had a pretty natural relationship since Smith and Robbie have already co-starred in a movie called "Focus" which I enjoyed very much. The squad is pretty unbalanced, I don't think someone really cared about Killer Croc, all he did was deliver a couple of lines and swim in the sewers, he's the most forgettable. Katana didn't get much attention, considering this character has a strong background, you end up not caring much about her though. The flames guy looked pretty bad-ass and his story was one of the best definitely. Boomerang was fine, he's responsible for getting Flash to make an appearance and that's all I can say. Deadshot didn't feel like the legit hit-man he is, that's probably because Will Smith can't make himself unlikable and we're to much used to see him portray the hero. Harley's best moments are in the trailers, and I've seen about two trailers, I didn't even know who the villain's villain was. Harley feels really, really out of place here. Everyone's caring guns and heavy suits and she's half naked with a baseball bat. I know her character is fearless but it doesn't feel right, you never get the feeling of danger when she's around 'cause you already know she's not going to die and cuts the intensity out of the fights. The Enchantress looked stunning and seemed threatening, but she was defeated in a pretty dumb way that makes you question what kind of powers did she really have. As I was watching the movie I felt like it was calling me dumb. There's no complexity in the story, and the songs they used were stuff everybody has already listened to, just to make it appealing. It's so simple it's frustrating, this movie needed more and even though a lot was rushed, more time wouldn't save from being what I was expecting.Production design is really great, it surely will become memorable in a few years. Visual effects were pretty great as expected from a movie with this much budget, I'm just really tired to see blue lightning shooting up into the sky in super hero movies. I could make a very respectable list of super hero movies that have a "blue lightning shooting through the sky" scene somewhere.This movie is a missed shot that may compromise what's expected from this franchise. It doesn't deserve what the most awful critics are saying about it, it's worth to watch and entertaining but not much else really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Female Perspective of what could have been a bromance movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so Im kidding with the title. Suicide Squad is far from being a movie where men come together and weep about how life has done them wrong but in some sense it was leaning that way a few times. Every single character had an Achilles heel. Some more more benign than others (Pink Unicorns anyone?) and it set up the movie in a way that I have to say did seem to be showcasing each character for a future movie. All except one. I hope he was well paid for his part. RIP. So to the meat and bones of this review. I want to focus on the females because thats where my interest lay. I wanted to see how the DC world would present strong female characters. I wasn't disappointed. I felt invested in each and every villain and that is coming from someone who is new to the DC universe. If the idea was to introduce viewers like me to characters that did not fill their childhood lore then they surely achieved success. Harli Quinn did more for girl power in this movie than every single song in the Spice Girls collection. She was bad ass. She kicked ass when she needed to (What was that bat made of!) and submitted to her twisted love affair with the Joker at just the right time. I loved her and can not wait to see her again. Katana's character had no flesh. Literally. It could just as well have inhabited the sword with her dead husband. Honestly I was hoping that someone would put an end to her sooner rather than later. Sorry she brought nothing to the story at all. Enchantress seemed to be channeling Queen of the Damned for this role. All that swaying of hips and arm juxtaposing felt very very familiar. Cara tried her best and was a wonderful June but her destroy the world because no one worships me anymore alter ego was just blah. Over all there was more than enough to enjoy and the missteps were just that. Missteps. This was an enjoyable movie that really did what all the hype claimed it would do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't a great film but it does a good job of fixing the things Batman vs Superman got wrong, namely bringing in a bit of humor. The film doesn't take itself too seriously but seriously enough that it nestles neatly into the franchise DC is building. It's well cast with both Margot Robbie and Viola Davis chewing the scenery with grand extravagance. Jared Leto, donning the Joker mantle this time around, does a fantastic job even though it is ultimately the outlandish appearance of the character that cheapens his performance greatly. The special effects are mostly excellent but there are a few points where it is clearly CGI (not really a bad thing). Perhaps the most glaring flaw is the villains central to the plot. The collection of squad members, save for Smith's Deadshot, seems to be a mish mash thrown together with no genuine thought. The antagonist is also vastly underdeveloped though still entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A one time watch which should/could have been a classic for the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crazy, fun, slick movie worth a watch. I got my moneys worth but have to say that I was a shade disappointed with the final outcome after the brilliant build up. Suicide Squad is one of those rare movies to have a lot of superlative acting performances and cgi effects to match them but lacked the punch from the creative department. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis and Jared Leto (for the handful of scenes he had in the movie) were all amazing. The villains, Cara Delevingne and her CGI army, were disappointing to say the least. The 'Enchantress' was meant to be menacing by ended up being a comic supplement to already fun packed movie. Mindlessness is part and parcel of movies that fall under this genre but even there there was a lot of scope to keep the audience guessing. It was as if the director wanted to show too many things but was strictly forbidden by Warner bros to wrap it up at around 2 hours screen time. My opinion : One time, fun watch which could have been a lot better had they kept up the good work from the first half of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another summer popcorn flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie, just like other reviewers on this forum. All in all, this was a very entertaining summer flick. I usually have a rule to stay away from movies with too many superhero/villain characters. I was a little intrigued by the Suicide Squad source material and with all of the Marvel/DC overload of superhero movies it breathes new life into the genre. This movie was neither good nor bad in my opinion. Just down right, gritty fun. The only complaint is the editing is a bit shoddy and a few characters are introduced without a background story, which gives away future events to come. Each character is likable in their own right. Harley Quinn and Deadshot are the most standout characters of the squad, brought to life by Margot Robbie and Will Smith. I usually dislike Will Smith performances, but he does a pretty good job with this character. Margot Robbie is a little over the top at times and as the movie progresses she develops a Brooklyn accent, which is kind of annoying. As for Jared Leto's take on the Joker, I am kind of on the fence about what to think about it. What can you do with the character that hasn't already been done? Gangster him out? This is what we get in this iteration of the character. Some scenes seem almost embarrassing to even think that Leto is an Oscar winner. But, some part of me wanted to see more of him on screen and I really can't explain why. The chemistry between Harley Quinn and the Joker are very genuine, which could quite possibly spawn a spin-off film. As for other Squad members, everyone did a great job with the characters. Two of my favorites of the Squad, other than Harley Quinn, were Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). As for the story line, it seemed a little rushed and thrown together. I was a little disappointed about that aspect of this movie. But, I went into this movie with an open mind and I wasn't expecting an Oscar contender. Summer movies are meant to entertain, not intellectually stimulate. Those movies come out in the Fall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I found this movie to be pretty good. Despite reviews from critics and fanboys who are expecting movies to be exactly like their dusty old comic books and totally demolishing this movie, I actually found it to be alright. Knowing nothing about the suicide squad going in and being somewhat disappointed by the last few DC movies (especially in the case of Batman vs. Superman) I overall thought the movie did a decent job of introducing dynamic characters. I thought Will Smith's character "Deadshot" was very well played as well as Margot Robbie's "Harley Quinn". On the flip side there was some very poor, forced, almost unbearable acting moments such as the character "Killer Croc" being almost like another dumb "The Thing" from the fantastic four. What I think was the worst miss of this movie was the main antagonist, this cheesy villain was a very poor choice for this movie as well as some of the CGI that was needed for it. I think in a different setting with a different villain this movie does a lot better. As your average super hero movie viewing critic who's going into the theater expecting such, I would say overall despite some misses I found this movie to be pretty enjoyable and would definitely not let some overly critical fanboys deter you from seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harley Qu...Suicide Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a new era that we have been fast approaching for some time, and now we are in full force of its presence, that era being every single comic book,video game,cartoon icon we can go in the past and think of is here, and ready for the big screen treatment. Obviously with the advancement of film technology, we will see everything come to life before our very eyes. It is a good time to be alive, I've seen Wolverine one of the most iconic, not to mention favorite for many years come to life through Hugh Jackman, I've seen my childhood toys come to life with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the 90's film not the new CGI Turtles, &amp; even the likes of G.I. Joe and Iron man, there is literally something for everyone. Superman being one of my favorite characters of all time I've had the pleasure to see him re-imagined in great form from Brandon Routh, but not being what casting directors/producers wanted, Henry Cavill has proved to be very good indeed. Everyone thought Ben Affleck cast as Batman was a poor choice, I disagree he has proved to be good as well, we'll truly see in Justice League. Now, enter the most eclectic group of "superheroes" the comics have ever produced,The Suicide Squad. Just setting this up was probably one of those feel good moments, from pre-production meetings with all cast and crew, you knew you could have something special here. The events of the story take place after Batman Vs. Superman so I would suggest watching it before you watch Suicide Squad. Now setting up the right cast for so many characters was probably very challenging, are they right for this iconic role, or not. Now from the start most people are seeing this for one character alone, Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) she had to be stoked at the opportunity to play one of the most iconic female characters ever, and she nailed it. She had the look, the voice, and the demented psycho killer badass valley girl character down to a T. The film is mainly driven with all its characters but set up and run by Viola Davis, she is a black ops C.I.A. Bad ass that works only to preserve the safety and security of the united states. She gathers together the rag tag group most of which are in prison for numerous crimes, Diablo(Jay Hernandez) who can control fire, and then there's the killer croc, a literal man/crocodile played by Adewale Agbeja, who looks the part for sure, make up artist deserves an award just for his make up alone. Now you enter DeadShot(Will Smith) who basically takes point for the group because they are leveraging him with his daughter, he needs this job to get done. Then you have your few Anti- Superheroes that help with the story slightly but are almost side notes, like Boomerang(Jai Courtney) who fights a little but is there mostly as comic relief, and Katana( Karen Fukuhara) who's personal vengeance is already there she killed the man that killed her husband and trapped his soul in her sword, I know you just have to go see it. So as you can see it's a cast of many characters some of which I didn't even list here, but I can't leave out The Enchantress(Cara Delevingne) her character was actually visually stunning, the CGI and make up work for her was superb, she is basically the whole reason for the film taking over the body of a human, she is an ancient God who is frustrated and wants to destroy humanity and releases her brother unto the world, thus setting up the need for the Suicide Squad. Written and directed by David Ayer, who's no stranger to writing with the likes of Training Day,Street Kings, and Fury staring Brad Pitt which I thought was a great film, overall I gave this film an 8/10, it's not a 7 and there are few things I would have changed to give it a 9, hell with a few good tweaks this film had the potential to be a 10, but I'll save that for the stand alone Harlequin film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jumbled mess with a good cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review as someone who very much enjoyed Batman Vs Superman. The Ultimate Edition was far superior to the theatrical version, and while both are flawed I did see what DC were going for and I find it a very entertaining movie. To be honest I thought Suicide Squad was a sure- fire success. The trailers and marketing has been excellent, the idea sounded original and it seemed like DC was going to learn from its mistakes. Unfortunately I could not have been more wrong, Suicide Squad is close to being a disaster on the same level of Fantastic Four, the only thing redeeming it from this level is the fact that the cast all seemed excellent and there were a couple of good scenes dotted in the movie somewhere.Let's get the good out of the way first. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Jai Courtney and Viola Davis are all excellent. I was concerned that it may end up being the Will Smith show, but he works well in an ensemble and he seems to be having a blast as Headshot. Margot Robbie is perfect as Harley Quinn, could not fault her performance (even if she has been sexualised quite a lot in this movie, this is a fault for nearly all the female characters). Jared Leto may not be present a lot and is not a patch on Heath Ledger, however he does something different with the role of the Joker. I did like his performance and would enjoy seeing him in a standalone Batman movie. Jai Courtney was a pleasant surprise and Viola Davis sells a role that could come across as one dimensional in lesser hands. The cast all work well together, seem to be having fun and have a couple of good group scenes that have been seen in the trailers.Now onto the bad. I am intrigued to find out what was going on behind the scenes, as it is very evident from an early stage that studio and director seem to be making two different movies. This is where I quite happily make the Fantastic Four comparison, there was interference with that movie and it clearly showed. While Suicide Squad is nowhere near as clear cut as the divide with that movie, you can see on one hand there is a dark movie being made and on the other a silly group movie more along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy. Both would work fine as a movie, but DC should have picked one and stuck with it. The editing is appalling, there appears to be multiple openings to the movie and introductions to the same character. Flashbacks spring up out of nowhere, some adding interesting backstory (such as The Joker and Harley's scenes) some just being downright pointless (Katana I am looking at you). The poor editing may have been forgivable with a decent story and villain, unfortunately this is where Suicide Squad falls flat on its face. The villain (The Enchantress) is downright terrible and spends the third act doing a weird sort of dance in front of a portal. Cara Delevingne may be a good actress, I wouldn't know as she has nothing to do in this movie and is terribly overdubbed in some scenes. In conclusion it gets 4 stars based on the charisma of the cast alone. I can't say I was bored as I was spending most of the time gazing at the car crash of the story. It really emphasises the fact that DC are panicking with their properties at the moment. Had this been the original movie that it set out to be I am sure it may have been fine. Unfortunately someone has stepped in somewhere and made changes in a blind panic. It shows and stinks of studio interference. It is worth watching obviously to make your mind up, some people seem to have loved it. I am glad they have, I wish I had certainly enjoyed it. But even those rampantly defending it must be aware of its glaring faults. I would be interested in a sequel, there is a good film to be made with this cast. But there has to be a solid story, even a solid cast cannot polish a turd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In an effort to create a viable DC franchise, Warner Brothers rushes what could of been an awesome movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trigger Warning(s): Violence Against Women (Without Discretion)Main StorylineThe story begins with a very good question: What would the world, though as always specifically America, do if a being like Superman came down and didn't side with man, but decided instead to annihilate it? Well, this is what Amanda Waller asks. This is the reason why she believes she should be allowed to use a host of different villains, all of which primarily have no real powers so they remain semi-useless, but they are bad guys. If they die, it's a win. If they live and somehow handle the task given, it's a win. All you gotta do is implant a bomb in them and send them off. After all, as much as they all are villains, seemingly fearless, everyone has a weakness and for them, it is one of the few loved ones they have which, despite knowing how cruel and evil they can be, love them despite of.HighlightsThere are really only three characters worth noting, in a positive manner. The first being Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. I highlight her performance because it is rare for a Black woman to be in a role like this. On top of her being the boss, she is a bad ass, a hard ass, and doesn't at all try to be likable. Her main objective is to be good, no, excel at her job by any means necessary. All of which Davis plays in such a good way. Granted, there isn't a movie or show in which she doesn't seem drained from dealing with people's BS and likely wanting to shoot people as Waller does, but getting to see her actually do it was something.Next up is Jared Leto's Joker. Now, unfortunately, we don't get Joker in full effect. He isn't the primary villain of the film so outside of his romance with Harley, if you want to call it that, he comes and goes rather frequently. With that said, in an ideal world, before this movie we might have seen him go against Ben Affleck's Batman. For while he does seem like a hipster Joker, and surely isn't as comical or interesting as Heath Ledger's take, he isn't as bad as many thought he would be.Leaving everyone's favorite: Harley Quinn. This character has deserved to be in a live action production for years. After all, when you think of female villains, in the DC or even Marvel universe, there aren't a whole lot with the profile Harley has. So with the way Robbie plays her, again you get a similar vibe like you get with Leto. You honestly wonder why this character wasn't allowed to be properly introduced? Why is she starting in a group movie where, yeah, director/ writer David Ayer knew to feature her, but couldn't just have her dominate, as perhaps she should have. I mean, I won't pretend that her one liners and being the group weirdo didn't get old, but with the flashbacks dealing with how she fell in love with Joker, alongside some of the scenes she had with the squad, it is hard to argue that Robbie may be one of the few who may full on benefit from this movie.Low PointsStorywise, and when it comes to The Enchantress, that is the downfall of the film. The story tries to give you just enough to know who every villain is, but it really isn't enough. For the actors who have charisma, or know how to play their characters, like Smith and Robbie, you are left wanting more. As for everyone else, you are left wondering: 1. Who are they, 2. Who is the hero to their villain, and 3. Can't they die to give Deadshot and Harley more screen time?To dive a bit deeper, Deadshot and Harley are given backstories. We are told how they fought and lost against the Batman, we get to learn why they are cool, and we are given enough to the point you honestly feel that you are watching snippets of a movie Warner Brothers didn't fully finance. With that though comes those two trying to keep you engaged while The Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne, is supposed to be your villain.Now, I have nothing against Delevingne, but the model turned actress reminds me a lot of Jessica Alba. Yes, she is pretty and likely fun to work with, probably knows all her lines when someone yells "Action!" but she is kind of dead on the screen. Granted, she is playing against Will Smith and Margot Robbie, but come on! The one thing DC has over Marvel is at least their villains, well the Batman ones anyway, are formidable, interesting, and well known. Why use this one? Much less, why have Delevingne play her?Though perhaps the real issue is that the whole argument for the Suicide Squad is that one day there might be a being, like The Enchantress, who decides to not side with man like Superman did but try to destroy the world. That is what the Enchantress tries to do and who do they send? People who know how to use weapons, with Deadshot having deadly accuracy, and one guy, Diablo, who is actually a meta-human and can do something. Everyone else is pretty much impractical in situations like this. Making it so when The Enchantress is defeated by them, especially considering how she is defeated, you begin to realize why so many critics, so fiercely, trashed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taken place after the events of Batman V Superman, Amanda Waller(Viola Davis) puts together a team of criminals with unique abilities in hopes to stop a big enemy, and they are Deadshot(Will Smith), Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie),El Diablo(Jay Hernandez), and Captain Boomerang(Jai Courtney) to name a few. But will they pull it off? I found this very entertaining, and I don't care what critics say. Suicide Squad was fun and never takes itself too seriously to a point. The cast really work well together, although the two who get more focused on are Deadshot and Harley Quinn, although EL Diablo does get some to do, but everybody else is just kind of there. Will Smith is just being Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie does give a fun insane sexy performance as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto does give quite a nightmarish performance has The Joker, he's good but does not top Heath Ledger, but that is a tough act to follow. Jay Hernandez is quite descent has El Diablo. Now Viola Davis is awesome has Amanda Waller, tough and ruthless, nobody you want to mess with. Jai Courtney is alright has Captain Boomerang. Action scenes are incredible, and effects are awesome.This is not a masterpiece, but it never tries to be, but a fun entertaining film, go in expecting nothing more or less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily One of the Best Movies of 2016... Harley Quinn is the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I have now seen this movie twice. I liked it THAT much. It is just a great, enjoyable, funny, awesome action/superhero movie. Why are critics so hateful against DC Comics movies? They're just fine! I have to admit though, Batman V Superman (2016) is not that good. I had to watch that movie twice as well. The first time I watched B v S, i hated it! The second time I thought, "Now that wasn't as bad as I remember." But Suicide Squad is the best movie I have seen all year. My only problem is that there wasn't enough time to give you the backstory on therein characters. The only person who had a REAL backstory, was Deadshot. Now the best character is most definitely Harley Quinn. Harley Quinn and The Joker were the absolute best characters in the whole movie. Harley Quinn was such a likable character. Everyone says "Harley Quinn was the best!" People say "Oh, Enchantress is the best." But they just like the actress, Cara Delevingne. I don't care what anyone says, this movie is awesome. The Joker is my personal favorite male character. People don't like him because he was a villain in previous Batman movies but he's still really cool. Okay, I'm gonna wrap this up, This movie a great action movie and it is probably the best movie I have seen so far this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Mess That Is Both Extraordinarily Fun And Entertaining DESPITE Itself..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In SQUAD We Trust! I've never seen a movie like this. Coming out of the cinema I didn't know what to think. It's both Incredible yet Inept, Amazing yet Awful, SPECTACULAR yet substandard.If I had to describe it in one sentence, I'd say: "It's a very flawed film that somehow still manages to be a tremendously entertaining ride from start to finish!"First off, I.LOVE.THESE.VILLAINS. The "Worst of the Worst." This might be the definition of character driven piece. Margot Robbie steals the show in what I consider her best performance yet as former Psychologist turned Psychopath Harleen "Harley Quinn" Quinzel. Fans of the comic's and the award winning cartoon B:TAS will rejoice as Robbie brings Quinn to life, perfectly capturing the comically quirky yet crazy essence that has made the character so popular for all this time. Will Smith SHINES As Floyd Lawton AKA Deadshot, an assassin who misses his daughter.. But NEVER misses a shot. Although Smith's acting doesn't stray far from his usual comfort zone, I will say that it's been a LONG time since I've seen him THIS charismatic and funny. Given great dialogue, Smith deliver's it effortlessly, finally flexing those comedic chops that have fallen rather flat throughout the years.Viola Davis IS Amanda Waller. Cold Blooded. Cruel. Calculating. This is 'The Wall'.Jay Hernandez is another stand out. Surprisingly, El Diablo was a substantial part of the film and added some much needed heart. I can't say more without delving into spoiler territory but let's just say he provides a 'fire' for the squad (pun intended). AND Finally, Jai Courtney!.. I can't believe I'm going to say this BUT... Courtney's HILARIOUS in this. His Captain Boomerang is a fun alcoholic who just isn't given enough screen time, in my opinion. I LOVED what I saw and I hope he makes further appearances in the DCU!Everybody else was "Okay". Killer Croc got some laughs in my screening but I found him rather bland and dull. Delevingne's Enchantress was entertaining in certain portions but overall was weak and forgettable. Makes you wonder why Ayers had her strip naked and run in the woods at night if this is the best they could do with the character. Slipknots very minor, Flag is boring, and Katana is criminally underused. Now, i'm sure everyone's wondering about Jared Leto's Joker. Unfortunately, he's given so little to do that you really don't know what to make him. AND THIS is where this film starts to fall apart. The Editing and Pacing is horrendous. The tone is all over the place. Ayers has said they had 6 different cuts before they settled on the final version and you can tell. It literally seems like 6 different movies "stitched" together in an attempt to form one cohesive piece. I don't know who's responsible for this but whoever it was should probably be fired. NO scenes are fleshed out as the movie jumps so much, it never lets you soak in anything as it attempts to almost drive itself to a very lackluster finale. I think the term is "Franken-Flick."This is what hurt Joker as well. He seemed like he was certainly from a different cut. Leto's portrayal is unique but you are never really prepared to see him on screen and when you do, the editing is so poor and jarring, you're left confused as to what exactly you just saw.According to multiple sources including Leto himself, there was enough footage shot for a Joker film yet he's reduced to 10 min. of total (and scattered) screen time. The scenes in question are said to be from the immensely popular "Mad Love" story line that showcased the origin of Harley Quinn. Hopefully we get an extended cut with these scenes included. It's a shame because there are parts where Leto completely disappears and all I see is The Joker from the panels of the comics. Then there are parts where he seems more like sad clown than clown prince of crime (More on that Later).The plot of this movie starts okay, but turns incredibly generic and simple fairly quick. You've seen it a thousand times before in a thousand comic book movies before. Nothing really to talk about here. It's the same for the villain. Basically, generic comic book villain #126.Overall, this is a good movie. I know it seems hard to believe with my critique towards the end but that should tell you just HOW GREAT these characters are. Perfection personified. This is a very enjoyable and entertaining flick succeeding in finally etching a solid entry into the DCU. I am looking forward to seeing more of these characters in the future! Biggest Problem: Joker and Harley's relationship. It's no secret that it isn't the "best." For lack of a better term, He beats her. It's Harley's Stockholm Syndrome that helps make her a more sympathetic character.This is a chore trait to these characters as their relationship should give you a glimpse into both their psyche AND their psychotic nature. I fail to see how people can't stomach things like this but are perfectly fine with murder. The lower common denominator of the population just can't seem to separate "Portrayal" from "Glorification" but that's the world we live in I suppose. Here, Joker uncharacteristically loves Harley. Early cut's did have the abusive aspect of their relationship, however audiences tested poorly so these scenes were reedited while some were removed to make Joker and Harley appear more caring, apparently forgetting these are villains.I rate this movie 10/10 just for the sheer fun and entertainment I had watching these crazy characters together. As a film overall, I'd give it an 8/10, excelling past BvS and MoS as the best DC movie SINCE the Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . Donald Trump as our next U.S. President in SUICIDE SQUAD, but this feature's mid-credits final scene between Hillary Clinton's stand-in "Amanda Waller" (played by a scary Viola Davis) and Ben Affleck as Gotham City Tycoon Bruce Wayne, a.k.a., Batman, a.k.a. New York City Tycoon Trump, indicates--as the Trumpster keeps telling us--that Hillary/Viola MUST be stopped, one way if not another. Warner shows us that Hillary/Viola can easily fall prey to the Forces of Evil. (When her Emails are compromised, she just shoots her IT people in the head!) Trump echoed Warner's warning this week when he revealed that Hillary founded the dread terror SUICIDE SQUAD known as ISIS. During the course of this movie version of SUICIDE SQUAD, Hillary's alter ego--"The Witch"--turns the citizens of Midway City into some sort of mindless cancerous zombie army, which can only be stopped when Will Smith shoots them in the head (before they can reach the voting booths). But even Warner's SUICIDE SQUAD has a tough time contending with Hillary/Viola's Evil Witch powers: only Trump/Batman is immune to them, and available to save America's bacon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a must see movie for all DC fans. This movie has everything that a great movie needs. The film was just not great it also had killer 3D in it. Will Smith was fantastic as Deadshot. Jarod Leto where do I start he was great and Margot Robbie oh my she was fantastic in every way as Harley Quinn. This was just not a movie this was an experience for the whole family. If I had any negatives it would be absolutely nothing.Parents this movie is pushing the PG-13 rating to the point where it should be a R rated film, but it was great besides that parents. Suicide Squad was just not the best film of the year it was the best IMAX 3D film ever. I just want to say that this was the coolest movie and great job Warner brothers. I can't wait for the sequel of this movie because this movie needs one bad. Thanks for reading</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That piece of sh*t had so big ad company that after first trailer it was obvious that this "masterpiece" will be a failure. Warner Brothers didn't correct mistakes of BvS and made whole things even worse. Suicide Squad is simply boring. It has nothing to compare with others superhero movies not to mention real movies. All actors act at the level of Kristen Stewart, except of Will Smith who is really trying to reanimate his career after "After Earth". The plot of this movie is so primitive that even 4 year old kids would understand it but this is not so bad cause those are main audience of this film. It earns some point for real good soundtrack but sound can't save whole movie. It makes fell sad for Will Smith and DC who bury themselves with this type of "Films"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start of, I'm not a DC fan. When my friends invited me to watch this, I only watched it because I wanted to see them. I hadn't even watched the trailers beforehand.I walked into the cinema, sat down and the second it started I was enchanted. The coloring was breathtaking, and the special effects were amazing. Same goes for the sound effects and the music and soundtrack. Also, the costumes and make-up was something I really enjoyed. The movie was captivating from it's first scene. I quickly connected with the characters (trust me, this rarely happens, I am the kind of person that doesn't connect with movie characters) and I really enjoyed the way they were represented. Besides form excellent characters, the plot itself was great. I've watched my fair share of Marvel movies and expected to see something I'd seen before, but I didn't. It had it own story, and the ending was unexpected.All in all, this movie was probably the best one I've ever seen. I don't give 10s, but this one gets a 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some say this movie is worse than BvS and Man of Steel, but it truly isn't, I can agree that Suicide squad is a love/hate movie but if you love the characters and care for them then you will like this movie. Do not listen to the critics! This is a great movie and should not deserve this almighty backlash it has been given by critics such as rotten tomatoes and sign who just focus on the negative side of things without touching on any positives.Margot Robbie is amazing as Harley Quinn and so is will smith, as for Jared leto's joker, most will say that he didn't get as much screen time as we hoped for and I agree, but when you think about it, this movie is called 'Suicide Squad' and the story should realistically be about them, Joker is not part of the suicide squad so don't get too disappointed when you find this out. Leto has spoken out about this and said there were tons of scenes that didn't make the final cut, but for the few scenes he was in, he was GREAT! I am not going to compare him to Ledger and Nicholson because in their movies they were the main villain and we don't see enough Leto to make this comparison.Overall Suicide Squad is a great movie and is well worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suicide Squad: "Im Beautiful!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 8.0, Great Movie, SCREW YOU Peter Travers (2.5), But He Gives Batman: Forever (7.5)....* I've said it before, with Batman V Superman, Dawn Of Justice (6.7), MARVEL's superheroes are way better,(except Batman of course) but when it comes to the villains of the DC Universe, MARVEL drops the ball. When I found out that David Ayer director of Fury (9.5) was making a Suicide Squad movie, I was flipping, and the trailer caught all our eyes. Suicide Squad is a new twist in the super hero genre that even the harshest of MAVEL fans will love, but not the critics... like Peter Travers...* Characters: - Deadshot: Floyd Lawton, A.K.A Deadshot is played by 'good guy' Will Smith, a lot of people have issues with him. Peter Travers says he supposed to be a "heartless assassin"- true, but he also has a big mouth and a daughter? Besides his solo hell fire scene was as good as Batman's warehouse fight. Get your facts right Peter!Harley Quinn: Margot Robbie plays an awesome Haley Quinn, she has the look, the humour and the bat, to put the smile or bruise on everyone's face, except Peter Travers...Rick Flagg: Flagg is you typical Michael Bay character, badass American patriot who bleeds blue, red and white, and I loved it.Captain Boomerang: You can hate Jai Courtney all you want, sure Boomerang is useless in a fight, but he is hilarious, dat beer slurp was gold!Killer Croc: I didn't like how he looked, but when he's in action, the Croc can shock!El' Diablo: I'd never heard of him before, he has an interesting character with a blazing origin story, no doubt the strongest and loving in the squad he trusts!Katana: An anime inspired character who's swords devour the souls of her victims, Awesome!Slipknot: HAHAHAHAHAHAH, oh god I saw it coming.. BOOM! HAHAHAHA!Amanda Waller: It's true Viola Davis's Waller is great, why? Because she keeps you guessing to figure her as the good lady or the bad girl all with the menacing look.Enchantress: OK no more jokes, Enchantress, and her brother and her zombies suck, pointless boring antagonists to assign the squad on their first mission.Joker: And Here We Go. Nicholson gave us the Funny, Ledger (R.I.P.) gave us the Dark and Leto gives us, just the Creepy. On screen Jarryd Leto portrayed the worst Joker I've seen, still I would have preferred him to be the main antagonist. Troy Baker and the legendary Mark Hamill are still the greatest Jokers!* Plot &amp; Design: It's a real shame when your characters are just awesome but the plot really falls. Ayer tries to draw from the cataclysm of BVS, but the movies Antagonist make it pointless. The movie's pace through introduction is executed well but through the feature its evolves into just a CGI mess. Still Deadshot, Rick and Harley deliver some great action sequences rivalled by the movie's delicious music score.* I like to see it as DC's take on Guardians Of The Galaxy (9.3), its very funny and very entertaining, so I recommend watching it whether your a MARVEL or DC fan. It's great twist on your average superhero blockbuster, now a message to Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone and his fellow abusive Critics. I follow you because I hate you. You abuse every movie that is seen as fun towards the public all for your money. Movies are made for entertainment! If you critics gave the 2016 Ghostbusters (4.7) positive scores to boost gender equality, I know why you did it, but your also liars, pretending to laugh at 'fart jokes?'. Most but not all of you critics are corrupted because you get paid and have terrible voting sites (Rotten Tomatoes/ Meteoritic) to anyone reading this, keep the reviewing here at IMDb. We are the public! We are the truth and "In Squad We Trust!"Please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2!

		<shortDescription>Fun characters, awful villain and plot line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I was so excited to see a dark, funny movie about all of our favorite villains. I was expecting this movie to have the dark humor like Deadpool, and an even darker tone throughout the entire plot. I was upset that the anti-heroes in this movie were so easily liked. Like, no! These are villains that kill innocent people for fun to take over the world! The main characters' evilness were downplayed. However, the characters were colorful and fun, and I did enjoy their dialogue between each other. Robbie and Smith hit it out of the park with their acting while the other actors seemed to not even matter. I felt like the joker was only in this movie to tease the audience with more upcoming movies about him. He only had probably 8 minutes of screen time. My biggest dislike of this movie was the main villain all the characters had to defeat. Like a witch?? Really? A witch that made a non human army that had bad CGI and was so hard to take seriously. This villain seemed like it shouldn't even belong in the DC universe and it was hard to understand the villain's reasoning to take over the world. This movie was fun and the characters were so enjoyable to watch. It was fun to like the villains and even start to love their craziness. However, the plot was stupid and the tone was too light for a movie full of villains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad movie, though failed by the aggressive PR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've finally watched the most expected movie of the summer and maybe even of the year. What can I say now? I have really mixed feelings and now I'll try to summarize them. The whole situation about this film in the world is clear. People are disappointed and so am I, but this movie is actually not bad. I'm sure this movie was killed by its aggressive PR company. For 6 months we were fed with trailers, teasers, official pics, songs etc. By the end of this company the expectation was unbearable and we were sure we're gonna watch the best movie of all times. And after all we get the NOT BAD movie. That's unforgivable. Let's start with the actors and theirs on-screen incarnations. Whole movie can be split in two parts. The first is the actual presentation of heroes and the second is the action. And that's where the movie begins to fail. There are a lot of characters and that's also a problem as the development of each is rather unbalanced. Actually only two of all deserve our attention. Of course that's Harley Quinn and Deadshot. I don't have any grudge against Margot Robbie, she is awesome and the best part of the whole movie. I can say that's the best realization of Harley in the movies. Waiting for her solo movie. Deadshot turned out to be the most interesting and well-developed of all. He has his past, his relationships and the motivation, cause the others suffer the lack of it. What about the rest of heroes... Boomerang seemed interesting, but he stayed absolutely undeveloped, Killer Croc looked interesting, but that's all. Slipknot...what the **** was that, are you serious?? Kara Delevingne is beautiful herself, but her Enchantress is one big disappointment. Viola Davis created the violent and smart manipulator and Rick Flagg wasn't really interesting. And yeah, we have The Joker. Jared Leto is cool and his presentation is really good, but I have the questions about the way Joker was made here. The gangster, the mafia... I don't know, The Joker has too little on-screen time and looks completely unnecessary. The plot is the weakest link of the movie, the main antagonist is simply nothing. I think better not to have antagonist at all than have the one we got here. The scenario isn't just simple, it's not developed and is full of plot holes. One of the huge advantages of the movie is its soundtrack. All tracks are really god-like and their mix leaves only pleasurable impressions. To sum it all up, this movie is not bad, but it isn't what we expected all the time. A lot of problems, weak scenario, lotta strange and stupid moments, inability to understand what is this film - drama or comedy... Of course you'll watch this movie anyway and there is a great chance of improving in the sequel. So we wait and hope, but this movie is unambiguously not the shot we've expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average at best. Entertaining but problems production wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good: The film is entertaining, no doubt about it. The comedy hits well, for the most part, and the action is satisfying. The actors and actresses did well in their respective parts, some more shocking than others (i.e. Jai Courtney as Boomerang). While on the topic of characters, for me, Jared Leto as Joker was fantastic to me. Although he had very limited screen time, I was more than satisfied with his performance. He was weird and uncomfortable to watch and it worked for me. I feel that if he had a role in a feature length film as the villain, he would impress even more-so than he has done for some viewers. Another fantastic performance lies within Will Smith as Deadshot. While he easily steals the show, Deadshot/Will Smith commanded attention with almost every word and action. Lastly, among notable characters for me, Diablo/Jay Hernandez was great for me.The Bad: So while most of the good was within the performances and entertainment spectrum, a majority of the bad lies within production, writing, and overall the creative direction. The film was re-shot for more comedy to be inserted into the film. With this knowledge and now viewing the movie, the comedy that was present felt unnecessary at times. Many lines fell flat for me and could surely have been done without... A large amount of criticism with 'Suicide Squad' was about the amount of flashbacks seen. I would have to agree. Although some were most certainly entertaining, others felt pointless... The soundtrack created issues for me as well. Far too often were sequences flooded with mainstream music and not just one song, but followed up by another and even maybe another. A friend of mine, Shawn, said something which describes it perfectly as, "It felt like watching a music video at times." I believe in letting a film tell itself. Music far too often drowns out the moment you are watching in order to increase dramatics. 'Suicide Squad' fell victim to this concept... All in all, the film felt rushed. There are reports out there stating the production was rushed itself, so who knows. At the end of the day, while it was plenty of fun and it was entertaining with great performances; the underlying issues drown out sheer entertainment, especially with the direction DC is trying to pursue. 'Suicide Squad' is an "alright" flick for me but better than 'Batman Vs. Superman', and that is a victory for me and my desire to enjoy a DC film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to like it, but a mess of a movie is still a mess of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to preface this but saying I am a long time comic reader, nearly two decades of reading DC comics have given me an expansive knowledge of the universe.So it's possible that I have a bias based on my knowledge. Unfortunately even as a movie this becomes a huge mess after the first act.The first act feels nice, you can't get into to much characterization with such an expansive cast so we have to make due with one character telling us about them. It works as a set up, but after that it becomes one big mess. Scenes felt cut and added for no reason other than trailer fodder. There is no connection between some scenes and it becomes terrifyingly noticeable to the extent that it draws you from the film. The best part of the movie was Jai Courtney, which is weird to say. That's not to say Margot Robbie and Will Smith weren't good in their parts. But when you have to keep Dead Shot's mask off just to give Smith face time it becomes a problem. As for Robbie, well you can certainly say someone looked through some comics and found every one of her jokes to add into the movie. Otherwise she's there for eye candy. Killer Croc looked like a joke (what the hell was up with his huge traps and then tiny tiny TINY body?!?!) and that was a huge waste of the villain of Enchantress (who just looked like she was hula dancing in every one of here scenes.) Last but not least let's talk about Leto. I was holding out hope for his portrayal of the Joker. But between his lack of actual scenes in the movie (most of his scenes are in the trailer) and the fact that he MUMBLES every one of his lines thanks to all the metal they put in his mouth, he is easily last on my list of favorite Joker portrayals. It's not a terrible movie, there are a few stand out scenes, but it's definitely not a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with a lot of expectations from suicide squad. The trailers had been brilliant and the excitement of seeing a new joker had me excited to the limit. But the movie was a disappointment. Margot Robbie(Harley Quinn) and Will Smith(Deadshot) gave a very good performance but again the story line disappointed. Marvel took there time introducing new characters and then building on them in subsequent movies, DC in there haste to catch up are goofing it all up. In Joker DC have by far the best antagonist of comic books, and in Jared Leto they have found a perfect replacement for Late Heath Ledger but the writers at Warner Bros let him down. Margot Robbie was outstanding as Harley Quinn and she was the only reason I am giving the movie a 6 rating. Overall DC built a very good story but were let down by the script writers. The movie lacks flow and could had been way way way better. Once a watch for me but even if you miss the movie you wont be missing out on a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Cult Film in over 30 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean that in the best possible way. For me, culture altering "Cult Films" are the most difficult to write and make. When they work, they last forever in a way no other genre can. Why do I say this? Because, using humor, philosophy and politics, they engrave archetypes into the collective consciousness, as I said, in a way that no other form can. Let's start here: Suicide Squad's incredibly strong Black and Female characters smashed the molds for what we usually see in film. Not that there haven't been others who have done awesome work, but the characters and performances in Suicide Squad have widened the parameters and opened doors that will never again be closed. Margot Robbie, in my opinion gave the first screen performance by a female that defied gender. That doesn't mean that Charlize Theron or Sigourney Weaver and other notable bad ass women haven't done amazing work, what it means is, the combination of the role given to Ms. Robbie, and her ability to take it to the absolute limit and beyond, have resulted in a total game changer. Ladies, the floor is now open, no more holds barred. Thank you to the writers, directors and producers who had the vision to allow Ms. Robbie, to take the role and run with it. Will Smith? Really? I mean, I do love him, but now I have so much more respect. That was one hell of a role to make work even without being true to source material. He grounded the film in so many ways. Viola Davis? What a surprise secret weapon she is in this film. Fresh and brilliant... once again a brand new avenue for female actors. Jared Leto? I know you all have your favorite Joker, but I'm sorry, his take was villain hall of fame level for detail and originality. Look, I could go on and on about each character, but this was an ensemble that fed off each other brilliantly. And here's the other thing about Cult Films for me... The rendering: from cinematography, to CGI, to make up, to wardrobe, to music (the music was flawless) to direction... must be very serious and of a high quality. That's the irony that makes it work; the contrast between the "off the cake" story and the very real production details. And let me tell you, the producers of Suicide Squad went all the way in every department. This movie is not for critics, it's for real people who love good film making, film making with joy and heart and imagination. Thanks guys. I can't wait for the next film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics were DEAD WRONG about this.Suicide Squad was a great film and an awesome continuation of the DCEU. It had a great story to it, the characters were utilized properly (though Deadshot was portrayed almost as a hero), and the action sequences were amazing. David Ayer kept the spirit of the comics alive in this.The Joker was well done by Jared Leto. Yes, a lot of the Joker scenes were cut from the film, but it was a good thing that they did so. It would have the taken away from the film too much. Will Smith as Deadshot was a good choice. He did a good job with that. Margot Robbie hit it dead on as Harley Quinn. There was no better choice. Jai Courtney as Boomerang was good, as well as Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje for Killer Croc and Karen Fukuhara as Katana. Jay Hernandez was good as El Diablo. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was superb.*SPOILERS* The story with the Enchantress and her brother, going on a rampage for what Waller did to Enchantress was a great way to do this film. The Joker as an interruption to the mission was a great use of the character. They did a great job.DC is doing a better job with more mature story lines than Marvels right now.That being said, to all of the critics out there: GO EAT A BAG OF DICKS!!! SUICIDE SQUAD IS AWESOME!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing... but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering all the hype and trailers that we have been seeing for months, I left the movie a little bit disappointed. I expected this movie to be a major upgrade from Batman vs Superman, but it wasn't. But it wasn't THAT bad, it was a decent story line with some great superheroes.The portrayal of most of the superheroes was one of the things that made me enjoy the movie and forget some of the bad things such as the awful Jared Leto as the Joker. I enjoyed Will Smith as Deadshot who was like the leader of the group. He eventually accepted that he is one of the good guys and should help the army. In turn, he would also persuade the others. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was great. Crazy but great. Her dysfunctional relationship with the Joker makes her even more crazy and mad. Jay Hernandez as El Diablo was a character that, at first is afraid of his own powers, but later gains courage to fight.Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker was awful. With Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson, The Joker was the bad guy that everybody loves. With Jared Leto, he destroyed that. His style and the iconic Joker laugh were terrible.Enchantress was good but I thought her character could have been portrayed better. Her background story should have explained and should have been given more screen time. She seemed like a real villain and one that could challenge the Suicide Squad; unlike the Joker.Overall, I found the movie to be entertaining. Most of the superheroes are interesting, each with their own background. There were some good jokes in the movie and the post-credits scene made me eagerly waiting the next movie. But this isn't a movie at the same level of The Dark Knight, so hopefully, the future DC comics movies will be much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comic Book Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep it simple. I'll start by saying, never forget that movie critics trashed Apocalypse Now when it came out. Is Suicide Squad as good as Apocalypse Now? Hell yeah it is! It's the perfect comic book movie. Cuts away like Family Guy to show us the awesome exposition rather than just say it. Everything with the Joker is perfect. But he is the conduit to get us to Harley Quinn. This is her movie, not his. When watching BvS I understood why some critics didn't like that movie. I didn't agree, but I understood. I have no idea what these critics who are trashing this movie are smoking. Or maybe it's what they're not smoking. Maybe they thought they were getting a Joker movie and they got a Suicide Squad movie. Will Smith and Margot Robbie owned this movie. It was so much fun to watch. I laughed, cheered, even got a little emotional at times with Harley and Mr. J's romance. There wasn't a character in this film I didn't like. Even Adam Beach and Scott Eastwood stood out. Kinnaman was a big surprise. I loved his relationship with Delevingne. Viola Davis was wicked good. Jay Hernandez took what could have been a throwaway character and gave him so much spirit. Jai Courtney and Karen Fukuhara played off each other wonderfully. Killer Croc has some of the best one liners. To sum it up, I just feel bad for anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. I'm glad this movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be. Fun, fun and more fun. I cannot wait to go watch this movie ten more times in the theater. It is simply epic. Best comic book movie of the year, just ahead of Deadpool. For me, up there with The Dark Knight and Burton's Batman. Do not understand at all why this movie got panned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst editing ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty movie, but unlike still photographs, movies must have story that takes place over a period of time. The editors seemed to ignore that. The obviousness of the re-edit after BvS's critical failure is so blatant that the story is incomprehensible. We're talking day turning to night turning to day, a la Plan 9 from Outer Space. The acting is pretty good, especially from Margot Robbie. And I love the "gangster/mobster" Joker. But people, there's got to be a story. Inserting jokes to "lighten the mood" only works if the jokes are an integral part of the character, and the jokes are timed well. Plot events have to be shown, if not in actual chronological order, then at least in a way that makes sense to the audience. This movie was pieced together with old wood glue and some duct tape. Again, the music was cool (although sometimes unnecessary), Margot Robbie's great and gorgeous, and there were other positive aspects. But these are the preetty face of a poorly-executed film. Save time and money and skip this one.</fullReview>

Take civil war for example, you kill crossbones in the first 15 minutes, the guy that suppose to kill Cap. enough about marvel, Suicide Squad was great if you know any history of the comic, and yes the joker is not in it that much, but if you read the comics you know it's not about the joker or batman, it is focus on the squad. The movie have great acting, visuals, sound and action.It was just a fun movie overall, don't listen to the critics or all this sheep who just agree that every Disney marvel movie is great. I can't wait for justice league and wonder woman movie, they're going to awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Amazing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start out, I do not know too much about the Suicide Squad except from what I saw from Arrow... and the first trailer... I came into the movie knowing about the low scores but it looked interesting so here we go... The movie was very well paced and the cast chemistry could be seen. There are moments of laughter, moments of action, and even moments of silence just listening to the characters talk to one another. It has quick witted and some twisted humor which I love. Harley Quinn takes front and center along side Deadshot. The leadership is shown and emotions that the squad didn't know were there are shown. Even though, they still had their evil tendencies. The characters are all innocent in their own ways which adds to the attachment you make quickly. Somethings are not explained with some of the characters however, but it does not detract from the plot. The "professional" critics seemed to have missed the movie and were to busy to enjoy it. This is one of my all-time favorite movies now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that, it has been a just been a day or two and the reviews are spilling so much venom against the Suicide Squad, has made me wonder, that why are such mean reviews being posted? But then I've came to realise that these are the reviews from fans of DC rival comic-verse. So I request you all to please ignore such reviews.Now coming to the topic, I am a movie enthusiast and would like to share that the movie was very good overall. Tone of the movie was dark, however it also had very good humor added to it (unlike Batman v Superman). The effects were good, the acting, the story-line and the pace with which the story-line went, although for first couple of minutes, the story was rushing a bit, but then it slowed down and started getting "really, really "interesting"!' I would not like to spoil the movie much, but *spoilers alert*, some of the scenes by Joker, Margot Robbie and Will Smith received great applause from the audience, and then obviously there was this Flash scene. I would grade the film, a solid A+ and give out a score of 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Decent" film, in all meanings of the word. Avoid the trailers if you still can.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very decent film, and that is its problem. The feeling I suspect most will have after seeing it is: "Yeah it was good. *beat* But(!)...", this was not what I expected it to be. Unlike The Other Anti-Hero Movie of 2016, you can tell that Suicide Squad was a corporate product and not one of enthusiasts and fans. There are heaps of experience and talent on the screen, supported by loads of money and production values, and this affects the film in a very positive way. But all of that is still very restrained. The story does not go out on a limb at any time, while most characters and their actors are completely under-used. This is most noticeable with Jared Leto that does not get to let loose as The Joker as much he could but instead gets relegated to be a crowd-baiting bolt-on. Only Margot Robbie gets to excel as Harley, and even so with a few caveats.The story seems all over the place at first but once you reach the end you see that it is very safe "Good Guys Vs. Bad Guys" affair. Marketing tries to tell us that the Squad are baddies, but at the same time the character development desperately drives home the point ? over and over ? that all the protagonists are actually (kind of) good. It even gets to the point where Deadshot explicitly tells us that the Squad are "the bad guys", and it fails miserably; Will Smith does not a convincing baddie make. And when Harley is day-dreaming about being The Joker's loving housewife it feels like blatant corporate executive meddling in action, where you can sense how they flinched and winced at the thought of "bad" characters being the heroes. As such, this is not at all the anti-hero film that it was touted as, but instead a very decent ? in the meaning "well-behaved" ? film, and that is not what I came for.Another thing that adds to the "But.." is that the trailers lead us to believe that the film will be a half-mad, full-tempo roller coaster ride. It is not that. That is not to say that the pacing is unfitting or wrong for the story, not at all. But it is different from what I was made to expect, meaning I came to the theater in the wrong mood, and that threw me off. After seeing the film I wish I never saw the trailers before I went.In the end, Suicide Squad is a decent flick ? in all meanings of the word ? that could have gone at least two steps further. But the concept, the story and the characters were all put on a very tight leash. It is as if the film itself ? just like the characters ? is operating under a constant death threat from the leadership, forcing it to behave well and not stray. Still, the film, the story and the actors all manage to perform admirably within their constraints, and as such I recommend watching.Just do not see the trailers before you go. Oh darn... too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*there is only a very mild spoiler in this. The paragraph about the characters has a small spoiler about a scene with Harley*I don't know what movie they showed the critics that rated this so badly. I know it had a few mistakes, but it was no where near the hate that it got.I am a huge Dc fan, I like marvel too, but Dc is just better in my opinion. Ever since I heard about the Suicide Squad movie I have been looking it up everyday to see pictures and stuff. When the first trailer came out, I was so excited. When the movie came out I thought it was not going to reach my expectations, but it exceeded them by a million miles.The characters are amazing. Harley was spot on to the comics, *Mild Spoiler* they even showed her in the traditional suit for a scene, it was amazing. The famous picture online of the joker and Harley dancing with the creepy grin and her jester suit on was basically reenacted in this movie and it was so good, they even had her jester hat on in the scene! *spoiler over* All the other characters were so good. In my opinion, Even though the Joker wasn't in it as much as many people would have wanted, I thought that he was the best on screen Joker, Ever! He is straight up insane, he is scary, charming in a way, smart, and everything you would want for the joker. He is definitely the closest Joker to the comics played on screen. Everybody else, again, was amazing!The soundtrack for the movie was spectacular. If you don't want to go for the story, go for the music, because it was amazing.All in all, it was definitely my favorite movie I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot. I had a great time, and I had a grin on my face the entire movie and on the entire ride back home! Definitely go see this, it will change your look on the dc universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put it's disappointing. I went in with low expectations, and still couldn't wait for it to finish.Directing is all over the place, the story is just one cliché over another. I talking about ten guys slow-motion walking in the middle of the street with heavy rock soundtrack kind.Oh about soundtrack, the first part of the movie is just a music video. We meet the characters and while we do it we listen to a couple of 70's rock hits. Then after Black Sabbath's Paranoid comes Eminem with Shady's back. It's like dad/son made a greatest hits mix-tape. Acting is not bad overall, with Margot just being excellent, and Will also not bad at all. But the script is full of loopholes and the dialogues are simply boring that the cast had very little to work with. And thumbs down for the new Joker. He is a caricature, a gimmick, you can't really see him as a crime lord, let alone a dark twisted psychopath. Anyways, I'd like my money back, please. I can see how a 15yo might like it but these guys giving it "10/10", "best movie of the year", "best pic eva!" are just here on behalf of the studio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasted Potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went and saw it last night. It's frustrating because it had so much potential.They don't know what to do with the female cast. Amanda is the only good female role, and that's because of the amazing job Viola Davis does, once again. June Moon and Katana are totally empty shells. And Harley, who is the most interesting and complex character of them all, is used as a simple comic relief, instead of going deeper into her head and the relationship with Joker and her crush on Deadshot. Jared'sJoker is awful. He's not The Joker, he's just a guy in green hair. He got so worried about the ticks and mannerisms that he forgot to act, it's kind of embarrassing seeing him go over the top while you have Viola and Will and Margot giving such better performances without that kind of method acting. And also, The Joker is useless to the story, he's just kind of there sometimes, they don't know where to put him.And the editing is horrible, the movie had three beginnings, and in the third one they reintroduce the two characters they had showed before.In the end, it's way better than BVS, and the cast does a great job and the characters are very interesting, however, it's still not enough. Batman Assault on Arkham is still the best Suicide Squad movie, they should have done that story instead. It made more sense. I love DC, but I still don't like their movies, maybe the next one does it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is fun and better than average but fail to deliver the teamwork of suicide squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, i have knowledge on DC comic characters. I know what those villains(i mean suicide squad) can do. However this movie just does not show much. Basically, u're just watching those villains joining together in a squad trying to get job done.(working together? ... not really).It does not introduce all of the characters well, this movie only show the surface of them(their power) and not much personality.I believe most of the people want to see .... "teamwork" , the bond between the squad members. You wont see how they understand each other well(Where is the conflict since they all have different personality), they just all become friends or partners since they join the squad&#xff0c; except the boss who they hated of course.This movie also does not show how they work together with their abilities during the fight. For example, Deadshot shooting alone , Harley fighting alone , Killer Croc punching alone, soldier shooting. This does have action scene but we cant see the villains teamwork performance especially fighting together. It's like you wont feel anything important on those characters.Batman: Assault on Arkham&#xff0c; this animated film actually did an awesome work on those villains. And i must say this animated film is better than this movie if u want to know what is the real suicide squad can do.OK Story&#xff0c; The story is straight forward and not much depth, it does have some twist but not so much influence on the main story. The Bad Guy in this movie is also "straight forward". Even the relationship between squad members are .... "straight forward", so this might be the reason some people don't like this movie. But it is still fun if you enjoy the movie.Actors performance&#xff0c; i will say good on most of the cast. you will not disappointed. And Jokers in this movie does not shine because the limit of his scene time(don't expect too much from Joker).Soundtrack is awesomeThis movie can be better,it may disappointed on people who have high expectation. For me, i want the suicide squad (villains working together&#xff09; to shine, but sadly i didn't see that. It's like an adventure with the suicide squad, u will enjoy it. But if u want to understand the squad or feel the importance of them, then i might say no. Not sure if PG-13 limit the potential of this movie, but i guess it can be more epic if it's 18.There is a mid credit scene, so wait a while before u leave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC fanboys gotta stop giving it 10/10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got to balance out these 10/10s. Everybody knows that this movie was nowhere near a perfect 10. There isn't even a Marvel movie that's a ten. DC crams too many characters into their movies. Harley, Deadshot, Rick Flag, Enchantress, and Amanda Waller were the only ones who actually did something in the movie. Harley, Deadshot, and Waller were the only "good" characters. The rest of the Squad was just there to be there. Joker was shoehorned in. Flag's romance with June Moone was pointless. Slipknot did so little I almost forgot he was in the movie. Same for Captain Boomerang. Katana and Killer Croc are just there to kill the zombies or whatever they were. The plot twists weren't good or surprising. I thought this movie was going to be fun to watch but DC ruins it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched the Midnight premier and here are my quick thoughtsWhat I LikedMargot Robie was excellent as Harley Quin, I was expecting it to be more of a Joker and Harley movie but Will Smith carries the movie well as Deadshot, he is more or less the leader....Jared Leto's Joker..... it starts off pretty great, but the more they show him and what his motives are (which I still don't know) the more you start questioning whether or not you like him, not sure if thats a good thing or not... What I did not LikeIntroduction to each character was rushed and thus there is minimal or little character development. You just get dished out a spec sheet of who they are and then expect to feel for them using flash backs... which works for some characters but definitely not all of them, and you'll know which ones after seeing the movie. The Villain was bad (no pun intended), half of the villains team gets randomly shoved into the movie without any back story. When I say team, I mean one out of the two antagonists... to vaguely put it without spoiling anything. Some of the lines and dialog felt out of place.... again, can't say without spoiling. Lots more to talk about but those are my quick no-spoiler thoughts. Honestly, would give this a 6.5 but 7 will suffice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad starts out OK then crashes and burns. I really wanted to like this movie but it was just impossible. There was no character development at all, the CGI was freakin terrible, the editing sucked, the main villain had potential to be awesome but they didn't use her at all, and it was super predictable. I did like some of the characters. Margot Robbie was good as Harley Quinn, Will Smith was such a likable character as Deadshot, Jai Courtney did the impossible and was good in a movie, and Jared Leto was easily the best part of this movie. He killed it as joker but there is one complaint I have with his character, he's in it for like twenty minutes. Every time he was about to do something that you wanted to see the scene just ends. Joel Kinnaman was fine but his character had really corny lines at times, El Diablo was alright, I didn't really like Killer Croc,I really wanted to like Enchantress but the way they used her was pretty boring and the movie just felt incomplete. Batman is in it for a little bit in the very beginning and it made me think to myself during the final battle "where the hell is batman during all of this?" The movie doesn't take place in gotham but we saw he has a jet in B v S. There were so many plot holes and the ending of the movie is so rushed and half assed. Suicide Squad wasn't just a disappointing movie but it's a bad movie. Suicide Squad gets a D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize the Joker was not a main character here but that is no excuse for a weak performance. He was awkward and pathetic. He definitely dropped the ball. As for the plot of the movie i did not care for it. They are too ambitious with movie plots these days and it's just too unrealistic and inconsistent. The main protagonists were extremely powerful but restrained that power against the Suicide Squad hence their downfall. I hate when movies do that! It's not realistic!I do applaud the performances of some actors though. I think Will Smith did a good job, Margot Robbie did a great Harley Quinn, and Viola Davis was a great Amanda Waller. For being very bad guys they came off very hokey and too nice. Especially in the end. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really impressed with the movie and by getting the chance to witness it earlier. It's true that I haven't experienced such a comedy and full of action movie after Deadpool but Suicide Squad really left Deadpool behind. The excellent working of Harley Quinn as psychopath and playing the role of Joker is amazing. She changes her voices and the iconic laugh of Joker is unbeatable. Well, movie was slow in the beginning while showing the origins of the characters. The best part of the starting scene is the appearance of Flash that interacts with Boomerang. Yeah they all are Badass including Katana, El Diablo, Boomerang, Killer Croc, and Deadshot. Deadshot was tried to show as the leader of Squad but due to many characters on the same mission, it didn't work. BVS and Captain America has their own place in 2016 but Suicide Squad is wonderful. You should definitely go watching it like I went wearing my Harley Quinn jacket from Fjackets.com but that's optional. I highly recommend it because it worth to have your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Pros*** : Will Smith, Viola Davis and Jared Leto saved this movie. Each Joker &amp; Harley scene together was amazing. also, i absolutely loved the easter eggs!***Cons*** :*1. There was always music playing during the movie! And most of the music wasn't even related to the scenes, it didn't go together very well. *2. The editing was bad &amp; it was confusing to watch.*3. I'm a huge fan of Margot Robbie but she was trying too hard. *4. The lines were lame *5.Cara Delevingne's performance was the worst &amp; her plot was pointless and boring, she needs to quit from acting and stick to modeling.*6.So in this movie, suicide squad member's just met, they know each other for a couple of hours and they already call each other "friends", they made them look like they are the bad guys who are trying to change and become good - this ruined the movie. I guess they thought that we would not relate to them if they stayed bad. Well guess what, they could be likable without all the heroism thing.*7.They did a mistake with rating it PG13. What bothered me the most was Harley. I mean she thought that her puddin' is dead and gone forever, she cried over him for two minutes and moved on, that's not like her at all. She's more extreme than that. She should have went nuts and try to kill everyone because her pudding is dead. I guess they couldn't show how crazy she really is because this movie is rated pg13. Also, she had the chance to bring her puddin' back to life (at the time no one knew that he was still alive) she could bring him back to life if she agreed to work for the enchantress, instead - she chose her "friends" over the biggest love of her life (joker) that doesn't make any sense. they couldn't show the abusive relationship in a pg13 movie.*8. Story telling was confusing and rushed. "Well they cant do flashback scenes for hours to introduce each character" which brings me to the next problem:*9. Pointless action scenes. They were shooting and playing with guns for at least 40 minutes. They could save these 40 minutes for proper story telling.DC can make up for this disaster by creating a joker/harley solo movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh boy, where to start.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what is shown, it's solidly, okay. But among this mess of a blockbuster actually lies a descent story (in the first half at least) and neither the studio nor director Ayers, seem interested in exploring any of it. The Joker and Harley Quinns relationship, for example, is all show no tell. Why does she love him? Why does he love her? Because they're both insane, isn't an answer.It's not just those two love sick puppies whose characters get butchered by the power of editing, either. Everyone's back stories and motivations (the most interesting part of the movie) are made second (sometimes third) to a by-the-numbers 'defeat the bad guy' plot line. Only Smith's Deadshot gets any real screen time to offer reason to why he'd want to the save the world. The only problem is his character ark undercurrents 'Squads' entire central theme. These are suppose to be the bad guys right?What acting chops are shown off from the cast (and surprisingly, they're mostly pretty solid) are all but wasted on a film too concerned with getting to the finish before it's even begun. The DCCU has all but hit bottom this year, giving a real perspective to why some people really hate comic-book movies. I'd say, come 2017, proceed with caution WB, but I'm pretty sure that's what's gotten you into this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie with more problems then usual movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all suicide squad is a group of bad people that exist in the Batman universe of DC comics. All members of the suicide squad were caught by Batman or they dealt with Batman in Gotham city. They were chosen to be 'Task Force X' by a U.S. intelligence officer, because these are all expendable people that don't matter to society.Now let's get into the movie. Right from the get go the movie had problems. There were so any characters that their intro took half of the movie away and they still could not explain all the characters. The movie felt like watching the trailers all together, cause it was cut poorly. Very poorly to be exact. David Ayer did say that this is his cut of the movie but we have seen some really good movies from this guy and it is a little hard to believe that he did this cut. The studio was confused on how they wanted to portray these characters. Cause we know from the comics and they animations that the Suicide Squad is a very lively group of people. But they have done very bad and dark things. Studio made the movie showing some of those dark features but they then wanted to turn it into a humorous movie. Obviously because of all the criticism from 'Man of Steel' and 'BVS: Dawn of Justice'. But this just made the scenes detached from each other and made the audience frustrated.Now let's talk about Joker. First of all you don't have Joker in a movie and don't give him an arc. He is one of the greatest villains in comic book history. He can't be there to only save Harley Quinn. Also they showed him too soon in the movie. He should have been given a grand entrance. Instead we was given 15 seconds inside Harley Quinn's intro. Everyone was so excited to see a new Joker after the memorizing performance Heath Ledger gave and Jared Leto actually did a good job. But we didn't get to see it cause he was in there for like 10 minutes. That was a very big upsetting factor for the fans. Cause we all went to the theaters to see Joker terrorize Gotham city. Instead we got a dancing witch.I simply stated out all the bad things about this movie. But none the less it was a good movie. It was a fun movie. The reviews are extremely harsh. The music was some of the best music I have ever heard in any movie. The acting was superb. Will Smith as Deadshot simply killed it. One, when he was showing off his skills and just ripping through rounds of bullets to hit the same target on the same bulls eye and two, jumping on top of that car and killing those hundreds of faceless creatures all by himself. We saw what Deadshot really is. We saw the true fear in all the other solders eyes. We saw them realizing that this man can wipe them clean in seconds if he wanted to and that moment truly captured the character. We saw the sweet, loving and also fierce side of Harley Quinn. At the end El Diablo took his true form and that whole sequence was awesome.St the end watch the movie. It is worth every penny and just a fun time with friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy On The Outside, But Inside Is Full of Surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever eaten a foreign cuisine which looked gross on the surface, but after the first bite you just kept eating because it was actually really delicious?! That was my experience with Suicide Squad in general. I am a huge DC fan and would be first to admit that the DCEU has struggled critically so far due either over ambitious plot (i.e BvS) or stupid endings (i.e Man of Steel Metropolis Battle), however in the case of SS the main problem with this movie was studio interference after the critical backlash of Batman V Superman. In terms of overall quality, the movie felt chopped up and poorly edited (again). Anyone who saw the trailers can tell A LOT was cut out for unknown reasons and DC executives deserve to smacked in the face for been so stupid and not trusting their director's vision. In terms of entertainment value, this movie had a lot of "fun" moments. Will Smith as Deadshot was great, Margot Robbie knocked her part out of the park, and Jared Leto had a very unique take on the Joker. His Joker is easily the most "sane" Joker ever seen on screen because Joker in this universe seems very in control of his actions even though he is still very unpredictable. This Joker is flashy and runs a "business", so he is the direct opposite of Heath Ledger's Joker, who just seemed to loved chaos. Speaking of tone, DC executives clearly got scared of keeping their universe "dark" and went the "Marvel" route of jokes mixed with action, which I personally didn't mind at all even though I am not a fan of "marvel humour". The original script of SS was clearly darker, but the studio wanted SS to become DC's "Guardian of The Galaxy", which is STUPID. Overall, I loved this messy movie for what it was. I will never defend this movie as a great summer flick, but I would say it is just as dumb as the critically acclaimed Marvel flicks critics seem to love. Go watch it for yourselves and make up your own goddamn mind. My score remains 10/10, which is a VERY subjective score and not to be taken too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leto and Robbie/Joker and Harley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked the Suicide Squad version of both. Other than the single cringey "the voices didn't really say that" scene, Robbie did a good job and was likable and funny. And Leto was a hell of a lot closer to the source material than Ledger. Leto's Joker was a little too "gangsta", but take that away and he had the look, darkness and obsession of a lot of newer comic book issue Jokers (yes the Joker has been ripped and pretty good looking in a lot of them, so no it's not weird nor inaccurate.)Yeah their relationship was a little bit too fluffy, but I think that's only because the movie it's self couldn't show massive amounts of abuse with out losing audience. But, if you've read the comics and watched the cartoons, it's also not unrealistic that they would be like this with each other. Basically if the movie had been able to add him bashing her around a few times (and kept everything else the same), it would have been spot on. I give it a solid 7/10, and most of that being the director's fault for their roles, and an 8/10 over all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was somewhat dubious about seeing this as I had read a mixed bag of reviews, however having just come back from the cinema I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed the film, it was excellent.Harley Quinn was the best and her love of the Joker clear for all to see. Deadshot was also great, a bit of depth along with Quinn. Flag and June was a nice touch, a love story, along with Quinn and The Joker, Deadshot and his daughter.I guess my only question would be 'what was Boomerang there for' he didn't do anything!All in all it was an excellent flick...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fully enjoyable film that unfortunately highlights everything lackluster about modern comic book movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad provides us with a fun, yet still extremely flawed, entry into the DCEU, however overall, it stands as the strongest of the films so far, maybe being on a par with the Ultimate Edition of BvS, if you can get over the extreme plot holes that BvS contrived, some of which can't even be fixed by the directors' cut, one of the things that Suicide Squad arguably also suffers from.It is worth noting first of all that the cast and the acting that Suicide Squad boasts is stellar. The Joker of course being the main point of focus for fans coming into the theater, and it is met with an intriguing response from Jared Leto when he is on the screen, as this interpretation of the Joker is a chilling, unhinged and certainly "Damaged" version of the character that makes his mark on the character's long history from the off go. This version of the Joker that Leto is putting forward most definitely portrays a side to the character that fans have not seen live on the big screen before. Leto takes elements from previous iterations, such as the organised chaos of Heath Ledger's legendary performance, the insanity of Mark Hamill's "Arkham" voice work and its subsequent physical presentation, as well as Jack Nicholson's upbeat yet sadistic depiction, and combines them to produce a fresh Clown Prince of Crime that audiences can look forward to seeing in future installments in the DCEU. Harley Quinn, played by the ever stunning Margot Robbie, is a wonderful mix of psychotic and lovable that blends fantastically with Leto's Joker and sets her up well for further Suicide Squad films as well as establishing her as a formidable villain that can hold her own as a potential single antagonist for a future DC film. With the exception of Will Smith as Floyd Lawton AKA Deadshot, who is solid as always yet plays the same role he always does, that being Will Smith himself, the rest of the Suicide Squad feel underdeveloped and reserved only for their own standout moments; none of them ever truly rise to the level that Quinn and Deadshot reach as fully fledged members of the squad and this forces it to feel like a film about Quinn and Lawton and their backup along the way, as these two stand out too much as to undermine the authority of Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, regardless of how well these two brought their respective characters to life. It is understandable that the studio would want to utilise the stardom of Robbie and Smith to the max, however this cost them a balanced and well developed squad and only left audiences pondering on what could have been, should the squad have each got their own equally evolved and compelling back stories as the two main members received.David Ayer and co. try very hard to deter from the dark, and often grim tone set out by Man of Steel and BvS, successfully at most points, but also attempt to partially stick to the grittiness of the previous DCEU entries, producing a rather mixed tone that one cannot quite grasp a hold of for longer than 10 minutes before it shifts again. A lot of effort has been put into making this film funnier and more enjoyable for general moviegoers and committed fans alike, it can be said that the team behind it has pulled it off, yet it seems as if they do so at the expense of a well driven plot and thorough character development. This therefore stipulates that it is as if they exchanged the opportunity to really kick-start the DCEU with a strong quality movie that the dedicated fan base are so desperately calling to unite behind with a rushed, messy and, once again, divisive end product that at least manages to entertain the audience to a certain extent. Although exploring a more light hearted tone at points, Suicide Squad does indeed have its fair share of violence (naturally), beautifully choreographed on the most part and thrilling to say the least. However, over exaggerated life or death scenarios are a key feature throughout the movie, and it is easy to say that these sorts of films are starting to look like they are getting far too strained in the task of topping the last occasion where everything depended on a small group of individuals to save the planet, and have now resorted to plain silliness when trying to get this message across. Suicide Squad suffers greatly from this, giving us another one of those typical "destroy the world" villains with a reliably average super evil scheme. Even for a film about bad guys, there doesn't feel like enough sustainable and meaningful threat that the audience can truly understand the scale of, as we've all seen the whole maniacal world domination motive a hundred times over, and we all know how it turns out in the end.It's not groundbreaking, but it's most definitely not as dismissive as Batman v Superman or as downright brooding and over the top as Man of Steel, yet it comes ever so close to just that. Suicide Squad once again indicates that there is huge potential for a brilliant DC movie universe that fans can finally say compares to the likes of Marvel. However, it has not reached there yet and we are left with another average film that could have been SO much better. It's saving grace is that, unlike the two films that came before it, it is a truthfully fun and enjoyable film and it shows strong signs that DC is starting on the path to redemption (however slow that journey may be).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes to combat evil you must use some evil. The premise of Suicide Squad is that a top secret cohort of despicable criminals are put together to fight a world threat. The first part of the movie is intense back story. So much that I felt I needed to take notes. Then you have these bad dudes assembled and they conflict with their handlers. To me the movie had the potential to be awesome but was a blend of bits rolled into one. Very intense fighting scenes that were obviously created with 3D in mind. Theses misfits come together to create their own family and seek to discover what is really important- family, friends and an honorable word. Harley Quinn does not disappoint as the sultry villainess. These heroes are on a self destructive odyssey. All for one and one for all. This movie takes you oo the road less traveled. One might ask, can evil be trusted?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is one of the summer's most anticipated films. With a very colorful, pop heavy marketing campaign, and the promise of an intriguing new spin on one of pop cultures most famous villains, people were wondering (hoping) that this would be the movie that would deliver the DC side of the superhero ship from the rocky waters that the last 2 attempts have left it in. But now with a harsh shellacking by prominent movie critics and an equally loud fan base shouting back, this movie has garnered more controversy than I think Warner Bros. and DC Comics were hoping for. So what is the final verdict? Is the movie really that bad? Or were critics just being overly hard on another summer tent pole? Honestly, the answer lies somewhere in between.

		<fullReview>Suicide squad has some messed up editing like the scene where enchantress frees her bro then the squad is assembled and they go to war with enchantress. Just that?! Nothing else in the middle?? That totally confused me. They should've added a few scenes in between. The soundtrack? It was good. Acting? Over the top. In spotlight was Harley Quinn and Joker. Though there were only a few scenes of him.The plot was average but suffered much. This film had much humour than BvS and sometimes that wasn't needed but eh...... It worked mostly. All of the characters did something but what did Cap Boomerang did? Just the fun part though. The flash cameo was fun to watch and Batman too. The villain didn't felt much like a threat y'know... After watching the film I want an extended R rated version of it because many things felt missing in the film. I would recommend it to you. But don't have your expectations high. It's a fun Popcorn flick I'll give you that.My rating 6.5/10.</fullReview>

They are used to fight in a battle between a witch, a witch in Gotham city?? Stupid and makes no since. The Film got a score of 30% on rotten tomatoes which is shocking cause the film is successful and the acting is great but the plot line did suck.But overall it was a good experience and luckily the witch will not be in the next film so the next film will be more realistic.Harley Quinn played by actress Margot Robbie brought the character to life, she has great acting skills and never went out of character.The Joker played by Jared Leto also did a great job in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least this movie has a little creativity and a few fun characters, but the story is very weak and boring. Jared Leto's metro sexual Joker is underused and Heath Ledger's Joker is a lot better. Jai Courtney is one of the worsts actors in the world, why is he even in this movie? I really want to like DC because I hate stupid Marvel movies, but this movie is not good at all, actually it's really bad.The visual effects looks very comical tho I don't like it at all. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight was a lot better than this trash.So that's my final conclusion. This movie is barely watchable, and for me superhero movies are dead. I always hated stupid Marvel movies for children, and I thought DC can make some real good superhero movies, but I was obviously wrong. Bring back Christopher Nolan, or just don't make any movies. But I'm sure you will milk this brand anyhow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched the movie and I liked it very much. The focus was more on the characters and less on overload action-scenes. I liked the characters, their powers, the jokes and the music. The most DC's characters need a psychiatrist and so they have a really weakness and a problem. The casting was good. I liked Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Will Smith as Deadshot and Jay Hernández as Diablo. It's difficult to write about the Joker because the Joker was very different. But he was million times better as Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. I don't get the negative critics. Perhaps some people have Posttrauma after "Batman vs. Superman";-) "Batman vs. Superman" was very bad but Suicide Squad is a masterpiece. the movie could been 10 minutes longer to show the stories of the other characters. This is my only critic. I hope they gonna do a second part with some new characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well................ it's worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched BvS, I thought that was not great for DC but maybe Suicide Squad will make up DC reputation because the trailer was so cool and not typical. I was so excited waiting for this movie, hoping there would be big surprises waiting. It starts with introducing every character, flashbacks, powers, weaknesses. And the first half is solid, I like it. The act is good, especially Robbie, Leto, and Smith, but not so much with Captain Boomerang (which I don't really know what he is doing in this movie). And I like how they throw some jokes in there. But as the movie goes on, it turns out to be typical and a little bit cheesy. Well I don't know what, but it has the same not so good feeling to it like BvS, I call it DC cliché. I guess its the plot, or the weak conflict, or maybe because I put my hopes up too high for this movie, I don't know. The story is too weak for such strong and bad ass characters. Is it worth watching? Yes. Is it good? Yes. Is it good enough for super villain movie? Ummm ... sadly No. Just.... don't put your hopes up too high.</fullReview>

Unfortunately the backstory development was too long and poorly executed and then the whole movie ran out of puff half way through. Dead Pool for me sets the new Gold Standard for sassy humour combined with a bit of action to create a great entertaining film.Some of these recent Hollywood films feel as though they are being forced to fit a formulae.

		<fullReview>Very very over hyped. The movie focuses more on Deadshot and Harley Quinn as all other villains fall behind them and are reduced to just a few lines in the entire movie.I'm not even gonna mention the fact, that they felt the need to introduce characters twice in the span of 10 minutes.Instead I'm gonna say this: "Warner Bros - grow a pair!". This movie should've been rated R, these villains would have been able to open up so much more, we might've even forgotten about the messy plot and the non-existent characters (xcept Deadshot and Harley). Even more than that they are VILLAINS how can you make a true to comic books movie about villains that don't kill(why are they even considered so bad then)?!??Lastly I'm gonna say some of them aren't even bad morally having in mind that W. Smith is just a father that loves his daughter and admits that he is looking for a chance to redeem himself and become a hero for her... Pyro is already a good guy when we meet him. The Katana girl (don't even remember her name) was good. Basically half of the villains in this movie turn out to be boy scouts.I'm not gonna talk about the story because as I said for me it was non-existent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was face-palming throughout the entire movie:- The first thing each "hero" does when he makes his first appearance is to punch a cop or soldier just to show how badass he is. Really??- Killer Croc is basically portrayed as a green version of "The Thing".- The way they tried to use different old soundtracks for each scene, you knew they were trying to imitate "Guardians of the Galaxy".- This joker is a joker. Nothing more than a wannabe gangster, instead of a psycho.- Amanda Waller behaves like she is possessed by a demon. What's up with that?- Enchantress talks in a holy Galadriel-like manner, but then suddenly blurts out, "You don't have the BALLS to do this". Wtf?I could go on and on about how cringe-worthy and sloppy this movie is, but I'll leave it at that.The only saving grace is Will Smith and Margot Robbie. But even they were not enough to save this potential-wasting, sloppily-edited, ultra-forgettable movie.As a DC fan, I hate to say this, but DC desperately needs directors like Christopher Nolan to bring glory back to its Universe, or it'll just continue to be overshadowed by Marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why have the Suicide squad when all you need is Deadshot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film 3 times already so I have the jist of the movie. My favourite lead singer is in this film Jared Leto, my expectation were high because of the off set craziness e.g. The gifts, never leaving character etc. This film is rather disappointing. Let's start with the Joker (Jared Leto). The joker is one of many reasons why I wanted to see this film. When I saw the comic-con trailer I was very excited to see the joker and what his role would be in this movie. In this film, he's in it for at least 15 minutes. Jared Leto Joker suited this film like how Jack Nicolson and Heath Ledger did too. I would like to see more of Jared's joker, 15 minutes is not enough. He really didn't do much in this film, sure he's the mob boss, he had power but that was it. Some scenes from the trailer didn't show up in the film too.Moving towards to Deadshot (Will Smith). I have to praise Will smith as he more or less carried this film alone. The star of the show, a true leader. His recent films like "Concussion" and "Focus" weren't his greatest but this film was he made up for it. Deadshot did everything. He over shadows Rick flag leadership, killed more Eye of Anversary than all of them put together and he defeated Enchantress. Which comes to my point why did Amanda Waller need the others?Harley Quinn (Marrgot Robbie). I love Harley Quinn, she's amazing on the big screen. I particularly liked the relationship between her and pudding. They got Harley Quinn right. Her back story was cut short, the scene where she stops the Joker, gets slapped and make out with him, that scene wasn't there.I could go on praising actors and actresses but let's get to the point.Amanda Waller pitches an idea of creating a team of villains with bombs planted on their necks and send them off to do suicidal missions, hence why it's called suicide squad. The Task force chases after a rogue Enchantress who creates a machine that will end the world. Let's start with Enchantress, how Amanda Waller controls Enchantress is by her heart that she keeps safe in a brief case. The idea is that if she does go rogue, she can kill her heart killing Enchantress, simple. What happens is Enchantress is able to find her brother's soul fairly quickly, feed it to a human, let his brother take over and destroy the city. Enchantress borrows her brothers powers to survive without her heart until she retrieves it from Amanda. She does retrieve her heart and kidnaps Amanda and uses her knowledge to destroy top secret locations from the government. Enchantress has many powers one of them is she can teleport/ blink. There's one scene where she blinks to Amanda when she's sleeping with the brief case. Why didn't Enchantress blink away with her heart? How did she not know about the explosive devices on the suicide squad's necks. She was at the meeting and she gathered information from Amanda at the end. Harley Quinn did nothing throughout the film. Captain Boomerang threw 2 Boomerangs throughout the film, there's one scene where Rick Flag destroys the bomb trigger which allowed Captain Boomerang to run off, moments later to return 2 minutes later (Pointless). Killer Croc choke slam a creature and swam underwater. Slipknot didn't even get a backstory, was introduce and died 5 minutes later. I expected more from Katana, all she had was slow motion sword slicing. Deadshot did everything. And finally Diablo, they tried too hard to make his backstory sad and when he died, I didn't even care. What makes me dislike this film is the last 20 minutes. You expect swarms of those creatures defending Enchantress and the machine right? Not one single creature was there to protect her or the machine, In fact the squad just walked in. Diablo fights Enchantress brother for a while and what does the squad do? They could of stopped Enchantress or Deadshot could of shot her heart out but instead they stood there and watched Diablo die. Once the brother was defeated, Enchantress blinks around fighting everyone, she could easily killed everyone but didn't for some reason. Once she threw all their weapons on the floor and gave mercy to them. Harley Quinn accepts mercy and kneels before her only to pick up Katana's blade to cut her heart out making Enchantress powerless (Cheap). Killer croc throws a bomb into the machine for Deadshot too shoot it. That's how they defeat Enchantress and guess what? Everyone stood still and watched Deadshot do all the work.Inconclusive I praise the acting, everyone pulled their weight but the story and the action scene were mediocre. I preferred Batman v Superman and I hated that film. 6/10</fullReview>

Margot Robbie proved herself as a great actress in this movie and Jared leto as Joker was interesting although he has not had much time on screen to prove himself as a real original Joker. the first half of the movie which introduced All the heroes and villains weren't that good. the screenplay has some major problem with creating the main Villain (Enchantress) which just gets worse with Cara Delevingne bad acting. the second half when our heroes actually start their mission we get to see a good, amusing, funny, Heroic and tragic superhero movie which what we all want. in general the movie was great and thank god we're not gonna see any DC movie with Zack Snyder as its director for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a barely fresh 'Tomato', but fresh nonetheless (READ the review first please!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call it the Rule of Very Low Expectations, but by this rule I had a good time with this movie. It's not the Fantastic Four level disaster you've heard. Is it nihilistic? A little, though not anywhere near some other films this year (not to say it's as good as those, i.e. Deadpool), and the fact that this was green-lit and conceived in the shadow of Guardians of the Galaxy is painfully obvious (i.e. Killer Croc = Groot, more or less). But David Ayer as a director AND writer, coming from a gnarly, south LA cops-and-criminals kind of cinematic background (remember his breakthrough was Training Day), creates his own playground to work in, and though Batman from the Goddamn Synder-verse appears it's really his own making this time - it's a colorful film to look at (not as "artistic" as the other neon film by Refn, but close), and while it's an ensemble it gets two really fantastic actors and anti-hero/villain characters: Deadshot (Will Smith, in the best I've seen him in almost ten years, fully entertaining in his Will Smith but grungier, more cynical, and he is fully acting here and giving it his all even when the script lets him down), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robibie, who I assume was created because she's one of those people the camera just loves, and she loves this character and it shows).They're the driving force here amid a group of motley characters and actors - some better than others, i.e. it was impossible not to think of Jai Courtney, having fun much as he is, as a discount Tom Hardy since he dropped out of the role, and Jay Hernandez who brings a lot to a character that is basically Fire Hulk - and that helps when it becomes clear that when this Squad that's been assembled, with a mostly entertaining series of backstories in the opening act, are put into a fairly generic and problematic plot that climaxes with (uh, spoilers?) the actual homage to Ghostbusters 84 for this summer(!) I think if I looked at the disappointments to have with the film they would be there, like how Cara Delvegine (sic) carries some real screen presence as the villain but she is just another in a long line of comic book movie villains that want to take over/destroy the world for mystifying-stupid reasons, and the Joker is surprisingly completely ancillary to the plot (and Leto makes me pine for Ledger's good but overrated performance as the Joker - like, I really miss him now he's so snarly and ugly and his-heart-isn't-in-this performance). But thinking about the movie some hours after, I find more to like about it than I don't: a lot of it comes down to the potential that is here with these characters and their powers, how they play off of one another, their energy and how they appear (Killer Croc is... NOT a CGI creation, yes, it's possible!) and how sometimes the plot flashbacks work (again with Diablo, the Jay Hernandez character, I felt Ayer coming through the most via his South LA filmmaking roots, and that's a good thing here).So I can nitpick this and it's probably a mixed bag. But I was not actively annoyed or bored - climax the one exception - and it provides its actors some strong moments to shine. It's not actively brooding or trying to be DARK in some hamfisted way that doesn't work. Its flaws are not from some terrible 'moments-driven' vision like a Snyder, nor is it talky-philosophical like a Nolan film. It's as acceptable today as it would be if it had come out circa 2002, which is about right. In other words, it's a decent dark-light refitting of the 'GotG' formula, and it's adequate! In this summer of deathly bombs and other BS that's fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer for the movie definitely portrayed it as an action packed movie. But after watching the movie, I can safely say they really tried to make it live up to the hype. The CGI is really good, but that barely makes up for the flow of the story line. The build up is really slow. The action is spread throughout. I really thought they could have a much better ending. The cast was well-balanced. Leto really played the Joker well considering the amount of screen time he had. He isn't on par with Heath but it was still a terrific performance. Margot's performance was definitely something. She really portrayed Harley Quinn well. Which was definitely surprising. Will on the other was just average. His character Deadshot was definitely an interesting character nevertheless. The lines the characters say are really dull and predictable. There were a few funny one liners but other than that, nothing much really. The critics are really harsh on this film and I can't blame them. I really expected so much more of this film. I hope the sequel will bring much more. Until then Marvel's Avengers are way ahead of DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's summer, it's fun, but it's not a memorable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What is this? Cheerleading tryouts?" DeadshotSuicide Squad is the most recent entry in the summer mayhem action movies, and it's distinctive only in its conceit: Assemble the baddest asses in the world from Louisiana's Belle Rive prison to eradicate even badder ones from somewhere else in the universe. Kind of like making a conscience-deficient dictator next president of the USA. Led by Deadshot (Will Smith), six dead souls, including the randy and dangerous Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), are recruited from lockup by the questionably-ethical government agent, Amanda Walker (Viola Davis). Their mission: Execute a black ops mission and receive clemency. Most sane operatives would not touch this group, much less give them license to kill, but these are desperate times because bad must beat bad as good has gone AWOL.What ensues is full of explosions and innumerable rounds of bullets, and oh, yes, a nice touch of a very sharp sword. If you can wade through the cacophony and carnage, there are a few lines like the one at the head of this essay worth noting and another: "It's taken me some time, but I finally have them. The worst of the worst." (Amanda Walker)I know what you're saying to yourself, can this be the best of the best lines, and I say it's difficult to find better. So focused is director David Ayer on the gymnastics of violence that he forgets crisp dialogue, or at least sardonic talk, such as in Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool, is more lethal than all the munitions you can muster.To show how off-center director and writers are, most of the first hour of the film is dedicated to the presenting the vitae of the six bad heroes. Then, when they finally meet each other, it seems we almost go through the bios we had in the first part of the film.Mostly it makes the dark Batman v Superman look like a birthday party. Even the love affair between Harley and The Joker (Jared Leto) is more like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, so full of over-the-top posing it is. Suicide Squad's squandering will make you remember the forgettable Fantastic Four. Yep, that boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews for any DC movie despite being a DC super fan but PLEASE PLEASE go watch the movie without any negative perception from reading the negative reviews.In short Suicide Squad was an experimental film to commence their new franchise, lets be honest there were too many characters to give equal opportunity of a screen time but despite what minutes they had on-screen EVERYBODY did a fantastic job!The action sequences were amazing, Margot Robbie absolutely killed it as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto should hereby become the joker for the next DC flicks. I went for the movie reading negative comments and trust me it turned out to be the opposite. Suicide Squad is fun, flaming good and the beginning to something epic for DC fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More questions than answers, don't take this too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a comic book reader so I knew nothing about the Suicide Squad before this movie. This is nowhere as polished as existing Marvel films but it has some of its highlights (though a lot of it already got highlighted in the trailer).The movie started off messy and fragmented. Character introductions were bias with most screen time spent on Will Smith's character Deadshot and Margot Robbie's character Harley Quinn. And then they just quickly glimpsed over Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc. Katana showed up from nowhere, and Slipknot disappeared as quickly as he appeared. You can say Suicide Squad is a pretty unmemorable squad featuring only two stars, Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Despite the movie's effort in putting more explanation into Deadshot and Harley Quinn's backstories...I feel I still don't really understand who Harley Quinn really is. And Cara Delevingne's character Enchantress. Who is she really? What's her true motivation? Nothing is developed with that character. Cara is fitting for the emotionless scary bad witch role, but her mean eyebrows ruined her distressed girl act as Dr. June Moone. And then there's the plot. The way they set up the plot in the beginning was incomplete due to poor transitions and explanations. The idea of Waller getting the approval to assemble the Squad by showing off Enchantress' magical powers seemed so stupid...it looked like the screenwriters took an easy way out to move along the plot. How the "villains" got defeated in the end seemed really stupid too. The movie is basically saying that all-powerful 4000 years old magical beings (Enchantress and Incubus) were defeated by a bomb and a heart that was easily stolen. There was so much more potential to these characters than what was shown.The movie found more coherence once the Squad found its purpose with the rescue mission and wasn't interrupted by random backstory interjections. But the questionable plot left me with still more questions than answers: How come Waller just popped up again with no scratches or battle scars? What happened to the little army of mutants created by the witch before their final scene of defeat? What is Diablo??! Is he non-human because I was pretty surprised when he just suddenly turned into a giant and fire monster. Where was his backstory? The lack of explanation or character development made it really hard for me to care about them when they die. Now some positives that stuck with me: - There were some amazing performances by Leto as Joker, Robbie as Harley Quinn, and Smith as Deadshot. Harlely Quinn had some good action sequences - The humour was pretty good. (Inconsistent but still good). - Sick soundtrackVerdict: Still a no brainer fun action movie to watch if you don't hold yourselves too seriously over its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to the hype but still pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in no way an amazing film but it's still alright. I enjoyed the characters ultimately because they all had something going for them. Most of the importance is given to Deadshot and Harley Quinn. I enjoyed Leto's Joker, I think it gives the iconic villain a new face whilst maintaining some important things that make the joker who he really is. However he isn't in this movie as much as all of us expected. If you've seen the trailers you've seen about 70% of his scenes. The movie struggled with its story slightly. It had a basic storyline but some subplots didn't make much sense. The action sequences are very good however at times it is a huge cgi-fest, take that however you will. I would've liked the villain or antagonist in this movie to have be a bit better to be honest.All in all this movie has some awesome moments and funny scenes. Those parts were very enjoyable whilst other scenes disappointed me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for what was given</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler Free*Have to start by giving credit to Viola Davis, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. The poor direction and dialogue given by Ayer is clear, faults which could have been solved during writing or could have been overlooked if it wasn't for the embarrassing editing. Nevertheless, these four actors did they're best with what they were given. There is no doubt in my mind that Viola Davis stole the show for me. Although there were times where her lines seemed corny and lacked the class portrayed by Ms. Davis, her delivery was solid and she was the closest thing to the comic figure that we could have hoped for. Will Smith again showed everyone why he is such a successful actor, strong presence and ability to lead the cast was evident. However, his character plot let him down. Will Smith seemed to be playing Will Smith, not deadshot. There was the witty commentary and one-liners, which we have come to know with Will Smith, but his character did not develop and did not ever push any boundaries to showcase Will's diversity. I expected Margot Robbie to steal the show, but she simply wasn't given her opportunity to.Some of her dialogue,was again,corny. The adverts portrayed her as this strong woman, but quite frankly, she is just depicted as some eye candy and had no real depth to her character. Her accent changed constantly throughout the film and some fight sequences seemed forced.With proper direction from Ayer,Margot Robbie would have been outstanding.My final favorite was Jared Leto's Joker. Although it seemed like he was put into the plot just to have him in the movie, the little that was shown of the Joker was definitely impressive. I was team Ledger, I was not looking forward to the new 'gangster joker,' but overall I was quite impressed for the screen time he was given.Perhaps it was slight weakness' in his performance which caused for so many of Leto's scenes to be cut, but from what I had been shown it was clear that he had put an immense effort into his portrayal. I can't say he was better than Heath Ledger, his character still lacks something which maybe could have been resurrected if he was given the chance, but Leto did a great job in showing his insanity and,in my screening at least, he genuinely made the audience uncomfortable by his actions. It wasn't overdone and it wasn't like anything which had been done before, Leto's intimidating persona was intriguing and sinister.It's a shame that Leto's interpretation clashed with Ayer's. This is the Joker which should have been shown in all his brief appearances, but shout out to David Ayer for forcing Joker,and Harley, to be half of that attached high school couple who couldn't be apart. Jared's commitment and work for being a tortured maniac was pushed to the side for some HarleyxJoker cuteness which wasn't that necessary. The rest of the cast really had no relevance to the story line. The plot was poorly executed and had some stupid mistakes when portraying the villain. I wondered why they even bothered which such a large team as they had no impact on the story or the audience. The only other characters who had some interest to me were Jai Courtney, who provided a comical quality to distract from the plot holes, and Ike Barinholtz, who seemed to derive a stronger performance from those he worked with. Overalll, it wasn't terrible. The cast has such promise but was let down by Ayer's careless editing and use of inappropriate song placement. It's as if Ayer decided lets let the music speak instead of the dialogue (which was fine at times but after awhile we all wished that they would cut off the music). If they had slowed down the film progression, given the characters some depth and actually shown what was in the trailers, then this movie would have been the film of the year. Let's all just hope the extended cut is released and does the cast justice for their efforts. I also hope that Jared Leto and Margot Robbie are picked up for a spin off movie that does justice to their comic book characters and own abilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven but memorable "superhero" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, i'm a big pessimist when it comes to movies, but i went in to Suicide Squad with high hopes and to be honest, I wasn't all too disappointed. The film opens with a colorful presentation of all the main characters, both the good guys and the bad. From Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn to Killer Croc, all were given a brief but satisfying introduction. Speaking of Margot Robbie, she was one of the characters I was a bit worried about. I thought she would be portrayed as a "goofy" and "not like other girls" type, but Margot Robbie nailed it, Harley Quinn is a completely insane and psychopathic girl with a glimpse of sanity and sympathy which makes her very likable. Also likable is this incarnation of Deadshot. Will Smith plays, by far, the most sympathetic character. One scene in particular shows this when he is forced to shoot down Harley Quinn when she's trying to escape but accidentally "misses". There were times, though, when he seemed to feel a bit too sorry for himself, but that's only a minor problem. By far the main attraction is, of course, The Joker. The number one reason for many people to see this movie and I can with certainty confirm that he delivers. And does so with style. Out of all the different Jokers through the decades, this is the only one I can actually say scared me. Jared Leto portrays him as a absolute lunatic with no sympathy for human lives. Cesar Romero's Joker was nothing but a prankster, Jack Nicholson's was a mere gangster with a few jokes here and there and Heath Ledger's was, as with Leto's, a psychopath. But Ledger's incarnation had a plan and ideas. The Joker in Suicide Squad is just completely mad. Mad and eerie. When he was crashing along with the helicopter to his supposed "death" I got worried. Of course I knew he was coming back, it's the Joker after all, but at the same time i didn't know if he was coming back, after all, Slipknot died only moments after being introduced. The fact that I cared so much about a psychopath is a great sign of character development done right. The rest of the character were also well written, but uneven. Captain Boomerang just didn't really fit in. El Diablo didn't have nearly enough screen-time and Killer Croc, well, he wasn't really too memorable. Katana was pretty cool, though. The "good" guys; somehow they are more unlikable than the main cast of bad guys. This was probably David Ayers plan, but not with Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman. I'll admit, I liked him more near the end but for the majority of the film he came of as a whiny sphincter whose only interest was to save his lover. Now, to end this ego-trip of a review, I just want to point out my main complaint: Suicide Squad is ridiculously uneven. As stated before, the intro is great, but from there it's only downhill. As if from nowhere a main villain appears, Enchantress and her brother who want's to enslave humanity and then, suddenly, the main characters have to save a mysterious person. All of this just seem to happen in the blink of an eye. Then, when this has happened, the movie gets lost and doesn't know what to do with itself, so, again, out of nowhere the "suicide squad" has to save the world, which they eventually do and to me that just seems unrealistic for these characters. Harley Quinn herself points it out: What did the world ever do to us?" Why would a cast of villains suddenly get a change of heart and save the world AND feel good about it?So to conclude: An uneven mess of a "superhero" movie, but driven by (mostly) likable characters. I recommend it despite its flaws because it really has its moments, like the Batman cameos and every Joker moment, and an amazing soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyless action scenes and uninteresting characters as destroying what could have been an excellent action comedy . This here is not good enough in 2016Unfortunately comprises the entire first hour of verbal cockfight to emphasize how tough everyone is , they play certainly not following any rules , they are real men ( even the women ) . A better film could have let the insults bounce between the figures and give the dialogue momentum, and then turn on the conflicts and build cohesion. Now everything hangs freely. No call leads to another.In fact, when the great supernatural threat would emerge the actors to change lines with each other , or play completely different super villains , but the story would be significantly affected. Get things done based on the characters, they just happen . It actually is character -driven foundation laid in flashbacks dripping with sentimentality. Why should we care about group dynamics and drama as the characters themselves do not? Not even entertainment violence is something up to much . The action scenes are trimmed in joyless 2010 's of ways: fast and confusing, with no sense of time , place or choreography.The only thing that holds together the film is Will Smith and Margot Robbie . Robbie is , in the worst comic book spirit of sexuality but she seems to have fun when she wields his baseball bat and hatch one- liners . Smith has a generic Will Smith 's role , with generic motivation - he wants to prove to his daughter that he was not only a murderer , but may be OK . Fortunately , he has enough charisma to sell it." Suicide Squad " could have been action-comedy that saved the DC Comics movie universe from his own lack of humor. So it was not . It is not enough to dull dialogue and environments they bought when there was a sale on broken cities of the backdrop shop. It is this kind of films that gives nonsense bad reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was it as Awesome as the Trailer made it to be!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I had huge expectations from this movie because the trailer was one of the best trailers I've ever seen. I was eager to see what the new Joker played by Jared Leto would be like and could he come near or even surpass Heath Ledgers Joker? Come back to that later? I will give it to you straight, I left the screening very disappointed? The movie falls flat and there is so much wrong that you feel betrayed almost. The story is poor and doesn't tell much at all, you get to know some things about the characters past and what they did to end up in jail, but that's about it. The "Squad" don't know one another until they assembles and they have their first mission ever and just like that these "super villains" just becomes like family after just one day!? (I mean they literally say that?) one of them even compare them to his wife and kids, after one day!? Super Villains!? It goes from one scene to another and nothing important happens, many of the jokes and cool scenes that were in the trailer doesn't at all feels as cool as in the trailer or as funny. And what I was most looking forward too seeing isn't even in the movie as much as the trailer kind of was telling us he would be, I'm talking about the Joker? What you get to see of him looks cool but you never really get to see the characters full work, there is so much left too see and that you want to know about him. He doesn't feel complete at all and it's sad because he had SO MUCH potential! It's clear that we will see him again but I really feel that they should have used him more in this movie. The scene with the line "I Can't wait to show you my Toys!" was even CUT out from the movie! Why!? Some of the scenes were cool but many seemed to prepared and weren't played naturally by some actors, unfortunately one of them was Joel Kinnaman (our Swedish star) that honestly wasn't that believable as Rick Flag. However there still was some good things and the best of it was the Soundtrack! Amazing music trough out the whole movie. Margot Robbie who played Harley Quinn also did an amazing portrayal of the villain and stood out most from the performances of the Squad. Will Smith and Jared were good too. Overall, it was mediocre, I really feel this movie could have been SO much better and it doesn't do the trailer justice. It's not near epic but it has some entertaining moments, not at all a good story but a few good performances? blend that in together and you get something? okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most over-hyped and disappointing film of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the critics were right all along about Suicide Squad. In fact, the 40+ rating on metacritic is a little bit generous. Batman vs Superman is better and that movie was mediocre at best. The first half of the film was really messy due to the weird pace and despite the character flashbacks, the characters never connected with me. The only ones that stood out are Amanda Waller and Harley Quinn. I can't say much about the Joker because he only had a cameo role (about 6-8mins. Of screen time), Jared's cackle is creepy though. As for the real villains of the movie, I would say that they were very underwhelming. Their introduction was very haphazardly done and I couldn't care less about what they are capable of.For the jokes, most of them felt forced. Only some of the jokes made me smile a bit and this aspect of the movie isn't even the worst part, the final act of the movie is. The climax is really cringeworthy and can be compared to the martha scene in BvS (in terms of cringe level).So overall, the film was really a big disappointment for me considering how obsessed I was with the marketing stage of this movie. It was all hype in the end and I feel bad for DCEU. Maybe Wonder Woman is DC's final hope or perhaps another Batman trilogy set in Arkham. This is really a bad streak for DC and it would be tough to recover from this. It would still rake in money but the future is dim.I'm not a professional critic but I would still give it a score for those who are obsessed with numbers. 4/10 at best.</fullReview>

I can see the similarity with the Nicholson version, not in terms of character but the background. both seems like having a background as a mafia ? but Nicholson a little bit classy, while Jared letto is the thug look one. I do like diablo, he's kinda preachy but the look and power looks awesome. crocs is funny. oh my God the enchantress, she have cool looks ( the dark skinned one, not the bright and beauty, i feel really strange and cringe seeing a pretty enchantress as villain ) yet the climax is horrible. most enjoyable scene ? watching 10 second flash capture boomerang, that flash looks really cool.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC on life support</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. I really did. The trailers and advertising was so good that it was impossible to not feel some hype. I'm also a big DC universe fan and really wanted to see them finally find some footing. Sadly this movie was a let down. The first act is all one giant spoon fed exposition as we have only a few of the casts backstories jammed down our throats. The rest of them are left one dimensional and they never feel more real than cartoons. A good film doesn't need to spend so much time shoveling out exposition. Look at Guardians Of The Galaxy. That movie just did such a great job creating rich characters, each earning their time on screen, who's chemistry with each other was electric that you got everything that you needed to know about them.Will Smith is great at playing Will Smith. He's as charismatic as ever and definitely adds some fun moments. However he is NOT Deadshot and portrays the character far more as a redeemable hero than he is meant to be. Margot Robbie is every bit as good as we all hoped. She's one of the few things that the movie totally delivers on. Jared Leto as Joker ... where oh where did you go wrong? This is the first cinematic version of the character that falls flat. He brings nothing memorable or interesting to the character. With how much he was hyped, with his method acting and claims about how terrifying he was on set, I definitely expected more. True his screen time is minimal but the second you saw the other Jokers that's all you needed to know that they were iconic. This Joker just wasn't. I mean he wasn't bad but he fell into that just barely serviceable category which is extra disappointing in a way. I expected so much more from him and now I'm very unenthusiastic of him appearing in future films. Jai Courtney is fun but under used. I kept forgetting that Killer Croc was in this movie. The rest of the cast does OK with what little they have. The threat in the film is way too supernatural and cartoony to fit the gritty dark world surrounding it. It's amazing how many possibilities they could have taken with villains and that this was the best they could do is pretty baffling. The action has it's moments but is also pretty repetitive at times. Sure there was some key moments that I enjoyed. It's just as a whole the movie was a let down. The cameos were fun I guess. The music was solid but the movie some times felt like a giant advertisement to buy the soundtrack with how often songs were forced in. All in all it's just another brick in the wall. Uninspired and unmemorable. It's not going to do much to help establish the DCEU. They really need Wonder Woman to be something special to pull this series out of this state of just being "OK". They need to be great next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so utterly boring. We all know we went to see Harley Quinn being super sexy gratious shots of her behind in spandex. She is only in a few flashes. Otherise she is merely your borderline girl next door going through post-puberty and another white knight.The dialogues are so bad you will be in awe. For example: alligator man uses phrases as "bro". But he has been in the sewer forever and only gets cable AFTER the whole ordeal. The dialogues are written for boys aged 8-10. And not to recreated the Gotham universe.Also, the joker. Who is this guy ? He looks like a young Marily Manson. But then, what a way to rape the legendary performances of those Jokers before... The whole movie seems to want to be "Heroes of the galaxy", you get a sense with the animations and the music that is what they were going for. But at no point the movie matches the same feeling maybe even A- team like during the introduction. But it wont generate the same enthusiasm at any point as the latter.I really hoped the movie would pick up and redeem itself. It never did. It never reached excitement above "meh". Even with the graphics, there is just so much going on and then, not much going on at the same time you check out altogether. It's not worth your money at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUICIDE SQUAD - My plan for today was to watch two back to back movies , but watching SUICIDE SQUAD made me so much exhausted that i canceled my plan for the second film. And by exhausted i didn't mean by tiredness but by frustration. Things are not working for DC universe. Its all started really well with MAN OF STEEL , but DAWN OF JUSTICE disappointed and same goes for suicide squad. David AYER as director didn't faulted but as a writer he did a bad job. He has done some good writing before(FURY , END OF WATCH,U-571,TRAINING DAY) but he has done some bad writing too (2nd part of fast and furious series , yes the worst one and SABOTAGE , one of the worst movies having ARNOLD as hero). SUICIDE SQUAD fall in the 2nd category.SUICIDE SQUAD is a very limited movie as long as we talk about its scope. Let me tell you the story(obviously in brief and only that part which already have been showed in 4 trailers of this movie). A team of bad villains has been organized. A good half an hour has been spent on their introduction using some colorful visuals. Then one of those recruit ENCHANTRESS goes bad and want to destroy the world. So our team land on the city where this villain making some machine (which the movie never explain that what will it do if made completely) to extinct the human race. Then they fight and they win , and the story ends. SHOCKING RIGHT! i know , but that's the truth. There was no plot , its just the intro , then some comic moment and then the mission. O yes i forgot , there were some back stories too to make us connected to the characters , but non of it worked. Think of this, the movie first promoted itself as a group of bad people come together to do something good , then the movie tries to justifies that those people are not actually bad , but just the victim of bad situation, i mean how does this work does anybody think of that. Why cant they create some GREY characters who have conflicted hidden motives , why they have to show villain as good persons. It doesn't make sense. More then half of the movie is the mission they have been appointed for , that could also have been a nice entertaining movie , only if we have got some exceptional action sequences , but the movie lacks that too. Its just gunshot , some punches , some baseball bat shots and yes some fire (which is among the good visuals). A time when MARVEL movies are making us stun with fast martial arts and chasing sequences , DC universe is still stuck with old slow motion style action. I mean at the climax one of our hero throws a bomb towards the villain , and that bomb literally took almost 30 second too reach the villain. The selection of villain was bad too. Non of our heroes have superpower except DIABLO who had the ability to generate fire. And they still gavecompetition to a 6000 years old witch with exceptional superpowers. Imagine VOLDEMORT defeated by gunshot and rocket launchers of BATMAN , it literally felt like that. It was actually a shame for ENCHANTRESS to get defeated by SUICIDE SQUAD. We get two very small scenes of BATMAN. And those two scenes along with JUSTICE LEAGUE trailer make me realize that m actually in that state where i can get rid of the thing that Christian BALe is the best BATMAN , and i actually started liking Ben Afflecks. But same cant be said abound THE JOKER. He was a really small part of this movie. Not even a part of main plot, just as a side villain who comes and go in between the main plot. I didn't like this version of JOKER. Not at least in this small role. The humor word well . But cant say same about all the dialogues. take this as an example - A 6000 years old witch say to one of our Hero when he trying to kill her - YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BALLS TO DO IT. Really? Is that the way a witch must talk. Action scenes although didn't worked well but the visuals are good. But the darkness of the night scenes ruined it too. Bad cinematography. Which was disappointing because i was kind of liking the 3D at first. As i said the humor worked ,so at least the first half didn't bore. But the lack of any exceptional set piece bore you in the 2nd half. I don't even know how this story-line is gonna be connected to the main JUSTICE LEAGUE story-line. After watching this the whole DC universe seems so unplanned to me. WARNER BROS needs to do some serious thinking on it. 6.3/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lot of style, but no substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide Squad is a train-wreck. Let's just get that out of the way right now. Jared Leto's Joker was teased heavily in all the trailers, posters, magazine ads, and TV spots, but he makes an astonishingly short (and pointless) appearance in the movie, only appearing a handful of times for a combined total of probably less than 7 minutes. Though that's probably for the better - Leto's Joker is less a theatrical, serial-killer mastermind and more of a general psychopath with a gun and a grating laugh. Harley Quinn's relationship with Joker is practically nonexistent in this movie - they touch on a few key cornerstones of what people know from the comics or animated shows, but not in any detail and not for long enough for anyone to take it seriously. The whole draw of Harley Quinn's character is that she used to be a respectable, well-meaning doctor before Joker twisted her into what she becomes, but in this movie, they make her out to basically be a lovesick puppy with no brain whatsoever. She basically exists in this movie to be the slapstick comic relief. Will Smith is great - but he doesn't bring anything to playing Deadshot, except to make him into another typically Will Smith "I'm cocky and I mouth off" persona. The plot goes absolutely nowhere. For a good 20 minutes of this movie, nothing is shown but a series of music montages. The rest of the movie seems pieced together from scenes that seem like they were shot only to be placed in the trailer. (It's a fantastic trailer, to be fair.) Whole lot of style, not a lot of substance, and just like the villain of this story, the Suicide Squad movie lacks heart - and that's why it's getting the reviews it has been. There are a ton of "wow, cool" shots and scenes in this - like June Moon's first transformation into Enchantress or Killer Croc's eyes gleaming from the darkness of his cell - but they're nothing more than a bit of flair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over Substance The Movie !! SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying that I in no way automatically condemn big budget/superhero movies. I'm not a snob. I love them when they are good. See my other reviews especially the one for Batman V Superman. Why this does not work in my opinion: -Jerod Leto's Joker. The emotional conveyance is stilted at best and the performance is gussied up with CG visual effects and loud sounds effects to distract you from this fact. This is especially present in the club scene. The juxtaposition between this joker and the Joker (and themes surrounding) played by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight is definitely something to ponder. Ledgers can be summed up with a freeze frame of him burning the mound of money (anti capitalism/anarchy). Letos can be summed up by the amount of gold chains and 'Bling' he is wearing I'll let you work out the contrast duh. Comparing these two performances and your preference for either could be the acid test to see whether an individual can see 'the truth' in art. Ledgers performance was gritty and visceral the actor was truly immersed in the madness flailing about in front of the camera with real furry and REAL EMOTIONAL CONTENT. CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE? All I can see in Letos is Artifice incarnate. Someone mentioned on another site/review how Letos reminded them of the store Hot Topic you see in virtually any mall everywhere. It's fake taste and style for a premium price instead of actually developing your own style and taste you just walk in chose "who" you are. Just look at the "Damaged" tattoo on his forehead. It's like instead of actually developing depth of character you just write it on the actors forehead and call cut. Print. Wheres my money. I will say I would definitely not want to be the person to follow ledger in that role and think that character should have been retired with him. RIP-Amanda Waller kills like five FBI agents like nothing because "they didn't have clearance" and its supposed to be OK because the "State is always right" even when they are wrong. Pretty funny because the whole suicide squad is in prison for similar reasons but its OK because she works for a government entity. (This horrible theme is sort of halfway undone during the credits scene where Bruce Wayne makes his distaste with her methods known. Meaning there could be a future counterpoint to this somewhat subtle exorcise in subliminal programming. Let's hope that's the case)-The Cliché dialogue. Yes this is a given with all superhero movies but Will Smiths was a bit toooooo much so and as others have said could have been lines taken directly from other movies he's been in.-I like seeing Margo Robbies ass just as much as anyone else. But There were sooooo many sexy walking away shots were your eyes can't help but land on her perfect butt. I sort of have mixed feelings about this qualm. lolStandard Summer Throw away Big Budget throwaway Popcorn Stuff here. I did enjoy the CG during the credits though. That's one of the cooler pure CG 3d effects I've seen sooooo much depth it was cool. I give it 3 bags of popcorn 1 cans of soda and 1 movie theater hot dog because like this movie it sorta tastes good while your eating it but immediately after you start to feel guilty for having consumed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sits somewhere between good and really bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with rather high expectations, I was one of the peoples who appreciated BatmanVSuperman and felt it could boost DC into a good string of action films. Suicide squad was one of the movies first in line to this new-found momentum and it started out amazingly well. The opening is designed masterfully and you can see the effort put in to instantly grab the attention of the fans.Unfortunately, after that, everything falls flat on their face. Most of the side characters feel out of place and go through no real development. Which is a real shame because in terms of performance Margot Robbie really knocked it out of the park and Jared Leto held his own. If there was more consistent character development across the board and fewer plot holes coupled with a better story, then this could have been a movie many would love. The direction from David Ayer also deserves a fair amount of criticism as well as the camera work in any scene that does not sport action. Expect this to be very similar to BVS in terms of box office numbers but the opposite in slow appreciation. A decent flick that could have been way better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and Nicholas (The Autistic Reviewers) had been looking forward to this film all year. it was all over our facebook page and we had been nonstop talking about it. While Nicholas loved this film, here's my review of Suicide Squad: We all know the plot. A group of bad guys/crazy people are locked in Asylum. They have all been assigned to bring down the biggest threat yet: a witch destroying the city. Yeah, you heard correctly. Pretty stupid, right? While I did not care for the villain Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), I definitely liked a lot of the super hero/bad guys. Will Smith as Deadshot stole the show. He carried almost the whole film. His humor, his charm and his badass moves and shots were awesome. Jai Courtney as Boomerang was a great choice. He has several funny scenes. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was just great! She also stole the show. Her craziness and the fact that she has no fear was just pure genius! She was the first Harley Quinn to have ever been brought to life and she did a great job.The first half of the story is just introducing all of the characters one by one and their history. Problem is that it drags on and it gets old rather quickly, and it takes a while to get to the actual story. And by the time it gets to the end, you just don't care for Enchantress for a villain. At least, i didn't! I thought she was pointless and dull. They needed a better villain, or even better...a a better story.Now let's get to the main point: The Joker! Jared Leto was awesome. He does not imitate Nicholson or Ledger. He made his own Joker. He made the feel of it a little cartoony, but that's okay. Here's the problem: He only gets 13 mins and 39 secs of screen time (Yes, I timed it), and his background and his love for Harley Quinn is never explained. They just threw him in there real quickly with no background story, no reason for his love for Harley Quinn, no purpose and just not enough screen time. With Ledger and Nicholson's jokers, they were both properly explained and everything they did had a psychological reason as to why they had this idea/thought. There were posters all over the world of Leto's Joker and they really made out he was the main purpose of this film, but he wasn't. It's not a good way to introduce Jared Leto as the new joker by giving him 13 mins of screen time and with nothing to do. I really do hope Leto stays as the Joker, because his performance was great and he needs to be properly explained.All in all, Suicide Squad is worth watching, and if you jut bring your popcorn and drink it should be a good ride! 6/10 2.5/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but poor story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thought I had as soon as the movie was over was: a lot of flesh and no bones.The acting is great, Margot Robbie is perfect and way out of reach of all the others, Will Smith being Will Smith is good, and Leto had the guts of bringing to us a new Joker (not better than others, just different). The soundtrack is really good. There are some jokes that cracked the theater. I liked the action scenes.All of this is what I call "Flesh".What is missing (the "bones") is a solid story, in a movie where the main characters are bad guys you need a really good antagonist and the movie fails in that. The movie spends the first part to introduce the characters and jumps directly to the main plot, that is so weak to be confused to a warm up mission. I didn't feel any tension, nor the movie made me care about what was happening on the screen. Yes, great characters, funny, but without a story to support them the risk to be a pointless movie, another expensive set up for the Justice League, is real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this review, like Harley Quinn, sums up Suicide Squad. Broken down in parts, Suicide Squad opens with a bang, meanders in the middle with the urgency of a root canal, and closes with another bang. The only problem with the closing bang is it comes in the form of one of Joker's gag guns. (Don't worry that's not a spoiler, just a metaphor.)The film gets quite a bit right in the backstory of the major characters, particularly Deadshot and Harley. These two characters, along with Diablo, are a strength of the movie throughout development-wise, played by Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandez. A problem with the other characters, save for a few Boomerang jokes, is their utility; at times they aren't given much to do and they seem like mere tagalongs without their own agency.Much will be made of Jared Leto's Joker, and I believe he does an OK job. At times he reminds me too much of the mob bosses in the comics he works so hard to upend, but Leto is a great actor and I think he will have much to add in future installments. I think one problem with him is that he was marketed so heavily, when the concentration on the plot should be on the Squad.Speaking of the plot...another weakness. I can't say I cared much for Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) rationale for having a bunch of crackpots lead a demolition squad, and the results are pretty predictable. The middle of the film is a bit awkward as far as team chemistry goes, even among Deadshot and Harley. Just when the film comes close to saying something profound, it reverts back to oddly-times jokes and head nods.In the end, this is probably DC's best attempt in the Extended Universe at something original and in general, even though it ends rather predictably. (A quick side note here is that I'm talking about original theatrical releases, since BvS Uncut is ultimately superior to this and I have reviewed that also.)2.5 out of 4 stars sounds about right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbiased and spoiler-free review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an early screening of Suicide Squad, so here is an unbiased review of that film. A little tired of these punk critics using SS to diss BVS and MOS which were actually good films, anyway?I like my reviews short and sweet but to the point, but had to extend this one a bit?. Action: The action was average and entertaining at parts but most of the characters where underutilized and we didn't get to see them inaction much to really get the idea of how dangerous they were. Dead Shot and Harley had the best action sequences between the squad. Croc would come in 3rd but there wasn't any real standout action sequences. There was one with Diablo that was unexpected and cool, but he only really shined that one time when they could have used him and other characters in cool ways because of their powers and skills, but it was mostly average. Acting: There really wasn't much issue here because everyone played their parts well and strong emotion wasn't really needed since this was mostly aimed to be a fun action flick. Will Smith did his typical stand up which didn't hinder his action since we are used to this. Leto was great as the Joker but his acting was wasted since his character really had no depth or point the central plot. Joel Kinnaman did a good job as the leader of the squad and Margot was pretty much consistent with what we got from the Trailers and did a great job as Harley. Cara Delevingne had a bigger role than the trailer lead us to believe and she played her part well. Again, the acting wasn't the issue with this film, everyone played their parts, though Croc's dialog was hard to understand at times. Story: The story was very simplistic and not well put together. The screenplay was bad on some scenes did not flow perfectly from scene to scene and happened so fast it was hard to grasp or attach or relate to what was happening within the story at that time. In my opinion the story would have been better in a different sequence, so it's not necessarily a bad story, it was just was executed poorly. I understood what Ayer attempted, but it didn't work or mesh together well at all.Bottom line: I believe this movie was a failure mainly because of the Directing and choices made with the screenplay. Ayer and Kinnaman have both publicly denied that humor was added later but some of the jokes were so out of place and not funny it was just a waste of screen time(especially the unicorn thing). We could have used this time to get more action from the characters and a full sequence of why they were so dangerous and what skills they had. The movie felt so rushed and like scenes were missing that would make sense of some questions that we have. There were scenes from the trailers that were missing and you could definitely tell they were missing pieces from this film. The bonds between the characters were absent and undeveloped though this was a 2hr film? They considered each other "friends" but there was no rhyme or reason as to why they felt this way and there wasn't a common ground to bring these criminals together in this film because they were all solo acts, so Ayer failed to write a good reason for us to care for them or simply explain why they felt this way. This was important because it created two plot holes based on a decision DeadShot made and one that Harley made that didn't make sense because it wasn't explained why they would do what they did, the connection was completely missing! Last, the Joker was completely underutilized and had no intelligent purpose to the central story or even a side story. Did he have to be the main attraction? No, but Ayer failed to give him purpose and we couldn't connect with the character and get the full grasp of how good Leto did with Joker. He prob would have worked better only in Harley's flash backs and to explain how she got in the position to be in the squad, then maybe a bigger role in a later film. I could go further with the errors made in this film but spoilers would pursue...so with a rushed story, bad screenplay sequence and humor choices, the directing was mediocre and caused this movie to lose value, and held back its potential. I think a cast this big and with all the personalities of the characters, Ayer didn't know how to piece this together at a good pace. Films like Harsh Times, End of Watch, Fury were decent films, but he was in way over his head with SS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't expected much for Suicide Squad despite the trailer quite promising. As I finished watching this movie today, I can conclude that this movie just plain and simple. This is a movie that you watch on your plasma TV at home while studying, doing paperwork, or scrolling down your Facebook news feed and Instagram.This movie has so many awkward and dull moments. All of the casts actually delivered good performance, but they couldn't do much with story and script like this. Except for Cara Delevigne, I dare to say she's done a terrible, stupid acting. And about David Ayer, he actually is a talented director, but appointed him as a writer for Suicide Squad was a gravely mistake.Just go watch it at cinema, but maybe most of you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These worst heroes ever make for an entertaining blockbuster ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a solid 12 months of some fairly loud hype, the "worst heroes ever" have finally been unleashed on the anticipating world in a film that in many ways will make or break DC comics plans for blockbuster domination and while David Ayer's much talked about film is not able to live up to all the expectations it has been fairly or unfairly burdened with, it's unquestionable that Suicide Squad is a silly and often deliriously fun thrill ride that will likely have popcorn munching audiences clambering for more.Filled with an array of colourful characters (debatably to many so) and tasked with combining them all together to make a cohesive and structured whole, End of Watch and Fury helmer Ayer struggles with the balancing act in the films opening stand and there's undoubtable teething issues for the film as it try's to introduce us to each member of this new fan-dangled squad of evil doers.The film bares scars of the reshoots and likely studio led editing suite meddling that went on behind the scenes and a raft of the squad's players get short shift and the films plot line barely has time to breathe before we are all of a sudden thrust into yet another big bad trying to destroy the world as we know it, which isn't fantastic as the films central threat and narrative drive isn't all that much chop and feels as though it may've suffered from the creative teams soundtrack shortlisting work rather than story polishing.These shortcomings however are quickly mostly forgotten about as the rag tag group of antiheroes begin to get their individual moments to shine as their mission takes hold and while as expected the film is mostly the Margot Robbie and Will Smith show there's ample joys to be found outside of Harley Quinn (and her uncomfortable looking hot pants) and Deadshot (laboured with one atrociously cheesy flashback sequence) with supports like Jai Courtney's Aussie larrikin Boomerang, Jay Hernandez's fiery Diablo and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's grizzled Killer Croc. The film could've almost doubled these side players on screen time without question, although with Smith and Robbie on such winning form it's easy to see why the film always reverts back to these key players.Suicide Squad's other participants all have varying degrees of success and shortcomings and in one case an hilariously short screen time.Viola Davis's cold and calculated government agent Amanda Waller is someone not to be messed with, while Cara Delevingne proves once more she's a model with great acting potential. It's perhaps surprising then that personally I found Jared Leto's Joker the most curiously hard turn to judge and taking the Heath Ledger factor entirely out of the equation, Leto's 10 to 15 minutes worth of screen time (those expecting the Joker show may be disappointed) as the crazed clown is a performance that will be interesting to see judged once the movie going public has had time to contemplate it, but overall it does feel like the films largest disappointment when it comes to hype verse delivery.It's not that Leto is bad perse, but there's something just not quite right about his grilled up incarnation of the beloved comic book figure although it could be argued that his vision of the killer clown is being harnessed and moulded for more of what's sure to come.Not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination and sometimes a frustratingly inert experience that was in need of a much better plot, big bad and perhaps even more memorable action ticks and pure spectacle, Suicide Squad will be lapped up by audiences around the world and should keep a large portion of its established fan base happy, as there's little denying the films fun factor when our crazy group of antiheroes take centre stage with the cast playing them is clearly having the time of their lives.The worst heroes ever therefore make for some far from boring guilty pleasure good times.3 1/2 downed choppers out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Margot Robbie shines. Rest of the film, not so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*sigh* Two words that describe this film. Missed opportunities.This movie should never have been made for PG-13, but R rating. But because it has been made for kids, this movie, and all that it could have achieved, is a huge wasted opportunity of gigantic proportions. Marvel was also hesitant to make Deadpool with R-rating, but they finally did, and it payed off.I hate all the mistakes DC are making these days. I grew up with batman and superman comics in the 80's and 90's, so it hurts when i see them treat their own material this way.Margot Robbie is the star of this film, she steals all the attention in every scene she is in, and i can not but imagine what she could have done with this character if it was not a movie for kids. A huge contrast to the rest of the cast assemble which has too little to do, and they are to many, so we don't ever get to like or dislike any of them. To top it off, the joker has far to few scenes in this film, which is a shame. Jared Leto plays a solid mad joker.And as i predicted before the movie came out, was that David Ayer would yet again fail. He and Fuqua both, are riding on the success they had with "Training Day", and IMO none of them have directed a good movie since then. Ayer is not a good story teller, he is good at blending action with CGI, which this movie could of had a lot less and rather spend time on the story. His direction, combined with a weak story, and combined with PG-13, disaster happens.And this is a movie that was so hyped as well. This was the one film DC had to do right, to prove they had it in them. The Marvel movie that kind of compare to this is "Guardians of the galaxy". And what Marvel did right was to give all the characters a unique and special personality, making it easier to recognize and care for them, which then made it a good movie. Here in "Suicide squad" we just have an outstanding Margot Robbie with a bunch of "others". Which is a damn shame.I heard before i saw the film that a lot of the Jokers scenes were cut out of the film before the final cut, i haven't read more into it. But The Joker had way to few scenes in this film, maybe the other scenes they had to remove weren't PG-13 friendly.*sigh* Why DC?. WHY?Is it so damn hard to make a R rated movie now and then? With an R rating, this movie would have dared to be as violent as it has to be with this assemble of anti heroes. The Joker can go full ballistic, Harley Quinn can be even more daring, The language even more naughty and provoking. It is all the movie needed to be decent or even good. But DC didn't have the brass balls needed to pull it off.Therefor just a big pile of missed opportunities.4/10 - Very Disappointing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but poor in usual fundamentals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this movie doesn't shine at all in terms of physical aspects, or even other elements that usually constitutes a movie that gets high ratings all around. There isn't much to say about the cinematography, the editing is distracting at times, the plot is second-rate, and more could have been done about the setting. In essence, the movie can objectively be considered as 'shoddy'. But what saves it is its high entertainment value.When it starts, everything goes well. The exposition sets up an anticipation that the next hour and forty minutes are going to be a blast. However, the first act ends and the zany plot begins almost instantly when the conflict and villain are simultaneously revealed. From then on, I still continued to thoroughly enjoy the movie, despite it abounding with flaws and all.The thing is that, to like the movie, you have to accept the silly premise and realize that it's purpose wasn't to become a celebrated film, or even a great blockbuster of the year. It's about a team of assembled "supervillains" taking on a crazy supernatural entity laying waste to the city. The story and pacing make for a refreshingly simple action picture from what we've come to normally expect from most recent movies - including comic book ones - that must always be fixed with some contrived narrative. So you have to sort of dim your brain, in a way. If you look at the movie subjectively, it could be looked at as being "good" akin to certain movies like the 2012 "Dredd" or something (except maybe with worse direction). Now even with that, other problems still affected the final outcome of "Suicide Squad". I felt that the characters needed to be more fleshed out and given depth, rather than having a cast of personalities we don't even know working together. Some characters with the highest potential like Joker, left us ambivalent about him due to his minimal screen time. The build up of the movie could also have used work, as it felt that the climax already started near the beginning without getting our feet wet first with the ensemble of bad guys.It's quite hard to justify why this movie gets a "7" with all these faults, but it mostly comes down to this: you can choose to enjoy it or not, and when you do, it definitely has a certain charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best super villains movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead shot and Harley Quinn are the only characters that played their role fantastically and the rest were awful. The story line made me felt the movie to be very lengthy. The story line have like 3 climax fights. So every time you wanted to get out from your seat, the story line will be telling, no hold down we still got some stuffs to show you.Joker was not impressive enough apart from his deadly laugh. Nothing fancy about the actions sequences as they look very normal. Maybe its because the super power of the villains were not fully utilized. Nothing much remains in heart apart from Harley Quinn. Again, If your fancy dead shot and Harley Quinn it watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Review. No Bias. No Bulls***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I am one of the many fans out there who have been waiting for 18 months now to finally see this flick.I tried, tried then tried some more to not read the reviews yesterday but it was to no avail.Although i always go in fresh my heart sunk at the total negative reviews.NOW Don't THINK "THIS GUY IS MARVEL". I am and have always been DC but this is yet another attempt to make a DC movie using a director that just isn't built for an epic Nolan type filmWe saw a midnight screening last night here in Australia. The first 20 minutes were entertaining in warming you up to the characters however the overuse of songs were a real distraction. Seemed every camera change had another song playing. Unlike Guardians though this soundtrack had no continuity. From 70's disco to 80's rock ballads to white boy rap..... and this was all in the space of 2 minutes!!!As the 2nd act started i thought to myself the movie is rather good however my fears did arrive very quickly.We found ourselves asking each other "did we miss something??".There was no information given to the audience as to where our SS were going and what their goal was. After a drawn out repetitive fight scene we understand the goal once finally told to us.There seemed to be no second act as we realized this film completely skips it and goes straight from act 1 to an act 3 which drags on and on.I cannot understand how a movie with so many executives could allow this to happen with the amount of editing time this film had.I guess they thought "lets just take the audience's money and try and improve on the next one"The plot and story were either not there to begin with or cut out in editing.It was fun but also a little too corny for my liking with only Will and Margot having a few shine moments and the Joker just laughing a lot when i guess Leto couldn't figure out how to act a certain scene.I am re-watching this afternoon to see if i missed anything however from talking to the mates I unfortunately have to agree with most of the critics reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not see what the hate is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie last night and I was actually surprised, pleasantly, to see what was on screen because the reviews have been so shitty; Rotten tomatoes has it at a 27% but Metacritic has it at 51. Anyway, the movie starts off great with Waller introducing the characters via montages and pleads her case the two men. The military is then brought in to hear Waller's plan and when the General says no, Enchantress gets introduced. Waller controls the Enchantress because she possesses the heart of the Enchantress and shows that off when the Enchantress doesn't return to human form by stabbing the heart. General gives Waller the greenlight on Task Force X. After the meeting, in a hotel, Enchantress wakes up Flag and then teleports to Waller to take her heart but Waller has a sensor on it. Enchantress then teleports to Midway City and takes over a stranger in a subway, turning him into her brother AKA the muscle. He wreaks havoc in the subway and molds into a being, looking like a metal pharaoh- like being. The General then sees the mess, via subway camera, and gives the OK to Task Force X. Waller gathers the team together and then they are on their way. A subplot in this is the Joker. The Joker wants Harley back because he misses her. He has a few scenes where he is trying to locate her whereabouts. He gives Ike Barinholtz's Griggs a cell phone to give to Harley to let her know that he's coming for her. To speed up the review, they wind up in Midway City to extract a person of high value from a building and then they are supposed to extract. After losing a lot of soldier to the Enchantress and Slipknot due to Flag killing him, they get the high value target, who winds up being Waller. The extraction chopper comes only to be the Joker and his men. Harley leaves with him but the chopper gets shot down, releasing Harley and having Joker die. Waller gets taken by the brother of Enchantress and they use her brain to attack satellites and ships that are top secret. The squad, after a short bar break to get to know each other better, goes to rescue Waller and Enchantress' human form, June Moon. After Enchantress tries to corrupt their minds with what each member wants in life, featuring a Deadshot killing Batman and Joker n Harley married with kids, Diablo fights the brother and turns into a big, burning entity. After holding him off, Scott Eastwood's character kills himself due to detonating a bomb; this ends up killing Diablo and the Brother. Enchantress has a final battle with the Squad and winds up losing because Harley pretended to join her but ends up slicing her heart out. Deadshot shoots an explosive thrown by Croc and ends the Enchantress. Flag takes the heart and destroys it and Moon comes back.The final scene is to Bo Rhap and shows the squad in prison only to have an explosion cut the music. Men unlock Harley's cage and the Joker reveals himself, ending the movie with "Let's go home". The mid credits scene is Waller asking Bruce Wayne for protection of the media that can incriminate her. Bruce then asks for her end of the deal, which is the top secret files of all the meta-humans. Overall, the movie was a lot of fun. It was cohesive and set up a good side story to the DCEU. Marvel is ahead of the curve thus far, but with good directing and writing, the DCEU MAY have a chance. The action was good, acting was good minus a few cheesy lines, like the Flag to Moon exchange at the end, and we get good characters to continue the DCEU with. As a side review on Leto... while not a big role, like around 10-15 minutes combined, Leto captured a very different Joker. Joker is in love and obsessed with Harley. One of the flashbacks is him asking her if she would live FOR him and she jumps into the acid, devoting herself. He then walks away but goes back to save her. It shows his reluctance at first and then his acceptance. He owned the screen and I was wanting more from him each time he was on the screen. He did a great new take on the Joker. A lot was clearly cut out of his role and I don't know why but I am hoping to see that when the blu-ray comes out. Great job by Leto for capturing a predator-like, obsessive monster. His tats, btw, aren't really standouts so I don't see the issue with that anymore. I liked the look of him and his mannerisms as well. Very comic book like Joker in this flick and the Harley love angle was a nice new take. His role, sadly, was 90% flashbacks but his ending scene when he breaks Harley out sets ups some nice potential movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest DC film since The Dark Knight Rises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's just so amazing. Harley, the Joker, Deadshot, the Enchantress...it's all just so spectacular. The chemistry between the whole Suicide Squad is uncannily amazing. Nearly everything about the movie is absolutely perfect. A fanboy's dream come true. Now don't get me wrong, there are a few things wrong with the movie (Joker's screen time and the pacing of the movie, mostly), but it's just not enough to bring the rating down to a 9. The movie is so much fun even without sacrificing the dark tone that it has. It definitely pushes the PG-13 rating that it has to the absolute limit. Overall, just an amazing film. Definitely recommend it, especially if you liked Guardians of the Galaxy, Batman v Superman, and The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little short of what it could be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I found it started off quite fast, introducing all the characters as briefly as possible, was a task. There was some substance missing in the scenes of the Joker, to begin with. I feel as though there could have been much more dramatic shots of him, it was almost comedic like. However, in the later half of the film I seen Jared Leto shine through with glimpses of his fantastic acting skills. If there is to be a sequel, which is obvious- then I believe they will allow more screen time for the diabolic couple, Harley and Joker. The first thing that struck me was the soundtrack! Instead of instrumental or theme songs, they chose well known classics from different genres to spark interest for the viewer, as first seeing each character, the songs coincided with them. Secondly, you can rest assured that the costume department was not lacking in this film! Every piece was striking and significant of each character. I can almost predict that cosplay lovers are going crazy for the next comic conventions, to show off their replicas from this film. Lots of great props and whimsical items throughout. The overall inclusions of the film are good for any movie lover, as it catered to the bad ass, the sexy, the sad, funny, action, serious and quality actors that make a great essential. The part that fell short, in my opinion, was the plot and the scenes that we have oh so many times seen. Which are 'let's save the city' and the gun action fights in between buildings. There wasn't enough to capture you through those moments, in the cgi department. I did like the variety of all the characters, but at the same time it was hard to enjoy it more, knowing that it was far fetched. I would have liked an in depth on each character and why they had special powers or what have you. My favourite would have to be Diablo, he is super cool for anyone that likes an underdog or not so much of a showy costume character. I have to agree that Margo Robbie was superb in her acting, and the delivery of all her lines were on the mark. The Joker was not in it enough and didn't have solid script to mesmerize, hopefully we see more of him to come. So I would like to say, go see this and enjoy it, but don't expect to be amazed. It's just some bad ass fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries too hard to be 'Avengers (with Bad Guys)'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Preface* I enjoyed Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice immensely, and I feel like the disappointing reception of BvS may have ruined the tone of Suicide Squad. The movie feels too cartoonish in introducing the characters (of which I feel like there were too many) and takes too long as well. The jokes aren't that great and seem like an afterthought. The "Bad" Guys don't feel villainous at all, and feel too non-threatening. The antagonists in the movie start off doing some impressive things but then are sidelined so that we can watch the Suicide Squad tackle zombified people henchmen for reasons? The movie doesn't have enough room to make each suicide squad member interesting. I would have preferred they cut some combination of Katana, Cpt Boomerang, Killer Croc, Rick Flag, and Deadshot's daughter out to make more room for the other characters and more action. Jared Leto and Margot Robie are great and I hope we get more of them. There is one mid-credits scene, and no post credits scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is slow, I agree but it had to be because not everyone has read the comics.All I have to say is that the bad reviews are so, so wrong given the performance of the movie. If you are a 10-year old marvel fan, this one is not for you, however, if you're 15 o over, this is one of the best comic book adopted movies I have seen. It is "Straight Outta Comics" show.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was amazing and Will Smith has mastered Deadshot in the movie.I should say there isn't much about Jared Leto's Joker, given his less than expected screen time, but I liked what I say.Cara Delevingne is quite the biggest gossip diva and I shall admit her acting was up to the mark as well.I'm happy that David Ayer didn't make it a Comedy Circus we know as Captain America : Civil War</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Antithesis of Batman v Superman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that Zack Snyder is credited as an executive producer of Suicide Squad, David Ayer's film is essentially the antithesis of Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Whereas Snyder's film was overstuffed, dragged out, and took itself too seriously, Ayer's film is nearly the polar opposite. Suicide Squad nails the concept of an ensemble cast. Each character is given nearly equal amounts of screen time, and every character is given enough depth in order to stand out and keep the film interesting. Normally comic book adaptations try to cram too many characters into any given film, but Suicide Squad gets it right. Similarly, most comic book adaptations suffer from an extended running time, allowing the film to feel boring and painfully slow at times. However, Suicide Squad is wildly fast-paced and never seems to have a dull moment. A 130-minute running time felt more like 90 minutes. In addition, the film boats a spectacular soundtrack, which really contributes to the fast-paced nature of the film and serves to keep things fun. However, one could argue that the film's fast pace and nonstop action serve to distract viewers from the numerous flaws lurking within the film. Perhaps the biggest difference between Snyder's film and Ayer's film is the fact that Suicide Squad doesn't take itself too seriously. That point is made perfectly clear early on in the film when each character is introduced in quick, flashy montages. With that said, this is a film that doesn't want to be taken too seriously. If you are going to nitpick the film or compare it to previous works, you most likely will walk away unhappy. However, if you do not take the film too seriously then it truly is a fun time. Suicide Squad manages to strike the perfect balance between darkness and lightheartedness, something that previous DC adaptations lacked. While the film benefited from a pretty stellar marketing campaign, the marketing may have been misleading seeing as the Joker doesn't have much of a presence in the film. Nonetheless, this is probably for the best because the Joker was quite possibly the worst aspect of the film. The costume design is just atrocious and turns the Joker into a parody of himself. While Jared Leto provides a satisfyingly menacing performance, the strength of his performance is hindered by his physical appearance. The real showstoppers here are Margot Robbie and Will Smith. While Robbie's performance is likely to face plenty of criticism due to this being the first live- adaptation of Harley Quinn, I truly cannot think of an actress more perfect for the role. She remarkably captures the contrast between Harley Quinn and Harleen Quinzel. Meanwhile, Will Smith steals nearly every scene he's in and his comedic-timing is absolutely effortless. While Suicide Squad may not be perfect, it's refreshing to have a DC adaptation that doesn't take itself too seriously. Suicide Squad is also refreshing for those unhappy with the lack of diversity in comic book adaptations, Will Smith even pointed out during the premiere how diverse the cast is. It's also refreshing to have a film that focuses on the villains, because after a while the hero stories just become repetitive and dull. In a sense, Suicide Squad is DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy ? a fun, action-packed adventure that humanizes the bad guys and features a killer soundtrack. As long as viewers don't overanalyze and nitpick the film, this is guaranteed to be the most fun viewers have at a DC film.</fullReview>

How most people thought Marvel Universe was coming to the end. i myself did not care too much for Captain America 'Civil War.' This movie will set the stage for DC comics when they introduce the likes of "Wonder Woman", "Aquaman," etc. next year. A sleeper no 1 expected. If you remember the "Mod Squad" { 1 black, 1 white lady &amp; 1 white gent } or "21 Jump Street" TV series. We had no racial tensions there and we were not age specific. Then came "Bad Boys" [ Martin Lawrence &amp; Will Smith ] motion picture. FYi: Watch out....'Bad' people. We are comin' to get ya!! :-{{</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC&#x202c; just cannot make a good film. It's extremely sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is not good and extremely campy with the Enchantress as the villain. I believe that the review published in Rolling Stone is the most accurate critique of the movie. Suicide Squad would have been better suited as a "Balls to the Wall" R rated violence and crude language fest. I am not a fan of the mysticism that is central to the menace that unites the Suicide Squad. Quite frankly the use of zombies was clearly employed to dumb down the violence and disembody the use of weapons. What disappoints me most about the film is the unfulfilled promise that is clearly evident by the quality cast. Needless to say this fan was disappointed. Stay for the mid-credits scene if you are a Batman geek like myself. I simply cannot get enough of Batfleck, he is the shining light of the DCEU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected much more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story about secret government agency which recruits the most dangerous and crazy super villains to execute perilous black ops. First the positive things about this motion picture: the acting was good especially Margot Robbie who shines as Harley Quinn; the visual effects and action scenes were well made; soundtrack was also good and there were a few funny scenes. But my dear people that is about all positive from blockbuster from which I expected much more. Now the negatives things: David Ayer the director and writer of this movie did not do a good job, although I mostly like his previous work in this project the script was badly made especially the characterization of main characters; the directing was not impressive also; there were a lot of pathetic and unnecessary scenes, bad dialogues and simply put clichés; the plot was totally unconvincing and predictable. Generally speaking I am a big fan of superhero movies and I wanted to enjoy in this movies at the most, I could not. In my humble opinion, the only way in which this movie could work is that it is created as a parody, similar to Deadpool. Deadpool is much better and it is everything that this movie is not. For my final note this is the most fun bad movie I have ever seen, but from movie of this casting and budget of approximately 175.000.000 $ I expected much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST.... Marketing Campaign EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, please note that I'm fan of of Batman and Superman, they were my childhood heroes! So consequently I'm also into anything that relates with those super heroes. It also drives to go to the premier of Suicide Squad even names like Amanda Weller, Rick Flag, Deadshot, El Diablo, Killer Crock, and Enchantress not so familiar to my ears. Although I'm well acquainted with the Joker and his love interest Harley Quin.But what were really drag me to see the movie was the series of the trailers. The trailers were so intense and so promising that the movie would like the antidote for gloomy and bad reviews. They were so colorful, more bright in tone, and the soundtracks! Oh, they are hell great of the movie soundtracks after (no offense) Guardians of the Galaxy, which I played for almost whole week prior the premier! I couldn't stop repeat to sing "You Don't Own Me..."Now, when it come to the movie, well, I kind of 'yeah, okay, but...' I won't spoil anything but I could tell you this, the movie needs stronger reason to glue those bad guys into a single frame, or should I say they need more evil enemy rather than picking up something or someone that already exist. Well, there! I said it.I felt that David Ayer should set up a problem before they created a solution rather than making up some problem after a solution were already being created. It's just, for me, comical. Even the movie taking the event after the death of Superman, I just felt that they are irrelevantly connected to the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, unless the mid-credit, which to me the true connection to the next DC movie.Now I now that DC or Warner Bros has best marketing team which transform the 'yeah, okay, but...' movie into something 'you-must- see-this' movie. I should raise my glass to that. It's a hard- working process and harder when the movie has no certain point to expose but series of interesting characters but have not-so-much interesting reason to be in the scene.So my advise to all DC fans, please don't expect too much, just enjoy the movie with not setting any goal afterward. It will be better. It's only 123 minutes. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just when you thought the DC movieverse couldn't sink any lower... As Bad As Any Movie I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought the DC movieverse couldn't sink any lower, here comes its dumbest movie yet.Suicide Squad is a film of fits and starts, and way too many flashbacks that kill all narrative momentum just whenever its attempting to come together, underscoring just how ramshackle its editing is. Imagine if you will, the team is about to go face the big bad, and then suddenly, for reasons that are only marginally clear, they all opt to go to the bar instead. In a way, I can see how that might work, given that this is a crew of bad guys; but the scene is so gracelessly plunked in the middle of the third act that I thought perhaps I was having a fever dream, a 15 minute interminable fever dream that ALSO finds the time to include a flashback! Or better yet, there's a moment where the film decides to display what I assume is supposed to be a twist of some kind, or at least it felt that way based on how the scene is written, but it simply flashes back to an earlier moment in the movie that was already explicitly shown to the audience! You can't make this stuff up!There are also quite a few elements in Ayer's script that come across fairly uncomfortably. There are far too many references to hitting women than are necessary, and of course Harley is on display throughout, with Ayer's camera ogling her body at every instance it can. I know many found Lois' bathtub scene in Batman v Superman to be problematic, but this is a bit beyond the pale in terms of objectifying content. Then there is Enchantress, who is displayed in what is best described as a "Slave Leia bikini" and the costume you've seen in promo material is actually the more covered up outfit. As she gains power, she somehow loses more clothing!Between the questionable decisions, and an overstuffed, convoluted structure, is there anything to recommend about Suicide Squad? If so, it begins and ends with Smith, Robbie, and Davis. Smith as Deadshot gets every possible opportunity to display just why he was/is considered one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. His Deadshot is both capable, charming, and is easily the funniest part of the film. It's been reported that some of his dialogue was improvised and given how much uproariously more hilarious his lines were than some of his more stilted "this is funny, right?" counterparts were, I can believe it. Additionally, Robbie is about as perfect a Harley Quinn as you'll find, with just the right amount of irreverence and loopiness, and utilizing her same New York accent that she employed in The Wolf of Wall Street, but finding just enough Arleen Sorken there to make it all her own. She's terrific, as is Viola Davis, who, to put it bluntly, IS Amanda Waller, carrying the exact kind of steely-eyed terrifying, take no bullshit demeanor that you'd come to expect from the character. You couldn't do any better than these three standouts, and even Jai Courtney makes for a pretty strong Digger Harkness (words I NEVER thought I'd say), but the plodding and utterly mindless goings on of the plot fail them completely as the running time rolls on.You'll notice I haven't even made mention of Jared Leto's much discussed grilled and tattooed Joker. I haven't forgotten him, he just barely makes a blip here and probably has about a grand total of 10 minutes of screen time. He's not bad, especially in small doses where his rather over the top shtick would likely begin to grate, but he's also just another distraction that could be plucked from the film entirely and not much would be lost. We'd certainly get less distracting flashbacks that way, but as negatives go on this one, Leto doesn't even crack the top ten (El Diablo and Killer Croc are far more awful, and Croc looks like crap). And surprisingly, the Harley-Joker relationship, though given some confounding backstory for the uninitiated, at least seems somewhat genuine and not so one- sided for once.As bad as any movie released in 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie to watch; DC's attempts to kind of mimic Marvel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this film 4 days ahead of its release at Regal Fenway, Boston (Thanks to Warner Brothers Invitation).This is a fast paced, comic and CGI filled movie. The character introduction is well done. Will Smith, Margot Robbie steal the show. The story is "Assembling a bunch of bad guys against a super villain whose motive is to wipe off the earth". (Story of Avengers 1, Avengers 2, Batman, etc). There is nothing new about the story, but the director David Ayer did a great job introducing the characters and building the story. Poor characterization, some poor dialogues and erratic screenplay are the side effects of a week story line. Except Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Diablo, the other characters seemed to be underdeveloped. The Good: - Jai courney as the Boomerang was a great comic relief and he reminds us of DCs attempts to include comedy in their apparent Dark and gritty films. - Diablo was fun to watch, though some things at the end of the movie regarding this character are un explained. - Great directing within the constrains of the story. - Fantastic lead by Will SmithThe Bad - Poor CGI - Villain(s) with poor motive - Viola Davis' poor characterization - Wrong timing for comedy. - You clearly see the audience and critics making an impact on the film. DC was blamed for being too dark unlike marvel and you can see the screen writers deliberately including funny one liners in un- necessary scenes.Overall, it is a great summer film. If you step into the movie hall with less or zero expectations (like me) you are going to have fun.Special mention about the Joker.Jared Leto: The method actor who underwent a lot of physical and mental training is put down as he gets less screen time to show his skills off. It was reported that Jared Leto shut himself from the world and completely transformed into the role of Joker. Will Smith also admitted he never got to know the real actor behind. That said, you will go to the movies to see all the talent unused and given less screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They made drag queen out of Joker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To sum it up in a few words: Will Smith would be better off in Independence Day. You can be skeptical about any movie if there is too many big characters in it, usually trying to compensate for poor story. And if movie was not pre-released to critics, also raises suspicion. Well, Suicide Squad is as poor as Batman vs Superman. Lack of imagination, poor characters, poor story, very poor action scenes. Without adult/director supervision Will goes towards a man-child which he is in real life. So we have a poorly finished cartoon character instead of main one. Margot Robbie finding role of her life, but then suddenly braking out of characters(pre-madness and after)in one scene. Cara Delevingne acting is just one big Facepalm. The one character that is remotely interesting is the Boomerang fellow. He looked like he was trying to get out of that ridiculous movie, when couldn't - just stood there drinking beer. But worst of all: They made drag queen out of Joker, also Joker is sad most of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only for the die-hard DC comic book fans...barely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin... The film starts off with an introduction to two of the main characters and an intriguing scene that explains the background of each anti-hero.After the promising start, all hell breaks loose... in a bad way.Story and plot coherence are out the window, in comes loud explosions, gun fights and a remarkably limited character development and interaction.Technically, the film looked good, the props and special effects were decent and on par with other hero films, Margot Robbie was beautiful even though she was made to look trashy and crazy.I have a feeling WB instructed the director and writers to ensure Harley Quinn had a lot of scenes and focus, they most likely also mentioned Will Smith and Jared Leto, because no one out of the suicide squad members got any substantial development or attention, minus a couple of forced scenes that failed to create any impact.I enjoy films as a hobby but I also love comic books and its world and characters, so I'm biased and usually give good ratings for comic book films, because I usually judge them as a comic book fan first moreso than a film buff. But I couldn't help but cringe and shake my head several times during this film. The screen play was generally poor, the dialogue lacked substance nor importance or assisted in adding depth to the characters. The story, as mentioned earlier, lacked... and I'm not exaggerating if I say that the story is probably 8th or 9th on the list of "what to focus on" from the film maker. WB and DC might as well have called this film Deadshot or Harley Quinn and it would of been closer to what was presented to the audience.The good?, well seeing the characters from the comic books re-imagined in the DC film universe and I'm struggling to think of any others to be brutally honest.Overall, it is a rung or two below Batman vs Superman and even Man of Steel. This film felt like it was made for the sake of putting Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Will Smith in DC character costumes... and thats it.It's NOT as bad as Green Lantern, but I cannot imagine myself re- watching this again. And thats a big statement since I've watched comic book films over and over with effort. Yes, even the early 2000 Fantastic 4 films.Avoid it if you are interested in watching a "good" action film that has acceptable storyline. But if you are a DC comic book hardcore fan, watch and judge it for yourself, it's your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide Sucks . . . 4 / 10 2 points because Will Smith 2 points because I'm DCThis review is Spoiler Free.Firstly i wanna say, if you start to bad-mouthing your rivals, even before your film premiered, it mean you don't have any confidence in your movie. No wonder they don't reveal much plot in their trailer, coz there's no plot at all. And from all 3 DCEEU movies, this one is the most sucks. They still don't learn from their past mistakes, RUSHING THINGS to coup up with MCU only bring more harm than good.My advice to those who decide to watch this SSucks, leave your brain at the door and enjoy montage of clips after clips, hell, there's no story at all, and for the most infamous DC character, those squad is lack, or should i say have a cheesy character motivation.This movie saving grace is Will Smith, not because he's deadshoot, but because Will Smith acting as Will Smith. And for the Prince of Clown? Don't raise your bar too much. Yes he's terrifying, but the Joker here, is only a montage, don't expect he's doing brilliantly insane Joker like in TDR.And what now WB? releasing the ultimate cut again to milking extra money? well, this is the last time i will saw your movies in theatre, 3 mediocre DCEU movie in a row is just too much.As dark and grim DCEU movies are, the future of DCEU is share the same fate, and i hope is not beyond help</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood please....just stop it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I went to a sort of premier of this film and I found it so bad that I had to share the experience and ask viewers to stop feeding this blockbuster industry, just stop it. All the movies that have come out are just awful. There is no story! But still people pay to watch it, why? If you stop giving money to these people, maybe they'll start hiring new decent writers, directors, producers, editors, production designers, etc.This film had potential, it's a film that could have been great, but it was not because the production companies don't understand that the "big shots" don't know how to make decent films. I bet the shooting of blockbusters is similar to the shooting soap operas, the actor gets there and the director says "now pretend you're sad and say the line". There is no acting.I feel bad for the actors because this is the type of film that can ruin a career.Dear Hollywood, you know why everybody loves Deadpool? Because it was made by "nobodies" that actually understand cinema, "nobodies" that probably get along with the average person and understand him/her.PS: how did someone let a film with 1 Oscar winner and 2 Oscar nominees/should have been winners be so bad?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess. Hear me out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, a quick review and this is just my opinion. This review is not to upset fans or viewers who enjoyed the movie. I could not understand the flow of this film. First of all, it had terrible pacing. You couldn't really get the feel or hang of it, before you know it, someone dies (not saying who) then events breakout into confusing shaky-cam action. It was even a visually confusing film as i struggled to enjoy the CGI. It's 2016 and a film this big, i expected a clean and slick looking movie (like the trailers) and it was the opposite. When it came to the actors of the film. Will smith , Jai Courtney and Viola Davis were standouts to me. I am not implying that the other cast members were bad, their performances were good but only a few popped out on screen. Sadly, it wasn't enough to save the film. I expected too much from Jared Leto. He was NOT terrible but he wasn't a standout to me. He was barely int he film and i didn't really bother caring about his character most of the time in the film. Margot Robbie was just OK. She played a good Harley Quinn but she just didn't do enough for me to engage with her character. A lot of things felt focused around her and it strayed way from better character developments. The pace, cgi, action (all that shaky-cam) and storytelling was pretty messy. I was looking forward to this movie and i sadly could not love it. I really wanted to but i just couldn't enjoy it enough. Overall, a 5/10. It just wasn't enough in all aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the film's numerous faults, Margot Robbie is spot-on as Harley Quinn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a "black site" buried amidst the swamps of Louisiana, the worst of the worst of criminals and evildoers are locked away. This collection of psychopaths are so murderous and irredeemable that - of course - they must surely possess the moral righteousness to work together as a team to stop extraterrestrial terrorists and save the day. Song after song (everything from Grace to Eminem) plays out to introduce each role, though the statistics that dance on screen aren't enough to build a worthwhile backstory. The audience is later subjected to numerous flashbacks to fill in more details (all of which only makes the personas less believable and relatable), as well as that cardinal sin of editing: the flashback to a scene witnessed earlier in the movie. The group of uncontrollable killers consists of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Deadshot (Will Smith), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), each possessing a special skill or a super power - or just martial arts training or great strength.The editing - something along the lines of a music video - is part of what makes this whole adventure so dull. Countless scenes drop off as if excised not for time constraints but for disagreeable content; poses are struck and slow-motion is abused; and sequences build up to punchlines that fizzle out completely or escalate into a chaos of lights and sounds and CG frill. Writer/director David Ayer seems to have crafted a hard R-rated picture, only to have all of the edgier seconds ripped away, leaving unintelligible segues and a sense of goofiness to replace sincerity. "Suicide Squad" isn't nearly as serious as it needed to be, especially if viewers are meant to witness the acts of these crazies in awe; it's mostly clichéd dialogue, meager insults, and action that is too obscured by computer-animated monstrosities."The world changed when Superman flew across the sky," insists Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the human ringleader of the covert assignment - and a reminder that in any superhero movie, the U.S. government is usually the first to pose a threat. Perhaps the worst part of it all is the design of the antagonists, which defies description - and certainly defies definition from the film itself. Meta-human witches and otherworldly entities just don't fit into the universe of Batman; if there was anything even remotely realistic about a caped crimefighter and his maniacal archenemy, this take on the Dark Knight turns everything into over-the-top superpowers duking it out with supernatural gods. The threat of death and the struggle to accomplish a mission hold no weight when magic can be used to do anything - and when characters can die and reappear without any explanations.It's baffling that this movie struggled with its storyline to such a distressing degree. It should have been the simple formula of "Con Air" or "The Dirty Dozen" with Batman's villains. But it wasn't enough just to build an A-Team (or an Expendables battery) of baddies (dubbed Task Force X); the film also had to include a love story with the Joker (Jared Leto), a love story between the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and military man Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), a blackmail scheme, a motivational explosive device implanted in the unwilling draftees' necks (stolen from "Escape from New York"), and a subplot to summon the soul of the Enchantress' dead brother. There are so many unnecessary asides and utterly pointless characters that some are debuted to fulfill a single idea - such as Adam Beach's Slipknot, who doesn't even get to demonstrate his forte, and Karen Fukuhara's Katana, who arrives just as the squad is deployed, dispensing with having to appear previously in a sensible introduction. Plus, it's never explained why the government can't simply recruit dependable meta-humans like Superman; there can't be solely evil superheroes running about.Even though the structuring of the film is obnoxious, the character designs and origins are ridiculous, and the finale is so nonsensical that it proves that everything transpiring beforehand is of zero consequence, Margot Robbie is spot-on as Harley Quinn. It's impossible to imagine a better live-action representation for the role; she looks the part, acts the part, and speaks in one-liners with that catty, cavalier, coquettish demonstration of bipolarity and derangement so authentic to the source material. She's good enough to have received her own movie. Sadly, everything else about "Suicide Squad" is so pitiful that her stunning embodiment is likely to be dragged down by the rest of the inferiority.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

It's like a special force was sent to a city with zombie apocalypse. Nice experience but don't be over-hyped. This movie is okay, but not really good. If you remember, MoS and BvS was controversial, some people said that DCEU was over, but I think Suicide Squad save it. This movie will be not controversial as MoS/BvS, because it's okay, it's entertaining, unique, maybe the first DCEU movie with positive reviews.Positive things : 1. This is a new kind of movie, nice experience 2. Superb action scenes 3. Harley Quin is amazing 4. Overall more entertaining than BvS/MoSNegative things : 1. Jokes was not funny, especially Will Smith's jokes 2. The Joker is not cool, he is just a pointless crazy gangster 3. The CGI was meh 4. The hype is too damn high</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC, you've done it again (and not in a good way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide is another disappointing entry into the DCEU, as it threw away the potential for a fun, light-hearted story and instead replaced it with the dark tone (and some humour) we have come to expect from this film franchise. Will Smith is by far the best part of this movie, delivering us his usual, charismatic charm and addition to this, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and Viola are great in their roles respectively. Where the film falters in terms of performance however, is through Cara Delevingne's disappointing representation of Enchantress (in which she was given a role that was utilized in the story much more than expected/needed), Jared Leto as the Joker, where he just seemed to be doing a strange and unsettling impression of Heath Ledger's interpretation in his surprisingly small and compressed role and other side characters seemed entirely underused (for example, Katana, Slipknot (who was added to the team for the sake of moving the plot along) and Killer Croc). Also, unfortunately the relationship between the characters, Rick Flagg and Enchantress seemed entirely forced and just completely unnecessary. Onto the "cool soundtrack" that was promised prior to the film's release, it was was unfortunately very overused as the began to cut off song-after-song and just play another one straight after which had nothing to do with the plot at all (some did however, which was pleasing). One of the antagonists turned out to be nothing but a fake-looking, CGI sh*t-fest with no motivation other than he wanted to take over the world (learn from your mistakes DC!) and the dialogue written into the script felt lazy and clunky and a lot of the jokes were hit-or-miss. Trust me, I wanted to love this film after seeing those incredible trailers but it just wasn't very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "superhero" movie......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying that I did enjoy Batman v Superman the first time I saw it in theaters. So don't down vote me because you think I'm some kind of Marvel fanboy(I can count on one hand the amount of MCU films I actually enjoyed)..But this is not a great movie. Already the "fans"(read: fanboys) are outraged that it is getting bad reviews, but the fact is: It's getting bad reviews because it deserves it. It's a story about a group of people with special powers that has to learn to work together to stop a generic CGI army and close some kind of portal/hole in the sky. Just like The Avengers, X-Men: Apocalypse, similar to Man Of Steel, yeah a bunch of movies have done this.It starts out with a series of flashy montages that went on way too long, all of a sudden something happens and they skip ahead a bunch of chapters in a couple minutes. The pacing issues luckily ends there, and the second act is pretty enjoyable. One of the best characters from the first half of the movie disappears though which sucks, they could have solved that in a different way to keep the character in play. The third act is where it goes full on generic "superhero". And then it stops short. No real aftermath or anything.It does have a post credit scene, but it is totally negated by them dropping the Justice League trailer a couple weeks ago.</fullReview>

Robbie and Letto seem to be the only interesting actors/characters and will almost guarantee a spin off based on their good chemistry. Will Smith as deadshot comes off as a nothing character who's angst is framed around a story line that we've all seen to many times.

I think there won't be another good joker after heath ledger.i think we all have a doubt when we saw in the trailers how he looks like and all the stupid accessories he wears but we waited to see his performance he had little screen times but still it didn't have any impact on us it's like he is acting crazy you can't really feel or believe it . adding batman was a great choice but i waited all the movie for his appearance again but all the screen times he had was in the trailers! Harley(Margot Robbie) and dead shot(will smith) performance save this movie from collapsing the editing and effects were terrible and awful it's like 90's cgi I hope they cancel this joker and sorry for my bad English</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the critics. If you're interested at least one bit, go see it You won't regret it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations were very high and this was my most anticipated movie of the year. I've been waiting for it for more than a year. And now it's finally here. And it was well worth the wait.Some critics call it worse than Green Lantern and last year's Fantastic Four. Well, that's where critics become haters because any person who says that is crazier than Harley Quinn. This movie ISN'T that bad. In fact, if you're a fan, you will love it. If you don't know much about the source material or DC Comics in general, the least you will think is that it was fun. Think Guardians of the Galaxy, DC version. Without space or aliens. And it's got an awesome soundtrack too. The critics say both that the plot is thin and that it's overstuffed. Just there you can see that they are just nitpicking. I'll be honest, the plot IS thin, but like the plot of The Avengers isn't. And yet, no one mentioned that. And it's still a good movie (to me not as good as everyone says, but okay). And this is even better. At least it is to me. It kinda depends if you like DC or Marvel more. But still, if you prefer Marvel, you will think this was at the very least entertaining. There were clearly some disagreements between the director and the studio because the studio wanted a more light-hearted and funnier movie, while Ayer wanted it to be darker and it isn't very well balanced and that's the reason why the movie feels choppy at times. The first half is full of dark humor and while there is some over- exposition, it sets up the characters very well. The second half is a bit more serious, but that was necessary to add some more emotional weight to everything. Maybe it does seem gloomy at times (I was, honestly, never bothered by that because that's what DC is and I don't see why everyone has a problem with that), but even tho I liked Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I will admit and say that this movie has something those two movies didn't have. The appeal. And the main reason for that is the best thing about the movie:the characters. They are well written (a few of them are kinda paper thin, let's take Killer Croc for example) and every actor nailed the role he or she played. And by the way, don't expect to see much of The Joker. Leto killed it and he captivates every time he's on screen, but he's on screen for probably 10 minutes in total. But even tho everyone was great in their roles, the biggest star of the movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. I just couldn't write this review without mentioning her. I can't wait to see more of her and Leto. And also Jai Courtney as Captain Boomeramg nailed it. If you didn't like him before, you will still like him here, trust me. Also, if you were worried about the PG-13 rating, stop worrying. When you see the movie, you will see that it didn't even need an R rating. R rating would probably just make it look kinda pretentious.Basically, if you're interested, go see it and ignore the critics. This is the best DCEU movie yet and if you're a fan, it's guaranteed that you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to the theater with high expectations! i've watched all the trailer and got so hyped about this movie, but then it falls apart... here's what i thought about the movie - Will Smith's acting skill is amazing, of course He's a seasoned actor, so when i knew that He's taking part for this movie i'm so psyched! but what i saw from this movie, Will Smith is just being a Will Smith, i was hoping that he's going to act differently.- Margot Robbie is great! she's a star in this movie! - Jared Leto is good but not as great as Heath Ledger Joker... and with all the hype or whatsoever, i think his appearance is too short and he's got nothing to do with the main plot... just a marketing strategy i guess? - Cara, not so good actress neither as a dancer 5/10 - Captain Boomerang, katana, killer croc, el diablo, slipknot are just complimentary for this movie, no important roles, no plot, no anything especially katana, there's a scene where she's suddenly out from nowhere talking to her sword, sobbing and then what? nothing.Overall the main story for this movie could've been better, but somehow it messed up and destroy this movie's only twist element. It would be better if the movie keep the audience confuse with what's happened and who's responsible for all the mess before deadshot found the top secret document from the helicopter, but no, they put the scene where enchantress going AWOL from the start so no surprise there, just bunch of action till the end.i give this 5 and extra 1 because i'm a huge fan of batman.</fullReview>

It is now clear to me that DC Extended Universe makes flawed movies that pander to their audience.The Joker was a combination of all the previous Jokers, but like in a 2 Chains music- video kind of way. Harley Quinn's character got really old, really fast. Deadshot was boring and had no purpose. Rick Flag and Enchantress? Completlely awful. The rest are just there.The movie has no plot and the plot twists are pointless. The CG is awful. The director must have forgotten to direct. The cameos are cheap tricks by the studio.

And jam packing all these villains didn't make it any better although the trailer made it seem it was going to be epic.. To me the main problem with this movie was the way it was directed. It felt very compact and if you are familiar with Ayers other movies and watch this you will see exactly what I mean. There is no sense of spacial awareness and moves from scene to scene without much depth or anything to have you wishing you could go back to watch that part again. Pretty much the whole movie was like this so yeah will not be watching this for maybe at least another 2 years and that's a maybe. Story line sucked too pretty much identical to the new Ghostbusters flick. Sorry guys 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe Suicide Squad is not as bad as Man of Steel or Batman V Superman but still quite bad. As expected, it's poorly written on every level. Every single character feels shallow and one dimensional and again justlike the first two tries from the DCU it's as we all feared. Word of mouth will very much hurt this effort because the trailer tried to fool viewers in to thinking this movie is something it's not. It's mangled and, frankly, has no heart at all. I know blindly loyal fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws no matter what actually hits the screen. We saw it with BvS and we are seeing it here.Just like with BvS, everyone is saying or will soon be saying that Suicide Squad is a dumb popcorn flick at best but really nothing special. How can a film follow something that's bad two times over but still give anyone high expectations? Yet, thanks to good trailers, that's exactly what happened.The actual movie AGAIN leads to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan. Campy, cheesy fluff pretending to be dark and serious usually fizzles out fast. Yet, as MOS and BvS proved this may be another indestructible franchise that won't die no matter how bad the stuff they churn out. A truly disappointing waste of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman V Superman, Civil War, now Suicide Squad. All poor Marvel movies. I am very sad. My feelings are somewhat hurt.I really wanted to like this movie but unfortunately David Ayer destroyed my dreams.It is tripe fan fiction. It is poorly constructed, badly written, underdeveloped drivel. The writers on this movie not only deserve but NEED a boot shoved up their own proverbial back-ends.And so I would thought that this movie would break the superhero movie stigma. WRONG! It was really rude and uncomfortable. Even Ghostbusters (2016) was better than this.The comedy is not funny. It is ridiculous. Joker is an amazing character though. Jared Leto sending Margo Robbie a rat in a box really helped his performance. I could breathe, smell, feel, touch, see, literally be the rat while watching his scenes. Such marvelous use of method acting. On the other hand, Will Smith's Deadpool is not good at all. Very annoying.But the Marvel fans will cry now, poke me with sticks and cry foul play, but didn't you see what happened with Batman V Superman and Civil War? Both tragic, awful movies from Marvel. Proof.Marvel fans are toast after this movie. They have literally just left the space open for DC to come in and swoop up everything now.You make bad movies, you let DC win, Marvel. You never learn from your mistakes!It's almost a guarantee that DC shall reign champion, releasing two huge movies, Doctor Strange and Rogue One. They will make up for the atrocity that was "Suicide Squad."This movie is awful and it should be clear to those in denial. The industry trollbot spam proves this. The script veered wildly out of control and the bots began insulting and downvoting on YouTube and other sites anyone who voiced the slightest bit of skepticism over Marvel, engaging in massive brigading to hide all such comments from view. Basically behaving like a two-bit Nomenklatura in the Rocky IV version of a totalitarian state. Very disturbing.1/10. Do not watch.~TonightTurnYourWeaponsToSnow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAY too over-hyped, very average movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, saying it was an average movie is really generous. It was really bad compared to all the hype. It was really clear that they were trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator because the movie was oversaturated with cheap jokes. The direction was all over the place, the acting was mediocre, and I feel like they rushed everything because they spent so much time introducing everyone and everything. The script was so bad and the directing was bad too. Most of the characters were meh, but Jared Leto as The Joker was absolute trash. His portrayal was so bad that I wanted to walk up and leave. This movie was way too over-hyped and I expect many people to be very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously man had a lot of expectations around this movie. But just like Batman v Superman: DOJ it disappointed me more then Batman v superman. Things that I hate most. Action- plain bad, hows is this even called superhero movie. CGI - It was so realistic that u can even see which parts are CGI. Story: u have seen the trailer right ? yeah that's all. Acting: All of their acting was amateurs like they'r paid less except Waller's. Starting: slow paced idiotic things. Editing: Oh god..... somebody please help DC out. JOKER: A wannabe joker no near close Heath. And the rest of the movie is full of clichés and bad jokes and unnecessary shenanigans that anyone can think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cartoonish effects and overacting make this more corn than catnip.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suicide squad is so mediocre that its title seems like a violation of truth in advertising laws.Cartoonish effects and overacting make this more corn than catnip.Full of clichés, weak actors, artificial effects, script with many holes and to be the most expensive film in history of Hollywood, your income may not be as grand as Deadpool or Force awakens.It adds more grist for the mill to the notion that studios don't hit the big red "reboot" button in any other state than a panic.Can we please get over the notion that every superhero in a skintight suit deserves a movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a huge problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films I've seen in years. The special effects are terrible(CGI), the script is garbage, and worst of all it is totally boring to boot. It's worse by far that the last DC films, including BvS.You feel a twinge of that let's-do-better ambition at the start of Suicide squad, as the camera soars over a clearly digital.Can we please get over the notion that every superhero in a skintight suit deserves a movie? Suicide squad can be compared with "amazing spider-man" and "Fantastic Four reboot".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall one of the worst superhero team movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to Cinema and see that Suicide squad is on the premiere. Suicide squad makes Amazing spider man look like the Citizen Kane of Superhero movies. A failure of a film that is worse than BvS (my god... was that possible?) Everything is bad: -The direction is shoddy and nothing flows, feels all over the place. - Acting is lifeless beyond belief (Like... Hayden Christensen lifeless).- Script is awful and they rewrote the script for the thousandth time. - Editing seems to be done by blind drunks. - CGI is worse than PLAYSTATION 2.- Ending is....... well bad is all I can say. - Jared leto's joker remembered me Joel schumacher's villains. - The excessive action scenes are just there to fill out the plot holes in this empty story. Overall one of the worst superhero team movies.</fullReview>
