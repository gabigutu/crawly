		<shortDescription>Do you have to be immoral to be funny????.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy stars in a senseless adult comedy movie. "The Boss" failed to entertain me from the start till the end.The comedy is too cheap and the obscenity in language and behavior did not make me laugh at all. Honestly,I thought I am watching a silly porn-like comedy movie.Melissa McCarthy portrays the role of Michelle Darnell, a shameless and a selfish businesswoman who does everything bad for the sake of her own arrogant welfare. Her wicked and reckless behavior led to her imprisonment of course.I am totally disappointed with this boring movie because its senseless vulgarity and the lack of comedy made of this film a total waste of time and a bad movie of the year 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Have All The Good Writers Gone???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And what one earth is wrong with Melissa McCarthy? She is beautiful, talented, funny?.and yet she keeps making these foul, way too much sex pieces of trash. It's hard to figure out why. Do people in Hollywood think there are no more decent people out here wanting to see good, funny movies? Nobody left without the mouth or mind of a waste container? If so, they are wrong. The thing is, with this movie in particular, it could have been very funny. Good cast, fair premise, but instead we ended up with a film that was nothing much more than garbage. When a movie ends and everyone is just looking at each other with, "What the heck did we just waste money on?" looks on their faces, it's not good. Even worse, waiting for this one to come on, we were treated to a couple of coming attractions with pictures as bad, or worse. Foul language, as if the writers have completely lost any ability to write witty, clever dialogue, or dialogue at all that isn't merely four letter words, over the top sex that, frankly, is not interesting, is tiresome, and is so over- done. Who decides to spend money putting out money for this stuff? Nobody with any intelligence, I'm thinking. Too bad. You're cheating movie audiences, big time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for children - then don't put them in the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was said right here on this site, this is a lousy film, save your money, don't go see it. I went to see it because I liked Spy a lot - I thought perhaps this one would have funny parts, be interesting, clever and maybe have original humor.Sadly I didn't walk out. I'll walk out of bad films but maybe it was the tasty bag of popcorn I was eating slowly, and enjoying my free Coke from my Regal points. I am disappointed that the filmmakers chose to use children throughout the film, yet they used foul language and some adult themes that gave it an "R" rating, thereby preventing young children to see a film that could have been fun if they had cleaned up the language. And with a wider audience, surely they could have figured out that it could have made so much more money. I truly do not understand the thinking behind the use of children in most of the film yet not making it suitable for them to enjoy - certainly there are enough "R" rated films that use adults, but very few films that use children with proper language and making a film the whole family can see.If a film has an "R" rating, then leave children out of the story. Easy enough to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was ready for a fun, entertaining comedy and it failed at every level. Melissa and her hubby should not ever collaborate on a venture again, the writing and execution was forced which did not flow. We love Melissa, however she should have taken her concept to a professional writer. Peter Dinklage did not deliver which was completely surprising considering his career performance with Game of Thrones. For the most part he looked like he was in pain in all his scenes. I'm sorry to say, it is not even worth a future video rental. This is the first review I have written, I want to save you the pain! I wish I would have read reviews before spending my time and money. Let's wish Melissa a better script for any future movies, as this was a pure dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TV shows: Almost every year you see a new clever comedy show like Scrubs, Simpsons, Big Bang Theory, Southpark, Malcolm in the Middle, ... You don't have to like it, but at least acknowledge that it is very clever and well written. With movies on the other side it's a different story. Here the trend is that it is getting worse and worse. We are almost at a point where we were in the 80's.The problem: The movies make money and as long as this is happening we will see movies like "The Boss" in the future. Or another theory - I'm getting to old for this kind of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Waste of Time and Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I let my friend drag me into watching this .... atrocious film.This movie relies on ugly, immoral jokes that demean and pigeonhole people into old fashioned stereotypes. Making fun of lesbians? Seriously who does that anymore?! Also, if the jokes are ugly and cheap to begin with, forcing child actors to say them doesn't make the jokes any prettier. Slang terms and vulgar words do not automatically equal humor. Far from it.Absolutely tasteless.The Boss lacked subtlety, and I found myself comparing Melissa McCarthy's role to Donald Trump, and not in a good way, mind you. There was nothing funny about the film---the violent attempt at slapstick humor failed. It was badly timed and came off rather flat. No one was likable except Peter Dinklage's role. Even then, he is shoved into a stereotype about funny midgets. What are we? 8 year old children? That was the last time I ever laughed simply because someone was shorter than average.There is a way to mix violence/vulgarity to create a comedy (See Deadpool, Hot Fuzz, etc.), but The Boss definitely never even took off. Just pure failure.Hated the film. I don't recommend wasting your brain cells on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the worst movie I have seen in years. It is so bad, that I find it difficult to find a comparison that sank to its level.As an attempt to create a movie for 21st century viewers it fell very far from the mark. The stupidity of the storyline, coupled with the over use of the F bomb just made the film appear to have been written by half-wits...No offense meant to the genuinely mentally challenged...The 'fight' scene? Had someone been watching that video, 'fight like a girl' and taken it literally?What is funny about watching little kids fight? The fact that they were all girls was not in the least relevant. It would not have been funny if they were all boys, or mixed. Kids being violent to one another is hardly comedic.It was crude, unfunny and deeply offensive on a good many levels. I will not even bother with the rather overt gender bashing that went on. The movie is offensive for all the wrong reasons. But did it have any redeeming qualities at all? Well, Kristen Bell played a supporting role, but even Veronica Mars was not going to stop this bus going off the cliff.Recommended ONLY if...No....No. There is no 'if.' Under no circumstance can this movie be recommended to anyone. Save your money. Go home, watch the paint dry. You will find it infinitely more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Queen of Crass and Crude goes to the Nth Degree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy has made a deserved name for her crassness and crudeness. I found her raw humor in Bridesmaids and The Heat to be extremely entertaining. But this movie, which presents her as a businesswoman in the mold of Martha Stewart, does her a disservice. What set McCarthy apart in the movies where she shines is that she's the one being crass and crude, surrounded by more normal people who make her stand out. In this movie, everyone seems to be trying to be just as crass and crude, if not more so, including the numerous girls playing Girl-Scout-like cookie sellers who get into a street brawl over cookie-selling territory. Poorly written movie. Not funny. Despite that, the movie is doing well in the box office. It's hard to imagine the audiences for this. Too crude to take kids. Not enough adult humor for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another McCarthy-Falcone misfire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a filmmaker is simply too emotionally invested in a movie to see when it needs to be better than it's turning out to be. Of course, every filmmaker needs to be passionate about his/her cinematic endeavor, but there is such a thing as letting emotions get in the way of sound artistic judgment. It often happens when the same person both writes and directs a movie (his/her "passion project"), especially when also acting in the movie. Then, there's an even greater danger of things going wrong when these kinds of overlaps involve a married couple. It happened when Dax Shepard wrote, co-directed and starred in the pointless action-comedy "Hit and Run" (2012) which co-starred his real-life wife Kristen Bell. In 2014, another couple, Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone, took the practice of overlapping jobs and complicating it with marriage to another level by co-writing and co-starring in "Tammy" while Falcone also directed. That movie made money, but was poorly received by most critics and many Movie Fans as well. 2016 has the pair taking the same chance with the comedy "The Boss" (R, 1:39), which, ironically, co-stars Kristen Bell (but her husband is nowhere in sight). So, is "The Boss"? boss? Read on.McCarthy stars as Michelle Darnell, a high-powered businesswoman and motivational speaker whose childhood (back and forth between an orphanage and foster care) taught her that the only person she can depend on is herself. She's self-centered, arrogant and basically amoral. Michelle generally uses and abuses her personal assistant, Claire (Bell), and Michelle's bodyguard isn't much more than her personal hype man. When Michelle is arrested for insider trading and sent to jail for five months, everyone abandons her, former lover and long-time business rival Renault (Peter Dinklage) buys her companies and the authorities freeze all of her remaining assets. Looks like someone has to start all over again.When Michelle is released from jail, she doesn't have anyone to call or anywhere to go, so she takes a taxi to Claire's apartment. When Claire gets home from her new job (where she works for a crazy Darnell disciple played by SNL's Cecily Strong), Claire's pre-teen daughter, Rachel (Ella Anderson), convinces her mom that they have to do something to help Michelle. Claire allows her former boss to stay in the apartment until she gets back on her feet, but Michelle's feet remain reclined on Claire's couch until Claire forces Michelle to do something to earn her keep. Michelle takes Rachel to her Dandelions meeting (think Girl Scouts) where the troop leader (Kristen Schaal) is discussing their cookie sales.Michelle gets an idea that her "way back" is to form a group called Darnell's Darlings which will teach girls business skills as they sell the unusually delicious brownies that Claire makes from an old family recipe. Michelle gets Claire to make the brownies and help with the troop and gets Rachel to help her recruit various tough girls and other misfits to join up and sell brownies for a percent of the profits. Michelle also approaches her estranged former mentor (Kathy Bates) for financing to help expand the business, but as all this is going on, Renault and his equally evil assistant (Timothy Simons) are keeping tabs on Michelle and her new business, hoping to increase the payback that he feels her still owes her."The Boss" is mostly unoriginal, uninspired, unrealistic and unfunny. The clichéd plot lazily recycles the often used story of a main character who has been hardened by a tough life and doesn't know how to give or receive love. Falcone's direction randomly makes use of McCarthy's talent for physical comedy, but rarely gets her or the other actors to show us anything interesting or even very likable about their characters. Both the script and the acting give us characters who often change their tones and their attitudes toward other characters abruptly and with no clear reason why. We also see characters meeting for the first time, but acting like they already know each other, again without explanation.There is also a lack of realism in the way the script portrays the fallout from Michelle's crimes, and her business dealings as the head of Darnell's Darlings, but this comedy's biggest flaw is its lack of? comedy. There are a few laughs to be found here and there, but the movie's other problems just kill the mood. Besides that, the movie's attempts at humor are overly dependent on cartoonish violence involving children, cursing around, by and at children, and vulgar sexual references which come off as more crude than funny. McCarthy herself has been much funnier in previous films and hopefully she'll be funnier again in her future projects. Sadly, her character in this film is one boss who should be fired herself.

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Falcone keeps proving to me that he is a horrible writer and a horrible director. There is nothing about this film that works. Read on to find out why: We have a female boss by the name of Michelle Darnell was placed under arrest for Insider Trading. She has just been released and wants to become something huge, something big and ready to become "America's sweetheart." All the people she messed over aren't quite willing to forgive her. Very simple plot.Melissa Mccarthy is just plain horrible. We all know that her character is unlikable, but this was beyond a joke. In the movie world if you decide to create a very obnoxious, nasty, mean, and repulsive character...it can work...but the actor/actress playing this character needs to be able to bring something great to the table and by acting greatly and making you appreciate this horrible/unlikable character. Melissa Mccarthy does none of this, and therefor makes it completely outrageous and leaving you in total discomfort for a full 90 mins. Kristen Bell was horribly casted and was just pointless. Peter Dinklage was the only decent thing about this film, and he managed to give us a few chuckles. That's the sign of a good actor. But he's used as the stereotypical midget and we are laughing at his advantage. Again, it just didn't work.Women and slapstick comedy - a mixture that fails abysmally. And this movie does just that. Nothing worked. It was a horrible combination. I will never watch this again. I disliked Tammy, but this one was even worse! It was just horrible. 1/5 stars. 1/10. Autistic Jay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women and slapstick comedy - a mixture that fails abysmally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is wrong with this movie? Actually, the question should be: what is not wrong with this movie? First, except for the final scenes, this movie is not funny. It mocks women and even worse, young girls. That is not funny. Second, the movie is poorly acted. Third, the movie experiments with gender role switching with poor results. Fourth, the principal player, Melissa McCarthy just is not funny. She is loud and obnoxious. Actually, it all comes down to this: gals acting like nasty wise-guys just does not work, at least not for this writer. Lucille Ball was funny, Joan Davis was funny, Jean Stapleton was funny, Irene Ryan was funny, Rosalind Russell was funny, Gracie Allen was funny, Shelly Long is funny, Barbra Streisand is funny, Melissa McCarthy is not funny. Women punching each other in the face is not funny. Young girls brawling is not funny. What's worse, the movie early on establishes that McCarthy's character, the Boss, is a rotten person and shows it. She generates no empathy. She does stuff that is really hurtful and nasty. The one strong male character in this movie, played by a midget who actually is funny, despises the Boss and with good reason: she used him to get a promotion and then dumped him. Throughout the story she is the cause of all the interpersonal conflicts. In fact, she is intensely disliked, and with good reason: the character is repulsive. She is pushy, a hustler, loud, obnoxious, aggressive, and physically unattractive. That alone would not necessarily render her humorless. The problem is that she has no redeeming qualities to make her lovable. She's not warm, endearing, sensitive or even misunderstood by others. Her abrasive personality is as transparent as clear glass. She is not the victim; she is the perpetrator. And that is not funny. What's next: a female version of The Three Stooges (Mai, Lara and Coochie)? Or what about a movie featuring a female version of Harold Lloyd? Or what about a movie about a female Sad Sack (Sadie Sack?) Or what about an all-female version of Gomer Pyle, USMC? (Scene: affable but slow-witted Gina Pyle is berated by her hysterical sergeant, Violet Carter). Or what about an updated version of All in the Family with Archie transformed into Alma, Edith into Alma's clueless husband Eddie, Gloria into Alma's hysterical son Glen and Mike into Alma's obnoxious daughter-in-law Midge? The rip-off possibilities are endless. Anything for a laugh, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exemplar of 1980s-To-Present-Day Filth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might be debated which is worse: That the absolute filth of society have taken over "film," "music," and "television" to produce such trash OR that this society has plunged so far into the intellectual and cultural abyss since 1980 that its "Porky's," "Dumb and Dumber," and "The Terminator" members demand such trash. We can thank this movie and the similar movies previewed during the 20-minute-long nightmare of trailers before this trash even began for confirming the validity of historical proclamations by Ancient civilizations stating that this time would be the absolute cultural bottom of the current 26,000-year cycle, while illustrating the extreme mental-retardation that could be achieved by the dumbing-down of America during and since the 1980s.A comedy is supposed to help us escape the nightmare of living among the filth around us not remind us of the nightmare of living among the filth around us. Not ONE redeemable scene, with the f-word and kindergarten-style references to sexual situations - and among teenage girls, no less - to the point where, after 45 minutes of the greatest torture in a long time, the group of six of us left the movie. Yes - Right in the middle of a crowded theater on a Saturday night, six of us up and left, right after a young-teenage GIRL-thug directs the opposing girl-thugs in a warrior-like stance to "Suck my d^&lt;&gt;"! The night for all of us was ruined, and, during the car-ride to another venue, the discussion centered on our profound nausea over our having contributed to the becoming even richer of the filth that produced this trash. And, when we see that it has become "fashionable" to mimic the characteristic below-30-point-IQ-level hip-hop and rap dregs of society, we know that we have entered a deeper depth: The time of history that DEFIES PARODY. This society, as represented by its entertainment, with this movie as the exemplar, IS a sick parody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing Melissa McCarthy having never seen any of her movies and she is known for her comedic skill. Sadly I was very disappointed with the film but must agree that Ms McCarthy certainly has talent. Sadly this film did not enhance her talent in any way. Her skills were spoiled by the constant references to female anatomy and mostly shouting insults with bad language. I was saddened to see a script that to me downgrades women which is not at all funny. I must be honest and admit I did not stay to see the whole film so there may have been an improvement further on which I missed as I left the cinema. This experience has discouraged any further viewing of Ms McCarthy's work which is a pity. This film had all the makings of good entertainment and would be more successful if the language was cleaned up. However, perhaps I am old-fashioned!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a terrible misfire. Melissa Mccarthy has proved with this 2nd movie written by her that she cannot write a screenplay. She proved with Tammy and with The Boss that her talent is restricted to physical humor with her acting. The Boss is a lazy attempt at a comedy with plenty of horrendous jokes, bad characters, and a weird ass ending that feels totally out of place because of a fight scene. This entire movie is a mess and the only redemption is that a couple of jokes hit and that Michelle's (Melissa Mccarthy) story arch is that she need's to learn that family is everything this intertwines well with the other main character's story arch which is to find her own self worth. They have good character contrast but besides that everything else is crap. I made a video movie review on my Youtube Channel if you want to check that out.

The film does have some shining moments though. The whole battle between the rival kids was awesome to see as they kept throwing down against each other along with the scene with them shooting at one another as well with paint ball guns too was also great, but a few great scenes can't make up for a terrible film. The jokes just don't land at all. The whole movie is boring to watch. A Melissa McCarthy is kind of being a big douche bag through all of it and it just doesn't work.

		<shortDescription>An absolute mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying something very bluntly - Melissa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone need to stop writing movies. They are tarnishing McCarthy's career. Ever since her Oscar-nominated performance in 'Bridesmaids' McCarthy has been hot property in Hollywood. Yet nearly everything she has starred in since has been an abysmal movie (with the exception of 'Spy'). If things continue this way for much longer she will no longer be hot property and her career will likely fall by the wayside. So to be entrusting the writing of her scripts, at the peak of her career, to herself and her husband (who have never written before) is nothing short of insane. They first gave it a go in 2014 with 'Tammy' and the general consensus was that it was pretty bad, and yet here they are again two years later with 'The Boss', and I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt, it's really bad.The first thing that comes to mind as being a major issue is the story. Selling cookies and battling a rival group? This wouldn't even pass for an episode of a sitcom. I know what you're thinking though, if the characters are strong enough the story shouldn't matter too much. Let me assure you this is far from the case. The characters are dreadful. Almost every one of them in the film is completely unrealistic and over the top, and yet at the same time incredibly boring. The jokes are amateurish and would struggle to make in immature five-year-old laugh most of the time. The film also uses the same jokes over and over, at one point even twice in a row within the space of a couple of minutes. If McCarthy really does have the comedic talent to carry Hollywood films (which I'm starting to doubt truth be told) she needs to find a very fine set of writers to write a script that plays to her strengths. And she needs to find them fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of The Boss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy is a successful comedic actress. Her films make a ton of money and she's been nominated for an Oscar. I'm happy for the girl but in my opinion, she hasn't been humorous in a movie since 2011's Bridesmaids (of which she got said Oscar nom). Melissa has become the female Vince Vaughn being that she plays the same character type and bemoans the same tired mannerisms in all of her projects. She has also become the female Chris Farley. The only difference is that her aptitude of physical comedy doesn't have any payoffs or a means to an end. When McCarthy falls down the stairs in The Boss (my latest review), it's not justified and it feels like it was never supposed to happen. When she lays down on a fold out bed and it hurls her against a wall (also featured in "Boss"), it doesn't register as plausible. All these shenanigans seem just for show you know. And as I sat in theater, I kinda wish The Boss could've been a fine-tuned documentary about Bruce Springsteen instead. Fat chance on that.Edited in a slipshod manner by Craig Alpert (he chopped Ride Along and The Sitter), taking place in Chicago with a lazy, pedestrian-like use of its locales, and containing a scene in which the leads pet each other's breasts for three minutes straight (excruciating), "Boss" is not even offensively funny. It's just plain offensive. Case in point: When I see a grown woman character close-lining a childlike, female character during a girl scout gang brawl, I cringe in revulsion. And when I see the same grown woman character shove cookies into another character's panted keister, well I just wanna hurl.The story is as follows: Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) was a troublesome young girl. She was shuffled mind you from foster home to foster home. Cut to present day and she's now the 47th wealthiest woman in America. After a tip to police from her rival businessman (Renault played by 4 foot 5 inch Peter Dinklage), Darnell is arrested for insider trading and sentenced to a few months in prison. When she gets out, she is penniless, asset-free, without friends, and pretty much homeless. Michelle Darnell's solution: Move in with her former assistant (Claire Rawlins played by Kristen Bell) and eventually start a brownie-making empire with Claire and her cookie troop daughter (Rachel Rawlins played by Ella Anderson). Throughout "Boss", there's plenty of suggestive language, mean-spiritedness, and uncomfortable references to lesbianism. Ah, you gotta love the citizens via the "City of the Big Shoulders".Now The Boss is helmed by Melissa McCarthy's real-life husband, Ben Falcone. He also shot McCarthy's 2014 vehicle, Tammy. I have yet to see Tammy but if it's anywhere near as bad as "Boss", well Falcone should never be allowed to venture behind the camera again (at least for the sake of his wife's future endeavors). His direction here feels rushed and sort of pasted together. He obviously can't work with a script supervisor because segments in "Boss" tend to go on too long with infertile background completely evaporating. There are also gaps in the film's 100-minute running time where he relies heavily on location shots of Chicago aerials or a Chicago-based burrito restaurant (I guess that's where Claire's apartment was located). It's the type of innovation that only a mother or Ed Wood could love. In truth, if Falcone wants to be in his wife's movies, then fine (I'm sure his many cameos are stipulated in her contract). He just shouldn't be able to direct. That needs to be nipped in the bud right away.As for "Boss's" attenuated screenplay (penned by Falcone, McCarthy, and Steve Mallory), well it didn't feel like their was one. This flick is about the trading of securities, entrepreneurship, and the emergence of a self-made woman. However, the interplay between the troupers came off as though no one did any research on these subjects. During The Boss with its twisted innuendos, its sense of cringing fantasy, and its morbid sense of hilarity, I had no idea what McCarthy's Darnell did for a living, no idea what kind of job Kristin Bell's Claire had, and no idea how Peter Dinklage's antagonistic Renault became so rich. What we're left with as an audience, is improvised, uninsightful, not to mention grating dialogue from mediocre actors (McCarthy for the moment, is excluded and Bell could do better than this thankless role). I mean was there no one on set to consult Falcone, McCarthy, or Mallory on the ins and outs of CEO compartmentalization (or anything Martha Stewart went through)? Guess not. The opening sequence in "Boss" has Melissa's Michelle Darnell making an appearance at Chicago's famed, United Center. She comes down on a phoenix and basically says, "I'm the wealthiest woman in America" and "do you wanna make some f**cking money!" Heck, a second grader with a 'C' average could have written those lines.Bottom line: With almost no laughs, a persona created by Melissa McCarthy that is pretty much unlikable, and a vision of her cloaked in turtle necks in nearly every single scene, The Boss as a movie, is insubordinate (no pun intended). Rating: 1 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boss is a mostly unfunny cliché of foul jokes and predictable scouting story lines. This box of cookies is not worth buying!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story cliché that's often used for comedies, especially family comedies, are the ones where an adult is thrown in to the world of a child's, sometimes by choice or by accident, and try to benefit from that. There is a lot of comedic potential from this kind of fish-out-of-water scenario, considering if their character is out of their element or if the children know more about the subject that the main character is about to face. Movies like Bushwacked, Troop Beverly Hills and even Ernest Goes to Camp not only uses this story element, but also throws in the theme of camping or scouting.This also has comedic potential (even if the previous examples aren't good ones), as the idea of scouting is often the first time children get the chance to become adults while retaining innocence, and yet the adult in question would be getting a dose of how much harder it can be to return to such a carefree time. One element that turns girls into women is when their tasked to selling cookies for their troop. Rather then tackle this idea as a family film, The Boss goes for a full, hard R rated comedy the tries to push how bad a person can be. Michelle Darnell (played by Melissa McCarthy) is a successful businesswoman (I don't think were told exactly what it is she made or did) who prides herself through expensive self-help seminars and daily richly living. She cares little for anyone, even her never sleeping assistant Clair Rawlins (played by Kristen Bell). One day, Michelle's business enemy, a Japanese culture loving Renault (played by Peter Dinklage), exposes her insider trading, which puts her in prison for five months, along with her property seized by the government and her bank accounts frozen, putting back at square one.With no place to go and no one willing to work with her, she shows up at the front door of Claire, who lives with her young daughter Rachel, and has taken a new job. She lets Michelle stay with them, but forces her to help out, including taking Rachel to her scouting meeting. It's here where she discovers that the girl's troop sells a high amount of cookies. It's here where she's inspired to make a brand new scouting troop that sells brownies that are cooked by Claire and twenty percent of the profits go back to the girls.While I wouldn't call Melissa McCarthy a comedic genius, but you'd think a talent like her would have had a lot more to offer for The Boss. Directed by McCarthy's husband Ben Falcone (who also directed the really bad Tammy), much of The Boss rides on how foul she can be in front of children. This wouldn't be a bad thing, but like how Tammy attempted to put in some unneeded drama, this also tries to sneak in some schmaltzy material about the importance of family and such. That's not going to work as this is supposed to be an R rated story for adults and not for kids.Making an R rated movie around something that's supposed to be child friendly is a extremely tough sell and this movie justifies why something like The Boss shouldn't be pursued without an intelligent script. As is, I laughed a few times, but mostly by how insane McCarthy can be with her character. Both Kristen Bell and Peter Dinklage try their best, but the material gives them little to work with, and their stuck telling predictable jokes with a predictable story. I'll give this three boxes of cookies out of ten. The Boss is a mostly forgettable comedy that we can toss into the bargain bin that will probably satisfy those that want cheap laughs. I hope McCarthy can show a lot more creative idea with her upcoming Ghostbusters movie. I know she's capable of a ton of laughs (no pun on her weight).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Market Crash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Movie profanity and crude humor are best used selectively, and certainly not as a comedy crutch. Melissa McCarthy has not built her career on subtlety, but even for her standards, this latest comes across as a lazy effort with missed opportunities for both laughs and a message.Ms. McCarthy re-teams with those responsible for Tammy (2014), including her husband writer/director Ben Falcone and co-writer Steve Mallory. Here she plays Michelle Darnell, an egotistical hyped-up business tycoon with no sense of integrity or humanity ? constantly wearing an odd turtleneck. Somehow the filmmakers thought it a good idea to explain this lack of soul showing a young Michelle being continually "returned" to her orphanage (run by a nun played by Margo Martindale).When Michelle's business rival (and former business associate and former lover) Renault/Ron (Peter Dinklage) turns her into the SEC for insider trading, the correlations with Martha Stewart become impossible to ignore. There is even an acknowledgment of this by McCarthy's character. Once released from white collar prison, Michelle hits rock bottom and ends up sleeping on her former assistant's sofa. Kristen Bell is Claire, the assistant that Michelle once dumped on and now crashes with. Ms. Bell is mostly relegated to "straight man" to McCarthy's string of lame punchlines.In the spirit of exaggeration in lieu of creativity, three scenes in particular stand out: the street fight between rival scout troops, a ridiculous breast grope-off with McCarthy and Bell, and a clumsily staged sword fight between McCarthy and Dinklage. The missed opportunity to have a point about girls in business, and stooping to schmaltz with the Michelle family story are every bit as disappointing as the mostly unfunny and constant use of profanity-laced insults. Saying "suck his d***"over and over in one scene does not make it funny ? in fact, it's a bit sad.Exacerbating the frustration is the misuse and underuse of such talents as Cecily Strong, Kristen Schaal, Tyler Labine, and Kathy Bates. Ella Anderson as Claire's daughter does come across as a real kid, and she's part of the best scenes in the movie. Somehow a movie that (finally) calls out the Girl Scouts on their unfair-to-girls business model, manages to disappoint on every other front.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the IMDb rating suggests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The current rating of 5.3 is much too low for this film. In the reviews there seem to be many 1 out of 10 detractors which makes me wonder 1/. did we watch the same film? 2/. did those reviewers not understand the film?, 3/. did they understand the film but not like the message?, or 4/. do they just not approve of films starring normal sized women?The Boss is a parable about the value of money vs. the value of friendship. Michelle Darnell (played by Melissa McCarthy) never had any friends or family as a child, so by tooth and claw she fought her way to material wealth and (the illusion of) prestige through some preposterous, exploitative, pyramid marketing type scam, hurting a lot of people along the way. For her, money is a type of armour that bestows respect, comfort and security, which she needs, because no one's going to love her any time soon. After a short white collar crime jail sentence she gets out to discover that she no longer has any armour. She doesn't even have a blanket, because she doesn't have any friends. But in desperation she appeals to her long suffering and under-valued single mom former assistant, Claire (Kristen Bell), who reluctantly takes her in because she knows herself what it means to be down on your luck with nowhere to turn. Michelle may no longer have any money, but she has a more valuable asset - chutzpah - something that can never be taken away - and the steely determination that comes from having to fend for yourself when you're just a young child. Discovering Claire's talent at making comfort food brownies, Michelle decides to muscle in on the girl-scout cookie operation headed by the movie's "bitch" Helen (played brilliantly by Annie Mumolo). Of course she prevails (because this is a Hollywood movie), but along the way she realises that she doesn't care about the money after all - what she truly values is the friendship of Claire and her daughter, and Claire's adorably dorky beau, Mike (played by Tyler Labine). She finally finds her family when she least expected it. So the 1 out of 10 haters should suck it, because they're wrong - this is a lovely movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a comedy that works for about five minutes. Written and directed by Ben, Mr. McCarthy, Falcone, it is poorly written and lacks any noteworthy direction.There are a couple of laughs, most are in the trailer. The comedy goes off the tracks with repeated foul language and a stupid sword fight. If McCarthy worked as hard to be funny as she worked to hide her neck, maybe things would have been better.If you see this movie, watch it on an airplane at least when it's over you'll have gotten someplace. Pass on the theatrical release and don't expect much when it arrives quickly on a home platform.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>vulgar R rated jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy uses her same vulgar R rated sex jokes and innuendo's in The Boss. It starts off entertaining and has it's share of really funny moments throughout. Annie Mumolo; co-writer of Bridesmaid's co-stars in this movie as Melissa's nemesis. Annie also had a cameo in Bridesmaids on the airplane sitting beside Kristen Wiig. Nice to see her get a bigger role. I wanted to give the movie 4 stars but the last 20 minutes really are truly ridiculous and not even funny. I guess that's the trick of comedy it's either really good or fails epically, given the movie as a whole and more positive moments, I can forgive the silly ending. I still think Identity Thief, Spy and Bridesmaids are probably her 3 best comedies to date. The movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of Melissa McCarthy's humor. If you don't normally like her humor, this will offer you nothing.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/265193-the-boss</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The comic timing is disastrously unpolished.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After consistently being rejected by potential adoptive families during her childhood at the Blessed Sisters of Merry orphanage, Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy) grows up to become a highly successful, but hardened and cynical, businesswoman. Placing profits above notions of friends and family, Darnell betrays her mentor Ida (Kathy Bates), her lover Renault (Peter Dinklage), and her loyal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). When the industry titan is arrested for insider trading, her company is usurped by Renault and all of her possessions are sold off, leaving her destitute when she's released from prison four months later. Arriving on Claire's doorstep, Michelle convinces her former employee to let her stay until she's able to bounce back. With Claire and her daughter Rachel's (Ella Anderson) help, Michelle must attempt to reclaim her empire ? and overcome her own contentious nature.Starting off as a celebrity motivational speaker, complete with rap stars, dancers, and pyrotechnics, Michelle is anything but the typical Wall Street hotshot. So it's particularly baffling that the movie would retain the name "The Boss," a moniker never actually applied to McCarthy's character in any manner fittingly representative of the filthy-rich, mobster-type persona depicted on the theatrical poster art. Whatever the title was intended to mean, it gets utterly lost amidst a series of incoherent, spontaneous modifications for the leading role, which shifts around so much it's as if she's depicting multiple personalities. When the story diverges into a Girl Scouts cookie/brownie-selling rivalry and showdown, Michelle's former multimillions CEO status becomes virtually blotted out.The very first verbal gag, which is a derivation of the "Who's on First" routine first popularized by Abbott and Costello, descends into blathering babble, as if half a joke was written and then dropped. This gives way to a series of conversations that all fall comparably flat - perhaps setting some sort of record for the most number of completely unfunny blabbers spouted out in a row, gruelingly unable to land a genuine punchline. The exchanges are painfully spewed, as if the actors were laboring through their dialogue while fending off boos from a live improv crowd. Even the slapstick, which generally capitalizes on the easy target of McCarthy's weight, struggles to find its footing."You've got no capital and nobody likes you!" The plot comes together discordantly, with flashbacks and transitions so ineffective they appear as if pilfered from different films. The basic ideas are hastily and sloppily sewn together from a smattering of varying works - undoubtedly pulling from rejected subplots from other Ben Falcone/Melissa McCarthy scripts. Is Darnell trying to regain her business acumen? Is she trying to display an emotional or maternal side? Is she trying to save her employee-turned-partner from the monotony of life as a single mom in a dead-end job? Is she trying to redeem herself from a career of backstabbing and deceit? Is she trying to find a suitable man for Claire?As each wholly incompatible predicament arises, the calculations and the resolutions either carry on too long or cut off too soon. The comic timing is disastrously unpolished. And the villain is another strong example of how incautiously the storyline is concocted - he's a bitter ex-lover, a rival businessperson, an extreme eccentric, and a samurai enthusiast all rolled into one, proving to be more of a cartoon character than a believable human being. When deadly conflict (something that should have never appeared in this kind of project) transforms into reconciliation with a couple of quick jokes, it's clear that nothing about "The Boss" was well thought out or approached with common sensibility (especially when the money to buy bags, stickers, ribbons, berets, and all the brownie ingredients is totally ignored). But, more unforgivable than the lack of substance, is the fact that so many of Michelle's misadventures are just plain humorless.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Needed a Boss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boss (2016): Dir: Ben Falcone / Cast: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Bell, Peter Dinklage, Ella Anderson, Kathy Bates: As with Tammy, director Ben Falcone and star Melissa McCarthy present a laughless comedy. It is about taking charge of oneself since nobody seemed to be taking charge on the film. McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell whose rushed premise has her as a rejected orphan until adulthood where she hits wealth by walking over other people. Kristen Bell plays single mother Claire Rawlins, Darnell's assistant who works hard and desires appreciation. When Darnell is jailed for fraud she is eventually released, humbled and must room with a reluctant Claire and her open daughter. Peter Dinklage plays antagonist Renault whose romantic past with Darnell is undone by betrayal and he seeks revenge. Like Tammy the screenplay is formula and weightless. The film is technically well made with director Falcone highlighting the production. McCarthy hams it up as this woman who shuts out everybody who gets to close. Bell is fetching but flat as Claire in the typical single mom who needs a makeover role. Dinklage is a fine actor who gives it his best here but the role is perhaps underused. Ella Anderson plays the typical emotional daughter trying to connect with Darnell. Finally we have Kathy Bates in a horrible cameo who shows up with a cloud of gray hair riding horseback. She voices her disappointment in Darnell before agreeing to financially back her. Message regards the damage caused when children grow up neglected. Unfortunately nothing was neglected more than the script. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The BossThe paradoxical thing about bosses is that they're the highest paid yet most hated person in the company.Unfortunately, the CEO in this comedy no longer receives the income portion.Michelle (Melissa McCarthy) is a hard-nosed businesswoman sent to prison for insider trading. With nowhere to live when she's release Melissa reaches out to her former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell), whom she mistreated and poorly paid.Determined to regain her fortune and topple her adversary (Peter Dinklage), Michelle proposes that they sell Claire's homemade brownies through her daughter's scout troop. But all that camaraderie soon becomes too much for the titan of industry to handle.While McCarthy's verbally abusive character provides a few decent sight gags, for the most part this vanity project written and directed by her husband is an unfunny, foul-mouthed and overall formulaic family outing. Incidentally, in white-collar prisons the inmates don't get raped...their butler's do. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really hate it when bad movies happen to good people. Despite bursting onto the entertainment scene with a killer supporting role in Bridesmaids (2011) and a star turn in Mike &amp; Molly (2010- present), Melissa McCarthy has struggled to find material truly worthy of her talent. She's a reliable box office draw and can be trusted to perform exceptionally well with an assortment of interesting characters so why is she constantly being saddled with wafer-thin plots, broad and boring scripts and paint-by-numbers directorial choices? Is it pride; risk aversion; nepotism?The Boss is the story of Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) a larger-than- life business tycoon, who looses it all for insider trading and is forced to start from the bottom once more. Armed only with a mega- maniacal ego and aided by her former assistant turned partner Claire (Bell), Darnell desperately tries to claw her way up to the top of Chicago's industry professionals. Undermining her at every turn however, are a multitude of former colleagues and competition who will stop at nothing to keep her at bay. Her most nefarious foe is Renault (Dinklage) a former lover whose obsession with Darnell is rivaled only by his obsession with the ways of the Samurai.McCarthy (predictably) does a stellar job channeling her inner Trump. The story begins with Darnell as a young girl being dropped off a number of times by would-be adoptive parents which, while being a lazy setup does give the audience a reference point in which to pin our aspirations. McCarthy takes that baton and runs with it; fleshing out the broadly drawn character into one you could imagine exists in real life. You're never made privy as to why everyone hates her and abandons her (other than Renault) though I suppose one could gleam such insights by her unofficial motto "Family is for suckers." Also despite once again being a lazy setup, the emotional payoff by the end isn't exactly deserved, but thanks to McCarthy's sensitivity she at least saves it from being offensively ham-fisted.One can't help but think there was a much better comedy left on the cutting room floor here. There are extended moments of improvisation that go no where, and could have been sacrificed for the sake of filling in plot-lines that are dropped or disappear into the ether. One particular plot-line surreptitiously involves Kathy Bates as Darnell's former sensei Ida Marquette who despises her but we never find out why. You'd think with two very talented actresses a moment of catharsis could have been captured on film but instead we get five minutes of McCarthy and Cedric Yarbrough taunting Claire for being the smartest gal in the room.Speaking of Kristen Bell; the former Veronica Mars (2004-2007) star plays a variation of the nagging, humorless, smarter-than-thou wife we've seen in hundreds in sitcoms and comedic vehicles. Her character is so irredeemably oppressive and boring that when Claire and Darnell have the third act falling out we all know is coming, I was less worried about what would happen to her than I was about why no one was standing in front of Chicago's Cloud Gate sculpture during the film's wistful montage. Her character arc completes itself with a budding romance with Mike (Labine) that was neither interesting nor convincing.Yet despite all it's faults, the movie achieves what it set out to achieve, that is to say it makes it's audience laugh and laugh often. This is largely accomplished on the strength of bawdy R-rated humor and McCarthy's shrewd comic timing. Peter Dinklage, who gives a particularly daffy performance, has a lot of fun riffing, joking and tumbling with McCarthy, thus saving the film's third act contrivance from completely ruining the movie. The Boss is certainly not worth the price of admission unless you're already a fan of Melissa McCarthy. Yet for those already annoyed by her shenanigans, The Boss is just further confirmation that she's simply playing to the Plebes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No clever "twist" on a title for this review. "The Boss" is Melissa McCarthy's latest dive into comedy. This was not well received by most critics, so I was a little more than hesitant to watch the film. Checked it "On-Demand" last evening. It isn't the best (by far) of movies starring McCarthy, but it was still better than most of the crap out there."The Boss" tells a story about a very rich, self-made woman (McCarthy) who, after being returned time and again from foster parents, maters to realize the only person she can actually depend on is herself. She becomes a "money guru," and just about has anything and everything anyone can want. However, due to a little "insider trading," (which she readily admits to), she loses her fortune and winds up serving a small stint in jail. When she is released, she realizes all those people she stepped on while proceeding "up the ladder," now want nothing to do with her or any of her new schemes. With nowhere else to go, she winds up on the doorstep of her former personal assistant, wonderfully played by Kristen Bell, where after accompanying Bell's daughter to a "Brownie" meeting, decides on her next step to get back on top.Some critics have complained about the coarseness of the humor in this movie. I would take this opportunity to remind them the movie is rated "R," so what did you expect. I found myself laughing out loud many times, which (if you knew me) you would be very surprised because it takes a lot to make me laugh. I thought the casting was great. Peter Dinklage as "Renault" was a scream, as was his butt- kissing assistant. McCarthy was true to form delivering zingers at the speed of light. Tyler Labine as Bell's love interest had me in stitches, especially with his line of "Well, SOMEONE likes Mortal Kombat." Still, the movie was a little slow and just a bit too cliché-ish for me. Rated "R" for language, sexual situations, and minimal violence, I enjoyed "The Boss." It isn't McCarthy's best, but it is leaps and bounds above the abysmal "Tammy." More of a 6.5 rating from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a funny movie, although it's not for everyone. If you are too sensitive to adult humor ... which most of the reviewers ARE, then don't watch it.If you are too sensitive to laugh at a few lesbian jokes... then don't watch it. Personally, i myself think it's a huge lesbian joke that every TV show be it cable, satellite, netflix, syfy, such as The 100, Z Nation, etc., etc., etc, turns q previously hetero character into a lesbian just for a few hot lesbian scenes instead of introducing new characters who are already lesbian. I don't see anyone getting upset about that big joke.I happen to be pretty fat, and I laugh at fat jokes. I laugh at funny fat jokes, let me clarify. So if you are sensitive to just about anything, don't watch this.It seems the only thing we are supposed to laugh at when it's insulted these days is white people.Good nuff movie to rent, don't buy it, it's not worth buying, but is a good Red Box rental especially for a double feature night.I don't expect all movies to be perfectly polished and politically correct blockbuster hits. Why do you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the bad reviews?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get the really bad reviews of this movie. The reviews don't even match the movie. There are references to too much sex, and a flat story. Maybe I got a different movie, but there isn't any nudity or sex. At best there is cursing.It was a fun movie with an interesting story line. McCarthy is a funny actress that is able to convey a warm heart in her comedy even when the story line is trying to make her look mean.When I am doing system upgrades from home I put movies on in the background that are memorable for being full of constant dialog and this one is now in my list of movies that provide laughs while doing that 4am system upgrade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE BOSS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Slapstick comedy flick, re-teaming actress Melissa McCarthy with writer/director Ben Falcone (her husband); the two previously performed the same duties on the 2014 hit comedy flick 'TAMMY'. McCarthy stars in the movie, and she also co-wrote the script; with Falcone and (actor turned first time screenwriter) Steve Mallory (who also played a small part in 'TAMMY'). The film costars Kristen Bell, Ella Anderson, Peter Dinklage, Tyler Labine and Kathy Bates (who also costarred in 'TAMMY'). It tells the story of a very successful businesswoman, named Michelle Darnell, who's imprisoned for insider trading, that tries to make a comeback by selling delicious brownies. Michelle Darnell is based on a character McCarthy previously created for the comedy troupe 'Groundlings'. The movie performed well at the Box Office (like all of McCarthy's films), but it also did poorly with critics (like almost all of McCarthy's movies). I liked it (like most of McCarthy's films).Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) was an extremely rich and powerful businesswoman; and then she was busted for insider trading. When she gets out of prison, 5 months later, none of her old business associates want anything to do with her anymore. Only Michelle's former dedicated assistant, Claire (Bell), will help her out. Claire lets Michelle stay with her, and her daughter Rachel (Anderson). At first the ex-con is extremely annoying, but then she learns to bond with Claire and Rachel; and when she learns how good Claire's home cooked brownies are, she gets an obsessive new business idea. I think McCarthy is a very talented comedic performer, and writer, and this character is brilliant. So the movie is definitely funny. It's a little hit-and-miss, but it's more hit than miss (I think). It's not hilarious, or an exceptionally well made film; but if your'e looking for laughs, it should deliver. Unless you're just not a fan of Melissa McCarthy, or her style of comedy (everyone has their own tastes), than this film probably isn't for you.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

The terrible thing about this horrible film is that all along you hope that it will get better, that the ugly character depicted will learn some lesson from life and start having a more respectable viewpoint toward others. But no. Her huge vulgarity and insanity is assumed throughout. This is one of the 2 or 3 worst movies I have ever seen... By the way, may I advise all parents not to show such a vulgar movie to kids. The language is obscene and filthy. Like the character of this movie only worth of disdain. I wonder what can be in the mind of the lady who wrote this... I really pity her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McCarthy and modern comedy at its very worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How long can one continue to do the same thing over and over before said one becomes bored? It's an intriguing question and one that now must be seriously asked of comedian Melissa McCarthy, who over the last 5 or so years has dominated the increasingly activate female comedy market thanks to hit turns in films like Bridesmaids and Spy but has also shown an unashamedly tired tendency to reiterate the same character over and over in often diabolically unfunny experiences.Identity Thief, Tammy, The Heat, this film (filmed once more with her real life husband Ben Falcone) and to a lesser extent Ghostbusters have seen the somewhat self-confessed queen of comedy reliving the same variation of her loud mouthed, dumb or obnoxious persona that initially won her a legion of fans of but has since seen her become a tiresome bore and its actually nice to see such a forced film like The Boss get the reception it deserves.Devoid of legitimate laughs and unnatural in the all the wrong ways for a comedy, The Boss is the very worst of McCarthy and the worst example of many of modern day comedies worst attributes from trite story lines, a thinking that the more swearing and toilet humour the better and a collection of characters we neither care for or find funny and while every now and then McCarthy reminds us that she can lead a comedy to moments of gold (last year's Spy an example) her Michelle Darnell is an utterly irredeemable creation.We're asked to care for Darnell as the high roller loses her fortune and finds solace and meaning in her relationship with Kristen Bell's kindly Claire and then in her battles with rival and ex-lover Renault played by Game of Thrones Peter Dinklage with more ham than a Christmas dinner but how Falcone and McCarthy thought we'd care about this barely there story with barely available laughs will always be one of life greatest unsolved mysteries.There's nothing boss about The Boss and McCarthy's continued one mindedness to milk her past successes over and over with increasingly forced and tired features like this will quickly see the domineering actress fall out of favour with her once willing audience as the so-so box office and terrible reception to this film is attesting to already.? a samurai sword out of 5</fullReview>

The plot seems simple, but when you witness it it's pure comedy that made me laugh countless times. Unless you don't have a sense or humor or hate dirty jokes, than I don't think you might like this movie.Melissa McCarthy, Peter Drinkalge and Kristen Bell as the lead roles, I think they did a very wonderful job and served super acting, especially from Drinklage. Ignore the other user reviews, they honestly have no sense of humor not to enjoy a film like this.Big thumbs up for this movie and the actors!

		<fullReview>Firstly, setting up a business and making it a successful one is not as easy as Michelle did with the brownie company. What I think is true however, is that if you want to be a successful entrepreneur you have to sacrifice some of your personal relationships. And you have to be aggressive to go get what you want and get where you want. This may make you an unlikeable person like it did to Michelle. Most of us would not be OK with that and would take relationships and being lovable before successes in business because relationships and people in your life are more important. Michelle, however did not think so and care about relationships because she never had a family. As soon as she came close to a family she also chose that above business because ad I always say feelings are the most important thing. Michelle was supposed to be an unloving, hard character however, this does not come through. It was very hard to believe and understand why Michelle would be unloved and why people would find her hard to tolerate. I personally thought Claire was worse. With regards to acting Melissa McCarthy is just fabulous and brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always liked Melissa McCarthy films when others said they were very bad, but this time it is totally different. I won't blame her, she always gives her one hundred per cent and so for this film. But it was the terrible script that let her down. Actually, it is a watchable film, because of her, but without her completely unimaginable. The trailer looked much better than the film. It is a comedy, but the laughs are too far, not even a little smile in your face easy to obtain.So it seems there are plenty of negatives about it than the good. I watched it to prove the people are wrong about it, but in the end I was wrong. This is the second time the director and McCarthy together for a film who are the real life couple. But I liked 'Tammy' better, not this one and there will be one more film that I hope they would come up with much more interesting than these two.She is not a solo type star, her films are always the multistarrer. So whenever I hear about her new films, I get curious about her new partner. Kristen Bell was not bad, even Peter Dinklage have given a nice performance. So The casting was good, but they all did not get the good script or the role. I did not enjoy it means not that I won't recommend it. It did not work for me, but it might to you, so I advise be carefully while choosing it.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boss Lacks Funny Content Even With Melissa McCarthy Trying Her Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's cool that Melissa McCarthy has become a leading comedienne. She was awesome in Bridesmaids and she's reaping the just rewards of breaking out in that movie. She followed it up with with some good movies (St. Vincent, Spy) and some not so good ones (The Hangover Part 3, Identity Thief, Tammy) but she's still a leading lady and a funny one at that. I knew The Boss wasn't well received but I thought I would check it out anyway. My family are generally big fans of her movies so I thought why not? I would have been better just passing on this, this is going to be one of the worst movies I see this year.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie actually begins in 1975 when a 5 year old girl Michelle Darnell (who will eventually be Melissa McCarthy) is dropped off back at the orphanage. There's not really a reason given for it but the nun who is in charge tells her that she will eventually find the right family for her. 5 years later the same thing happens again and then another 5 years later it happens again. Michelle is now 15 and tired of the process, she tells herself and the nun that families are for suckers and that she needs no one but herself to get to the top.In present day, Michelle is doing a tour, telling the American public how to achieve success her way through self-reliance and hard work. She comes out on stage on the back of a phoenix and rapping. After the show, she's going through her schedule with her assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). She's pretty disrespectful to her and Claire is getting sick of it. After, Michelle heads up to the roof to meet with a former associate Renault (Peter Dinklage). He used to be Reynold but he fancies himself a samurai. They trade insults and Michelle flaunts that she came out ahead on a recent deal. He tells her that she's guilty of insider trading for what she did but she just tells him that she's just doing what it takes. She leaves in a helicopter with Renault vowing to have her brought down by the SEC.This movie has some talented actresses and actors in it, it's too bad that this movie strands them completely with it's uninteresting plot and awful jokes. Melissa McCarthy co-wrote this movie with the director (and her husband) Ben Falcone. If anything I think this movie shows anything is that after Tammy and now The Boss, maybe they're at their best working separately. McCarthy is still watchable even though she's playing a completely unlikable character. Peter Dinklage really need to pick better movies. He's so great on Game of Thrones but between this and Pixels, he's swinging and missing on movies. I felt bad for Kristen Bell watching this. She's really good in some things and she's not afraid to be in risqué material but nobody seems to be able to give her the right roles (except in House of Lies, she was really good in that).The Boss has a pretty familiar arc to it. The tough businesswoman learns to feel and that friends and family are more important than making money. There's nothing wrong with the plot being done before if the movie can find a new angle on it or be funny enough to distract from it but this movie couldn't accomplish either. Michelle as a character is just such a jerk and so full of herself, you don't connect with her or her inner struggle. I didn't feel any sympathy for her and the turn in the plot where you're supposed to jump to her side is pretty nauseating.The most important thing wrong with The Boss though is that it just isn't funny at all. I maybe laughed one or two times during the movie and for a movie that's over an hour and a half, that's way too little. You could have heard a pin drop where I saw it through the entire film and when a movie doesn't achieve the one requirement of a comedy which is to make people laugh, the bottom line is that it failed.I don't watch movies hoping that they're going to suck. I didn't expect The Boss to be the comedy highlight of 2016 but I thought with McCarthy at the lead, maybe I'd get some laughs out of it. There were none to be had here. I can't recommend this movie on any level even if you're a big Melissa McCarthy fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Boss" has a few redeeming features. Melissa McCarthy, who is quite possibly my least favorite actress in recent memory, is convincing as a self-centered narcissistic, self- indulgent, crude, abrasive, conniving motivational speaker who is talented at understanding everybody except herself, but a bit ditzy in understanding the world around her. Cedric Yarbrough is funny as her sycophantic assistant and Peter Dinklage delivers an interesting performance, as do a few of the other supporting cast. Production values are good with a refreshing lack of jiggly-cam shots. But many of the scenes seem borrowed from earlier films where similar scenes were presented with far more panache. The unwanted orphan that adoptive parents want to return to the orphanage was done much better in "The Three Stooges" and even "Despicable Me." The street rumble seems borrowed from the two Anchorman films. A similar television interview was much more effective in "Magnolia," and Tom Cruise's character was much more interesting. The riches to rags plot doesn't make much sense (Martha Stewart wasn't bankrupted by her insider trading conviction), but was done better in "Get Hard" and even "The Jerk." The sofa gag is a riff on the Murphy bed gags that have been used in movies from Charlie Chaplin to James Bond. But the biggest problem lies in the film's dramatic structure. McCarthy's Darnell needs to find love. She's been tremendously successful financially, but at a cost of betraying Renault, the only man who has ever loved her and her mentor and by closing herself off to all emotional attachments. She needs to reach a dramatic climax where she rejects materialism in favor of Renault's love and Claire's friendship. Instead, she betrays Renault again. They have some sort of physical liaison, but he is nowhere to be seen in the denouement. She doesn't reject materialism. The reconciliation with Claire makes about as much sense as her machinations to betray her. I was surprised to learn that McCarthy had a minor role in possibly my least favorite film of all time, "The Life of David Gale." Like "The China Syndrome" and "The Star Chamber" (two other contenders for my least favorite film of all time), TLoDG uses a contrived and improbable plot to make a liberal political statement at the cost of dramatic impact. It seems the filmmakers are making a similar error here. I'm not a Melissa McCarthy fan. I haven't seen many of her movies and haven't much cared for what I have seen. I regard her as a comic sidekick. She's had the good fortune to be in the right place at a time when there has been lot of feminist sentiment and efforts to give greater visibility to women who do not fit the traditional mold of leading ladies. Here the producers seem to want to make various statements. A woman can be a successful, self- made entrepreneur and role model ? but the dramatic arc would seem to demand that she wind up relatively broke but happy in her romance and family lives. A plus-size woman can be a romantic lead ? but now she has to be the most beautiful woman in the movie, which means making Kristen Bell look a bit dowdy and frumpy and deglamorizing most of the other females in the cast. We're left with a protagonist who has told thousands of devotees they should pursue financial gains even at the loss of personal attachments. We see the effects in Claire's demanding, self-centered, unsympathetic manager. At the end of the movie, Darnell has not moderated or renounced her views or undone the damage she has done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie, but the jokes fell flat. Peter Dinklage's character was especially disappointing, considering he's such a great actor and has played in funny roles before. Melissa McCarthy did her best with what she was given, but they didn't utilize her full capabilities as an actor. Kristen Bell's character was genuinely boring. Tyler Labine played in an unfortunate role but, like McCarthy, he did his best.The drug references in this move weren't funny. The samurai references weren't funny. The sexual more-than-references weren't funny. The couch-flip was funny in the previews but in the movie it was no longer a surprise. There needed to be more moments that surprised the audience like that. The constant references to the tall girl being tall... Yeah, not funny after a hundred times. Once. That's a one-time joke. I think that's partly what happened. Any actually funny material was replayed over and over so that the original joke didn't even get a chuckle toward the end. You can do it, writers. We believe in you.I don't think the actors did anything wrong here, but the writing was very odd (lazy) and the pacing poor. They lingered where they didn't need to linger and ignored opportunities that could have been very funny. I had high hopes for this movie, which definitely contributes to my disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy has had plenty of ups and downs in her career. It seems in recent years she has gone back and forth from landing in hilarious roles to disappointing roles, her last major role being the action comedy 'Spy' from last year. She has often stolen the show in films directed by Paul Feig, 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Heat' to be more specific, but seems to slop in other roles. This film marks her second collaboration with her husband director Ben Falcone, the man behind the critically hammered 'Tammy' which starred McCarthy as the titular character. In this film, McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a chairwoman of a billion dollar company with her best friend Claire (played by Kristen Bell), a single mother of a pre-teen daughter Rachael (played by Ella Anderson), working by her side. In the process, she's made enemies with her former lover Renault (played by Peter Dinklage) after taking his position as manager, and he has vowed revenge against her ever since. After a botched interview with a television personality, Michelle is arrest for insider trading and sent to prison for six months. Upon release, Michelle stuck on the streets with her assets wiped clean, her home on foreclosure, and with nobody to turn to but Claire and her daughter who move her into their house in attempt to get her back on her feet.For the past several years, McCarthey has proved her gift of comedic talent, and this movie does not fail to show it, but she certainly doesn't embrace her full potential in her smart-mouthed role here. What good does she bring to this movie exactly? Well, she doesn't fail bring on some occasional laughter enough to distract you from the thinly written script, and her comedic chemistry with Kristen Bell works, but the jokes don't always hit home. McCarthy tries desperately on bringing out laughter through her shamelessly vulgar dialogue, some of which in the presence of elementary school-aged Ella Anderson. In some scenes, the jokes work, and leave a fair number of people in my theater laughing. In other scenes, they tend to come off as bold and mean-spirited, or otherwise rather forced. A lot of it begins when her character volunteers for Kristen Bell's daughter's Girl Scout. As shown in the trailer, one scene features a violent street brawl between dozens of young-aged girls, a scene where we sit through little children engage in slow motion fist fights, throw each other against cars, karate kick each other in the face, etc. Apparently we are supposed to believe this is funny when it really just comes off as cruel and makes you feel guilty for laughing, if you happen to do so. As the most of the fun and hilarity take place during the first hour, the film completely drops the ball during the second hour and laughs come to a halt. That is when Peter Dinklage begins consuming some major screen time. This actor is shown to have comedic potential, but sadly it doesn't work. The jokes he shoots out never land and his comedic chemistry with McCarthy falls completely flat.The biggest accolade The Boss manages to achieve is being slightly funnier and more fun to watch director Ben Falcone's previous film 'Tammy'. Overall, this definitely doesn't sit on the ladder of Melissa McCarthy's best works, not even close. She and Kristen Bell manage to steal the show here, but only by a short shot. This is comedy that will please mostly fans of Melissa McCarthy, but leave others with a cold shoulder.</fullReview>

Without her, I cannot help but think the film would collapse around her, but her involvement (matched with the character and supporting cast) make the film a success. I struggle to comprehend the negative reviews for this film, as it is nothing but enjoyable from start to finish. A success that should tide McCarthy over until Ghostbusters, in just a few weeks...Summary: Melissa McCarthy is absolutely The Boss, adding another notch to her belt of impressive comedy and hilarious characters, registering in the higher end of her filmography, despite what reviewers would make you believe.I truly do not understand the hate that this filming is attracting.

Ben Falcone's Direction, on the other-hand, is just about okay. Cinematography &amp; Editing, too, are ordinary. Performance-Wise: McCarthy is the life of the show. She's first-rate! Kristen Bell is endearing. Ella Anderson is cute. Peter Dinklage is hilariously over-the-top. Kathy Bates is adequate.On the whole, 'The Boss' isn't without its share of laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, where to start? Perhaps to mention the whole theater was in stitches most of the time? That's always a good sign, even if I missed some lines due to the noise of the laughter. One quick thing to get out of the way: The plot was basically a vehicle to move from one funny scene to the next. There was something about a rich woman who lost everything and tries to get it all back, but that wasn't really important. This movie could have been just as much fun if it involved game show hosts or ballerinas, but the plot as written was fully passable. Remember folks, this was not a drama, but an actual comedy. If hovering undecided over the button on Netflix, the best thing to ask yourself is if you've enjoyed other movies with Melissa McCarthy. She was an absolute scene stealer throughout this movie. She was unabashedly foul-mouthed and as politically incorrect as could be. Kristen Bell got to play the uptight, straight man (or person, in PC-speak). Another sign of a good movie is I never checked my watch once. There even a few good sight gags, something sadly missing in so many high-brow flicks. I'll never look at a sofa bed the same way... It's been a couple of days since we saw this, and my wife and I are still chuckling over this one. It was quite the pleasant surprise.Pay attention to Melissa McCarthy's costumes. She wears a turtleneck in every scene, even as a child. Some were quite over the top, practically covering her chin. This was a running sight gag throughout the movie. It had me chuckling, anticipating each new scene just to see how outlandish the next costume would be.</fullReview>

Living in and out of orphanages growing up hardened her and made her the woman she is today; one of the richest and most powerful women in the world, and former prison inmate. When she is released she has nothing and no one to turn to, except her former assistant Claire (Bell). Willing to accept her in for a few days but after Michelle takes Claire's daughter to her Girl Scout meeting everything changes. After watching the last few McCarthy movies I have said that she only has a few movies left before her humor starts to get played out. After watching this one I realize that I am wrong. She is as hilarious as ever in this one and is one of her best movies she has ever made. She really lets loose in this movie and says and does things that are different then her usual unsure of herself characters, and it works. There is something about her that is just so likable that even when she plays a character like this you can't help but laugh with, and not at. Overall, one of the funniest and smartest comedies I have seen in a while. I laughed out loud many many times watching this, and I watched by myself. McCarthy is a comic genius and I can't wait till her next movie. Watch this today, unless you offend easy. I easily give this an A?a very very hilarious A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ruined movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie. I wanted to watch it since I saw the trailer, and now I'm just disappointed because the movie is not good.I like Melissa McCarthy especially her roles in Spy and The Heat, and I was hoping this movie was like those, but I was wrong. Melissa is great, I like her humor, and the way she acts, and I liked her even in this movie, but the plot, and the actions, it just wasn't my cup of tea.Melissa plays Michelle Darnell, a woman who was alone through her whole life, she never had a family, and she was raised in an orphanage. Life made her strong and she became one of the wealthiest women in America, but after some inside trading, one of her enemies from the past makes sure she ends up in prison. She is alone, broke and broken, and she finds help with her former assistant who takes pity on her.Her assistant Claire (Kristen Bell)has a young daughter in girl scouts. And when Michelle takes her to a meeting one day she realizes she could be rich again if she starts her own girl scouts organization. With Claire's help she manages to start an organization, but in the meantime realizes she started to bond with Claire and her daughter Rachel and gets scared. She sells the company to her enemy Renault, but when she realizes she made a mistake she asks Claire and Rachel for help and they get the company back.The movie was not necessarily so bad, but everything was in the trailer, the funniest jokes and scenes, and that pretty much ruined it for me. That's 4 stars for me, only because I didn't hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All feminine, Bland, Clichéd, Cheeky affair. A total Hit and Run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie primarily because of Melissa McCarthy. Like 'Tammy', 'The Boss' is directed by Ben Falcone, McCarthy's husband and longtime collaborator, and written by them both. The duo has earned a reputation for delivering good humor. Also, it is produced by Will Ferrell's Gary Sanchez Productions. This production house has dished out some really good comedies in the past. But in 'The Boss' they all seem to have lost steam. 'The Boss' is a completely bland affair - one of those hit and run films production houses mass produce in off-season, just to keep their people employed.Story here is completely predictable. It is about an orphan (McCarthy) who ends up as a billionaire only to lose it midway and regain it in the end. The premise is rooted in the common frustrations of ridiculous bosses and mundane modern jobs. The story and screenplay are full of clichéd acts and spineless jokes. There are portions of raw physical comedy too. In a scene (obvious from trailer) McCarthy gets thrown off a sofa bed. There are other scenes involving McCarthy tumbling down a flight of stairs, having sword fights and having fisticuffs. The humor is of poorly calibrated slapstick category. You literally stop laughing after a limit! I actually fast forwarded through many parts in the second half. The plot development seems totally contrived.An all encompassing on-screen feminine presence is a curious aspect of this film. Even the street fights and classroom brawls have zero male presence! Peter Dinklage and Tyler Labine provide for only a feeble male presence in the film. Looks like neo-feminism is the new fad in Hollywood.In the end 'The Boss' is a partial one-time-see. I saw it for McCarthy. I found it to be a waste of talent, screen space, time and energy. I expected it to be better - but it certainly is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedic Wasteland with Occasional Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the writer and director of Tammy starring Melissa McCarthy playing Melissa McCarthy comes The Boss starring Melissa McCarthy playing Melissa McCarthy. Sigh. Thankfully, this isn't nearly as bad as Tammy, but it's not great by any means. Coming off the heels of the unexpectedly appealing and hilarious Spy, Melissa McCarthy is back to her old tricks of playing the same, predictable character. McCarthy's general charisma and comedic timing does aid the film in being a lot funnier than it probably should be. The script, first of all, is not good. Its not terrible by any means, but the story is well worn and so incredibly predictable. Many of the jokes that are laid on the audience during the film (mostly being fueled by the F bomb) are completely unfunny and just awkward and desperate. However, I will admit that there were occasions that were genuinely very funny - mostly thanks to the sheer comedic talent of Melissa McCarthy. As for the likes of Kirsten Bell, she's just there. rarely does she offer an laughs and basically serves as the punching bag that Melissa McCarthy is constantly throwing low blows at for laughs. However, in what was so far a very 'ok' comedy, by the time The Boss reaches its third act, everything falls apart. It also puts forward the totally unnecessary addition of Peter Dinklage comes into play, who offers zero comedic input or any laughs for that matter. The whole third act, looking back at it, was completely unneeded and did not elevate the film in any way, shape or form - but rather completely detract from what was, so far, an 'ok' experience. This ruined anything that may have been the films saving grace in the first two sequence of events.In the end, The Boss, whilst sporadically entertaining and funny in part, is a wholly predictable, disappointing and scattershot comedic wreck that you probably wont remember in two days time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is at times strange and quirky, yet overall, quite funny.Though not a fan of crudeness, obscenities or violent behaviour, especially in kids, I looked beyond that and found the movie humorous, with some off-hand remarks hitting home.The characters didn't have great depth, but we got the gist. Melissa McCarthy is always a joy to watch. Peter Dinklage's character was ironically comical. Below the surface points to note regarding this movie - it's about connecting with people,family, being there for each other, trust, making things right, empowerment, reaching heights one doesn't feel capable of or when others have put you down, rising after a fall and finally, a movie about kicking ass and taking names!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average film, not McCarthy's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tammy Director Ben Falcone reunites with funny lady superstar and wife, Melissa McCarthy who plays The Boss, the obnoxious, crude and power hungry Michelle Darnell. She goes from being a CEO for a Fortune 500 company to losing everything due to being snitched upon by her main competitor and ex-lover Renault, played by Peter Dinklage, and as a results does a short term behind bars. Very little we see of by the way.On her release she has nowhere to go but to seek out her trusted ex-personal assistant, Claire, Kristen Bell, and inadvertently ends up staying with her and her daughter Rachel. Now, Rachel is played by Ella Anderson who's awesome and also in this year's Mother's Day, but this is the bigger role of the two. Darnell, adamant to get herself back on top starts at crumb bottom and with the help of Claire and Rachel forms a brownie empire. Relationships develop and there's so emotional investment there but all is dashed after getting too close to being family. It's never really fully explained why she's so difficult but you get it, she's not the family type and prefers to alienate herself when people get too lovey-dovey. Her character, not the storyline, is borderline Scrooge, just not as cold hearted, but she has a similar turn around. She actually reminded me a lot of Ruby Wax. It has a superb Soundtrack with tracks from T-Pain, Cheap Trick, Foreigner, Nina Simone, Beck and C.C. Music Factory. But the score by Christopher Lennertz is unnoticeable. There's some good scenes, like the heist planning and the street fight but it's McCarthy's put- downs and verbal abuse that's brilliant. Wondering if she ad-libs or if the material is all written out for her. (The film is actually written by both McCarthy and Falcone) Bell is good but young Anderson is amazing. It's not that funny and I'm quite surprised at the 15 certificate the BBFC awarded the film doing class A drug use and a lot of unnecessary sex references. Melissa McCarthy is her usual best but it's far from her best work and funniest at that. It's certainly not Bridesmaids or Spy level but average brainless entertainment. Running Time: 6 The Cast: 6 Performance: 5 Direction: 5 Story: 5 Script: 5 Creativity: 5 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 5 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for Ella Anderson. 53% 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind crass and vulgar - Grimsby (The Brothers Grimsby in the US) was crass and vulgar but also witty, satirical, intelligent and frequently laugh out loud funny. The problem with The Boss is that its just not funny at all - its the laziest effort at comedy I've seen in a while. In the first ten minutes, three key scenes (an opening orphanage scene, then her seminar, then the conversation between her, her assistant and bodyguard) are just lacking any punch at all - there's just nothing to even smile at. It just fails to be interesting on any level, like it was written by a grumpy teenager for an English assignment, when there was something better to do. How it got made, I'll never know. I'm glad I walked out after ten minutes. If you're interested in seeing it, do yourself a favour and download it instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect example of how enough marketing and big name actors will produce a film that grosses enough money to be somewhat profitable, but still terrible at the end of the day. The plot was shaky at best, the jokes toed an odd line between being childish and very crude, and the end result was a disappointment. The film felt awkward, forced, and cheap throughout its entirety. After watching, I was honestly confused as to why Kathy Bates and Peter Dinklage agreed to have any role in the film whatsoever. I felt as if Melissa McCarthy was simply yelling at me for the entire movie, and was hoping that I would laugh either out of confusion or because that was what I was supposed to do. It wasn't the worst movie I had ever seen, and I would be lying if I said I did not laugh a few times as I watched. The Boss has a few laughs in it that will make you not completely regret spending your time watching it, but as you watch it, you will probably think that the movie is a quickly and poorly made sham.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What? No Springsteen Cameo?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 has been very successful so far with releasing humorless comedies like Keanu, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising and this excuse of a "comedy."Now, admittedly, it isn't a crap movie. None of the movies listed above were. It's just that I didn't hardly laugh at all. In fact, the first and only genuine laugh came towards the end involving the movie's saving grace: Tyler Labine. This actual LOL moment for me was followed by two more chuckles in the climax, one of which also involved Labine and his sucking dick gag. So to speak.But, then again, Tyler's always funny. Can't say the same for Melissa McCarthy. When she's not trying to be a, ah-hem, huge bitch, she's actually a laugh riot. Like she was in Spy and Bridesmaids. Sadly, she's more miss than hit.The Boss is basically the Martha Stewart story told too late. (She's sadly even referenced here in case anyone actually missed that. Sigh.) After Michelle (McCarthy) gets out of prison for insider trading, she's cooks up a brownie empire to bounce back. (Can't believe I just made a lame joke that worked better than 99% of the jokes in this film.)The movie needed conflict, so enter in the always fantastic, though lost here, Peter Dinklage. He did try, but was kinda short on jokes. (There. That, too, was funnier than, well, 79% of the comedy in the movie.)Again, it's actually not a bad movie. It flows, fine to watch, but just don't expect a comedy or to laugh much. If you can make it to the climax, it's definitely the best part for jokes.***Final thoughts: Ahhh, my Tyler Labine. I had no idea he was in this and so glad when he showed up. Plus giving him scenes about sucking dick, and even partially showing it, that, in itself, is an actually recommendation from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good use of my time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>19 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Boss. When wealthy businesswoman Michelle (Melissa McCarthy) is sent to prison for insider trading she is left with nothing except her massive ego. Turning to her former assistant Claire for help, she ingratiated herself into the lives of her and her daughter with a grand plan to become successful once again. Sounds good on paper but this film, although mildly entertaining and fairly easy to watch, did not live up to its promise. As with many comedies, this film tried too hard. We were given all the funny bits in the trailers and what was left was insipid and dreary. There were a few funny moments throughout but mainly the humour was inappropriate to the plot and uncomfortable to watch. It's a shame because it had a strong cast, my favourite being the character of Mike, played by Tyler Labine, who added just the right amount of desperate craziness in his bid to woo and date Claire. Melissa McCarthy was wasted in this role. Glad to have seen it, will not rush to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girl Scout cookies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-written by McCarthy and her husband as well as directed by her husband I can only conclude that Ben Falcone does not know of his wife's comedy strength, then again neither does McCarthy.In The Boss McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a go getting brash businesswoman who fell from the top and jailed for insider trading. Upon her release Darnell moves into the home of her put upon former Personal Assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and her daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) and end up masterminding a campaign to sell girl scout cookies. This puts them into conflict with a rival girl scout group and a former bitter rival comes back on the scene Renault (Peter Dinklage) who wishes to destroy her for once and for all.McCarthy looks weird with a collection of turtlenecks that makes you think that there is something wrong with her neck. The film should had aimed for some kind of School of Rock vibe but McCarthy constantly curses around the kids, is mean spirited and shows little empathy even though at the beginning we see her as a child rejected by various foster parents. There are some bright moments with some decent knockabout comedy when McCarthy's girl scouts tussle with the rivals but the film is too unfocused and meanders all over the place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605; - McCarthy/Falcone partnership again fails to deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone's second collaboration as star/director and co-writers. The first was the tragically unfunny Tammy, and The Boss is no improvement - in fact it seems they've taken a step back. Whereas McCarthy played someone who wasn't funny in Tammy, she at least had some vague character depth and sympathy. In this movie, not only is she not funny, but her character is revolting and enraging, and never really redeems herself (even in the hugely predictable and out-of-place sentimental speech near the end).The main problem lies with the screenplay. Although the premise has some potential (a millionaire losing her company and starting from the bottom again), the trouble is in the dialogue. As is often the case these days, the scenes are about double the length they should be, for example the boobs scene, which is about 7 seconds in the trailer and 4 minutes in the movie. The constant swearing, and then repeating the same words (like "Cumbersnatch") are not anywhere near as funny as they think they are, which makes the movie feel incredibly self-involved and pretentious.The second problem is Falcone and McCarthy's partnership. Being married, they clearly think more of each other than everyone else does. Because she's such a vibrant screen presence, Falcone completely gives McCarthy freedom to do what she wants on screen which damages the flow of the movie. Also his comic timing is poor - McCarthy is hilarious in movies like Spy, The Heat and Bridesmaids, because Paul Feig knows how to direct comedy, and clearly Falcone doesn't.On the plus side, Kristen Bell does well in her role as McCarthy's weary assistant. Her relationship with her daughter Ella Anderson is possibly the only thing in the movie that feels honest and true, and gives the film some form of substance. Unfortunately, she's outweighed by the hilariously terrible performances by everyone else, especially Dinklage and Mumolo.McCarthy is capable of so much more. If she and Falcone really respected each other, they would stop working together. Bell is good to watch though, and she alone elevates this review from one to two stars. Though it's still a waste of 90 minutes of your time.2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't be The Boss of everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review of The Boss (spoiler free)** (2/5) Cast: Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Bell, Peter Dinklage with Ella Anderson and Tyler Labine.Plot: A titan of industry is sent to prison after she's caught insider trading. When she emerges ready to re-brand herself as America's latest sweetheart, not everyone she screwed over is so quick to forgive and forget.Melissa McCarthy in my eyes is just a comedy goddess but not in this. In this movie she plays Michelle Darnell who is the 47th wealthiest woman in the world and just a titan of industry but other than that her character very flat and the material is just over used. Director Ben Falcone also known for Tammy (2014) another immature adult comedy just like this one.After being released from jail she seems lost and tries to seek the help of Claire (Bell) and her daughter Rachel (Anderson) to try an make herself a better person. She gives Rachel some business advice to run a successful cookie company and she gives Claire advice on dating. Peter Dinklage who plays Renault (not the car) is just as equally bad even he doesn't make the film any better.Just so you know this is an adult comedy but it just feels rushed and isn't the raw humor we're used to from McCarthy. There is no story and no character development it feels rushed, and made me feel guilty for watching it as if to say "why am I watching this." It certainly isn't as funny and as enjoyable as last years Spy which was the funniest film of 2015 and just a balls out smash. There are two funny moments in this film and only two this should be left alone.Here are some points as to why this comedy should be avoided:Character: Michelle Darnell has a very Trump-esque feel to her and other than her just being the 47th richest in the world, again like in Tammy her character feels rushed. Michell starts life as an orphan being taken in and out of the orphanage where she lives even when she tries to change she is still a bad character, and still over done. Just as humorous as she was in Bridesmaids.Story: Other than the story of her being wealthy there is no other story better than that, it's not even well written by Falcone or Steve Mallory. To be frank this is just a plot-less and unfunny mess. I miss Spy. Renault's story is no better he is a business man who likes to take whatever everybody else has got because he feels he should have it. The story is just to real life it's just silly.This a cheaply done comedy and I thought comedy meant funny but this is just unfunny and as I said before just a mess. Like Tammy this is one to be missed.Verdict: Stupid and immature. Melissa is not her funniest and not her silliest if you like Melissa McCarthy just avoid this. Comedy not worth watching.4/10 plain bad.</fullReview>

So, I definitely liked the idea of the girls forming a company and learning business and becoming independent. And I actually enjoyed the fight in the street.

		<fullReview>With Mccarthy, I can take her or leave her, but for some reason, she has a lot of haters out there, and i'm guessing that if the new Ghostbusters movie bombs, she's the one who will get the blame for it.I haven't seen her in a comedy without Feig at the helm, I heard really bad things about Tammy, and St. Vincent isn't exactly comedy fare.But I thought I'd give this one a go because it sounded so much like the premise of Get Hard, and I don't think there would be a comedy released so soon that would be more poisonous than that.Huge(ly) successful businesswoman Michelle Darnell is convicted of insider trading and sentenced to prison.After being released, she is forced to move in with a long-suffering employee of hers, and tries to earn redemption and revamp her public image by helping a group of young girls in their quest to sell brownies.But ex lover/business partner Peter Dinklidge still has a grudge with her, and wanted to ruin her......It's not a terrible film by any means, It follows the same trope as every predictable comedy narrative when someone is trying to succeed/get back on their feet.They are at rock bottom to begin with, then they come up with an idea, have a wonderful success for a while, jealous rival takes over, things look bad for the protagonist, all comes good at the end with a life lesson learned.It's no different here, apart form the fact that lots of young girls have abuse hurled at them by the titular character and will probably be scarred for life.If they make a sequel, they can set it twenty years in the future, where all the girls meet up because they are at the same counselling session for the mental torture they endured in this film.McCarthy is fine, as is Bell, but it's the random moments that really make the film an oddity. Like the street fight, and the heist scenario.And let's not forget the 'hilarious' turn from Dinklage. If you thought he was over the top in 'Pixels', he's beyond pantomime in this.But he is hardly in it, and with the rest of the random scenes, Kathy Bates pointless cameo, and some of the poorest editing i've seen in a long time (I honestly thought I was seeing some weird edited version), it doesn't leave any bad mark on the film.So all in all, it's very predictable stuff, with a couple of funny moments, but it goes to prove that working with your spouse doesn't really pay off.Just ask Jennifer Aniston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun simple dirty little comedy that McCarthy has become known for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At some point Melissa McCarthy became a comedy superstar. It seems to me that The Boss wasn't even marketed as I never saw a trailer or hardly any advertising. It still grossed 60 million dollars and made money. The Boss is anything but good. Its cheesy and ridiculous, contrived and silly but you know what it's fun and easy to watch and exactly what fans of McCarthy should expect. It is far from her best but to completely trash the film doesn't make sense because it is watchable and entertaining and attempts to have some heart too. Perhaps the biggest negative I could say about it is that it doesn't need to be as crude as it is. I think it would have worked better as a "family" or "PG" movie but it bases a lot of comedy off of excessive bad language which tends to be a staple of Melissa McCarthy films. Uniquely this was co-written by Melissa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone and if you liked Tammy, you'll find this very similar. The Boss is perhaps a little more predictable and there is some really ridiculous scenes but turn your brain off, sit back and laugh.Melissa McCarthy has essentially one comedic role she can play and she can twist that into certain characters and she does it again as former financial guru Michelle Darnell. Her character is the one you love to hate and she's mean and scrooge like and is supposed to find some retribution but the character never changes much. Kristen Bell is actually very good as Darnell's unwilling partner and protégé. Bell does a really good job and she grounds the silliness quite well. Peter Dinklage is off the wall ridiculous. He even takes it further than what the silly film should allow. I think Dinklage can do Game of Thrones and anything else is just ridiculous. Tyler Labine is sort of forced into the story as Bell's romantic interest but he has good comedic timing and finds his moments.McCarthy's husband Ben Falcone co-writes, co-produces with her, shows up briefly in a cameo and does directing duty. As only his second credit, he does a decent job. This was meant to be dumb and it is. It's absolutely ridiculous but I think I came in with very low expectations so anything better than rotten is okay in my books. That is setting a low bar but this is one that truly needs to be taken as is and not dissected because there is not much below the surface but you can still find some ridiculous comedy, not unlike a Saturday Night Live skit that runs long. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it-- Black Ironic Humour no sugar-coating!! ---Finally a comedy in years that made me laugh...and did so from beginning end! The story is actually cute and quirky, and even thou it is comedy there are also a few life lessons one can learn by watching this film. I have no idea why certain members have a negative view on this movie. I liked it because it is raw and is sarcastic--- if your only into just Rated G or foreign drama films this is not for you then stick to Walt Disney! I also think reviews from certain members first regarding the movie as being vulgar, but end up themselves writing vulgar reviews with inappropriate language...if want to set an example then do 100% I give the movie a big thumbs up!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on, it was funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get what all the bad reviews are for. Melissa McCarthy is a comedic mastermind. I laughed from beginning to end. I saw this with my mom, dad, &amp; my grandma. That was probably a mistake but all of us enjoyed it. Although it had constant language, a bit too much sexual content, and a sort of corny atmosphere, it was an overall funny and awesome experience. Daddy's Home (2015) was given amazing reviews and it was corny as well. In my opinion this movie is on of the best of 2016 so far. There were a few uncomfortable parts considering that i had my parents there but it was overall yet another hilarious movie by Melissa McCarthy. I don't get how this has a 20% on rotten tomatoes. i would give it 78% at the least. I also don't get how this was rated a 5.2/10 on IMDb. IT WAS FUNNY! People just don't get comedy if they didn't like this movie. I however four it to be a hilarious, fun, and great experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the hate for this movie? It was funny. Like very funny. Yeah, the humor was a little stupid sometimes, but it told a decent story. The opening is hilarious, the main character is hilarious. The third act is a little stupid, but yeah it was supposed to be a little stupid. This movie was tastefully vulgar and tastefully offensive. The slapstick and physical humor is a bit hit and miss and I could have used a little more of Melissa's character as opposed to Veronica Mars, but...I still liked it! It was funny! It was cheesy, but the cheese made sense and was established well! Honestly, why is there so much hate? I loved it. And its feminist themes are very well written and acted upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melissa McCarthy steals the show by only a short shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy has had plenty of ups and downs in her career. It seems in recent years she has gone back and forth from landing in hilarious roles to disappointing roles, her last major role being the action comedy 'Spy' from last year. She has often stolen the show in films directed by Paul Feig, 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Heat' to be more specific, but seems to slop in other roles. This film marks her second collaboration with her husband director Ben Falcone, the man behind the critically hammered 'Tammy' which starred McCarthy as the titular character. In this film, McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a chairwoman of a billion dollar company with her best friend Claire (played by Kristen Bell), a single mother of a pre-teen daughter Rachael (played by Ella Anderson), working by her side. In the process, she's made enemies with her former lover Renault (played by Peter Dinklage) after taking his position as manager, and he has vowed revenge against her ever since. After a botched interview with a television personality, Michelle is arrest for insider trading and sent to prison for six months. Upon release, Michelle stuck on the streets with her assets wiped clean, her home on foreclosure, and with nobody to turn to but Claire and her daughter who move her into their house in attempt to get her back on her feet. For the past several years, McCarthey has proved her gift of comedic talent, and this movie does not fail to show it, but she certainly doesn't embrace her full potential in her smart-mouthed role here. What good does she bring to this movie exactly? Well, she doesn't fail bring on some occasional laughter enough to distract you from the thinly written script, and her comedic chemistry with Kristen Bell works, but the jokes don't always hit home. McCarthy tries desperately on bringing out laughter through her shamelessly vulgar dialogue, some of which in the presence of elementary school-aged Ella Anderson. In some scenes, the jokes work, and leave a fair number of people in my theater laughing. In other scenes, they tend to come off as bold and mean-spirited, or otherwise rather forced. A lot of it begins when her character volunteers for Kristen Bell's daughter's Girl Scout. As shown in the trailer, one scene features a violent street brawl between dozens of young-aged girls, a scene where we sit through little children engage in slow motion fist fights, throw each other against cars, karate kick each other in the face, etc. Apparently we are supposed to believe this is funny when it really just comes off as cruel and makes you feel guilty for laughing, if you happen to do so. As the most of the fun and hilarity take place during the first hour, the film completely drops the ball during the second hour and laughs come to a halt. That is when Peter Dinklage begins consuming some major screen time. This actor is shown to have comedic potential, but sadly it doesn't work. The jokes he shoots out never land and his comedic chemistry with McCarthy falls completely flat.The biggest accolade The Boss manages to achieve is being slightly funnier and more fun to watch director Ben Falcone's previous film 'Tammy'. Overall, this definitely doesn't sit on the ladder of Melissa McCarthy's best works, not even close. She and Kristen Bell manage to steal the show here, but only by a short shot. This is comedy that will please mostly fans of Melissa McCarthy, but leave others with a cold shoulder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McCarthy carries the film to make it pretty funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy continues her comedic rise with the funny and cute film, The Boss. The story revolves around McCarthy's character Michelle Darnell as she tries to rebuild her financial empire after being accused of insider trading. McCarthy embodies the crude business woman who is a female version of Donald Trump.There are plenty of one-liners and physical comedy gags. McCarthy throws herself around for laughs falling down steps and getting thrown by the sofa bed. The plot doesn't have that much clever points to it, just sort of follows a typical story about being alone and involves a pseudo girl scout cookie entrepreneurship program that help Darnell get back to the top.One incredibly funny part was Renault or Ronald played by Peter Dinklage as the rival corporate owner. Dinklage takes his acting chops and adds them to the ridiculous wannabe samurai.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I didn't want to go see this after being let down by Trainwrek, but I went and watched it and loved this unapologetic film for adults, it was made for adults to forget your problems and laugh.This movie relies on physical comedy, adult jokes, that shines in the same standard of Caddy Shack. Making fun of lesbians? Seriously who has the balls to do that anymore?! Right off the back you know not to take this COMEDY serious, if you go to forget the worlds problems and not bring them with you, its a good time, for adults.Absolutely fantastic time.I found myself comparing Melissa McCarthy's role to Donald Trump, how is that not funny, in anyway the slapstick humor is what I expected from McCarthy. Peter Dinklage's role was funny, because its a comedy. I got the feeling that he was playing a person who just happened to be a small person.There is mix violence/vulgarity, I seen as an up to date Laverne &amp; Shirley, great cast too, on line with Deadpool, Hot Fuzz, etc.), but The Boss definitely is a great ride if you are there to laugh.I loved the film. I recommend it for a good time with friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had me and my friends laughing several times throughout!!! Other reviewers comment on the fact that there was simply no humour, but some jokes just aren't funny to others which is of course understandable. McCarthy strikes back by doing what she does best, and that's making us laugh! This comedy will make you look like an absolute fool in front of others in the cinema - that is, because you will be laughing so hard! Funny characters, hilarious jokes and bizarre scenarios all combine to make a very enjoyable film. Don't expect a clever plot or engaging story because this is meant to be FUNNY and I can assure you that it exceeds that label! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on!! Flat Out Physical Comedy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've decided that society is not yet ready for a woman to be the star of a physical comedy. The public just can't handle it. When Jim Carrey does it..hell, when the 3 Stooges do it, it's comedic genius. But when a woman does it, it's vile, dark and I've even heard people say immoral. I suspect the ones rating this film are the men who are threatened by it. I'm glad I'm secure in my manhood enough to laugh at true comedic talent like Melissa McCarthy.I cannot believe the complaints I've heard about this movie, and none of them true. Yes, it was dirty. Yes, it was nasty. Yes, it was violent. But I'll tell you this, it was damned funny! As funny as the best male-driven dark comedy out there IMHO. I laughed more in this than I did Bad Santa, and to be honest, except for the gratuitous use of the "C" word ion one scene, this film was much less disgusting and vile. The scout-scout fight scene was hilarious (and by the way, those were OBVIOUSLY grown stunt women, they didn't even try to hide that) and the other physical scenes like the couch-bed and the stairs at the country club were laugh-out-loud funny.People, get over yourselves and stop the sexist-based biased. Just sit back, enjoy the film for what it is and laugh. More importantly, stop rating films poorly because you're threatened by a strong female lead in a physical comedy. Enjoy it, because if you can get over your biased, The Boss was one HELL OF A FUNNY MOVIE!</fullReview>

Yes, there are curse words, there are cartoon-sh fights, the unsettling "children of the corn" battle. But i think this all together makes a great comedy. I think Hollywood needs to toughen up a little in the sterile and boring world of political correctness. We are not watching "House on a prairie" here. I mean, there is nothing wrong with the "House...", but this is Melissa McCarthy comedy. Delivered as advertised.To be honest, i loved the speech in the beginning. Very empowering.

		<fullReview>I honestly can't understand how this movie is getting such bad reviews. If you have watched any Melissa McCarthy movie, you should know what to expect. I laughed from beginning to end. I've found Melissa hilarious in every movie she's been in, even if the movie itself wasn't that funny. (Bridesmaids) Imo, if you enjoyed The Heat or Tammy especially, with their raunchier humor, you'll love The Boss. I saw it on $5 Tuesday, and would have gladly paid triple the price to see it. It seems like critics hate Melissa, and the public can't handle her adult humor being as we're in the year of the butt-hurt, part 2. My advice is to lighten up. Go into this movie with all your guards down and allow yourself to laugh at everything, whether it's p.c. or not. Laughter is the best medicine. People are getting too serious these days, as well as being too easily offended. This is a rated R comedy. That means rude and crude humor and anything over- the-top to get a laugh. If that's not your thing then by all means avoid this movie. If you find offensive humor funny and want to pee your pants laughing then do yourself a favor and let loose the laughter. Solid, hysterically funny film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boss (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, if you don't like Melissa McCarthy, just don't go see The Boss. It's not some surprise role where she showcases her broad dramatic acting talent that will be loved and adored the world over. It's a Melissa McCarthy comedy, and I look for two things in comedies: a relatively likable atmosphere and, ya know, comedy. Funny comedy. The Boss has just enough of both of those to recommend to a comedy fan even if it's not as strong as McCarthy's work with Paul Feig. In The Boss, business tycoon Michelle Darnell is sent to prison for insider trading, and after she's released from prison five months later, Michelle is ready to rebuild her fortune at any cost. She is taken in by an old employee, Claire Rawlins, whose to- die-for brownies present the perfect opportunity to build another dynasty. With the help of Claire, her daughter and her girl scout troop, Michelle starts the brownie making business, but Michelle learns that people she screwed over in the past aren't so quick to forgive and forget. Melissa McCarthy has a knack for making the most despicable characters actually seem someone likable (maybe that's just because I can relate to an arrogant power-hungry business tycoon?), so you never outright hate Michelle Darnell. She grew up moving around several foster families, so it's hard not to show some sympathy towards her character and why she ended up so narcissistic. Although some of the jokes fall flat, there are two more jokes to make up for it, and there's some hilariously memorable lines in The Boss. Although it's not as consistently funny as some of her other work, The Boss should please Melissa McCarthy fans until Ghostbusters this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the trailer and generally enjoy Melissa's movies along with my fiancé. Prior to going I read all the negative reviews and low score on IMDb so I went in expecting the worst, but was surprised it was funny.Reading the negative reviews I kept seeing them talk about vulgar jokes in the movie which I can see as a problem, but the trailer had some of those same jokes. So what were these people expecting from the movie? The trailer sums it up perfectly. I honestly think most people are upset simply because of the vulgar language/jokes while there are children in the movie. Including some of those vulgar remarks are made by the children. So if you look at that as being bad, don't watch the movie. If you are a grown up that knows majority of children cuss away from their parents then you will probably enjoy it.You can wait for it to come out, not a theater must, but worth seeing at some point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Melissa Film That Lacks Quality Writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another beautiful day another reason to head back into the theater. Hi I'm Robbie Karim and that despicable display of comedy is my attempt at a funny opening for my latest review. Today we look at the latest production starring Melissa McCarthy called the Boss, a film that looks promising for a quick laugh. However, does this movie shine in terms of quality or is it another mediocre media designed to net our money? Let's get this review started then and see if we can answer that question. THE GOOD: ? Very funny moments ? Cute moral built into the movie ? Fairly Fast pace ? McCarthy's actingThe Boss is certainly a humorous film that uses a lot of McCarthy's old tricks that we've become accustomed to. McCarthy herself bears most of the comedic weight using her delivery as the main punch to get you laughing. She's loud, drawn out, and she has the sass that I can't help but chuckle at every now and then. Kristen Bell and Ella Anderson assisted with keeping the film fun in two ways. The first, and major contribution was being the medium for McCarthy to bounce her jokes off, where they acted as props to react and keep the rants going. And the second contribution was bringing the cute, life lessons that every comedy film seems to need. In the Boss' case, that moral is family and these three actresses do make a fun, interesting family to watch. This dynamic keeps the plot going and thanks to some decent editing helps avoid some longwinded and slow plots that Hollywood likes to waste our time with. THE BAD: ? A lot of scenes already shown in the trailers ? Some comedic scene went on too long ? Not the most unique or original film ? Too much obsession with genitalia and sexNo surprise that the trailers give a lot of comedy away and the Boss is another victim of this trend. You will catch a lot of the more unique moments on the commercials, which depending on how much TV you watch, can dilute the comedic punch it was intended to bring. Fortunately there were still golden nuggets still buried in the movie, but even these weren't as funny as some of the other things that have come out of McCarthy's films. The problem was these jokes weren't that original, easily blending in with the sea of Melissa McCarthy jokes that we've seen. In addition, the scenes not shown in the commercials centered very heavily on sex, which seems to be the only medium they think audiences like. The Boss doesn't even try to put cleverness behind their dialogue, instead relying on the delivery and a low comedy threshold to carry their writing. If relentless vulgarity is your bread and butter, this is the movie for you, but for me well it got old after a while, especially when you see as many films as I do. I can't deny I laughed at a few dirty moments, but some scenes where they bantered on and on crossed over the stupid line. The Final Verdict: The Boss is a fun film that takes its place in the mediocre works meant to kill time. However it certainly isn't the greatest of Melissa McCarthy's works and the lack of originality, wit, or even balance are the components that weaken this film. But it still feels like a Melissa McCarthy film and those who are extreme fans of this movie will laugh their heads off regardless of the stale tactics and lazier writing. Regardless I can't recommend this one for a trip to the theater, but then again I'm just a reviewer and can only share my opinions. Again this is a fun Melissa McCarthy movie and will most likely crack everyone up, I'm just not the biggest fan of sexual humor and I see more movies and trailers that really dilute humor for me. My scores are:Comedy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been more Boss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melissa McCarthy has entered that zone where I'll go see a movie if she's starring in it. Good for her and funny women everywhere, not so good for me.The Boss was weak. It had a lot of good jokes and good punchlines but they did not hit me as hard as you would expect from someone as funny as McCarthy.I would not go as far as to say she was phoning in her performance. I think she brought her A game, but the movie itself is a C tops.Kristen Bell for the most part was the straight man to McCarthy's comedy, but the chemistry between these two seemed lackluster. Tyler Labine seems to be going somewhere as Bell's love interest, but his screen time was really coming to little too late.The concept of a Martha Stewart styled situation, bouncing back by selling girl scout cookies was Boss. The material with McCarthy interacting with the girls and teaching them big business is funny.But the big laughs... Peter Dinklage (pun implied). He plays McCarthy's ex-lover turned business rival, and his whole persona of a wound tightly Mongol who keeps focus with his interest in Japanese Samurai culture was golden. I loved all of it.Overall, it's good for a few laughs, if you catch it on Netflix, but it's not the strongest comedy one of the Queens of comedy as every done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly diversified portfolio of comedic stock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year Melissa McCarthy was a spy; and this year, she's the boss. Over and over again, McCarthy proves that she is a brilliantly talented funny lady. And whereas some may see this movie as a sloppy pandering comedy, I see it as a fantastically entertaining movie with a pretty good plot filled with well-developed characters. No story exists without conflict, and comedy is no different. The best comedies are those full of conflict that ignites the hilarity and irony. Very much in the vein of other McCarthy comedies, The Boss is over the top. But, that's perfectly acceptable because the movie certainly opens with a larger than life scene, and the movie never pretends to be something that it's not. This type of comedy knows exactly what it is, and it rocks it! I always have more respect for movies that do not pretend to be anything other than what they are. It's designed to provide an escape from the doldrums and mildly depressive lives many of us have and provide us with the best medicine?laughter. Is this new comedy on par with Bridesmaids or Spy? No. But, is it funny, filled with fun characters, conflict, and satire/parody? YES.At first glance, this movie appears to be another zany comedy that only McCarthy can pull off. Much in the same way Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are often type casted. But, a closer look at The Boss reveals a surprisingly well-developed and executed plot that is incredibly well-paced and includes impeccable comedic timing. Like with Poehler and Fey's Sisters, this movie too has a heart-warming message throughout the narrative. You'll just have to watch it to find out what that is. Like with the opening scene at Chicago's United Center with Darnell descending to the stage on a fiery phoenix alive with pyrotechnics, Michelle herself is larger than life. Interestingly, this opening parallels the career or acting-style of McCarthy. She is the type of actor that has yet to prove a wide range of characters; but with the characters she plays, she is often the most dominant character whether among the supporting or leading cast. We expect her to provide us with that which we are accustomed to watching and enjoying. And in that respect, she has yet to fail her audience.The phoenix at the beginning also symbolizes, as many of us know, the rising from ashes of defeat to become even more resilient and powerful than before. The character of Michele Darnell is very much a phoenix in this story. But is she the only phoenix? No. Michelle's former assistant Claire is also a type of phoenix. Granted, she was not on top of the world and fell from splendor, but she also takes a journey similar to the phoenix. As Michelle's assistant, she had a good job (although not paid nearly as well as she should have been)?let's just go with the fact that she was employed. When Michelle lost her assets, she was no longer able to pay Claire and she was forced to take employment elsewhere. From riding around with Michelle in Cadillac Escalades to working in a cubical in a administrative pool, Claire fell from the glamour she was associated with by extension. After several turning points in the movie, which you will just have to see for yourself, Claire begins to rise up to achieve goals she never thought she would?personal and professional triumphs.Unlike many comedies, this one has a dynamic range of dialog, physical antics, and high brow humor that is sure to keep you laughing during the movie. Furthermore, contrary to how many may perceive or expect of comedies, it is important that the audience not continuously laugh the entire time. If there is so much "funny" in the story structure, then the moments that should elicit the most laughter won't succeed because they will just fall in line with the rest. It's like Michelangelo's famous Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco. Although I have never been, from others who have told me about their travels, the ceiling is not nearly as impressive as one may think it to be. Why is that? Because there are many painted ceilings throughout the chapel so Michelangelo's masterpiece is fairly anti-climactic. Fortunately, The Boss strikes a pleasant balance and timing between the high comedic elements in plot and dialog. Another component of this movie that is sure to please the audience is the cameo by Kathy Bates! Thats right. Better known for her more serious roles, Kathy Bates is one of the most amazing actors because she can truly play a wide range of characters in film or television from the serious to the funny. It takes only the highest level of acting to be able to deliver brilliance in such a short amount of screen time. Plus, having Bates just classes up the film a little!If you love Japanese katana fights, this movie has it! If you are a fan of McCarthy's style of comedy? You won't be disappointed. Having a bad week and just need to laugh for a while, then this movie is for you! There is little that I did not enjoy about this comedy. By no means to I argue that this is an amazing film?certainly that isn't the case. But, is it s FUN movie that is actually well- produced, written, and acted? Yes it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Showcase For Melissa/Flimsy Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Boss", starring Melissa McCarthy-Mike &amp; Molly_tv, Gilmore Girls_tv; Kristen Bell-House of Lies_tv, Veronica Mars_tv; Tyler Labine- Animal Practice_tv, Reaper_tv and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_tv, Threshold_tv.This is a comedy directed by Ben Falcone, Melissa's real life husband. He also usually makes a cameo appearance in her movies, as he does here- he plays Melissa's lawyer. Anyway, Melissa plays an orphan that turns her sad, homeless past into an inspirational-and quite wealthy- motivational speaker. One of her big talking points includes telling people who want to be successful, 'Don't let families or friends get in your way!' Kristen plays her overworked-and underpaid-assistant. Melissa gets caught by Peter, a former lover and now business rival, who turns her in for insider trading and Melissa goes to prison. When she comes out, she has lost everything and moves in with Kristen, just until she can get back on her feet, of course. Kristen has found a new but boring job in Melissa's absence and Tyler plays a co-worker that likes Kristen. Melissa hatches a scheme to get back in with the rich crowd but will she revert back to her old ways-not caring for people-or will she know what it means to be part of a loving family? What do you think? The story is kind of flimsy but if you like Melissa, she is funny. There are some bloopers shown, just as the end credits start. It's rated "R" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 39 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

The author of Helen's cluster puck is, of course, THE BOSS, known to all conscious U.S. residents as Donald Trump. "Melissa's" nemesis here, played by Peter Dinklage, is a very thinly disguised caricature of Trump's opponent for the Rich People Party nomination this year, Ted Cruz. Rather than Texting everyone a lie about Dr. Ben Carson dropping out of the Iowa Caucus, Dinklage's significantly-more-principled Beta Cruz drops a dime to snitch out Melissa's Trump clone to the SEC. Anyone who's followed the War of the Wives waged between Cruz and Trump in Reality surely can ferret out this pair's subconscious agenda, but Universal uses its Artistic License to flesh this out with the BOSS' climactic Horror Scene, showing Dinklage and McCarthy Canoodling. Since the Democratic Process has proved pretty horrible in its own right, Universal seems likely to spoof it in an upcoming Summer Release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Melissa McCarthy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michelle Darnell(Melissa McCarthy) a billionaire, who suddenly loses her fortune, and is sent to prison for insider trading. After five months she is released, ends up staying with her former employee(Kristen Bell) who is also a single parent. But finds a way to build things back up, with a brownie empire.Melissa McCarthy really jumps out the screen to you, even if the movie is bad, Melissa McCarthy always find a way to make it interesting. Her husband Ben Falcone directs it, and also co wrote it with McCarthy. Melissa McCarthy is really funny here, playing a hateful character you can not help but really like. She and Kristen Bell play off each other with such perfection. Peter Dinklage is also quite the scene stealer, when he is on camera, he goes for the moment each time. This is not for everybody, It's not all family oriented, but not overly raunchy either, I mean it comes but never hangs on for too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised so many people don't like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to read so many negative reviews about this movie. I just got back from the movie theatre with a group of 6 people and while some of us found it funnier then others, we all enjoyed it. When the movie first started we all thought it looked like it was going to be cheesy but within the first 10 minutes all of us were giggling or outright laughing (and continued to laugh throughout the movie). Everyone else in the theatre seemed to me laughing too! The premise behind the story is unrealistic but that is part of what made the movie so funny for me and the group I was with. This was one of the only comedy movies that has made me laugh out loud in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>comedy gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, Melissa McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell who didn't really have a family and was bounced around from one foster home to another decides to depend on herself and make herself a business woman who becomes rich and helps others gain money. Things go downhill for Michelle when she is accused of insider trading and framed by an old lover of hers who wanted revenge against her over a promotion years earlier wanting payback. Broke and penniless, Michelle ends up staying with her former assistant Claire and her daughter Rachel. However Michelle decides to start anew and start a new business making brownies and helping out fellow girl scouts. I will say while it is not the best of Melissa Mccarthy's works but I do feel that she does entertain and make people laugh. Kristen Bell is quite hilarious as a comedian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie was Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it last night and didn't expect too much from all the bad reviews. Found myself laughing a lot. This is one of her best movies. Glad it was R rated and raunchy! This is a comedy not an academy award winner! Ton of funny scenes! The fight scene between the two girl scout troops was great. Plot worked simple and made the movie a fun ride. Most comedies get panned by critics. little Peter D was great as usual! People are a little to hard on this movie, There's been a lot worse, a lot worse! Mellissa is a funny lady and I enjoy her timing and her physical comedy. Chicago was a great city for this movie to be based on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for Kids but great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mellisa McCarthy is hilarious in this movie. It is raunchy humor but if your good with that it is the best. The whole theater was laughing and with a few gasps at some of her references. I and my wife found it very funny. I would highly recommend. a lot of the comments I have seen are likely prudish types who really shouldn't have been in this type of movie in the first place. It follow the "This is 40" and the movie with Sandra Bullock. Probably better. I will be seeing it again when it comes out on DVD. Very funny as long as your not looking for too much of a story. Kristen Bell is excellent in it as well as the girl that plays her daughter. Well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviews that didn't find it funny, are not human, lot funnier towards the end where there was lot of laughter. Sure there some words in front of kids, but maybe that was dubbed in, more realistically, despite how you think your kids are sheltered, they use those words more then adults, so stop living in denial. There was some serious scenes that didn't pan out, but all the goofy scenes hit the spot. McCarthy still can be funny whatever role she plays. From Plainfield IL to Hollywood must not have been easy, but to still be able to pull it off, great. Made our day, my wife had to muffle her laughter with her coat so as to not disturb everyone, who also was laughing in the lady to lady adjustment scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome--funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, this movie is not intended to be an Oscar contender. It is a funny movie. Go see the movie with the attitude to have fun. If you go to the movie after a very hard day and you have no idea how to relax and have fun, you will hate the movie. But then again, you will hate any movie.The characters made us laugh, real hard. A few serious scenes (almost a tear drop). The actors did their job. Loved Peter-too funny. If you stay through the credits, you will see the bloopers--too funny.The only negative with the movie was the length--it did seem to go by rather quick. But all in all, ignore the critics and if you want a movie where you don't need to "think" and you want a mindless funny movie--get a ticket and go have a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>business is business, and business must progress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boss" is one of those movies that you can only enjoy if you accept low, in-your-face humor. Melissa McCarthy is all about said humor, and her character here is no exception. Part of the movie's aim is to show the contrast between McCarthy's brash, crude-mannered former magnate, and Kristen Bell's uptight former employee, with McCarthy trying to launch a new business and hire Bell. There's no shortage of talk about sexual organs, and McCarthy's abrasive character even upsets a Girl Scouts-like organization. I suspect that they had fun filming it. Even if you think that it gets too over-the-top at times (such as the tanning scene or the plan of what to do with the guard), you gotta love McCarthy's character's outrageousness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melissa McCarthy brings physical comedy to a new golden age in The Boss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Channeling a combination of Lucille Ball and Jerry Lewis, Melissa ushers physical comedy to a whole new level. The movie starts with a little history of Michelle Darnell's troubled childhood, being rejected from family after family. As she grows up, Michelle becomes overly self-reliant, deciding to make it in the world as independently as possible. That independence comes at a cost. Will Michelle grow a conscious or continue her corporate climb, stepping on as many heads needed to make it back to the top? You have to see The Boss to find out!It is a hilarious movie watching Michelle Darnell transform from a despicable tyrant to a heart-warming character that you ultimately root for. Kristin Bell plays the Dean Martin straight man to Melissa McCarthy's Jerry Lewis. Peter Dinklage is pure icing on the cake with expertly delivered lines and evolving hairstyle. The kids in the movie are the real winners here. Ella and Eva steal every scene they are in, and the West Side Story rumble on the block is half kid Braveheart and half sugar- cookie filled insanity. Is this a high-brow, erudite comedy? Newp! This is the heart-warming, trash-talking, hair scalping comedy that will keep you in a silly mood for days! If you need a pick-me-up after a long work week, this is the comedy that will have you seeking out brownies, itching for an old-fashioned street fight, and motivate you to finally ask for that raise. Now go see it!</fullReview>
