		<shortDescription>Little plots make Little movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a supposedly "inspirational" kind-of movie based on the life of Joy Mangano a business woman and inventor of home products.As I'm reading this is far from the actual life of Mangano (who, unlike the Joy in the movie, she went to University and has a degree in business administration). It is more like a blend of the stories of other housewives turned to businesswomen (if you can believe that) and contains lots of fictional elements for dramatic purposes.Nevertheless the plot is weak. So is the script. There isn't any actual moral here (like "Try and you will succeed"), and the narration of her grandmother dilutes any of that "moral" with too much "it is your destiny" crap.Soooo, the movie is an empty shell (or should I say Sell, pun intended) but is it fun to watch? No. Not really.The characters (including Robert De Niro's who plays her father, Elisabeth Röhm's who plays her half-sister, Virginia Madsen's who plays her mother and Isabella Rossellini's who plays her father's girlfriend and serves as the initial investor) are heavily unsympathetic.The direction is blunt, the pace uneven (I wont spoil you but the resolution of all problems comes in just a few seconds near the end), the situations unbelievable (like going to the...bathroom and unveil a conspiracy by pure luck) etc.Overall: A blunt movie with weak script and plot. The unsympathetic characters also make this unbearable. Not fun to watch and no true moral in this fictitious sequence of events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JLaw sold me more than just a mop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard that this movie received negative reviews and feedback, so I was pleasantly surprised when I enJOYed the movie as much as I did.There is no denying that the grand appeal to the movie was Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. The movie's story itself does not seem like it has much to offer. A poor, overworked woman selling a plastic mop does not sound that thrilling on paper. However, Lawrence takes it up a level to a powerful story about a woman never giving up and making her own opportunities happen against all odds. She takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. Lawrence has the undeniable ability to make you ache along with her struggles. This can be uncomfortable for the helpless movie-goer, which leads me to wonder if this is the reason so many people had distaste for the film. No one wants to be told that hard work and strong will are not enough to succeed in this world, and, as a whole, "Joy" does just that. That being said, "Joy" still left me feeling inspired. As a young, aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be reckoned with."Joy" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to raise the otherwise dark tone. Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with "Joy." It may not be the uplifting movie you want this holiday season, but I would argue it is the movie you need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy-less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not hard to see why this movie divides people. Some will always find a tale of an under-dog's trial over adversity compelling, no matter how clumsily it's told. And some will find a story about the manufacture of a mop dull, no matter how charismatic the characters or inspirational the telling of the tale. The problem here is that charisma and inspiration are in short supply. David O. Russell doesn't make much of the real strengths of the story. And he can't resist imposing his trademark style on characters and a story that really don't either warrant or suit it. So the characters are more than a little grotesque around the edges; the situations are all heightened, even given an absurdist spin; and the facts are never allowed to get in the way, even when they might actually strengthen the story. So much of Joy is desperately predictable, which makes for dispiriting viewing. And the real moments of surprise or pathos are just so much grist to the Russell mill. Jennifer Lawrence somehow shines through in the lead, and Isabella Rossellini does her best to enliven her scenes, but that's about where the positives end. For the most part, Joy is a tedious mess. While it's a story that would probably never have been told without David O. Russell wanting to enhance it with his schtick, it's a story I wish they'd entrusted to anyone other than David O. Russell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mighty Russell Has Struck Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: Clean-up in Aisle 4GRADE: CThe usually reliable David O. Russell lets down his fine cast of performers in his latest film, Joy, which doesn't quite live up to its title. Except for a strong performance from its lead, the delightful Jennifer Lawrence, the film remains a major disappointment. The film is loosely based on the true story of inventor Joy Mangano, but the screenplay also written by its director is a mess that needs to clean up its act. The film swings wildly between comedy and drama but never stays long enough to be effective in either category. Joy, winningly played by Ms. Lawrence, is interesting and the actress brings some verve to her role, but all of the supporting characters around her are sketchy and never amount to much more than quirky curmudgeons whose actions are so over-the-top that they never resemble anything remotely believable.The plot: Joy's life is in shambles (but then, so is the script). Living slightly above the poverty level and sharing her household with her dysfunctional divorced parents, Terry (Virginia Madsen), a reclusive soap opera addicted mother, and Rudy, a crotchety self-absorbed father (Robert De Niro) who takes up with a rich Italian widow named Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), Joy's ex-husband, Tony (Edgar Ramirez), who is trying to be a professional singer, Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm), her jealous stepsister, and Joy's two adorable children. Still her creative impulses compel her take action and change the direction her life is taking, which leads Joy to her long- time friend and adversary in business, Neil (Bradley Cooper), who gives her moral support on her latest venture. However, none of these relationships build to any satisfactory conclusion due to the stilted writing and uneven tone of the film. The ending also seems pat and forced as it quickly tries to tie up its loose ends, be they cotton or synthetic.With all of the talent involved, sadly, Joy is a joyless filmgoing experience.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plain boring and horrendous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this movie with high hopes considering it was the work of David O. Russell (who has made some great movies) and highly praised stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro (my favorite actor of all time), and Bradley Cooper. Unfortunately, after the first thirty minutes or so I lost all my hope... it seemed like a childish movie made by an amateur film-maker!The script was utterly immature. The main message of the movie was female empowerment, a cause worthy of fighting for and to which I say kudos; however, it was represented in the most childish way. Let me give you an example: "You are going to grow up and be a strong, smart young woman. Go to school meet a fine, young man. Have beautiful children of your own. And you're gonna build wonderful things that you do in your room." Sounds like an advice a 14-year-old, obnoxious, recently-turned-feminist girl would give! Furthermore, the story was completely disoriented and difficult to follow. One doesn't even know how time passes in the movie! I mean after Joy grows up there's clearly some significant passage of time, judging from some of the major occurrences (for instance grandmother dying, etc.), yet the movie gives absolutely no information about it. I was also bothered when the narrator of the story died in the middle of the story, nevertheless still miraculously narrated the events after her death... this is what I call 'posthumous narration' -- yep, seems legit!The directing was so horrendous it gave me a freaking migraine! Very rarely one can find a scene in this movie in which the camera is actually stable. I don't oppose to a fluent type of camera movement but in this case it was a continuous, subtle, yet super annoying jerky motion that went on and on and on...Moreover, there are certain scenes in which the acting is incredibly fake. For example, the scene in which Joy walks out of the garage just before releasing her anger by shooting -- never seen this fake of an acting from Jennifer Lawrence before. (I kind of think it's a directing problem though, considering the high level acting Jennifer Lawrence can perform, the director could have and should have repeated that scene)In conclusion, the movie was disappointingly weak and boring. I certainly do not recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really tried to liked or at least understand this movie but it seem to be an impossible task. I keep it brief - imagine that the screenplay is written by several schizophrenics who fight over whether they write a comedy, drama, melodrama or anything in between throughout the film. Characters come and go without realizing what they should bring to the story. Add poor Isabella Rossellini to the mix (the most bizarre act I have seen in years) who has lines so unbearably surreal no one could possibly carry them without looking like a lunatic. Add nightmarish soap opera merging with the plot. Boom! No sense what-so-ever. Jennifer tried really hard to keep this scrambled mess of a movie bearable and to watch she is only reason it is not a complete disaster. I feel dizzy now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Joy" is one of the most disappointing films of the year (if not the most). The great cast with names such as Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Isabella Rossellini gives the sensation to the viewer that "Joy" might be a great film. However, the storyline of a creative woman that lives with her dysfunctional family and invents a mop, becoming a successful woman, has a boring and dull story and consequently screenplay; in addition, the soundtrack is annoying. In the end, "Joy" is a waste of time and talented cast. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Joy: O Nome do Sucesso" ("Joy: The Name of the Success")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Drama + No Comedy - Stakes = Zero Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostly, the everyman applauds when another everyman struggles against odds to find success. Sometime those struggles are herculean. Not the case in "Joy." While the real life, inventive Joy deserves kudos, the bottom line is this is a feature film about the creator of a better mop.Russell struggles, unsuccessfully, to portray as harrowing the path to the mop. Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), deals with a houseful of kids, only a few of them children by age. The motley crew in a small house is not on Joy's side. She is the breadwinner, the adult, the rock whose imagination is a liability to those overly dependent on her. It's a paint-by-numbers affair from there ? familial jealousy, dirty financial dealings, the nightmare foretold by the old saw, "Do not do business with your family."The only one with an eye on Joy's genius is Grandma (Diane Ladd). Joy uses her small crumb of encouragement to build a mop prototype. She brings it to QVC where the initial sale segment bombs. Slick QVC huckster Bradley Cooper takes a chance and allows Joy to showcase the mop herself. Bingo! The mop sells out. Success? Nope. The parts supplier is screwing Joy, every sale of the mop loses money, and the family wants their money back. Financial ruin follows. Then Grandma dies. But the plucky Joy womans up to settle all scores financial and emotional. Hoorah!In lieu of dramatizing a woman overcoming, Russell instead created a painfully unfunny comedy. His palette is broad with a spectrum of quirkies mincing about with a family dynamic that could only exist in a poorly written movie like "Joy." The spot-on Russell eventually had to fall. "Joy" is the X marking the spot.Made-for-this-film, unfunny soap opera segments are unmotivated. There is no subtext pointing to the off-TV characters. There's also no payoff. There are out-of-left-field scenes of the soap in the first quarter and it's never seen again. What's the point? The Cooper-Lawrence chemistry bright and vibrant in past screen pairings is absent in "Joy." Here, it's given way to forced discomfort. There's a sense Lawrence, Cooper and DeNiro at some point knew "Joy" was a dog and tried hard to not phone it in. That or their direction was, "You've just been hit by a phaser on stun."The tonally confused "Joy" offers little on the path to an unsatisfying end where Joy makes it big, big, big and helps others succeed.There's little sympathy for Joy. The stakes: not living to one's potential and living with unfulfilled dreams. Her children are healthy. Her dad, DeNiro, runs a going concern and could help financially if push came to shove. She's smart and capable of working. Poor Joy.One wonders about the scores of courageous men and women who daily struggle against far greater odds, wolves at the door, to put bread on the table. Where are tales of these folks? It's an odd and tragic choice for Russell to highlight Joy's story (and insensitive in the current economy where one in seven US children go to bed hungry). The can-do attitude of a person overcoming trials is powerful. Open your eyes, Mr. Russell. There are far better underdog tales to make. They're just not sexy as Lawrence dancing with a mop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lawrence could have released 2 hours of her praising herself to the same effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother is the kind of person who, when walking out of a movie, always has something good to say about it regardless of how bad the movie was. We saw this movie together along with my brother and a friend of mine and when we were walking through the parking lot afterwords she was suspiciously quiet.I was hesitant to give this movie such a low rating because I can think of movies that were objectively much, much worse but frankly the complete lack of substance makes it hard to give it any kind of rating.The plot seemed simultaneously dragged out and rushed and contained zero suspense because no legitimate stakes were really raised and even if they had been, I cared so little about the characters that it wouldn't have mattered.Jennifer Lawrence's character is trying so hard to be The Every Man that it comes across as painfully fake and her performance was very much sub par. Every other performance in the movie was not all that memorable, even in regards to a few bigger name stars.Two separate characters die over the course of the movie, one of whom is never actually fully seen on screen. Both times Joy seems to have moved on completely by the next scene.A huge problem this movie had was in its attempt to retain some kind of vaguely political message without actually taking a firm stance on the issues in play. For example, there's a scene that essentially ripping on Joan Rivers for being anti-feminist and yet, we never really see Joy struggling in the work place for being a woman or having her decisions questioned by the men she works for. She seems to have it remarkably easy actually, and most of the things that go wrong are solidly on her. Another aspect of this is in the fact that they're poor and it causes Plot Issues but this is never truly discussed in any meaningful way. We are told that they are poor and that it causes problems, but they never really talk about it nor do they ever seem to face real consequences for the fact.Really the only positive things I have to say about this movie are: the soundtrack was good when it showcased period appropriate tracks as opposed to generic drama movie background music and I was very glad that Bradley Cooper and Lawrence didn't hook up in this movie.Overall, exactly as bad as I expected it to be and definitely not worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? Joy is a plain, boring and uneventful movie lacking great performances from Robert de Niro and Jennifer Lawrence (of course I wasn't expecting much from Bradley Cooper). The plot could have been interesting but the script completely ruined it I am not a fan of David Russell bu he did a really really bad job with Joy: his sequences don t make any sense, the narrator character choice is just pointless and many scenes are really hard to believe in. During the initial part of the movie, there were some funny bits which kept me moderately entertained but, after those 30 minutes, it was just plain boredom. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence won a Golden Globe for this is just unbelievable and proves what we all already know and what Ricky Gervais mentioned at the ceremony: all awards are bought by studios as a marketing campaign. Well, they succeeded, because I spent the money to see that, and I could not regret it more than I do.</fullReview>

And what was the message of this film?That there is still hope in a materialistic world and we should chase our dreams, even when all seem against us? Maybe interrupt and invade to a board meeting of a powerful company and confront the CEO? Come on, a director should respect the audience. If you want to direct a fairy tale,OK, i like fairy tales but don't present me an uninspiring fairy tale as a realistic movie, "based on a true story". Even if it was a true story, it is not convincing. Please, respect the audience. A talented director like O Russel should not forget it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Half a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is a fine half a film. The performances all-around are strong, the story is uncommon enough to grab your attention, and keep you invested, and the direction is solid. With all that in mind, Joy still feels like a shallow version of what could have been. There is a reason why all the movie's Oscar buzz has all but dissipated in every category except a courtesy nod to Jennifer Lawrence as Best Actress; Why? You should read on.Lawrence plays the titular character, a mother of two with a very complicated home life. Though divorced, her ex-husband (Ramirez) lives in the basement waiting for his singing career to take off. Though she has decidedly negative relationships with her parents, her shut-in mother (Madsen) lives with her and her father (De Niro) is a serial divorcée with a struggling auto repair shop. It's also the 1980's and she works the night shift for an Airline that's dramatically cutting back hours; yikes. The only thing she has going for her is she likes to tinker and has the work ethic to see a good idea through. So when she has a eureka moment after a failed excursion on her father's new girlfriend's boat, she quickly invents a household object that may just be her ticket out of systemic poverty.I don't think I'm giving much away by saying the movie asks its audience to hinge their emotional cache on a mop. The self-wringing Miracle Mop to be exact, invented by honest-to-God real person Joy Mangano. Leave it to director David O. Russell to find a decent story in the life of a QVC luminary and keep it just this side of rational. The prologue of the film lovingly dedicates the movie to "daring women," which Joy certainly is but Russell wisely omits the last name to give the audience a universality. This too can be your story of success if you have grit and a good idea. It's a great theme sadly worth a much better movie.Part of the problem is the pace. There are long stretches of improvisations that carry absolutely no emotional weight. Unlike American Hustle (2013) and Silver Linings Playbook (2012) where the rushed, overlapping dialogue and melodramatic mugging serves to highlight the immediacy of, say dealing with the mob, here there's nothing holding us to the characters and their goals...except Joy. Russell seems to be aware of his own style and juxtaposes the lives on screen with an 80's era soap opera which consumes the life of Joy's mother. The parallel is interesting in theory but the results deflate the proceedings.Not usually the voice of hope, I really wanted to like this movie. A movie about the positives of hard work and entrepreneurship has not hit theaters since Pursuit of Happyiness (2006). Yet out of all modern directors working today, David O. Russell feels like a quixotic mouthpiece for such a hopeful theme. His movies always have an unabashed pessimism about human nature that undermines his characters with an almost Bunuelian sense of treachery. Even as far back as his Three Kings (1999) days there was a mercurial, bittersweet undercurrent to his work. Joy bares disappointment after disappointment to a breaking point most protagonists of this genre would buckle under. Then, as if to put a band-aid on an open gash, the movie ends with an epilogue that's pat to the point of flimflam.www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could be good. But it isn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy presents itself as an attempt of a fresh take on a very typical Oscar-bait movie: the biopic. Sadly, it doesn't go beyond the attempt.Joy Mangano (Lawrence) is a poor and overworking divorced mother of two children who lives with her dysfunctional family that in addition to being completely dependent on her are also faithless on her ability to be more than a house wife that will always struggle to get some food on the table. Despite all the negative influence, Joy's imagination and ambition are powerful and she manages to invent a revolutionary mop, which she will try to develop and sell. Despite the fact that this mop eventually turns into a success, she has to endure a path of betrayal, jealousy and corruption (starting with her own family), hardships that she will surpass (or else this would have never become a movie).What first caught my eye (or in this case, hear) was the soundtrack. Composed by some famous jazz, classical and rock-and-roll songs, the music was highly responsible for other positive features of this film: a frenetic pacing and a very light atmosphere. These two features added to some quirky dialogues and surrealistic dream sequences and flashbacks gave this film a very interesting potential, that could have turned the very basic plot into a fulfilling experience.However, Joy remains as flat as the synopsis would suggest. The underdeveloped characters made impossible for any actor to perform well here. Even Joy, the title character, seemed exactly the same during the whole movie (the only reason I see possible for Jennifer Lawrence winning that Golden Globe is that she did the most what she could with almost zero material - and I don't want to believe that she was the most deserving actress of the year.) The whole family seemed like one-dimensional caricatures of pessimistic morons, which lead to completely forgettable performances by everyone involved. There was also a very short appearance of Bradley Cooper as an executive who first believed in Joy's idea, but whose character suffers from the same problem as the rest. There seemed to be a slightly romantic chemistry between him and Jennifer Lawrence that I found completely needless, as it lead to nowhere. Another very distracting feature was the constant out-of-focus framing, especially on indoor scenes! Amateurish, to say the least.Overall, I think David O. Russel tried to do something different from a biopic which is something I respect very much! The fact that he focused on a very particular moment of Joy's life, the invention of the mop, could be something he could have explored better, but in the end we are left with just that, which is kind of frustrating... To finish where I started, Joy could have been a good movie, but ends being nothing more than a typical hollow Oscar bait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't see what the hype is all about. The story is average and done many many times before. Nothing really likable or inspiring about the characters or the story. The acting is nothing notable. Just very standard stuff. Let me cap it in one sentence. Down and out mother thinks up an invention, brings it to market, and becomes rich after some travails that, in reality, is all fought and done with lawyers in the end. That's it. If you watched "The Pursuit of Happiness" the Will Smith movie, you've pretty much seen this one.And just an off note, these type of movies are ridiculous. For every success story like this one, there are thousands of others who've tried and failed. People who risked the financial well beings of their children and family on an improbable venture because they think themselves special, even though they never done the hard work of getting an education or training. But they still think themselves special. You never hear about them, the losers, the irresponsible ones who ruined the lives of their families. You only hear about the one in a million, like lottery winners. For a society, this isn't healthy when even the dumbest dingbat thinks himself above everyone else, and they're going to be millionaires. I guess that's why people vote Republicans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what this film was about-I just thought it might be good because of Jennifer Lawrence. Boy was I wrong. I suppose if compared to being in a hurricane or a flash flood-this movie would definitely come out on top-but as a 'movie for entertainment purposes' it belittles the audience and the people on the screen rendering them mere caricatures of people-not real people at all. That is strange to see-actors with talent wasted on what is basically nothing but a dumb movie project that isn't even worth being a movie of the week on some family orientated cable station. There were other things that didn't work in relationship to this movie-an endless 45 minute "preshow" from the movie chain that treated the adult audience as if they were all in grade seven. Going to the movies has become virtually a waste of time-especially if this is the type of thing they expect people to go for. I heard the positive reviews by critics but I don't see any positive reviews from an cinema goers. Everybody seemed to think this movie was ridiculous. I know I do. Its a movie about a woman who designs a mop. That's right-a mop. Unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I start when the best things about the film were a short audio clip of the Buffalo Springfield song, "Expecting to Fly" and Susan Lucci playing a soap opera character (thus the 2-star rating)? I found the dialogue to be filled with clichés, the acting quite flat (especially Jennifer), and many of the scenes so implausible that I could not "buy into" the storyline. The film dragged...Bradley Cooper was underused...the hairstyles seemed out-of-sync for the time...the daughter uttered lines and behaved in a way that even a mature little girl would never say/do...the relationship with the half sister was confusing...and why did the mother always have a bowl in her hands? Also, seriously: who in their RIGHT MIND hand-wrings a mop that is filled with shards of glass? Girl, get a towel, scoop up the shards, and shake them out over the trash can!Bottom line: An uplifting and perhaps compelling true story does not always translate into a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little joy for moviegoers in this Tale of Mrs Mop!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think the story of a woman whose claim to fame is that she invented a 'miracle mop' and made millions selling it via TV shopping channels sounds a poor basis for a movie, watching Joy will do little to change your opinion. Despite its claims, there is little that is 'inspirational' or even particularly interesting about Joy Mangano's progress from schoolgirl to 'matriarch', at least as portrayed in this quasi-biopic.The film starts interestingly by thrusting the viewer into a 1980s (? - it could have been 1950s) TV soap. At this point I thought Joy would perhaps be a comedic satire on the inanities of American consumerism. With a few tweaks it could have become just that and how much more interesting and challenging that would have been.The quirky opening note rapidly fades. We soon discover that Joy's story is going to be told by her granny, a prospect that does not bode well if you are looking for gritty realism and objectivity. Since granny dies halfway through the film, we then realise that the whole thing is being narrated from beyond the grave. Poignant? No, spooky and sentimental at best. From there on the plot lumbers along conventional channels to its predetermined conclusion.As the movie progresses it becomes more leaden, especially when we encounter the head of a TV shopping channel (Bradley Cooper). He comes across as a stereotypical corporate carthorse, who truly believes that pulling his telly-shopping cart is a higher calling. When Joy succeeds, at the second attempt, in presenting her miracle mop to the World on live TV and the sales indicator goes ballistic, the studio erupts with an ovation reminiscent of the one in Mission Control when the Apollo 11 astronauts touched down on the Moon. Hey guys, calm down - it's just a mop! If Joy's triumph seems a bit too good to be true, the credibility of the ensuing story is not enhanced by demonstrations of very poor business acumen on both her and her advisers parts. She would have got nowhere on Dragon's Den! When later Joy discovers she has been double-crossed in her business dealing by a most improbable circumstance, we begin to wonder if granny has got her facts straight.One has to conclude that this rather unexciting movie is basically a star vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence. Visually, fans will not be disappointed as she is displayed in numerous full-length shots and close-ups. But the role has too little meat in it to demand much of Lawrence in the way of acting. Robert de Niro, reprising his Jack Byrnes (Meet the Fockers) character, brings some bright moments to the proceedings, not least with a very funny wedding speech. But the occasional humour sits uneasily with the serious intent of the movie to tell an uplifting tale of a woman's successful struggle against adversity.Unless you think American consumer culture really is something to get worked up over, it may prove difficult to be fully engaged by the inspirational tone of Joy. That aside, there is little here to lift this movie above the ordinary. Talk of awards and even Oscars seems wholly misplaced; one critic even describes Joy as on a par with the Hollywood classics. No wonder they say you should never believe what you read in the papers - nor what you see on the tele-shopping channels!

		<shortDescription>Bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to give this a one out of ten. Only because you can not give it zero. So I do apologize for not giving an accurate score. This was not a David O'Russell film, it has his usual cast but he is no where to be found. The story draws out its quite obvious and inevitable finally for 2 long hours. You know at some point she will become a billionaire...and you wait and wait and wait and they draw it out and then...shazam!... she is a billionaire. There were a couple of moments that reminded me of the dysfunctional family set up you might find in a Wes Anderson film...but then that drops away very quickly...and there is no other time that it comes close to art or great cinema in the way that ''American Hustle'' or ''I Heart Huckabees'' did.I don't know where he was going with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Reminder of Jennifer Lawrence's Horrible Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going back to the depths of an 'argument' created by Jennifer Lawrence herself, in this movie, we see another reason to not enjoy her, or her antics. Once again is she placed with the same people ( Cooper and O'Russell ) and what does it lead to? Mindless acting with minimal to no emotion. It's a reminder that Jennifer Lawrence is not set to be an actress. Already out of her time with the date of movie being set in '92, it's an uncomfortable reminder that people actually enjoy her wooden and lifeless acting.Perhaps, the next time she argues that she should be paid the same as her male counterparts, she a) stops taking scripts from the same people with the same situation and setting and b) gets herself a new agent. Maybe then that'll get her off the cliché train she rides on with every movie she does. Truth be told, I feel horrible for DeNiro and the others that were involved in the creation of this disaster ---- there was no potential with this movie. Another reminder that, unless that person is known for something bigger than a mop ( perhaps a president, or at least someone with more worth than that of a cleaning device ), that you should not make an unnecessary, and unwanted, biopic that lacks every kind of emotion possible and needed.All in all, you should save your money and see something that packs a punch, or, in the very slightest, has emotion to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is complete and utter garbage.This "true story" is completely fabricated and faker than the soap opera scenes that intersperse this movie. What's worse is the director knew he was making a garbage film but because it contained two stars he worked with in American Hustle he just kept throwing in references to other, superior films, such as Taxi Drive and Citizen Kane.There is so much here that violates the laws of the suspension of disbelief, for instance, somehow the restroom has a secret door blocked by a few boxes that lead into the main manufacturing plant that holds the smoking gun that Joy's plans are being stolen.Joy has to hire a plumber and then suddenly her bed-ridden mom who only watches soap operas is cavorting around the house with the Haitian plumber offering bowls of soup to Joy. For no reason. They just interrupt the scene.Everything about this film is stupid and insulting. There are B-movies made in the 1950s that have more integrity and artistic merit. This whole film is a sell-out on the highest order and a class action lawsuit should be filed so that people who paid actual money to see this disaster could get some compensation.There are many times where I, as the viewer, wished that Jenifer Lawrence had a bow and arrow and could go Katniss Everdeen on the rest of the characters.Bradley Cooper seemed like he was reciting lines in a hypnotic trance. In fact, the whole cast seemed as if they were under some somnambulist's spell, robotically reciting lines that had been poured into their heads by some careless programmer, ambivalent of how his automatons performed. As if by some government worker who would get paid regardless of the quality of his work.There is nothing redeeming here. There is no quality. There is no charm. Everyone was tasked to do a job and no matter how bad it was, they were just going to get through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying that I really do appreciate good film. I would say that the only ingredient present in this film that would be found in a quality film, is the cast. I wanted to stop watching within the first ten minutes but I really could not believe that it could be as bad as it was. From what I have read this screenplay is not exactly based upon the specific events in a specific person's life. That tells me that the director/screenwriter created a mediocre plot and did a less than mediocre at directing said plot. I could go on and on but the bottom line is this: what a bad movie. It takes a lot for me to write a review, whether good or bad, and I could not wait to write this review. A shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People are greedy and not nice. What else is new?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money corrupts. Not an original theme, yet this is what this movie is about. It lambasts most, if not all, of the major social institutions of modern society. Marriage, commerce, the mass media, work, the law - all are targeted for negative treatment. The problem is that none of this is surprising, new or insightful. Essentially, the movie is a soap opera, and not very good one. All the characters are flawed. Most remarkable is their intellectual shallowness equaled only by their selfishness and greed. The principal character, a woman named Joy, invents something and then immediately encounters difficulties trying to market it. She depends on others who repeatedly let her down. Finally, after repeatedly being ripped off, the light goes on inside her head. She finally realizes that people are not nice. Once she understands that, she becomes a success. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper deliver strong performances. Robert DeNiro is okay as Joy's stupid father. However, this is not one of DeNiro's better performances. DeNiro tries to give his character some depth, but he fails because his character is simply too intellectually limited.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both the plot and acting in Joy are incredibly two-dimensional and stiff, and the time spent on different parts of the plot is grossly imbalanced. This means the film is particularly boring and completely fails to engage. Lawrence, Cooper, De Niro and others are so weak and uninteresting to watch here that it's amazing they've ever done good work. I'm so tired of seeing De Niro crinkle his brow and smirk his mouth as an expression of acting talent. He's gotten as bad as Jack Nicholson. And, Cooper and Lawrence are unbelievably lame here, too, as are the script and editing. There's no meaningful character development -- just "drama" that fails to engage or make you care and "comedy" that fails to make you laugh. All that time in the theater watching supposed stars and nothing but a yawn. This thing is LAME!! Don't waste your money...</fullReview>

I don't think Joy smiled once throughout the entire movie--I've seen more passion on Shark Tank. In fact, I never saw Joy exhibit any real excitement about her product. I love Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro, but a movie with well-known actors and cute songs does not necessarily make a good movie. This is just another stupid movie for Hollywood to make money off the limited talent of Jennifer Lawrence. I am tired of movies about dysfunctional families: simply a poorly written, directed and edited movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lawrence and her asshole family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is the third time David O Russell, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper have worked together, and this time its meh. It's an average film, not amazing, not awful, just OK. This film is one for the feminists, a woman becoming successful no matter how much the white man tells her no.The only likable character in this film is Joy herself (her ex husband as well sort of). Everyone else in the film is so irritating as they are such horrible people especially toward Joy, who they treat more like a slave than there blood relative. This does help in making the audience like Joy even more but it also wants them to see her gun them down in the films climax, which I'm sad to say does not happen.I don't know why the film was narrated by Joy's grandmother, I guess either to save money or Morgan Freeman was busy.One other thing which I thought was particularly good about Joy was it's parody of soap operas and how they are complete and utter bull, but lazy and stay at home mothers lap up every second of it. I believe that, because of this, the film gained it's comedy genre as this film is not funny at all and it doesn't even seem to try, I do not understand why its been given that genre.Plus I swear Joy was an absent parent to her son as she does have one, we just see her spend time with only her daughter, this is probably more due to the feminist messages the film aims to convey but because of the amount of things Joy has to juggle, it to me, came across more that she (and the filmmakers) simply forgot about him.Joy's OK, it isn't at all high on my recommendation list but if anyone was thinking of seeing Joy I wouldn't encourage or discourage them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One improbable dilemma after another.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you not like a movie with Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Niro? Take a David O. Russell screenplay only half based on entrepreneur Joy Magano's invention of the Miracle Mop, fill it with a series of implausible straw men, then knock them down over the course of two hours leading to the happy ending we all know is coming because it's the story of the successful Miracle Mop, not the Flop Mop. People have analogized Joy's situation to Cinderella, but it seemed to me more like Rocky. Each time poor Joy takes a punch and hits the canvas, we are rooting for her ("Get up, Joy!"). The problem is that each setback is completely avoidable and, thus, becomes infuriating to the viewer. Examples: Marketing guru, Bradley Cooper, agrees to get her product on QVC but gives it to a pitchman who has never used the product and doesn't like it. When Joy insists on demonstrating the product herself (which did happen), she is dressed in a fancy outfit- just the thing you'd wear when mopping a floor! Genius, Bradley Cooper! Then the parts supplier attempts to extort Joy by raising the prices after the success of the product. What, no contract covering this? When Joy learns her intellectual property rights are not protected, it is explained that her financial backer- who meticulously monitors the expenditure of every penny- has consulted a lawyer who is not an expert in IP rights. How meticulous! Everyone but Joy throws their hands up in despair saying there is nothing to be done but file bankruptcy. Here's a thought. How about suing the lawyer for legal malpractice for giving IP advice without any expertise? When Joy learns that the real IP holder is in Texas, Joy meets him in a motel room, spins out some convoluted explanation as to why his claim over the IP rights is "fraud" and gets him to sign a one page disclaimer of all IP rights right then and there without years of litigation. The longer this movie went on, the more I hated it. Except for Joy, none of the characters were likable. Some critics apparently find it impossible to be objective because of the pedigree of the David O Russell, JLaw, Bradley Cooper collaboration (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle). But, many IMDb viewers have been courageous enough to say this emperor had no clothes and I joint their ranks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how else to explain it.Perhaps the problem here is the subject matter. There was another "invention film" that wasn't great called "Flash of Genius" with Greg Kinnear, and while that film also waned down the stretch, it was better than this one.Jennifer Lawrence is about the only redeeming quality here. Everything is just so unlikable or shallow about every other character in the film. "Joy" is overrated here at 6.7, and is probably on the way to 6.4- land before long. I'd go 52/100. When our lead here finally get's rich, it comes off as a poorly explained and rushed conclusion. We sit for an hour-and-a-half waiting for a payoff, and what we get is a legal-boring-non-twist, and a brief explanation on what made her rich. Is that what we were meandering through all that average film for? Oh geeesh. The end is very anti-climatic. This film, along with "Race", "THe Brother's Grimsby", and "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot", had me in movie purgatory for my two days off, making me wish I had actually gone to one decent movie at the theater, and not wasted 12-15 bucks on this lot of terribly average, if not flat-out disappointing films.The lone bright-spot was "London Has Fallen"(6.5/10), which at the very least was an unabashed, yet still frenetically-fun rehash of the original. And no I don't have to have action to enjoy a film.There is very little "Joy" to be found watching "Joy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "Aloha", there's a point where you wonder if this was edited by either a trainee or maybe release 2.0 of movie editing A.I. Joy Mangano's life story probably lends itself to theatrical treatment but you can't tell that from this bewildering hodge-podge of vignettes. Most of the script revolves around showing how Joy's life is something of a self-inflicted misery of needy beings incapable of taking care of themselves - children, lounge singer ex- husband, father played by the once interesting Robert Deniro and mother played by the once interesting Virginia Madsen - dragging her down. Each of these miseries is then contrasted with her name. Get it? Hopefully you do because the contrast between her personal and financial misadventures and her happiness denoting name is used as a knowing wink to the audience about fourteen times. Largely the trainwrecks continue until a trip to Dallas where everything somehow turns itself around for indiscernible and un-foreshadowed reasons. In short, there's probably a biography or just Joy's Wikipedia page you could read instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy (2015)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Lawrence made a name for herself by starring in The Hunger Games, and she's easily one of the most recognizable actresses in Hollywood. But what does she do now that The Hunger Games has ended? Her first post-HG project is reteaming with David O. Russell, director of Silver Linings Playbook and American Hussle, which netted her one Academy Award win and two nominations (including Joy). Although Joy wasn't as well-received as their other pairings, it still gives Jennifer Lawrence a movie to carry on her own without a franchise title to support her. Joy is a biographical film about the life of Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop, because evidently she needed a biopic. She grew up in a home where everyone around her had a dead-end job, and her grandmother was the only source of optimism for Joy. By the time she's 30, Joy is a divorced mother of two, working a dead-end job, her parents are divorced but still live with Joy, and her ex-husband lives in her basement. To add insult to injury, her sister constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children. The rest of the film is Joy overcoming these obstacles to become an overnight success with her first invention, the Miracle Mop, and selling the product on QVC. It is one of those inspirational bio-dramas we get a few times a year, but it never feels overly sappy or fake. The real issue is the film's first half which drug on about 20 minutes too long hammering in how much the characters' lives suck. Once Joy makes the prototype for the Miracle Mop and starts her business, the movie's quality picks up immensely. You actually start caring about the characters rather than just saying "Wow, their lives suck." The ensemble cast, which includes Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, does typically great work and salvages the movie's slower parts. Joy is definitely one of those movies that you really go see for the cast, but it's often fun to watch Joy's race to the top even if it takes a long time for her to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence, but have to say I was disappointed with this. The movie based around Joys invention of a self wringing mop, and the story is literally revolved around this invention from beginning to end. I had hoped for a bit of romance at the end with Bradley coopers character but that didn't happen. Just seems like a simple story was dragged out for longer than needed, and the story was somewhat boring. I found myself drifting to sleep a couple of times. Such a shame as I normally cannot fault movies Jennifer is in. It was pretty much the typical 'american dream' of someone wanting to succeed at something so much they put everything on the line and lose everything. and then of course Joy turns it all around and comes out on top in the end. Very cliché and predictable.Very disappointed, expected something a bit more interesting to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and In particular Robert De Niro are all great actors in their own right. But it's becoming over familiar to see them cast together. They all featured in Silver Lining's Playbook and American Hustle.... Cooper and De Niro also stared together in Limitless. The film wasn't terrible, but I guess that's barely high praise. All the characters lack personality and depth which is an incredible achievement when you consider the film is biographical.Director Dabid O' Russell who formally released American Hustle and Silver Lining's play book seems to have a real struggle translating depth in character on to the big screen. It was no surprise to me that this film was made by the same director that made American Hustle, the lack of characterisation is astounding.There were good parts. but they were few and far between and frankly not worth the boredom in between. overall it was a flacid film and as hard as I try It's difficult to find any real positives. But If you put a gun to my head and forced me to give some positives this would be my half hearted response....1. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is pretty good 2. If familiar is what you like from a film you'll feel comfortable from the first minute with such a famous cast 3. I must admit Cooper,De Niro and Lawrence have great chemistry on screen, despite feeding off the scraps from the writers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm trying to remember why we all like this director. Not impressed. The story its self though I found inspiring. I just wish the script had focused a bit more on her inventions and career path rather then the dysfunctional family. I also found the film kind of lazy if that makes sense. For example, there's one scene where it's a flashback of Joy and her sister and both child actors are very clearly sweating. And not in a "oh, there upset and sweating..." it was clearly winter during the scene. It was from the lights on set and the young girls had perspiration on there upper lips. I worked in film so maybe that's why I noticed this. My question is where was the makeup artist that day? Get some powder on those girls! Was Russell taking the day off? Shouldn't he have noticed that kind of attention to detail? And please don't get me started on the casting of Lawrence. A 25 year old cast as a mid thirties mother of two... I mean, I know they love working together but come on. Pick another script with a younger character or an older actresses (older women in Hollywood really don't have a shot if this is what it's like!!). She looked more like her characters kids sister then their mom. Maybe wait until the film comes onto Netflix. No need to see it in theatres.</fullReview>

We, the audience, totally forgot that a flashback was going on and when it switched back it was off-putting. The sound and scoring was way off - the music was probably just someone's iPod stuck on shuffle. There were some scenes where the sound was just sloppy - fading prematurely and out of sync with the mouths. Enough that it was distracting. There were a few interesting camera angles and shots that were visually appealing. As for the story, I thought it showed promise, but was poorly executed. The beginning drags on and adds little to the story. Neil's introduction was interesting, well written and clever - it also seemed like there would be more of him in the film based on how he was brought in and built up. It left me disappointed and confused. I would have liked to have seen more interaction between him and Joy. JLaw gave a great performance in some poorly cut scenes. The only part when I really felt something as an viewer was when de Niro's character was going off on an apology for raising his daughter to be too confident and aspire to something higher than she was - a lower class housewife. That got the blood boiling. Had they continued to go with that, they could have had a much more engaging film. They just let it fizzle with a lack of substance and an over abundance of odd, slow tangents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One supposes "The Mop" wouldn't have been a suitable title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just from having watched the trailer, I wasn't even sure what this film was about, and the shot of Lawrence firing the gun made me think it would be about her committing a crime of some sort, but it's a rags to riches story about Joy, who cannot even afford a surname, who invents a mop, ... goes through hell having it financed, manufactured, and sold, ... DeNiro was funny (especially when referring to his ex- wife as The Creature From The Black Lagoon), Bradley Cooper, fresh from his turn in the nearly as odd Burnt, and really needing a shave, injects a bit of life to the proceedings, in his 20 or so minutes of screen time, but the main plot was too odd, seeming like an infomercial about a mop, and a behind the scenes look at a home shopping network. Not knowing when the story was taking place bothered me. At times it looked like 1970s or 1980s, but they mentioned 1995, which turned out to be only the price of the mop ($19,95) She is shown early on working for Eastern Airlines, who went under in the early '90s, so it is sometime before then, obviously. The suits Cooper wears seem like 1970s, but some of Lawrence's clothes look more like 1990s.Everything was narrated by the grandmother, who dies 2/3 of the way into the film, returns at the end for a final recap for some reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I just watch a movie about the miracle mop?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that kept coming to mind as I was watching was how awkward it was. Zero chemistry. And also the Lawrence/cooper/deniro thing isn't *that* good to make three movies about it. The characters were awful. One thing that also bugs me is horrible child actors. She kept blinking a lot? And Jennifer Lawrence is just too young to come across as being a mother. She is beautiful I do have to admit. Deniros weird temper tantrum was awkward. Jlaws first time on qvc was awkward to watch. Every time there was supposed to be a joke, I didn't realize it until a second later. Like oh I was supposed to laugh at that. The people that did catch on gave weak giggles. And from what David o Russell had implied, I was thinking it will focus a lot on Joy and not about the fact she created miracle mop. I was wrong. It was all about the miracle mop. I felt kind of embarrassed when I realized that. It was a lot of Russel trying to get *cool* shots of jlaw looking like a badass and putting on sunglasses *twice.* He also tries to be like Tarantino and pick cool songs and that just completely flopped. It felt really rushed and It didn't have time to convey emotional ties between characters. Bradley cooper was in it like three times. It's a movie about qvc and the miracle mop. Oh and please don't get me started about the fact that Melissa Rivers decided to play her dead mother?? Am I missing something? I thought that was weird and just kind of wrong. It just fell flat for me. I hope this was the last movie of these four together. I also feel that Russell will make a movie purely for the cool trailer. The trailer was definitely cooler than the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step down for O'Russell, but still a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy marks the third collaboration for David O'Russell with Jennifer Lawrence, De Niro, and Bradley Cooper. However, it is the weakest of the three films as it doesn't have the consistency and entertainment of the last two movies although it isn't a bad film. The movie takes the story of the woman who gave us the Miracle Mop and delivers a worthwhile underdog story that just barely misses being really good.Good: Jennifer Lawrence is good in the film as Joy. She has a likability and determination that makes her endearing to conquer her negative family and all the other obstacles. Bradley Cooper is really good as the QVC boss with his dissection of how the inner workings of the channel works being the best scene in the movie. The movie is shot well and the music choices are good. It even goes for a semi remake of Cinderella I felt with the way Joy was set up with her family.Bad: The tone is all over the place. One minute its a flat out comedy, then its a drama, then its a crime film and it goes back to being a comedy. The lack of a definite tone or at least some sort of rhythm hurt the pacing and my involvement with the movie. With the plot being an underdog story, the inconsistent tone made it hard at times to truly care for what happens aside from what Lawrence did. Having the family be very over the top in their negativity also didn't help as they felt like caricatures. It wasn't organic and mixing it with the predictable plot just zapped any endearing qualities it might have gotten.Overall, I can see effort in here and Lawrence does her best, but the lack of a tone, predictable story structure, and over the top family members made it hard to get into it.</fullReview>

I had high hopes after seeing American Hustle but this was definitely a "miracle flop!" Do not see this movie.

		<shortDescription>Terrible, terrible, terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry to rain on the JLaw parade that seems to be going on out there among her fans, but this movie strikes me as if the director realized that all he'd have to do to create a film that would make a bunch of cash at the box office is point a camera at Jennifer Lawrence. He wouldn't need a script, he wouldn't need believable characters, and he certainly wouldn't need to do very much in terms of direction. Unfortunately, that seems to be exactly the approach he took to making the movie.I found the first third of the film almost unwatchable. As a filmmaker, you know you're in trouble (or you *should* know, anyway) that when the intentionally-horrible soap opera characters in your intentionally-horrible soap-opera-within-the-soap-opera are more interesting and more sympathetic than your main characters that you're in deep trouble. The second third of the movie wasn't much better -- more soap opera family drama queenery. *Nothing* of any interest happened for me until about the 1 hour 37 minute mark. Sorry, but in a 1 hour and 53 minute movie, that's just WAY too long to wait to see if it's actually going to turn into a movie. BIG "thumbs down."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You never mix family and business. Relations by blood or marriage can and usually do influence the business, causing the inevitable argues. Unclear decision-making involving all family members, multi-generational dynamics and approach all must stay in the family, can do more harm than good. Although this is the most common and the oldest business, it is the most challenging. This notion doesn't stop Joy Mangano to be a successful corporation owner.Joy Mangano is an Italian descended, seventeen years old entrepreneurial girl. After her parents divorced, she takes care of the family: grandmother, mother, father, ex-husband and a daughter. Stuck in a dead-end job she struggles with everyday life. Bills and family members make her miserable. One day, while cleaning the floor she cuts her hand with a broken glass. This mishap pushes her to creativity. She invents the Miracle Mop and starts her own business. Despite her family pulls the rug out from under her feet, and the fight for her patent with manufacturer she manages to become a multimillionaire.David O.Russell's film neither is a Fighter, nor it is an American Hustler. It is more precise to say that Joy is an upshot of both of them. It has a dramatic illustration of a family, but it is dimmed with calm, inspiring perspective. This Italian ? American family drama more resembles the soap operas than profoundly dysfunctional and pathological.Joy embodies the American dream that results from the resourcefulness but adds to the subject feminine resilience. She carries the story and the family. This girl is a mother, a daughter, and ex-wife. Handles all the responsibilities in the house, she rules this kingdom with polite and kind manner. Joy has a solution to any problem and makes everybody feel welcome. Her positive spirit is her strength and enables her to reach the goal. Despite this kind eye, Joy is a fighter for her future. This woman has a nose for opportunity and unhesitatingly places a foot in the door. The small circle of business making and malpractice of manufacturer learns her to be tough and fight for her products. Takes from the channel supervisor what he owns her. Never is she arrogant or unjust.Jennifer Laurence builds a compelling character that combines all the roles women play. She shifts from one to another effortless. Joy life may be seen as another Cinderella story, but there is one aspect the film is worth attention. So far it is hard to look in cinema for the woman in the business role that isn't stone cold bitch or too eager and pushy with her career or personal life, paying costs in motherhood (Devil's Wears Prada). Joy had lost youth, she had to uphold her dream, and became someone else than she imagined. She isn't anger or has a damaged ego, neither she does manage the family and business like a man. She doesn't have to pretend to be a boss (The working girl). She never has to relay on her sexuality (Disclousure). Joy lay her advantage on matriarch structure and innovation. Forgiving and understanding is a weapon of hers. Joy is a woman that unnoticed makes a career with all the woman support and wisdom. Titled joy and optimism combined with a proactive and creativity makes a new aesthetic value. This aspect seems to be unnoticed. But makes the story inspiring and uplifting. Recommend to watch this movie with an emphasis on Joy's background and portrait can be fulfilling. And is own feature that makes the story worth a time. Other aspects of the film look aright, what makes Joy only a casual movie. David O Russell, have an interest the director is the human effort and the struggle between a group of people. He brings to the picture the best of his dramatic skills and puts them in contemporary, casual context but is it doesn't make the spark. He runs the directional smoothly from frame to frame. Vivid dialogues and the personalities catch an eye. Robert De Niro has its funny moments. Especially when he balances on toxic and loving speeches. Isabella Rossellini, Bradley Cooper, is okey, but this is it. Cinematography nicely colors the movie, but adds nothing sufficient to the story.Overall Joy isn't as enjoyable as Fighter and Silver lining Playbook the film is casual and easy to watch. You don't get any epiphany or tight entertainment, you won't be overwhelmed with drama and acting. This movie is recommended to all the viewers, who likes casual cinema.www.visualandwriting.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy proves that both Jennifer Lawrence and David O. Russell have lost their touch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy tells the story of a strong willed woman or, as our narrator concludes, the film is about all strong women everywhere. We are introduced to Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) as she plays outside her father Rudy's (Robert De Niro) auto shop store. We get glimpses of dysfunction within her family and then it spits us out somewhere between one surrealist scene in which Joy dreams about soap opera stars and her family harassing her and then it goes into her family life and why she is in the situation she's in. This patterns continues throughout the whole film, allowing us to never feel an ounce of concern over Joy and her miraculous mop. Why care about someone who can literally figure a way out of every unsavory situation she is in and into every beneficial situation she's in. There's no suspense, no wonder, no enchantment. This film feels like a biopic but ends up coming across as a half assed attempt at one as it blends the corniness of soap operas into the seriousness of David O. Russell as a filmmaker. In the end, it never works. Not even once as a film. Instead, the film subjects us to situations that Joy is in that we care nothing about. Whether it is mending things with her mother and father or fending off those looking for a free ride, you know before it even starts that Joy is going to get out of it. This makes for a painfully boring film. The performances are good here, as with any David O. Russell film (except this year's Accidental Love). Jennifer Lawrence is being Jennifer Lawrence. There's no acting required here for her. She can sleep walk through a strong willed woman role and she does so here. Despite being the lead role, Lawrence is the weakest link here. She was the weakest part of American Hustle and she is the weakest part here and it is a testament to Russell continuously casting her in roles that should be played by actresses ten years her senior. American Hustle it was pretty clear she was out of her element, there's no difference with Joy. She wallows in a mature aurora to her but it never really rings true no matter how hard Lawrence tries (and trust me, she does give her all here). It ends up being a good performance in a woefully miscast film. The supporting actors are plentiful, some even stealing whole scenes. One highlight here is Robert De Niro. Russell has proved he can get the absolute best out of De Niro. This is refreshing to see especially because we all thought he gave up with some of his recent film choices but De Niro can surprise us with touching performances in between playing cookie cutter gangsters and cops. Bradley Cooper is good here and will make you want more out of him but this is a showcase for Jennifer Lawrence so let your hopes down easy. Overall, Joy demonstrates that David O. Russell has a confident handle on his performers but it also proves that he is merely a carbon copy of Martin Scorsese (or at least he is trying to be). It is an uneven film that is inspired by Goodfellas in the way Joy's story is told and unfortunately for this film, gangsters are much more interesting than housewives making a fancy mop...no matter how kick ass that mop may be in real life, the film feels like a rip off in more ways than one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Very Worst Films of 2015 But I'll Buy the Mop!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blue-collar visionary Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) has an idea for a revolutionary new home-cleaning product. With the help of her failed lounge singer ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) and despite the machinations of her crazy family she pitches the product to a home shopping channel mogul (Bradley Cooper).The film Joy is what you would get if ingested psychedelic mushrooms, wrote an infomercial about Miracle Mop and got an excellent cast of Hollywood stars to appear in it. Nothing is more absurd than the very idea of this movie getting made as a wide release feature with the exception of the inexplicable critical acclaim it has garnered.Auteur David O.Russell (Who wrote, produced &amp; directed) has been so successful in recent years with films like Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle that it has perhaps made him complacent and even bored. Sometimes when that happens an artist can go off on an experimental tangent. Equally as often the same artist can take on a challenge that they shouldn't. That is what Russell did here in trying to turn an idea that wouldn't normally have been considered for a movie of the week on the Lifetime network and making a feature film out of it.I feel like seeing it again just to make sure the actors were really saying the goofy lines of dialogue I heard. Some of them appear to be gleaned from a motivational speaker's teleprompter. Others sound like what you hear in a dubbed version of an awful Mexican soap opera. I'm embarrassed for the distinguished cast that they had to try to make sense of this weirdness.Tinged with Fellini-esque surrealism the bizarre rhythm of sequence suggests it was absolutely butchered during editing by somebody on speed, then Ritalin, then speed again. I often found it incoherent. It probably made perfect sense to drug users.If the film accomplishes one thing it is that everyone who sees it is gonna wanna buy a Miracle Mop. I started scouting for one online right after I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly inspirational story! 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: Finally, I have managed to stay awake through a whole movie and I actually found it entertaining throughout! This is a truly inspirational story about Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), who found it extremely hard to make ends meet, whilst looking after her family and her ex- husband. Her dysfunctional family lived in her house, and she also had to look after her young girl, so when she invents a new type of mop, they all pull together to try and sell her new invention to a mass market. The storyline was put together very well by the director and you can't help rooting for Joy, who had the odds staked up against her. Her determination and belief in her product, is remarkable, and the fact that it was based on a true story, made it a joy to watch. Jennifer Lawrence put in a great performance, and with Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, Edgar Ramirez and Virginia Madsen, all making brilliant contributions to the project, it really did make this a heart warming movie. The only fault that I found with the film, is that it's not the type of movie that you can watch time and time again, once you know the outcome but that doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. Anyway, I personally enjoyed the film, even though it didn't go down too well with the critics, and I'm surprised that it didn't make money at the box office. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Director David O. Russell, 58, has found the perfect combination with Cooper/Lawrence/DeNiro, and the fact that they have returned to work with him after the successful Silver Lining Playback and American Hustle, proves that they like his unique, storytelling methods and direction. He also directed the Fighter with Bale and Wahlberg, the great Three Kings, Flirting With Disaster and Spanking the Monkey in 1994. With such a great track record, I really don't know what he was thinking when he released the awful Accidental Love starring Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal, which tanked at the box office, but he can now put that terrible film firmly behind him and concentrate on decent projects. Anyway, he really does bring out the best in Lawrence, who has earned herself an Oscar and many various awards after starring in his true to life movies, so I'm sure that were going to be seeing more movies from this successful team. Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $101millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/drama/comedies, starring Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Edgar Ramirez, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen, Isabella Rossellini and Donna Mills. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too much of a downer for too much of the movie to make me feel good at the end. I compare how I felt emotionally about this movie the same as I did while watching the Pursuit of Happiness, in that I felt awful the entire movie until the last few minutes, and by then it was just too much.I didn't understand what happened halfway through the movie when Bradley Cooper's character told her that he wouldn't give her another shot, and then as soon as she burst into a meeting with him and the lawyers he immediately changed his mind and was fine with her going on TV to promote it.Jennifer Lawrence's character seemed all over the place, and her rivalry with the half-sister seemed undeveloped. As hectic as her life was, and with all the changes in her life, I expected her to cut out her sister and the family, as all they were doing was holding her back. Especially as soon as things got good, I expected her to give the family some money or pay for their living and leave them behind, as they were a cancer at best to her.Wasn't a huge fan, wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes a feel good movie.</fullReview>

Brilliant cast to support her, though as other have stated, I can see why some would just call it a mess and not want to get into it (pun intended).But while the dialog is rapid fire and there are probably many things enhanced for the viewing pleasure of the audience, if you do like people overcoming obstacles that seem impossible to overcome, you will like this movie. And it's not a spoiler, though I won't go into details, because this movie and the viewer know where this is heading. Even if you're not aware of the story of the mop.

		<shortDescription>I loved this inspirational, quirky story, Ayn-Randish though it was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a lot of aspects that might drive someone up a wall. But not me, apparently.First, there's no simple answer to the question of whether this is really a biopic about Joy Mangano. On the one hand, it's a movie about a woman about Joy (last name never stated) who invented the "Miracle Mop" and shares some other biographical details with Mangano, and Mangano has executive producer credit, so of course it is! On the other hand, there are noticeable differences between "Joy" and Mangano, and Writer/Director Russell says that Joy is a composite. But back on the first hand there are plenty of acknowledged biopics which have changed details to get a better story, and if you saw a movie about a guy from Virginia named "George" who became the first president of the US you wouldn't think hard about whether it was a biopic. You would very much like to find out what Mangano's relatives think about the portrayal of Joy's relatives in the movie, but it looks like you'll never find this out.The movie looks a lot like it would look if it were an adaptation of a somewhat amateurish autohagiographical memoir by a woman who is very proud of herself, ready to settle scores with some people and gild her own lily some and certainly sell more mops and other fine consumer products. Was Joy's (the real Mangano or the fictional Joy, take your pick) struggle for entrepreneurial success really as exciting and rollercoasterish as in the movie? Were her relatives really that horrible? Did she really have to go to Lancaster and California and Texas and fight it out all those times to rescue her mop single-handedly the way it is on screen? Did she really have all those dreams and a supernatural experience? I wouldn't bet on it. So I might think this movie was cheap and brassy and manipulative. But in fact I suspect the movie is meant to look and feel pretty much exactly the way it does - like a truthy sales pitch sort of like you might see on QVC. For me it actually works.It works for me even though my own politics and economics are pretty collectivist, and this movie can be read as a paean to American entrepreneurialism right out of an Ayn Rand novel. This includes the portrayals of her father, half-sister, and stepmother- equivalent/investor, superbly portrayed by Robert De Niro, Elisabeth Rohm, and Isabella Rossellini as the most toxic, selfish, grasping, and stupidly parasitic relatives in the history of all worlds, except (I don't think this is a coincidence) for Henry Rearden's horrible relatives in "Atlas Shrugged". They are about tied. (I really have to pause here to again applaud the performances of this ensemble, who, aided by the screenplay, make floods of attacks on Joy's abilities and character and self-worth seem like natural language.) As in "Atlas" they all live off Joy's self-sacrifice and genius, and yet they are ready to kill the goose and pilfer the eggs at any time. (Or this may be just the way "Joy" remembers it...)So Joy works just as hard to make her mop as Henry Rearden did to make his new alloy, and launches herself (spoiler?) on her path to a position of wealth and power from which she can give the essential hand-up to other creative young women, just as the Bradley Cooper entrepreneur did for her. This is the un-nuanced myth which is so deceitful when it becomes the sole basis for real-life policy (in my view anyway). And yet it doesn't make me hate the movie. It at least comes across as very sincere (or "truthy" at least), and, hey, it is about an individual fighting against all obstacles from one end of the movie to the other. Sort of like "John Wick", except with Jennifer Lawrence, no guns, and a better variety of action.Well, is it "predictable" that Joy will succeed and sell many mops? Yes, of course it is. It would be even if you didn't know that Joy was somehow related to noted successful mop-inventor and mop-seller Mangano! But so what, really? Hmm? Is it predictable that Katniss (to pull a heroine randomly out of the air) isn't just going to die in the first hour of "Hunger Games"? Yeah. And? This might be a good time to say that I approve of Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar nomination for this. And even though the idea of putting a single number up as an evaluation of the goodness of any work is pretty silly, still those are the rules of the game, and within that game I stand by my nine stars.</fullReview>

The flashbacks are mapped out perfectly and create a depth to Joy's personality. Also the use of music flows perfectly into the story. I found myself crying just because I felt so attached to the characters and was desperate for them to succeed.

		<fullReview>This film contains a very powerful message but is weighed down by its uninteresting script and poorly placed cast.Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the script she is given. Acting from her part, as with Silver Linings is very top notch, could not complain, gaining empathy and love from the audience is what she does best, that is just a given. But something is missing that most David O' Russell films contain... and that is the chemistry within characters... what I mean by that, is that even though problems arise and people are placed in those situations, the character dialogue is very forced, and out of place, family drama is arisen for situation complication yet it all feels very unnecessary and sometimes exceedingly awkward. What worked for Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle with dysfunction lacks here because of its very mild PG-13 vibe. I strongly believe that the film's possibilities were very limited due to its PG-13 rating kind of the way I Heart Huckabees was. Dialogue and character development could have been better exemplified if it had gone for an R rating, that is just the way I feel.That being said though, the film's message of perseverance is enough to make this movie somewhat enjoyable. But nonetheless, it will probably be as easily forgotten as it was easily watched. It is very disappointing given that David O' Russell's craft lies in character development and I had my expectations quite high, regardless of reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somewhat bumpy road to success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) was the high school valedictorian but stayed home to care for her divorcing parents (Robert De Niro, Virginia Madsen). She finds herself stuck in life. Her ex-husband Tony Miranne (Édgar Ramírez) is living in the basement. Her mother watches soaps all day. Her house is falling apart. Her father is forced to live with her. He's closer to her older half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm). She has always invented but her family is not supportive. She comes up with a new mop. With money from her father's girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini) and help from everyone including best friend Jackie (Dascha Polanco), Joy struggles to navigate the business world. Tony gets her an interview with Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper), an executive at the new TV station QVC.This is a family where everybody talks but nobody listens. Directer David O. Russell wants to make them funny but I find them mostly annoying. It's a bumpy road where the quirky humor doesn't work and the drama seems very standard. There is an interesting dramatic story here but it's only the last act where it gets compelling. Russell overwhelms a good dramatic scene when her family forces her to go bankrupt with some badly overwrought writing. Then it goes into one of the best confrontation in the movie. This is a mostly flat movie that is highlighted by good work from Lawrence and a few good scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I managed to enjoy Joy even after finding out much of the narrative was dramatized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this movie Joy on Netflix DVD. It's about a woman who seems to feel her life is not satisfying-having to deal with a divorced husband who she lives with along with her divorced parents, a grandmother, and her two kids. One day, she invents a mop that she feels will revolutionize the world. Well, I'm not sure that's what she thinks at first as she simply wants to sell something that will do well for her financially. I'll stop there and just say that this seemed quite inspirational to watch though since I just found out that many passages were dramatized, I do wonder of those fictional parts were really necessary for the narrative. Still, both Mom and me enjoyed Joy and Jennifer Lawrence's performance in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly told story, mildly interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm this movie was almost interesting.. Almost.. It was very poorly told. There is way way too much time spent early describing the main characters childhood. It reached a point that you are saying to yourself 'we get it.. now move on!'. 25 mins could easily have been cut from this film without affecting the story. The relationships play strangely on screen. You never get a real sense of friendship or family other than the Ex Husband. Its more of a girl surrounded by a family of idiots and putting up with them because she has no choice. Business relationships are shallow and don't deliver on any sentiment. The visit to Dallas is ludicrous when a smallish looking town is portrayed and everyone is wearing cowboy hats, boots and western wear!. haahaaa laughable. I am guessing this movie will get a slightly elevated score because it is loosely based on a true story. But even thin I can only give it a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joy is a 2015 drama based on a true story directed by David O Russell and stars Bradley Cooper,Robert De Niro and Jennifer Lawrence(all three of these actors worked in the 2012 flick Silver Lining's Playbook)and the story is about a young woman named Joy(Lawrence)who sets up a manufacturing factory where she creates these mops where you can take the top part off and put it in a washing machine. She deals with a divorce,being a single mother,having her madcap father (played by De Niro)who is staying with her and her ex husband who is now her friend)don't ask)and Joy goes to different companies so that she can try and sell her mop and get an earning.She meets a man named Neil Walker(Bradley Cooper)who helps her out to sell these mops she created. So will she become a household name after this?Overall this film was pretty decent,its not as good as Silver Lining's Playbook as the story felt more better,here the story just dragged and dragged and dragged and I said to myself what is this film about I can't make head or tails of what this premise is about. The acting was good though Jennifer is a pretty decent actress,she's no Julie Andrews or Kate Winslet but she did a pretty good job here. If you are a fan of Lawrence's then check it out,for me it was an OK movie. Not one to watch a billion times again though.5/10C+Not bad but not that great. Watch Silver Lining's Playbook instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another pathetic effort out of Hollywood that proves they are only interested in money, not art or anything else. David Russel proves that he is one of the worst directors or writers ever! How does such an incompetent idiot like this get financial backing?! Hollywood must be full of stupid people! Here they took what is already a fairly boring story and made it much worse with the crappy writing of David Russel and even worse direction. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence accepted this role in this bad script shows that she is not a genuine actor and is just in it for the money and fame. Don't waste 2 hours of life watching this garbage! I wish I hadn't. I blame the buttheads in Hollywood that hyped this trash so much. The producers of this film are obviously money grubbing assholes! Here's hoping that karma comes around to them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never known the story of Joy Mangano before watching "Joy". I've never watched the Home Shopping Network or QVC, and I would never buy a Miracle Mop, but it looks as though Joy Mangano went through a harrowing experience to get it on the market. Although I found this to be the lowest of the collaborations between David O. Russell, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, I thought that the cast members did a good job. It's not any kind of great movie but it's still worth seeing. I actually thought that Isabella Rossellini's character was the most intriguing one in the movie. Effective support from Robert DeNiro, Diane Ladd and Virginia Madsen.</fullReview>

I understand the main theme of the story but it was already so obvious that it needed little performance by players and writers. However, when I watch the movie I feel disappointed by all of them but the story. Actors did not demonstrate that they have any idea about the theme of the story and writing ... is soooo bad... I do not have any single quote from movie in my mind ..but that being said it is better than most movies out there and it deserves 6/10. I expected much more from these casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funniest lines in "Joy" were used in the trailer ? both of them.However the trailer doesn't really give much of an idea as to what the film is about, and it's hardly a straight-out comedy ? it's hard to pin the film down to a single genre.Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) struggles to make a better life for her two young children and herself, although circumstances conspire to drag her down. When she invents a simple but effective household device, she enters into the world of mega merchandising. At first this brings even more anguish to her family and herself until, through sheer perseverance, things finally start to go her way.The film has as many heavy-handed touches as it does inspired ones. If "Joy" wasn't based on the life of a real person ? I have a wardrobe full of her Huggable Hangers ? the plot of the film would seem more dysfunctional than the way Joy's family is portrayed. But with that said, Jennifer Lawrence does give an amazing performance.The film crams in almost too much, and has trouble settling into a consistent mood until about halfway through.We get the extreme quirk of Joy's family, nearly all of whom live with her. Her mother has withdrawn from life and stays in her bedroom watching television; her ex-husband, Tony, and then her father, Rudy (Robert DeNiro), live in her basement ? despite the fact that they hate each other. Maybe it was all true; although you would think situations like that only turn up in movies to provide very contrived comic relief.The movie starts to click into gear when Joy gets involved in the manufacturing and marketing of the product she has invented. She encounters many hurdles. Bradley Cooper makes an impact as Neil Walker, a telemarketing guru who gives Joy the chance to make it big, although his constant referencing of Hollywood moguls as role models is just another odd touch in a movie that has plenty of them."Joy" is an interesting movie rather than a captivating one. However anyone planning on an appearance on "Dragon's Den" or "Shark Tank" may find Joy's struggle to get her inventions across the line an eye-opening experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J.Law shines in a disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've wanted to see Joy ever since it earned Lawrence her Best Actress nomination, and while I still think Brie Larson topped Jen's performance, it does come pretty close.JLaw gives a strong, totally convincing, brilliant performance, and she is the one who carries this dry, if not slightly mediocre film. Her effortless acting excels at making you ache along with her and gives the film a lot of much needed heart-ache and feeling. It's an inspiring story, certainly, and a moving one, but I feel like the film ruined this a bit but making us wait so long for the big climax and then draining us with its disappointment. When Joy does succeed in her endeavours, we only get a tiny glimpse of that; while most of the film should have been about the events that really matter. Enough wandering already! The ending was a weak attempt to tie up loose ends, and wasn't quite as satisfying as I'd hoped. Joy's final moment of triumph was pushed right to the end, and felt false and much more coincidental than the actual event of Joy finding out about the fraud was meant to be. The cinematography isn't original or creative at all, but it passes as okay. The script is dry in too many places, the humour lasts only a short while whenever Joy's eccentric and slightly disturbing family get even more eccentric and slightly disturbing; when Rob De Niro's on the screen the humour is drawn from his "funny" character (which is only funny because it contrasts so strongly to everyone else and Rob shines at acting grumpy and argumentative), and yet the lines (or conflict that works as humour) are too bittersweet and slightly depressing to actually work as real humour. This is a tragic tale, after all, people. Or at least it should be. I can't help feeling that Bradley Cooper was miscast. He only really acted and came alive when he was shouting or cheering or being loud; otherwise he was merely a boring presence. And him and Jennifer again? Do I really need to go into that? These days you can't get a film with Jennifer Lawrence apart from The Hunger Games that doesn't have Cooper there; either to add chemistry between his character and Jen's, or because she simply requested his presence?.etc, etc?. And let's face it, David O Russell knows these two (and De Niro). After Silver Linings and American Hustle he's obviously going with people he knows are good at what they do and won't disappoint. (Well, I thought Cooper certainly did?.)The sound track is obviously intended to fit the time period where this story takes place. Yeah, maybe it does that, but it's also annoying and uncomfortable.Yes, it had some "strong female moments", thanks to Jennifer Lawrence's acing of a strong heroine. At the end I did indeed feel ready to take on the world, and honestly was inspired by Joy's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lawrence stands out above the subpar quality of this semi-biopic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to be said when it comes a biopics of famous figures, and plenty audience come to expect when going into a biopic starring a glamorizing cast directed by David O. Russell, an inspiring filmmaker brought a true sense of charm in films such as 'Three King', 'The Silver Lining Playbook', and 'American Hustle' (haven't seen The Fighter). Joy Mangano, an American entrenpeneur who gained high business status in the 1990s with her invention of the Miracle Mop and later developed patents on hundreds of other new products that rose the woman up to fame and earned her a spot on the cover of a Forbes magazine, is the central figure of this semi-biopic drama. The film stars the ever likable Jennifer Lawrence as the titular character, a woman living an overly stressful life in New York cramped in a house supporting her two young children, her mother Terry (played by Virginia Madsen), her grandmother Mimi (played by Diane Ladd), her overachieving and arrogant sister Peggy (played by Elizabeth Rohem) and later her father Rudy (played by Robert De Niro), an auto shop owner who is forced to move down in the basement with Joy's ex-husband Tony (played by Edgar Ramirez) who he doesn't get along with too well for his attitude towards him. In an desperate effort to make a difference and possibly provide more efficient support for her family, Joy becomes the mastermind behind a brand new product known as the Miracle Mop (as mentioned above) and with the support of company executive Neil Walker (played by Bradley Cooper) to sale the product on Home Shopping Network, she rises high in the business dynasty while battling the obstacles of business management.Business can get dirty and is not always an easy road and the film significantly underlines it. And with a filmmaker like David O. Russell in the director's chair, it's quite fair to expect more than just a straight forward story of a famous business entrenpeneur. However, the beauty and charm Russell brought to his previous pictures seem rather lost here. The film is only partially based on facts of Joy Mangano and her rise to business fame while part of it is fiction-based which is not a problem as long as it tell a story a cohesive story, a task this film fails to do. The storytelling is uneven and scatters all over the place, with seemingly non-stop flashbacks of Joy's childhood and later her marriage with Tony dotted throughout the storyline. The purpose behind these flashback sequences serves little importance other than expository, and at times hurt the flow of the story. By the end, the film feels it missed some opportunities in bringing together an engaging tribute to its real- life figure it centers on. Luckily, Jennifer Lawrence who's made her third collaboration with director Russell delivers a solid performance that anchors the film. She comes charming and likable in her role to where you come to care a lot about her character, you root for her success and become frustrated by the obstacles she faces when making her way up the business ladder. Bradley Cooper, another frequent collaborator of David O. Russell, is also quite engaging in his role but sadly shares a small amount of screen time than expected. Although Robert De Niro stands well here, his role along with the rest of the supporting characters, is cut short and feels less memorable than when he played Bradley Cooper's dad is Silver Lining Playbook.Joy may deliver a considerable amount of charm with some fine performances by some strongly likable actors, the film falls deep below the level of David O. Russell's previous efforts. It is not to say that the film isn't worth watching but certainly isn't something to expect as a powerful cinematic work of art like Silver Lining Playbook and American Hustle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JoyThe Home Shopping Network works exactly like online shopping, except quantities are limited and time is running out.Two things the aspiring inventor in this dramedy knows all too well. Determined to bring her removable mop-head to market, single mother Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) convinces a QVC bigwig (Bradley Cooper) to allow her the rare opportunity to host her own segment, which eventually brings in sales.But a shifty manufacturer recommended by her deadbeat dad's (Robert De Niro) girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) could put an end to all of her success, her supply and her patent.Based on the semi-motivational true story, Joy's ensemble cast and offbeat direction offers the only entertainment in this breezy biography. Whereas the plodding script only services those high- points as it lurches towards its inspiring yet manipulated ending.Maybe next time they could focus on a real QVC superstar, like, the inventor of porcelain clown figurines.

		<fullReview>David O.Russell unites with Silver Linings cast (not forgetting American Hustle) to bring us a story inspired by a true legend and based loosely on Inventor and television salesperson Joy Mangano. He works his magic as he did with Silver Linings Some who read up about the real life Joy, might be confused, put off or even annoyed as a lot has been fictionalised for dramatic effect. Putting that aside, it's a great story, the kind you hope is actually true. I can imagine it's captured the spirit well enough for Mangano to be happy with. Like some of his previous films he likes to have multiple characters and relationships without it becoming a mess. He actually films a messy situation and turns it into a film. Family altercations, lots of tears with a splashing of weirdness which many of us can probably relate to. It really is an all-star cast with the JLaw right on centre stage. She brilliantly conveys the feelings of frustration and contained anger as a result of continuous obstacles and failures set against her all the while she struggles to keep the peace with her whole disjointed family. Candyman's Virginia Madsen (yes, Michael's Sister) is superb as soap opera addicted, house bound mother, De Niro plays that stubborn, sometimes obnoxious father who gives fortune cookie like wisdom from time to time. Edgar Ramírez as her divorced husband stroke best friend; there's part of you that thinks they're gonna get it back on. Bradley Cooper was in danger of becoming a sleaze-ball but actually turns out to be nice guy. His sells pitch about himself is really good. And was that really Blue Velvet's Isabella Rossellini? Amazing! I have to mention Chinatown Diane Ladd. As expected, it's well scripted with some great dialogue, especially between JLaw and Cooper. Diane Ladd's narrative kinda brings a fairytale touch to the film which makes it that more enchanting and inspiring. The soundtrack is excellent, creating classic scenes and depicting the mood so well. It's such a mixture too, Bee Gees, Lee Morgan, Bruce Springsteen and Cream to name a few. It's exactly what I was expecting and didn't feel mis-sold anything at all. JLaw cleans up amazingly well. Now where can I buy one of those miracle mops?

		<shortDescription>Like all David O.Russell movies, too much character focus and not enough plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is based on the true story about Joy Mangano who designed amongst else the Miracle Mop. David O. Russell is directing, and as always he has gathered his usual group of band of brothers, Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro. Joy, played by Lawrence, is a young woman who is forced to take care of her ungrateful family as they expect her to do everything for them. When she one day comes up with the idea of making a mop that wrings itself, she goes to her father, Robert De Niro, for help to create a business.Joy is unfortunately a pretty boring movie. The idea of a woman who becomes an entrepreneur and creates her own business empire, is very interesting but O. Russell throws it all away on strange side stories, such as her father and his demanding girlfriend, a strange TV guy who apparently doesn't know how to sell things despite it being his job. There's also the jealous sister and their strange mother who does nothing else but watch soap operas all day long. If O. Russell really wanted to tell a great story about a successful woman he should have toned down the side characters substantially and focused more on Lawrence's character as a struggling mother and entrepreneur. We get that the family is weighing her down after about 10 minutes into the film, but O. Russell continues to go on and on about it through the entire film.The film is almost exactly 2 hours and it feels way too long. A film like Joy, should be able to stress for 2 hours and still feel interesting. That is if the script had been more interesting. I also really think that O. Russell needs to mix up his choice of actors. To see Lawrence in yet another role she looks way too young to play and De Niro with Cooper in strange supporting roles, are just tiresome. It feels like I'm watching the same film over and over again. Don't get me wrong, director and actor collaborations can work. Just look at John Wayne and John Ford, or Leonardo DiCaprio with Martin Scorsese. But if so, the director and the actors must show more range or stick to a winning concept. That's not the case with O. Russell's latest movies. The thing he does well is choose great music, costumes and production design, but what good does that do when the movie itself is boring. Too bad, because the story about Joy is interesting. I grade it a four.David - Filmografen</fullReview>

I wish there was a story to let her shine, as the title makes you feel that you are going to watch something great and then you are disappointed by the result.

		<shortDescription>Don't come in expecting joy...that for sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well...after collaborating with Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper twice before this one, director David O Russell casts them (in a nail-on-the-head kinda fashion, as he is wont to, since flirting with the mainstream in 'The Fighter') as an inventor, her family members and a business partner, with this one, with the misleading title meant to be ironic, since the life of our protagonist has anything but joy....Always 1-upped by her selfish parents and jealous step-sibling, the movie chronicles her tale adopting (but upping, as well) the style of movies that have chronicled long-standing suffering a lone, righteous women faces, depicted in numerous movies across geographies, but tries not to get heavy-handed with the narrative, or give short shrift to a co-lead, played with realistic, yet dignified poise by one of the most underrated actors of our time, Edgar Ramirez (the new Bodhi, Ares in 'Wrath of the Titans', 'Carlos', 'Deliver us from evil', 'The Bourne Ultimatum'). I'm not sure that many might have felt this, but I did feel that the writers could have tried to humanize the main lead more than they did, by trying to also go across any character flaws she may have had. If one were to believe all the befalls her in the course of this flick, she comes off as nothing short of a saint, and though that may be something kind that the makers wanted to do with the real life character, it also has the effect of keeping her at arm's length from its intended audience (and I'm not talking about the gullible, mainstream audience that laps this stuff up without questioning anything). One of the perfect relationships depicted (there is more than 1) in the course of this story, is the one between JenLaw and Bradley Cooper (they also have last year's 'Serena' to their credit, in addition to David O Russell's 'Silver Linings playbook' &amp; 'American Hustle'), and a lot of people I watched this with expected their characters to align themselves romantically, an urge that the writers did not succumb to, in spite of the many mis-steps they do make. Another relationship that seems close to being realistic is the one JenLaw shares with her father, played by De Niro, who's not the greatest of husbands, but is a decent father, who tries treating both of his children from 2 different wives the same, even at the cost of perhaps being wrong, and choosing the wrong person for a few key responsibilities. However, depicting that is something all actors (including Elizabeth Rohm, also in 'American Hustle') do well, with O Russell's able guidance, of course (in spite of what I referred to about the distance from the main lead). The is not O Russell at his best, but is definitely much better than how it might have turned out if it were directed by someone more mainstream. JenLaw being good is not a surprise anymore, but for me, she seems to be doing her schtick, which, is a disappointment of sorts, since she's definitely both gifted, and someone who can make an effort. However, with the exception of 'American Hustle', once again, to me, she seems to be playing herself in every flick she gets to be a part of, and not as versatile as, say, Meryl Streep, to whom she's often compared to, doing Streep herself a disservice. In any case, she's young, and perhaps can try many more different things over the course of her career. One of the best things this movie does, is in showing a few of the insiders at work in the industry populated by inventors and their representatives in the tele-shopping networks. I do wish they had some more meat in that department, but what's on display here might not have been seen earlier on screen (or perhaps I'm missing those movies which did depict this phenomenon). In any case, watching this movie is time well spent, though I did have greater expectations going in, that were not completely met.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the wry humour of the family in Joy. The pacing is good. And Jennifer Lawrence is a very appealing actor, who is good at playing the steely, independent female hero. It seems to be all she plays. But although Joy is inoffensive, I don't think there's enough passion in the story to elevate this film above others. For one thing, it's way too similar in setting to Silver Linings Playbook. Of course Robert De Niro, as Joy's Dad, and Bradley Cooper, as the TV shopping channel manager, were also in Silver Linings with Lawrence. Fun for them, but a bit boring for the audience. The character Joy has a very caustic, critical family who rely on her for everything, but they do love her. But the film seems to say that in order to succeed in life, you have to be spectacularly successful in business. It's quite a materialistic view of the world. The garish, money-soaked TV shopping channel world here is seen as something quite normal. I guess for Joy it was the best way of getting her products to market, but it's not very heartwarming. The film is about how anyone living in some working class suburb with a lot of obstacles in her way can succeed with a lot if hard work and determination. It's kind of like a long advertisement for the American dream. But maybe Silver Linings Playbook was more convincing because it was about people who succeeded on a more humble, realistic level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of empty Oscar bait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Joy" is a film from last year and the newest project by writer and director David O. Russell. The filmmaker has received lots of praise and awards recognition in recent years and in my opinion almost none of it was truly deserved. "Silver Linings Playbook" was pretty mediocre. "American Hustle" was downright cringeworthy at times and it is a tough decision, but I think that with "Joy" he did hit a new low. The actors are only to blame partially. Of course, none of them was convincing, but the whole movie falls with the screenplay here. It is a mess, intended to include as many Oscar-bait situations for Lawrence playing a strong, independent female and it all does not only get pretty unrealistic, but downright bad on some occasions. This is certainly a movie that can be summarized as cringeworthy. The runtime of over 2 hours does not help things at all. The music is okay, but this is probably only because they used well-known songs from that era and nothing original.If I were the real Joy, I would be disappointed, maybe even offended. This film is never about her. It is all about letting Jennifer Lawrence look as good as possibly with all the material she is given here. And once again it becomes clear that she is an incredibly limited actress. Of course Russell wants us to think otherwise and it comes off as truly try-hard how he attempts to make her seem attractive with great range and tries to trick us into thinking she is one of the best actresses in her age group. She is far from that actually and people probably begin to realize. About time. On a more positive note, I think Bradley Cooper was bearable in here and I am not the greatest fan at all, but I've seen worse from him. But maybe it is just because everybody else in here looks quite bad and it hurts me to see Robert De Niro like this. The dialogues were truly abysmal. David O. Russell continues to disappoint. I cannot talk about his early efforts, but in the last 10 years, he came up with a lot of garbage. I recommend you to stay far far away from "Joy". This one is closer to a */***** than to a ***/*****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Joy' features plenty of commendable elements: good performances by Lawrence and Rossellini in particular, and it tells an engaging underdog story. As expected DeNiro provides an entertaining performance, but the cranky, foul-mouthed grandfather character seems a bit cliché. The tension and uncertainty of the business world is portrayed well and provides most of the dramatic tension here, at least until a final anti- climactic scene that is somewhat of a let down. 'Joy' offers two lessons: (1) Business is hard, so be ruthless, but (2) treat your business partners well. Otherwise, 'Joy' comes off a bit too polite and trite and designed to please holiday viewers. The "Joy is a magical fairy who is destined to give the world wonderful gifts like special mops and coat hangers" theme was a bit too much for me to swallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer Lawrence has the lead role in the movie Joy, in which she really showcased her talent and skill. Her character faced the many ups and downs that came with being a single mother still involved with her ex husband and a dysfunctional family. While Jennifer Lawrence tended to make the same small facial expressions and mannerisms that are typical of her in all her movies, her acting really did help make this movie better. With that being said, her role as a stress-induced mother was played very well. Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper both played their parts well, adding their own unique story to the plot. While I had no preconceived notions about how good Joy would be, I was glad to come out of the movie satisfied. Despite a handful of dull parts, the story was good and the movie did really well bringing everything together in the end. It really emphasized the stressfulness of life and the everyday hardships one goes through.

The hardships she had to endure and overcome led me to rooting for her to come out on top.

		<shortDescription>Bottom Line: Great Jennifer in a Pit of a picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JENNIFER SHINES IN "JOY"-- "JOY" Starring Jennifer Lawrence and misdirected by David O. Russell.Jennifer Lawrence shines in one of the dullest pictures of the year, another pretentious all-star miscarriage by D. O.Russell. The poster indicates that the co-star is Bradley Cooper, but he doesn't even show up until the halfway Mark, and then he doesn't even get the girl. De Niro is in it, but in such a wooden walk through that he might as well not be in it. There is also a side role by Isabella Rosselini that looks like it came from another picture -- a horror flick. Basically this is the story of a sickeningly dysfunctional family and Lawrence's real co-star is a broom! ~ ~ talk about shaggy dog -- this is about as shaggy as it gets. I felt like it was going to be a walkout at the ten minute mark, but I forced myself to sit through a senseless fifteen minute introduction featuring a child actress playing the Joy of the title, just to see what Lawrence would finally look like as an urban housewife. To my great relief even in this disheveled role she looked just as great and was just as attractive as she has been as Katnip Everdeen in The Hunger Games. This 25 year old actress has it all -- she can do no wrong, even in a turkey of a film like this. Fresh young beauty, brash engaging personalty-plus, plus a sexy low pitched voice reminiscent of early Lauren Bacall -- Bacall, in fact, was even younger when she became an overnight star inviting Bogart to whistle, and Lawrence seems to be following a similar trajectory -- so enticing she can turn jaded critics into fans. For the record O'Russell's latest study in nothingness is about a young woman who was a born Edison -- inventing a patented new dog collar at something like age ten, then -- to escape the drudgery of her dreadful dysfunctional family, including her divorced husband who hasn't left the fold and dreams of becoming the next Pressley even though he has a thick Spanish accent -- a homeless father (De Niro) who operates a failing business out of The garage -- divorced from her vapid mother (Diane Lane) who spends all day in bed watching TV soap operas -- to get away from all that, Joy now a mature inventress, designs an ingenious (?) recyclable Mop head -- on a mop that sells for a hefty $19.95, but will last a lifetime. Get it? (I didn't)Pretty dull going until we meet Bradley Cooper about halfway through the film. There the story picks up a little because of the natural chemistry between Brad and Jennifer. But even this chemistry is wasted as Brad is a career advertising executive who is more interested in Marketing the broom on TV than on bedding Jennifer down. When the broom, with Jennifer/Joy herself pushing it on TV, becomes a best seller, the corrupt company cheats Joy out of her earnings. All this is made more complicated because Isabel Rosselini gets into the act in a hateful devious self-serving manner. Here the plot becomes incomprehensible and has more to do with star promotion than with story development. In the end, Joy will of course triumph over the corrupt bosses trying to cheat her out of her just deserts and will become a wealthy TV celebrity herself. But only after several false starts that jerk the story along to a more or less triumphant conclusion. In sum, an extremely dumb movie which in its dumbness has been nominated for the Golden Globes, and has Jennifer in the running (Again!) for a Best Actress Oscar. In a way I think she deserves it for her ability to inject life into an utterly ridiculous, badly written character, in a deadly dull movie. (Another in that category this year, Cate Blanchett in Carol). O. Russell is the kind of film school director who seems to think that an excessively convoluted plot populated with a cast of unsavory characters and opening credits at the end instead of the beginning, qualifies the work as "Art". As for the nominaters who have put "Joy" up for a best film award, i am reminded of the one about the befuddled viewer at an exhibition of abstract modern art who, when asked: "What do you like?" Replies: "I don't know what I like -- but I know what I'm supposed to like". Bottom Line: Great Jennifer in a Pit of a picture -- in this disputed Oscar season it can only add fuel to the fire of good black films nudged out by bad white ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About me: I'm 44 old male, so I watched a lot of movies in my lifetime.About the Movie: Joy is the biography movie about the girl who becomes the woman who founds a business empire...Review: This is David O. Russell's latest attempt to recreate magic of "Silver Linings Playbook". But sometimes, you can't return the wheel of life. Actually, if anything, "Joy" makes me appreciate the Directors brilliance of "Silver Linings Playbook". "Joy" is watchable, a bit inspiring, but at the end it's soap opera version of "Erin Brokovich" with almost cartoonish characters. Verdict: You won't be missing out much if you decide to skip this one. Much better, look for your old copy of "Erin Brokovich". Rating:6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie felt like a (very long) Lifetime TV movie. The script was all over the place, with half-baked characters, many of them cartoonish. I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of seeing De Niro's mug. He does the same type of roles over and over and over again. Give us some time to miss you, Mr De Niro. Anyway, Joy was kind of joyless, flat and uninspiring. If you want to see a "strong woman" movie, watch Erin Brockovich! That movie/woman kicks ass. This one just blows warm air and goes nowhere.Blah. Don't waste your money on cinema tickets, wait for the DVD release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trouble Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie feels like a highly energetic, unfocused masterpiece by an artist who had the seeds of a great idea. Most of the movie is very straightforward in Joy's journey to power, but then sudden fantasy sequences pop their way in. What do they have to do with the overall story? Tons! But it takes a moment to figure that out.There's a parallel with a fictional, high-stakes, daytime soap opera. As the characters revealed their unnecessarily complex web of relations, everyone in the theater laughed. Then, cut to a scene of Jennifer Lawrence trying to fuse the explosive relationship between her divorced parents, who nearly avoid a domestic disturbance in front of two children. That's what kind of movie this is.But the relationships are real. The mother is believable. The father is believable. Joy's family situation is ridiculous, but highly possible and highly entertaining. On top of that, it's striking how memorable this family is. They want to look out for each other, but have to look out for themselves. Oh, the dramatic possibilities! The biggest disappointment, though, is Joy herself. Not Mrs. Lawrence, who delivers her star-power in spades; but the character of Joy, who feels so restrained. Even during scenes of high intensity, her emotions are so subdued that Bella Swan would be jealous (how's that for a dated reference?). And that is why the movie feels empty. That climactic moment where Jennifer Lawrence goes crazy never...And that's the movie in a nutshell. It has a lot to offer, and will divide a lot of people. It could insight riots, begin wars, and charge the internet with love it/hate it debates. If you want to join in on the fun, I'd say go see it. But you decide if it's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacularly bad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but what did I just watch? Some Spoilers ahead.I was truly looking forward to this film and now I'm not sure why. There first rule of film making is that the audience should be entertained. This was not entertaining to me in any way. The biggest failure was the script, which seemed more like a rough draft. Clumsy and looking for a few more edits and a polish. Russell seems intent on showing the audience meaningless shots and drawing them out while passing over important points like they were nothing. The best example is when Joy literally goes from bankrupt to on top of the world after a five minute meeting with a man we've never met. She divulges secret information that we didn't see her collect and scares the poor guy into giving up everything. At this point in the film, we barely remember the importance of anything she discusses. But I really didn't care at that point because I, and apparently Russell as well, wanted to just get it over with.Sorry, but what does it say about film making today when this is nominated for a Golden Globe?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taken right from this pages trivia: "Annie Mumolo's original script featuring the story of the Miracle Mop was based upon a real person: Joy Mangano, an Italian-American inventor and entrepreneur known for inventions such as the self-wringing mop" This is not anything about that! Instead you'll see a alleged amalgam of strong women woven into a sort of Cinderella sells her mop story. With evil henchmen, a jealous half sister, and kind of a nasty wealthy Stepmother.Ruined it for me, knowing the real story, and liking the real story of Joy Mangano.Just an excuse to make another movie starring JLAW and Bradley Cooper IMHO.It's not bad, but it's just a rehash of David O's favorite movie formula. Take characters out of an insane asylum and put them in a family in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Joyless Experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook &amp; American Hustle, Joy advertises itself to be a biographical comedy-drama but isn't faithful enough to qualify as a biography, has nothing but disappointment in store if what you are looking for is a compelling drama &amp; forgets midway that it's supposed to be a comedy as well.Joy tells the story of its titular character, a divorced mother of three children who attempts to overcome the overwhelming obstacles in her personal &amp; professional life by bringing her invention into the commercial market, which becomes an overnight success and marks the first step in her rise from a nobody to the founder &amp; matriarch of a powerful business dynasty.Written &amp; directed by David O. Russell, the first act of Joy has no trouble at all in getting on your nerves for Russell goes horribly smug about his ability to create interesting characters and overburdens the plot with way too many irrelevant people, who never for once allow its titular character to breathe comfortably, plus their contribution amounts to pretty much nothing in the end.Russell tries too hard in the beginning because of which the supporting cast he introduces us to turn end up being annoying much earlier than expected, thus leaving the responsibility of taking the story past the finish line on its leading lady. Editing also is an issue for the story meanders on moments that are tiresome, Cinematography adds nothing to the experience, and even the soundtrack isn't effective.Coming to the performances, Joy features quite an ensemble in Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Edgar Ramirez, Isabella Rossellini, Bradley Cooper &amp; others, amongst whom only Lawrence is able to deliver the goods. The supporting cast is anything but supportive, mostly due to the lack of characterisation in Russell's script, and while Lawrence tries to do whatever she can, she doesn't have enough material to work with.On an overall scale, Joy could've been a highly fascinating biopic for there are tiny glimpses of a hidden gem in its content but instead, it turns out to be an absolute mess that manages to stay afloat only due to Lawrence's commitment. The first act is annoying, the middle part is its only saviour while the third act arrives too abruptly &amp; ends everything a tad too quickly. Definitely the most underwhelming of all Russell-Lawrence collaborations, sitting through Joy was a joyless experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clean up on aisle...bring the mop!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometime you win and sometimes you lose. Sometimes life just doesn't play out the way you had it planned. Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence), as a child, had one of those wide open minds that let her invent things to function in her fantasy world. Life is not always fair; after her parent's divorce, Joy became the caregiver of a very dysfunctional family. Eventually the housewife ends up with her ex-husband living in the house and being joined by her disgruntled father. Trying to build a better world for herself, she struggled being beaten down after a string of failed ideas. After ten years of trying to mass-market the revolutionary floor mop she invented, Joy finally strikes gold via QVC. The attractive housewife personally pitches her product to a nation of TV shoppers. The "Hail Mary" performance produced a miracle...the Miracle Mop!Director David O. Russell's kinetic style is bogged down at times with wordy sequences and meanders a bit with what some critics consider an overly long script. However, Miss Lawrence excels as the champion of this project. JOY brings hope and inspiration in the will to succeed and survive in life.Outstanding cast that also features: Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen, Edgar Ramirez, Elisabeth Rohm and Isabella Rossellini. Also appearing are: Dascha Polanco, Susan Lucci, Donna Mills and Ken Howard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introducing "Da Chef of Da Future"?Do We have any calls?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unconventional Director David O. Russell announces the Quirks Early and Spontaneously Shifts from Annoying to Sentimental Introspection and Self-Pity Erupting into Self-Determination and Back and Forth We go for what seems like an Eternity in Hell.The Charm is Fleeting and the Black Comedy Inconsistent. The All-Star Cast Delivers Expected Traits of the Conventional, that being Stilted Rehearsed Rhetoric to make the Movie move along. The Movie has Trouble Moving from the Expected to Insightful.You will Certainly need a Miracle Mop to Clean Up this Mess. The Entertainment Value is Lost in the Middle of Social Criticism (mostly involving Family disappointments) and the "Fish Out of Water" Corporate World that our Working Class Heroine must Conquer with Limited Skills but Honorable Chutzpah as She is supposedly an Inspiration for Women Everywhere.The Tone is Typically Unbalanced for the Director but it Works Less here than in His more Successful Movies, "Three Kings" (1999) an almost Forgotten Film is a Near Masterpiece. His more Recent and Award Winning Films are not as Widely Accessible, although the Oscars and Critics say Otherwise.Overall, Nobody in this Movie is Likable and it just Tries too Hard most of the Time with Limited Success. It Strives for an Off-Beat Presentation, and especially after Arriving at QVC, the Movie is Spastic and Sputters trying to Tie Everything Together. It's "Da Chef of Da Future...Homina Homina" Sensibility is Disappointingly Dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy can reignite the dreamer in you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great cast packs this based on a true story film about a woman desperately trying to redeem her underachieving life and live her American dream. Jennifer Lawrence anchors the story of "Joy", a young divorced woman who has lost the sense of imagination and wonderment she had instilled in her as a child. As her husband says, she "has put her dreams on hold". Like many people, normal life pressures and family demands have stunned her career growth in life, and she finds herself suffocated in suburbia. Under the inspiration of her grandmother, Mimi (Diane Ladd), and overwhelming family pressures, Joy reignites her passion to dream and invent she had as a kid.After overcoming many obstacles, she manages to get her new product, a mop, in front of national television on QVC. She must mortgage her house to come up with over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to fund the manufacturing of fifty thousand mops. Despite some success, her manufacturers increase prices and certain legal contracts she didn't realize she was signing came back to bite her, landing her business with the mop in another hole. An assertive businesswoman, once again desperate for success and to prevent bankruptcy, Joy finds the contractor in Texas and talks him into fixing the financial situation. She went onto patent several other products, hundreds of different kinds.While much of the movie is relatively flat, Lawrence's performance keeps it buoyant. The first half of the movie might be fairly boring, but the movie does end on a very good level, tying the story up in a heartwarming way. She outgrows QVC, and in the evolution of home shopping becomes a big part of HSN, finally realizing that the little girl in her was behind her all along. Although it is mostly boring, it's a really good story, worth it for anyone in the mood for inspiration. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great main actress, weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had low expectation before watching the movie, but found myself really immersed in following Joy in her journey. Jenifer Lawrence did a great job of showing very strong personalities and determination of a woman named Joy. Her sharp eyes, her nervous smiles, blank face because of tiresome when seeing troubles in her family, her excitement when seeing her products sold and that "wolf- like" look when going getting her patent and property back - everything was shown perfectly. It's such a pity that the story line is quite weak. Sometimes it's too fast and feels non-logic with the story's progress, yet sometimes too slow in emotional parts. I could understand that the director and scriptwriter want to focus on Joy's personalities in contrast with her tough life. However, I hoped to see more of her inner process and creativity on screen. Overall, this is a good movie to watch, and very inspiring to me. I will watch it again some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Joy and her kids and her ex-husband, eventually and her best friend and grandma, but just about everyone else is despicable. You kept thinking and hoping that she was going to grab a gun and be haunted by many of them for the rest of her life. You'll understand when you see the movie. She does grab a gun, but, well, you will see. Oh yeah, Bradley Cooper's character was odd, neutral and supportive as it benefited him.The movie is magical in Jennifer's shadow, which is cast long and wide. She is stellar. Unfortunately, there was only time to really develop one character, Joy, apparently. Every other character is fairly one dimension. It does work on a few different levels, but not all. Sometimes you are wondering, if it is supposed to be a sophisticated dark parody, but they don't sustain it.Overall, I enjoyed it, but had a few pitfalls. It did manage to tug at the heart string a few times and you rooted for Joy to rise above the fray, sometimes you want her to burn the fray down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a semi-biographical film about a person who invented a modern hygienic mop. So all the depicted events and characters were partially real, but for the cinematic reason they have been fairly altered for a good outcome. And yes, I loved it. A very inspiring film among all the Oscars nominees this year. In some way I also felt Jennifer Lawrence should have got the award for her fine character display.Honestly, I was not interested in this, so I wanted to get over it silently as soon as possible. But I ended up enjoying a lot and instantly it became one of my favourites of the 2015. What I expected after watching its trailer was like I judged it by its cover. As I hesitated in the earlier, but strangely now I'm recommending it to all.The story of a woman who grew up listening her grandmother's motivational speeches. But realises the life is tougher than she thought and making a living is very competitive. After so many struggles in the life, she finally invents something that changes her and her family fortune forever. But like any new initiative does face, the problems arise and how she is going to fix them is what the remaining film narrates.A very interesting film in the perspective of the career option. Forget the doctors, engineers, lawyers and those who're settled in their lives with a good job in hand that pays big, but there are billions of people, to them it will definitely serve as an inspiration to ignite their future.The rating for this looks like a fair value, but still a very underrated film everywhere. Amazing actors, a little funny and a little emotional, but a very impressive film directed by the one who bought the Oscars to Jennifer Lawrence for their earlier venture together. I don't know what's between her and Bradley Cooper, but looks like their on screen chemistry is doing something big impact. This is their's fourth project together and second with the director, so I hope they do more in the future as well. This is really a wonderful film, so don't miss it.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so-so dramedy saved by Lawrence's spirited turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the one-two double whammy of the both equally praised and equally overrated Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle, oddball director David O. Russell's has taken his as per usual A list cast on a journey to of all things, the world of mops.Mop enthusiasts don't often get the chance to see their beloved cleaning tools take centre stage in big budgeted Hollywood affairs so Joy, the at one stage mooted biopic of Miracle Mop inventor and TV sales star Joy Mangano, will likely be quite the event for them whilst for the rest of us (as Joy's so-so reception over X-Mas will attest to), Joy will be a curious little experience that is highly unlikely to leave a lasting impression.A very uneasy mix of strange Russell infused comedy and family/trial over the odds drama, Joy has what seems like on face value the elements to create a really special something but with a bunch of characters that feel either underused or just not at all likable, Joy's central story of Jennifer Lawrence's hard done by mother and inventor Joy's journey with her wondrous new self-wringing mop isn't the stuff of thrilling or inspiring big budgeted film making.Teaming up with Russell for a third time, Lawrence certainly is Joy's biggest win. Her Oscar nominated turn as Joy is another finely tuned example of her talents as an actress that can see her change from comedy to dramatics in the blink of an eye and Joy is her biggest test as an actress since her breakout turn in Winter's Bone and she's more than up for the challenge. With Lawrence in awards worthy form, Joy's lack of meaty narrative drive is further hampered by an underused support cast from Bradley Cooper's TV big man Neill Walker, Robert De Niro's frustrating fatherly figure Rudy and Point Break star Edgar Ramirez's odd turn as Joy's ex-husband Tony who all seem to be floating along in a plot line that was perhaps as uninteresting to them as it is to us.In some ways just as good as American Hustle (which isn't saying much) and better than the downright tortuous Silver Linings Playbook, Joy is a watchable experience thanks to a spirited Jennifer Lawrence turn and a few nice moments but overall in the big scheme of things, Joy is yet another example of Russell's flaws as a filmmaker that will eventually catch him out badly after a string of wrongly praised oddities.3 melodrama loving mothers out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frothy entertainment this is not. A compelling story of business it is. If you're in the process of starting a business or know somebody who is, this picture is definitely worth a little over two hours of your time. And, it's fun.This picture is about a particular business -- The Miracle Mop -- and it's about business in general. And, it's about women. For once the men in the story are mostly two-dimensional knuckleheads who lack imagination. Mr. DiNiro plays one of these men very faithfully indeed.People in Sili Valley would say it's about their favorite buzzword, "disruption." Ms. Lawrence plays, with excellence, a character determined to make the most of her circumstances, by creating a durable -- not disposable -- household product. There's a plot narrative about her destiny as matriarch. That plot line is adapted from countless business success stories about men, and reworked for Ms. Lawrence's character. To me it's a little jarring because it takes a stereotype and turns it inside out.Let's hope Ms. Lawrence's career in her business -- movies -- turns out as well as her character Joy's career. The business world could use a few more hard-nosed matriarchs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Want to Buy One of Those Mops!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Joy" begins slowly in the depiction of a seriously dysfunctional family. The strongest bond is that of the caring grandmother named Mimi (Diane Ladd) and her granddaughter Joy (Jennifer Lawrence). Mimi is the film's narrator, who describes the ebb-and-flow pattern of Joy's failed marriage and stormy family relationships.The film begins to pick up steam when Joy doggedly pursues the marketing of her invention of a new style of mop. In many respects, the mop was one of the highlights of this film because it truly was a unique invention: efficient, durable, hygienic.Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as the tenacious inventor, who must deal with shady entrepreneurs and colleagues who undermine her efforts. But the film stretched credibility in the depiction of her family members who are both gullible and antagonistic to Joy. The father figure, as played by Robert DeNiro, was especially troubling in his mean-spirited and cruel treatment of his daughter. The character of the half-sister was simply determined to ruin Joy. And what about the mother, as played by Virginia Madsen? It was difficult to believe that she would be portrayed as negligent and reclusive, yet she begins a romantic relationship with the plumber! And all of these family members are living under the same roof!Overall, "Joy" was a lightweight film that never made a strong statement about the American Dream or the cutthroat world of business. This was principally a showcase for the talents of Jennifer Lawrence, who carried the film on her shoulders from start to finish. She certainly sold me on the unique features of the mop!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for those with a entrepreneurial spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching this on DVD and I was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed it a lot!I was surprised because I'd seen the many lukewarm reviews for this movie and I'd wound up with pretty low expectations.Putting aside the filmmaking/acting/directing/editing/story aspects that others have commented on (and yes I do agree Jennifer Lawrence gave a terrific performance).I just wanted to add that I can only assume the movie worked so well for me because ever since I was young I was inspired by inventors/innovators/entrepreneurs.e.g. This is going back some years but this movie put in mind of another I'd really liked that I never heard much praise for - "Tucker: the Man and His Dream" (if you're not familiar think of the story of Tesla and Elon Musk - in the 1940s!). Just noticed Tucker was directed by Francis Ford Coppola I did not realize that!I think it's part of certain people's personalities and temperament to be drawn to the act of creation, whether creating something physical, or just imagining the potential of a new idea. But not everybody is like this. Everybody's different. The world takes all kinds.In this movie we see that "creative spirit" depicted with Joy as a little girl making her paper figures in her room and obviously in later life with her invention of the "miracle mop".I don't mean to demean the reviewers who rated the movie so poorly when I say it just reminds me how subjective appreciation of art can be. Not every work is appreciated by everyone the same. It can be a very personal thing.I conjecture that those reviewers who didn't enjoy the movie must not have connected with and identified with Joy's predicament trying to overcome obstacles bringing her idea to the world like I did. I'm quite sure that's where my enjoyment of the movie came from. I was rooting for Joy. I wanted to her to win. I saw myself in her and what she was trying to do.So the movie did work for me. I enjoyed it very much.And for others who who do have that "thing", that "hunger", who dream of creating/inventing/innovating, being an entrepreneur, etc. I think this is a movie they will *really* enjoy.For those people this movie can be a lot of fun and inspirational. For those people this movie is Rocky.Rocky - with a Mop. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy--To Behold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Joy" is based on the true story of a divorced Long Island entrepreneur, Joy Mangano (played by Jennifer Lawrence), who invented the Miracle Mop in 1989. In the process she overcomes significant personal and business obstacles. Mangano develops an immensely prosperous business empire, first with QVC and later with the Home Shopping Network (HSN). This is all before retail stores realized their distribution channel was going to be decimated?first by QVC and HSN, and later by Amazon."Joy" (written and directed by David O. Russell) reveals a deeply poignant story about a young intelligent woman, from a working class family, who battles a marginally functional mother, divorce, two young kids, a jealous step-sister and corporate risk-aversion. Joy ultimately is a modern fairly tale about believing in yourself and your dreams. Read the entire review,"Joy--To Behold," at: www.unhealedwound.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting and... not much else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came and went in my city (Buenos Aires) without making any noise whatsoever, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. But I am. First, because an actress like Jennifer Lawrence would work on such a poorly made film. Second, because I would've never expected such poor performances from a cast of that magnitude. And third, because I can't believe actors like De Niro or Issabella Rosellini would even consider doing characters of that cheesiness level. Lawrence can get tears from a stone, that's nothing new. However, not even the intensity she shows here, can carry on a movie that bores you to tears. Rossellini and De Niro look like kids in a school play. Bradley Cooper... well, he was never much of an actor to start with. Add to that a "comedy" that, save for for a few moments that can get a smile out of you, just isn't there. So, all in all, a very talented, amazingly likable young actress, coupled with an old, tired cast, and a director who, by the looks of it, couldn't direct traffic. I gave this movie a 7 only because of J.L.'s performance. The rest, in my opinion, isn't worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The life and times of Joy, inventor of the self-wringing mop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie on DVD from my local library. I must like David O. Russell films, this is one in a line that keeps getting longer.Joy Mangano is a real person and the one who invented the self-wringing mop that sold well on QVC. As the writer/director explains in the making-of extra, maybe 50% of this movie is actually based on her and her story, the rest of daring females he either heard about or knew. The rest is fiction including many fictional characters. His purpose was to tell a good story, not to make a biographical film.I have had a lukewarm feeling for Jennifer Lawrence but the more I see her the more I like her. She really is a good actress, here she plays Joy from about 25 to about 45. She was born into a very dysfunctional family and put off college to help take care of her 'mental' mother, even though Joy had been Valedictorian of her class. Now she was working as an airline agent. With two children and her ex husband living in her basement.By way of backstory we see as a young girl of maybe 10 she had a vivid imagination but had lost that over the years. Her big inspiration comes when they are on a sail boat, some bottles of wine break, she mops up the mess but cuts her hands on shards of glass. What if she could invent a self-wringing mop with a removable head that can be thrown into the laundry?The whole story follows her and her difficulties in the real world of business, patents, and deceptive contractors. The real Joy now has over 100 patents and a thriving business.I enjoyed this movie and Lawrence is super.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not mind blowing, but good never the less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is a dramatisation of the true story about a woman called 'Joy' and her journey from rags to riches.THE BASICS- Without giving too much away, Joy is a thirty-something year old woman who has a very hectic life; young kids, difficult parents, failed marriage and stressful job...but she's very intelligent and has a certain drive to better herself. This story documents how Joy developed a new product, from inspiration through design, development and completion, it shows the many struggles along the way, both personal and professional. It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley cooper to name a few, it is one of several movies staring these actors that's been directed by David O'Russell.MY OPINION- My thoughts on this movie are that it hit all the points the director wanted to touch upon, Joy is a strong woman who has to deal with all manner of crap, is beset on all sides by difficulties made worse by selfish people in her life. I rather enjoyed Jennifer Lawrence in this, she's got a certain quality that the director can bring out...she's sort of strong yet vulnerable. There were times in this that made me think Joy would not succeed, times in which I'm sure the average person would crumble, I was, quite honestly, on the edge of my seat really sympathetically rooting for her to do well.All the actors, even the children, did a superb job in this movie, Robert De Niros character and his girlfriend were good antagonists who really made me feel rather sorry for Joy and bewildered as to why she'd put up with them in the way she did. IN A NUTSHELL- A very decent, feel good drama, well directed, well acted, totally watchable...perhaps it will lack in a certain type of excitement for some, and others may think it 'over eggs' how hectic Joys' life seems to be, but if one can overlook this minor criticism I'm sure most would rather like this excellent piece of work.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy - Film Reflections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy embraces you with a warm hug swiftly stabbing you in the back with a hidden, unnerving, plot. Jennifer Lawrence (Joy) performs at ever soaring heights with no sign of plateau. Ms. Lawrence's co-stars are drawn to her on-screen, regardless of the scene context. Even when Joy's character is berated, her energy radiates through the screen, into your core.Joy has a natural pace, and the time floats by as it does at an enjoyable family holiday. The potential drudgery of a tale of cynical iterations of plotted personal, and financial, destruction of a character, can destroy a film; however, these characteristics only build the audience's suspense; owed solely to Lawrence's dynamic and authentic emotional range, and Mr. McKay's whimsical directorial style.Bradley Cooper (Neil Walker) has a memorable on screen chemistry with Lawrence, and his ability to make us experience the unreadable, slightly affable qualities of Walker, are superb.Robert De Niro (Rudy) wraps us in a hateful personality blanket; all tucked in are Isabella Rossellini (Trudy) and Elisabeth Röhm (Peggy). Together this threesome anchors the opposing force that Joy so majestically battles, with the help of her honorable, and decent, friends played by Edgar Ramirez (Tony) and Dacha Polanco (Jackie).We come to the egg holding together her life meatloaf. Joy's daughter and grandmother. One inspires her, while one encourages her. All the while the narration, by Diane Ladd (Mimi), guides us through Joy's turmoil until her implosion, caused by the weight imposed on her, by plotting family, and business, forces.The release of this bane, and the born phoenix that remains, is Lawrence's owned triumph. A work to behold. A scene to remember. The spark for which I watch films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie with a decent star turn from Jennifer Lawrence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is an overwrought, self-indulgent mess which wastes and pulls into question the talent of everyone in front of and behind the camera. Told in insufferable voice-over by a grandmother character who constantly talks about how great its protagonist, Joy is a movie that never trusts its audience to connect a single dot and hasn't found a narrative device too heavy handed to use (dream sequences, flashbacks, and flash-forwards also abound). This is a movie that says repeatedly it is a movie about the strength of women, as if it wants a pat on the back for it; it's a good thing for movies to be about that, but not for them to be this self- congratulatory about it. It only knows melodrama and high-volume, never taking time to meditate and always looking to create a classic scene (Isabella Rosselini's four rules, for example, which has great pieces but runs far too long). On the bright side, Edgar Ramirez is once again great in a bad movie, and DE Niro at least looks like he's interested, but its balanced by Bradley Cooper mumbling his way through the proceedings. Lawrence is fine, but her talents don't extend quite far enough to save this train-wreck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I am shocked to see people reviews of this movie. Jennifer Lawrence performance was flawless. I felt worried, sad, frustrated, and excited for every odd Joy had to go thru. Maybe it is because I can identify with her struggle, her impatience to be "someone" and her thirst of making an idea come true.When there's someone who expects big things from you, but you don't feel you are doing enough or that you don't know what exactly are you doing you feel lost, pressured BUT excited. In my opinion this movie is VERY realistic, very easy to identify with. If you want to watch a simple movie with 10 ups and 1 down and 10 ups again, this is not it. This has real life struggle, 3 downs 1 up, 3 more downs and a big one up and so on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched this on a plane, and missing parts of the story (as well as not completely finishing the movie), this review is based on parts that I did watch.The acting is pretty great, and the cast really did well at portraying their characters. The chemistry between characters has a palpable tension which aids in establishing the dynamics of the family. The settings too are well designed and help bring the era of that time back to life. Lawrence's character shows how perseverance and hard- work isn't all that is needed to be successful. Her reliance on other people proves detrimental, and the film pretty much says that to succeed you need to be the one who does everything. I really do want to finish watching the rest of the film now. Just to see how she ends up, and where the family members go from there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe this film was too quirky for some people but not for me. I loved the twists and turns that added a comic layer to the story. Or was it a simple story? (Yes, if you want to sum it up in a line but then you would have missed the point!) And what about its lesson to the viewers? Was there meant to be one? The little bits of reviews I have seen after viewing this fine production surprised me and left me feeling sorry for many of the reviewers. Go to the cinema wearing whatever you like except great expectations! No, it wasn't like the book. No, it wasn't a morality lesson! No, it did not always make sense! No, it was not like any of the other films made by the same actors! It had its own unique screen presence.So, would I recommend this film? Yes, definitely! But if you want a lesson or an inspiration or a book story then I recommend you go to a school, an art gallery or a library and don't even think of looking at "Joy".For me this was a wonderful piece of cinema, refreshing and original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy; the story of a cleaning journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Bradley Cooper is one remarkable actor. Jennifer Lawrence is another one. Robert De Niro is a third one. In with them in a movie... have a true and amazing script. Add a director with a magic touch.... there you have the start to Neil Walkers brilliant one liner: "Stop. Can you make 50.000 of these mops until the end of next week?"To have an idea and to bring it to the table is one thing. To make the distance and believe in the product all the way is another thing. This lady did that. Inspiring and uplifting movie with a an ordinary day-feeling. Joy is the true tale of an woman that crawls back to her life... just to get knocked down... just to get up again, more intense.... just to get knocked back down all over again... almost....... just to get up again... and then up.... and up...This motion picture has a sense that gives me the thinking that it could easy have been 30 more minutes, to give the viewer a more in depth journey of the joy (pun untended) that Joy had after all the ups and downs. More than two times both acting and events seemed forced and... odd. This brings down the rate.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Packaged in a contemporary fashion. Sound and picture well made. Makes the movie a good fair look. - The actors : Splendid!Oscar nomination for Jennifer Lawrence. - The story : True and positive story. Enough said. - Entertainment : Inspiring. Insightful. Scratching the surface of the story told; could have been more emotional. Capturing the viewer. - Age : All ages can find something in this one.7,5 out of 10 (Short elucidation for the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a complete joy, but not a downer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acclaimed Writer-Director David O. Russell's playbook was not so golden or silver for that matter in his creation of his latest film "Joy", but I still think it had enough americana woman hustle and brought a woman fighter to the limelight effectively. "Joy" stars Jennifer Lawrence as Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop. Her story details the spirit of invention of a young girl which later materialized even further as an adult. Sure, there were a few aspects of "Joy" that needed some cleaning; including too much emphasis on Joy's dysfunctional family which were very unlikeable. But that did not stop me on feeling joy in observing the title character's fiery determination to succeed. Lawrence was sensational as Joy, and it was no miracle that she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Bradley Cooper was enigmatic as the cable-access merchandising channel mogul Neil Walker, and his scenes with Lawrence brought back some of that silver lining chemistry between these two; however, I was not sold on the fact that Cooper's performance had to be limited to just a few scenes. I also saw no new inventiveness in the supporting performances of Robert DeNiro as Joy's father, Virgina Madsen as Joy's mother, and Edgar Ramirez as Joy's ex-hubby. Nevertheless, it was the Joy herself, Jennifer Lawrence, that made me buy into it. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mom wanted to see this so we went to see it and i really enjoyed it! It definitely deserved the Best Actress In A Leading Role nominee for Jennifer Lawrence. She did so great in Joy. I think it should have been nominated for more in my opinion. Joy tells the story of the woman who made The Miracle Mop. She has to deal with a lot of crap in her life and she comes out on top. She has 2 kids, a mom who sits around all day watching soap operas, a crazy father, an ex-husband who still lives with her, and not enough money. She designs the Miracle Mop and takes it to an HSN kind of thing. The first time it goes on, a man who had no idea what he was doing, messed up the whole thing and they get no sales. The second &amp; third time Joy goes up and makes over 1,000 sales each time. The end just makes you feel so happy because it shows that Joy is now finally on top and she did what she wanted and everything worked out for her and she is rich and she still has a kind heart. It is very good and worth the watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misstep in David O. Russell's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is the story of the title character (Jennifer Lawrence), who rose to become founder and matriarch of a powerful family business dynasty.Jennifer Lawrence may be America's Sweetheart, and over the last few years we have gotten used to her collaborations with Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro and director David O. Russell. But this seems to be a misstep in the group's collective career.Lawrence has been praised for this role, even taking home a Golden Globe for it. She is up for the best actress Oscar, as well. The difference being that the Globes divide the categories between drama and comedy, whereas the Oscars lump everything together. It makes things a bit tougher. And, frankly, this is not Lawrence's best role. She has the luck of not facing Amy Adams, Meryl Streep or one of those perennial nominees. But comparing her in this film to Brie Larson in "Room"? No contest.Although a ridiculously fictionalized account of Joy Mangano's story, I enjoyed it. At least the second half (the film is very slow to get going). It had a quirkiness to it that might have been more appropriate in a Wes Anderson film. The plumber is especially amusing. It also, strangely enough, made me a little curious about the history of QVC and the Home Shopping Network.But really, this is not an instant classic and will probably quickly fade. "American Hustle" was great, and "Silver Linings Playbook" (though not my favorite) is much more memorable. But you can't have one of the best films every year, so we will have to wait and see what Russell comes up with next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of complaints here which barely amount to more than nitpicking some rough spots in direction and plot. Yet despite these flaws, 'Joy" has the essential elements for a winning attraction - it captivates, it's compelling and its entertaining. And I believe the ultimate responsibility for storytelling weaknesses falls on the director.I don't put stock into those negative reviews that are imbued with subtle tones of anger and hate. A little detachment in reviewing goes along way for effective and convincing arguments.The characters may be badly drawn but the acting all around is good. The scenery is good and refreshing, the script good despite some needed trimming. My last litmus test - would I watch this movie again? And in "Joy" yes I would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many distractions that limit the film's potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to like and so much to dislike in Joy (2015). It offers intriguing and unflattering insights into the business ethics and inner workings of television's high-volume shopping channels, but the novelty dims as the pretty-housewife-turns-mega-entrepreneur story gives way to your standard "anyone can be President" soap, and with a mop would you believe. The acting is sharp, controlled, and often humorous in a downtown Bronx kind of way, and the regular sideshows into feminine vulnerabilities and strengths ensures Joy has a place on the shelves of feminist film, but only just.There are too many distractions that limit the film's potential to provide insight into the human spirit under extreme adversity. If Joy were Jim or some other male the story would flop like her mops, so it rests entirely on the shoulders of the implacable Jennifer Lawrence to make us see beyond the film's clichés about the crushing effects of American capitalism on the individual. The American Rifle Association must have leapt for Joy when she admits to feeling better after shooting a few rounds to relieve her pent-up anger about male treachery and being told go home to tend the family. Overall, this is an entertaining, if somewhat clichéd story of feminine triumphalism in the fabricated-value world of television commerce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious, With A Few Decent Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is a loosely based film on Joy Mangano, an entrepreneur and inventor who became an overnight success after inventing the miracle mop, but not without overcoming personal and professional obstacles.Not much to like about this film. Joy is a very David O. Russell-Esque film, meaning that the film focuses so much on the characters that, at times, it can take away from the plot/storyline. American Hustle, also a David O. Russell film, has many scenes in which the characters are improvising in order to more powerfully express the character's feeling and emotions. Which can very affective, but films like these are always in danger of going off course plot-wise. This occurs as well in Joy, which works as a benefit for Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro, as they can use their superior acting skills to their advantage in films with a lot of improvisation. Other aspects of the film such as the music, screenplay, and the cinematography offer nothing special. If the screenplay had been balanced between character dialogue/improvisation, and actually plot, the screenplay would be a little better. But because of the focus mostly on the characters and less on the effectiveness of the story-line, the screenplay was not good enough. Overall, besides the relatively strong acting performances by Lawrence and De Niro, of course, the other aspects of the film only barely live up to average scores.Direction: 6/10, Cinematography: 7/10, Acting: 8/10, Music: 6/10, Screenplay: 5/10Overall: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"She'd put up with just about anything, until when she had to bring the hammer down." Joy (Lawrence) is a single mother who is trying to take care of her daughter, reclusive mother, ex-husband and her father (De Niro) who has recently moved back in with her. Everyone wants a piece of her and her time which leaves nothing for herself. One day while cleaning Joy invents a new type of mop. She soon finds out that inventing was the easy part, and get rich quick ideas are not all that they seem. This was a movie I wasn't all that excited about watching. One of the main reasons was because I didn't see how a movie about the woman that invented the Miracle Mop could be interesting at all. I was very wrong. The movie is surprisingly tense and interesting and really makes you feel happiness, anger and worry throughout. To me that is the sign of a good movie, by the way it makes you feel. I was almost immediately sucked in and interested and entertained the entire time. This is one of the biggest surprises I have seen recently and I actually highly recommend this movie. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and no matter how you feel about it going it this is one you should watch. Also features one of Jennifer Lawrence's best performances. I very surprisingly give this an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for all feminists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is Jennifer Lawrence, nothing joyful about her life. The movie is actually about her struggles, about how everyone, including her family is trying to bring her down and how she copes with it. Because she is brilliant. Only her grandmother understands and knows that Joy is destined for greatness. If only Joy believed that herself.The movie starts slow but picks up steam once Joy makes her first invention ? The Magic Mop or that's what it is called in India. Now we love the magic mop here ? especially my generation of women who are working and don't have too much time. Most of us have help in cleaning our houses but even the maids don't want to take pains to hand mop the house. Enter Magic Mop and its thousand variations. The easy way to clean the house. And to get to know that it was invented by a woman was just pure Joy.Anyways, back to the movie. Joy has always been a creator unlike others in her family. At one point in time she is just so fed up of her life that she designs this mop. She draws it herself, does the first prototype herself and even gets a shot at selling her product at QVC. But nothing goes well for her. Without spoiling it for you, I would just say that all's well that ends well. She becomes the matriarch who supports her entire family once she becomes successful. It is loosely based on Joy Mangano who created the mop and it seems holds over 100 patents. Fascinating story hers as well. But that's for another blog.Jennifer Lawrence according to me has done better in this kind of disturbed and a little crazy character. I liked her much better in Silver Linings Playbook or even American Hustle where the kind of crazy is at a different level. Realized that Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper are constant features in some of her best work ? well they make a good team though Bradley Cooper and De Niro don't really share scenes in this one.Lawrence is more subdued in this, more controlled somehow that was a little unsettling. Some of the scenes and plot twists were also a little unbelievable for me. But having said all of this, a very enjoyable movie. Like I said, give me a movie with a female lead and I will lap it up. So this review may be a little biased from that perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the looks of it, Director David O. Russell plans to make an anthology of movies with his Lawrence-Cooper-De Niro squad after all. We've previously seen him working with the trio in Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and American Hustle (2013). 2015 marks their third collaboration in Joy. Who can accuse him of "repetitivity" on casting duties when he has these three good actors/friends on his speed dial? Plus, third time's a charm, right? Well, that'll be up for debate.The opening sequence flashes these words on-screen, "This film is inspired by real women, and one in particular," and in that instant, the film has already set viewer expectations that this is going to be one of those feminist, woman empowerment films. The woman we're talking about here is Joy Mangano, an American entrepreneur eminent in her appearances on the Home Shopping Network and being the acclaimed inventor of the self-wringing "Miracle Mop." Yes, the movie will be focusing on the humble beginnings of Joy's matriarchal empire brought by her efforts to sell the said retractable mop. That may not sound thrilling on paper, but Pursuit of Happiness did it in 2006 as Will Smith's character sells a bone density scanner throughout the entire film, so don't judge too early.Jennifer Lawrence plays the titular character ? a young, struggling, single mom of two trapped in a complicated home with her dysfunctional family. Along with her grandmother and two dependent children, is her socially-withdrawn mother (Virginia Madsen) who watches soap operas the whole day, her over-achiever half-sister (Elisabeth Röhm) who constantly humiliates her in front of her children, her ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) who lives in the basement of the house waiting for his singing career to take off, and her philandering father (Robert De Niro) who just moved back in. Her vision, as a kid, of a fictional world filled with wonderments one after another is spoiled by the realization that she has fallen into exasperating routines and forlorn mediocrity amidst a circus of family drama. Might I remind again that the name of our protagonist is Joy? Life's ironic, right?Read the full review here: http://goo.gl/H1mkbN</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We need more movies like this--but they're not going to show up any time soon. I've started a little funky business from scratch using next-to-no money and plenty of "sweat equity." It's a nightmare. Every new business is subjected to "running the gauntlet" of predators and parasites who live to infect, sicken and destroy new businesses.It's not fashionable to talk about it, but the hazards that Joy faces in this film ARE NOT peculiar, rare or unlikely. They are TYPICAL of the kinds of problems encountered by anyone trying to start a business who doesn't have plenty of muscle--and by that I mean "pull" at city hall or elsewhere that allows you to push back when the parasites start to sink in their claws.But most small businesses are started by people who are not business experts and don't have "pull"--they are like baby turtles trying to reach the ocean and being eaten by birds, snakes, crabs, sharks and every other animal on the beach. Joy's trials are the type that usually prove fatal or near-fatal to newcomers to the business world. It's a jungle out there--and that's a fact.We need more films like this so I'm giving it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know there's an interesting story within Joy. Careless direction and writing turns this into a dirty mop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Children are always told by their peers that their meant for more in life and that they will give the world something amazing. The message is very "kumbaya" and vague, if not well meaning. The problem is that the adults that tell children this often don't see other things getting in the way; money, health, or simply the people around them that hold back on their supposed "big ideas". Another thing that people fail to notice is that it doesn't just take ambition to make it big, but it requires an inclination for the gambles involved; something that not everyone is blessed with. Now for those that are willing to take the risk, the next step is finding the right people to receive help from. In this day in age, there are a lot of resources one can go to in order make their dreams come true. Investors are an easy start from the crowd funding sites of Kickstarter and Indigogo to a popular reality show like Shark Tank. The only issue now is that since the idea of self-doing most things from self-publishing and self-marketing has become popular, it's too easy to get lost in a sea of other good ideas. One young woman tries to get her great idea noticed in Joy.The idea behind this movie is that it's sort of a bio story on Joy Mangano, the inventor whose products have been featured on QVC and Home Shopping Network, but the movie makes it clear that this is a fictional Joy. Anyway, Joy (played by Jennifer Lawrence) is a divorced mother of two who's already working hard as a booking agent for an airline while living in a house that's also occupied by her soap opera obsessed mother Terri (played by Virginia Madsen), supporting grandmother MiMi (played by Diane Ladd), and her ex-husband Tony (played by Édgar Ramírez). If that's not enough, her divorced parents Terri and Rudy (played by Robert De Niro) are always fighting and her half sister Peggy (played by Elisabeth Röhm) is always putting down like a bully.It's shown early that Joy loves making things since she was a girl. It's during childhood where her MiMi kept telling her that she will be strong and be successful. One day, Joy starts developing an idea for a mop that self-wrings and is washer friendly. Calling it the Miracle Mop, she takes it to QVC where executive Neil Walker (played by Bradley Cooper) gives her the chance to go on TV and try to sell this thing.Joy seems to have an interesting story in there and even a good set of actors to pull this off, so where could they go wrong? The direction.David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle) is our director with who've I've always seen as?overrated and Joy seems to be the most misguided so far. While I know that biographies have to take creative liberties in some spots, by only using the basis of the Miracle Mop woman and combining the ideas of several strong women, we get a main character whose only personality is "strong independent women".What's strange is that the film makes creative and narrative errors. The formula is practically the same as a sports movie that remains predictable, especially when they keep hammering in that Joy WILL be a strong person. If I do have anything nice to say, the film still looks good and the actors are well casted in these parts. But another trait of David O. Russell is dysfunctional families that are so horrible as humans, that they seem nearly cartoon-like.I'll give this three Miracle Mops out of ten. Joy never comes of as a genuine story about a strong woman, but rather an empty shell with the director telling the audience, "you can do this". Rather then inspiring, it's pandering. I'd say to mop this movie away for something cleaner and more refined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The star power of Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro, together again after wonderful chemistry in "Silver Linings Playbook" is not enough to make this film a top-tier film for 2015. Ms. Lawrence plays an extremely co-dependent woman who cannot say "No" to anyone. Her mother lives in her bed watching soaps 24-hours a day, her father moves in and out of the house when his lady friends throw him out, and her ex-husband lives in her basement where he practices his Latin songs. Her plans to become someone important have been postponed by all the care taking she must do for her many, ungrateful hangers-on.She is to become a giant star of cable home shopping networks. She invents a new kind of mop and goes deeply into debt to finance the fabrication of 50,000 of them to be sold on a cable shopping show. Everything goes wrong. Her supplier is crooked; her sister tries to undermine her commercial triumph, her father is a fool in business, and Joy reaches the edge of complete disaster.The story ends happily enough and Joy becomes some sort of home shopping channel legend, and thereby, she is able to continue to provide for her worthless family members.The cast of characters were not evil, but they were unlikeable. The arc of the story was too predictable. In the end, it was hard to root for Joy who makes millions selling crap on channels I avoid at all costs. It is not an awful film, but it does not approach the brilliance of the film which first brought these actors together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never get those two hours of my life back. I feel cheated. This was a very badly made movie. It wasn't clever or black comedy nor grotesque and provoking alla Fellini. De Niro was appalling. Not sure what has happened of late but his on screen presence is lacking substance and I can't quite work out what has gone wrong. He was one of my favourite actors and now I can't bear to watch him on screen. Thank God for Bradley Cooper and Isabella Rosselini who managed to have enough class to transcend this drivel. When Bradley Cooper came on the screen I could control my desire to walk out of the theatre and sit through this movie. Jennifer Lawerence did a good job and was very centred and contained in her role but poor direction and Luke-warm writing didn't give her much to go on. Also I now have mopophobia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I just want to mention that I was disappointed even before I saw the movie, when I realized that this is the third time David O. Russell is making a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, and second time with De Niro and the other two all together. It just gives off a "me and my buddies made a movie and you have to see it, mostly because we're all the rage nowadays" vibe. Does David O. Russell even knows how to direct a movie without these artists? Does he realize that as fans we're getting nauseous of his christophernolaning the movies he directs?Factoring this throughout the movie you have a feel that someone has been miscast, a feeling that is even stronger because of the uneven pace of the movie. Parts of Joy are happening fast and in an incomprehensible fashion, while the rest of the movie is a family drama with no obvious or superficial emotional ties between each other. It's really hard to pinpoint what is wrong with the movie, and you constantly compare it with the Silver Linings Playbook even though the two movies are worlds apart in aspect of the story, and yet, there's no way you can escape the comparison, when all faces are familiar. As a result of this the viewer is left with the feeling that no actor was rightly cast or good for the role even though their performances are solid, and when I say solid I mean solid as much as the poorly written script allowed them to be at their best.So maybe working with the same people over and over again is not the best idea. It limits audience to think inside the box and alters expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Putting Jennifer Lawrence at the center of any film is always a good idea. Pretty much guaranteed a big profit and a great performance, especially when paired with frequent collaborator David O. Russell. Silver Linings Playbook is a great offbeat rom-com and American Hustle is an entertaining film even if it isn't nearly good enough to be an Oscar caliber film. So I figured Joy would just be the next step for this film duo, sadly I was mistaken.Joy tells the story of Joy Mangano, the creator of the miracle mop, and her rise to power alongside her family of four generations. Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy and does so well for the most part. Her accent is inconsistent but she's really the only character you care about throughout the film. Even Joy is unlikable at times. The rest of the cast is filled out with plenty of talent considering you have Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper (both O. Russell staples) in important roles. De Niro is very good and gives the film some of its rare funny moments. Cooper's significant role in act 2 takes the film in a much needed energetic direction but the rest of the film turns out to be rather dull.Lawrence's performance is enough to forgive some of the various issues. But there is one issue that continued to rise between Joy and her several obstacles in which everything seems to happen very easily. Not that she didn't work hard enough, but that the problems the movie brings up are resolved quickly and aren't handled with care. With no one likable and the conflicts being glossed over, Joy becomes yet another forgettable Oscar hopeful. +De Niro+Cooper is magnetic-Lawrence's accent is awful-No one is likable-Dry and dull story5.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent actors and a fine story that could have been related in 6 minutes. A proper production team would know that most of this film should have ended up on the cutting room floor. The story of Joy and her travails is inspiring but this telling of it made this movie memorable to me for 1 reason; it's the 3rd movie I ever couldn't wait to end. DeNiro is an excellent actor all-around but it's evident that his career is in its dying days; it's so below him to have taken this role. Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job but, I hope for the sake of her future acting career, that there would be a way for her to erase this awful experience from her resume... or, at least to (mini- spoiler) bury it for 17 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The titular character founds a dynasty on the invention of a mop and becomes an overnight roaring successBetrayal, treachery, the loss of innocence and the scars of love, pave the road to becoming a true leader of family and enterprise when facing a world of unforgiving commerce. Allies become adversaries and vice versa, both inside and outside the family, as her inner life and fierce imagination carry her through the storm she faces.......Well if the film tells you anything or gives you any metaphorical message, it's that don't stop dreaming, don't stop believing in yourself, because if Jennifer Lawrence can carry this awfully strange movie, you'll be a success too.And it's one weird movie to get through, it's as if Time Burton and David Cronenberg have been given one of the most pointless success stories and have been advised to glam it up a little.If it wasn't for the downright bizarre imagery, settings and some really good performances, this could have gone right down the toilet for O'Russell.I mean fair enough, a story about a girl inventing a mop that turns her into a success doesn't sound like the stuff of Hollywood dreams, so kudos to the makers for making the sub characters just so wonderfully bizarre.Madsen is at her most strangest here as the mother with whom she has some bizarre interaction with the TV every so often.De Niro turns up to show give viewers an antidote to Dirty Grandpa, and proves he still can put in a good performance, even when the film is bonkers.Cooper is easily the best thing about the film, a shark from the beginning, he gives Joy her joy, and believes in her and her morals.Lawrence is good, but she rarely changes her facial expressions through the film, she has but too, perplexed and bewildered. She puts in a decent turn, but I needed more physical emotion.It will divide a lot of people, because it's so oddly bizarre when it doesn't have to be, but when a film about a mop inventor isn't in the least bit boring, the makers must be doing something right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an inspiring flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Lawrence is a girl with the golden goose. She never fails to deliver. Her portrayals are powerful. Her eyes are so riveting that it is hard not to empathize with the pain she wears. Her demeanour dons a skin that is hard not to relate to and she makes you sway to her rhythm. The natural act she puts on is unmatched.David O' Russell cashes in on Lawrence just right. To helm Joy as a character so marred by spears of life that she forgets her true talents is what he tries to manifest. Bludgeoning her further are intricacies that end up in a chain reaction and pile her under the boulders of responsibilities. That's where the flick takes off. It is a pleasant perspective taken in a diegetic tone by her grandma Mimi, an optimist with a very kind heart, sadly clouded like any grandmother is. Sidelined and unseen she keeps pointing out the good in her, and occasionally making Joy believe that she was special."Maybe your dreams are on a hold right now." The bit about creation was an eye-opener. On behalf of all the creators across the world, I would like to thank Russell to have given it a proper coverage. If we don't look at the reel life for a second and focus on the real, so many of us have dreams that we started up with, a natural flair that promised us silently our true purpose in life, but alas life happened to us and we got skimmed to the footpath, diverged. Russell's take is just brilliant when he focuses on the pointlessness of relations, tangled ways of the living, and the insanity of it all. He subtly delves into the territory of epiphany with Joy's dreams, the only point I felt the flick's balance missing as he tries to blend in melodrama and humour at the same time. The epiphany bit sadly needed more emphasis.However what unfurls thereon is a constant struggle to prove the mettle, the malice in commerce and the hopelessness that doesn't seem to stop, until it does. It is quite inspiring for people who have put their dreams on hold. There are so many people who point their fingers at you when you are doing something good, succeeding at it, so many near ones who reek of jealousy and try to pull you down, something which Russell captures magnificently.He uses exceptional screenplay to dignify the fallen talent, and weaves some great words. The rest is picked up by the cast really well. There are bits that shatter you to pieces, despair that boils you up but you can't simply help but marvel at the perseverance of Joy as she fights everything and comes out a victor.If you wanna feel inspired just go for it!</fullReview>

The only thing she has going for her is she likes to tinker and has the work ethic to see a good idea through. So when she has a eureka moment after a failed excursion on her father's new girlfriend's boat, she quickly invents a household object that may just be her ticket out of systemic poverty.I don't think I'm giving much away by saying the movie asks its audience to hinge their emotional cache on a mop. The self-wringing Miracle Mop to be exact, invented by honest-to-God real person Joy Mangano. Leave it to director David O. Russell to find a decent story in the life of a QVC luminary and keep it just this side of rational. The prologue of the film lovingly dedicates the movie to "daring women," which Joy certainly is but Russell wisely omits the last name to give the audience a universality. This too can be your story of success if you have grit and a good idea. It's a great theme in in crazy movie . unlike Linings Playbook (2012) where the rushed, overlapping dialogue and melodramatic mugging serves to highlight the immediacy of, say dealing with the mob, here there's nothing holding us to the characters and their goals...except Joy. Russell seems to be aware of his own style and juxtaposes the lives on screen with an 80's era soap opera which consumes the life of Joy's mother. The parallel is interesting in theory Not usually the voice of hope, I really wanted to like this movie. A movie about the positives of hard work and entrepreneurship has not hit theaters since Pursuit of Happyiness (2006). Yet out of all modern directors working today, David O. Russell feels like a quixotic mouthpiece for such a hopeful theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly speaking, this film is a breath of fresh air and the storytelling is extraordinary. I loved the way the events were sequenced, that there is no sex in the movie, and that Joy the main character is not motivated by a love interest. If you enjoyed Winter's Bone, (or Take Care Of My Cat) then you will appreciate following the journey of the protagonist and the mundane, yet maddening challenges she has to face. I'm so glad to have seen a woman's professional, creative and inventive contribution to society portrayed on screen with realism, elegance and maturity. If you are a woman/fan of Jennifer Lawrence/David O' Russel films, then chances are you will love this. If you are a man, you will probably enjoy this anyway, because there is action and toughness in every scene, and the film invites you kindly as an equal to the main character. If you enjoyed this movie, you may also enjoy the book: In My Shoes by Tamara Mellon, and (perhaps) the TV Series Mad Men. With How to Be Single and more cool fem films releasing I hope they keep making stuff like this in different styles so I can head to the cinema with my girls for regular movie nights out!I only wish I could have seen it on big screen when it came out and not on my laptop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the film a few hours ago without knowing anything about it. The characters were absolutely entertaining, tragically genuine, and easy to relate to. I was drawn in to the main characters struggle and the story was really engaging. There was comedy, tragedy, triumph, delightful quirkiness, and a nice touch of modern day Americana that touched a chord with me. The multi-generational household, the intertwining of anglo and Latin culture that is currently taking place throughout America, the dysfunction that exists in families (maybe there was a little much here), the difficulties of making ends meet, ambition, reality vs. what we thought life would be like, imperfect parenting, etc... It was all there and made for a beautifully entertaining and original film. I'm glad to see a film like this in the mainstream. Don't get me wrong, a dystopian sci-fi adventure is always fun but this was a nice break from the action and overly cheesy movies that strive for striking an emotional chord. If you're in the mood for something different then give this a twirl. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.Quite a few commenters didn't find the film that entertaining but the beauty of art is that everyone gets something different out of it. Personally this movie was a welcome change from the usual product that Hollywood cranks out I had a great time watching it.</fullReview>

Jennifer Lawrence brings much strength, courage and plenty of angst to the role as the housewife to matriarch role demands.Her wacky family can be anyone's wacky family. They help her. they hurt her. There are wonderful performances by Robert di Niro, Virginia Madsen, Diane Ladd, Isabella Rossellini and Bradley Cooper. her ex husband is good too. Don't know Edgar Ramirez but he's a good actor. Diana Polanco from Orange is the New Black knocks her role out of the ballpark. She has something. I don't know what it is - but it's a certain kind of star power.The story is just that - the story of what it takes to succeed in business. With all her breaks, she still could have been broken many times along the way.It's great they just tell us her family tried to sue her for the business later but didn't show it. Couldn't take much more of them.Watch it because it's great filmmaking - and it stars Jennifer Lawrence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a weird and dreamlike biopic, loosely based on the life of Joy Mangano, an inventor and strong mother who got rich in the 90's, by selling a revolutionary self-wringing mop. No doubt, Jennifer Lawrence gives a strong lead-performance, and the other actors are all around supporting her very well. This is one of those movies where the cast can make a difference to sustain and give depth to a story which is not that interesting or deep by itself, but leaves, despite its confused narration, many thought provoking hints at the numerous dysfunctions inside family. There are hilarious moments, counterbalanced by more dramatic and tense ones, always held together by a magnetic Jennifer Lawrence, who will probably please more the female audience, offering the model of a woman who does not need a man to stand up and face life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was not a joy at all................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters, yes I am very much a fan of Jennifer Lawrence. In fact, I consider her one of the best actresses of today. I have seen all her movies to date, and each time she impresses me. Whether its being a fearless heroine in The Hunger Games movies, her very underrated role in Winter's Bone, or being the free-spirited Tiffany in Silver Linings Playbook, Jennifer Lawrence's acting ability is very admirable in today's cinema.Joy Mangano lives a very fast-paced life. Between being a mother, whose ex-husband still lives at Joy's residence along with Joy's kids, mom, grandmother, and father, Joy can never seem to catch a break. Unbeknownst to Joy's relatives at first, Joy in fact has an idea; a creation that Joy has crafted all on her own.Not surprisingly, Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Joy Mangano is excellent throughout the movie. She brings the same ferocity in her portrayal here as she does in every role, and she delivers her lines really well. Robert DeNiro stars as Joy's father Rudy, and does a nice job; though I do wish he had longer screen time. Bradley Cooper also plays the straightforward character Neil Walker.David O. Russell has collaborated with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robert DeNiro numerous times, and though they all do well in Joy, I hate that the movie has faults.Joy's pacing is not always where it should be, and some scenes feel rather rushed. Some characters feel more necessary than others, while certain characters just feel out of place. Make no mistake, Joy is the character you are gonna root for, and her daughter is adorable, but I kept feeling that: 1. Robert DeNiro's talents feel wasted here, as opposed to his role in Silver Linings Playbook 2. Jennifer Lawrence does a fantastic job as always, but the story doesn't always allow her to display her full range.I feel that the story stumbles between the first and second act, but Joy does have a rather enjoyable third act. And overall, Joy also does particularly well as a movie when the humor is on display. The movie has a nice message to back it up and it is shot exceptionally well. Joy is no classic for David O. Russell or Jennifer Lawrence, but it still does a decent job of bringing Joy Mangano to life on- screen(thanks in large part to Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal).To close, I do feel Joy is a one time movie. See it once, and you'll either like it or dislike it. Hopefully, Jennifer Lawrence's 2016 movie Passengers with Chris Pratt is more memorable. Happy Holidays.</fullReview>

Is there some kind of wild story about Joy Mangano that nobody knows about? I checked out her Wikipedia page, and it said nothing about her previous life, other than, she was a single-mom, who struggled her way to the top. It's the rags to riches story, one that we've all heard. You know, the one about the American dream. But so what? That story has been told a million times. Some of the greatest movies ever made are about that. Is this going to be another one? ?. It's about the Miracle Mop, how could it? What possessed the director of American Hustle to make a movie about that? Then the trailer came out, and I was even more stunned. It looked pretty damn good, but I have no idea what it was trying to say. The standout shots were Bradley Cooper smiling widely and Jennifer Lawrence shooting a shotgun in a parking lot. I don't get it, but you know what? I've got to see this thing. David O. Russell might have something really creative here.Did he? Eh, maybe he did? The verdict is, Joy is a strange movie. Everything that I wondered about it was true. It was a non-story, made out to be a big deal. There really wasn't that much to work with. The story is as small as the Wikipedia page of Joy Mangano. What Russell does instead is focusing in on the determination and strength of one woman. Joy, as insignificant as her story may be, is presented here as a female warrior. Someone, who despite every curveball society threw at her, gets up and punches back even harder. Everyone in her life tells her that the Miracle Mop is a failure, but she still pushes through and gets it on the market. As with most of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, she lead an impossible goal as hard as she could take it, and wins. Being that she is a woman, in a male-centric world, she's even more of a reason to be admired.So when you take into account the character of Joy, you allow yourself to really like this movie. However, when you look around Joy, nothing else is really there. David O. Russell has always liked making movies about multiple characters, all of whom are slightly insane. He did that terrifically in Silver Linings Playbook, and perhaps best of all in American Hustle. You're reminded of movies like Nashville and Magnolia when you see David O. Russell developing and expanding so many interesting, oddball characters into one movie revolving around one theme. But it doesn't work here. It's sad actually. The characters around Joy sure are crazy, but they don't serve any purpose, and they are sorely underdeveloped. The story is narrated by Joy's grandmother, who is the only other powerful woman in the movie, and Joy's inspiration in life. This sounds like a great character, but the problem is, we aren't told much about her. We have Joy's Mother, played by Virginia Madsen, who does nothing through movie but lay in her bed and watch soap operas. We actually get to see the soap opera she watches throughout the movie.. and I wish we didn't, because it added absolutely nothing to story. Robert De Niro plays Joy's father, who's basically an obnoxious playboy.. and that's about it.. poor De Niro, remember when he was good in movies? Edgar Ramirez plays Joy's ex-husband, who lives in her basement, making money as Joy's business associate and as failed lounge singer.. OK then. Worst of all is a largely thankless role by Bradley Cooper as the TV executive at QVC. Talk about a waste. Bradley Cooper, who in the last five years has given some incredible performances, is relegated to a walk-on role, with nothing to do but flirt with J Law again, as he always does, because audiences seem to like that.I seem to be criticizing the movie an awful lot, but it doesn't mean that I disliked it. I'm just slightly disappointed that David O. Russell didn't try harder to make this as good as the last two movies he's made. Maybe it wasn't meant to be in the first place. But I still liked this movie. Why after all that do I still like this movie? Two words, Jennifer Lawrence. She's mesmerizing, she's beautiful, she's the actress of our time. She's amazing as Joy Mangano. She made me genuinely feel some very strong feelings about the woman who made the Miracle Mop. I was not expecting that. J Law, whatever you are doing, never stop. Keep going.As a story about women in general, Joy comes up very short. As a film about one in particular, I did have fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As an inspirational true story, Joy works almost entirely because of the absolute and commanding delivery from Jennifer Lawrence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To a certain extent, Joy can be construed as a follow up to 2012's Best Picture nominee, Silver Linings Playbook. That's because almost everyone from the latter film is back, including director David O. Russell. Does it work as a worthy follow up? Yes and no. And at the risk of sounding sexist (albeit unintentionally), I might even add that Joy is best appreciated by the fairer sex. But that doesn't necessarily mean the male audience is in for a snooze fest either.Evident right from the monochromatic prologue, Russell's narrative is a reverence for head-strong women with the heart to match. It's a pitch Russell has been honing for some time now, and after last year's American Hustle (also nominated for Best Picture), this would be his third consecutive film featuring the highly gifted Jennifer Lawrence. In a befitting parallel, Lawrence plays the titular Joy Mangano, a Long-Island based single mother who invented the Miracle Mop in the 1990s. Russell's story is narrated by Joy's grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd), the only person who believes that her granddaughter is special. A divorcée herself, Joy has to deal with bickering from her divorced parents (Robert De Niro and Virginia Madsen), raising her kids in a rickety house, and her Tom Jones wannabe ex-husband (Édgar Ramírez) living in the basement. Russell's nuance for dysfunctional family farce forms a bulk of the narrative before Joy comes up with the idea of a self-wringing mop. Designing and inventing the mop was the easy part. Selling it to the American public turns out to be a nightmare, made worse by betrayal and jealously from her family.That Joy went on to become a wealthy entrepreneur with over 100 patented products is barely touched upon. Instead, Russell's main focus is on Joy's struggles, and then a tonal shift through her determination to overcome a series of obstacles. Quite literally, Joy is initially on her hands and knees, mopping up after her deranged family, before a faceoff in Texas turns her into an overnight success story. In retrospect this might seem predictable, but the film's appeal is in its rags to riches underdog factor. It's a modern day Cinderella story without the need of a prince, and therein lies Russell's pro feminist plot device. As such, there isn't a male lead and the film is almost entirely anchored by Lawrence with gravitas much beyond her age. Reminiscent of her commanding tenacity in Winter's Bone, Lawrence is not only worthy of another Oscar nomination, her delivery here suggests that she could be in for the long-haul as a true blue Hollywood sweetheart. Meanwhile, De Niro is at his sarcastic best opposite Isabella Rossellini as Rudy and Trudy, hopeless romantics with a bizarre twist. Also returning is Bradley Cooper but late in the film. Although his character plays an important role, Cooper's inclusion is more of a submissive nod to previous collaborations with the director.In a year that produced quite a few films based on true stories, Joy works as an inspirational biopic owing to Russell's aptitude for minefield dramedies. Once again, characters punctuate the story with screwball mayhem but unlike Silver Linings Playbook, spontaneous hilarity is quickly replaced by an emotional backdrop that peaks towards the end. Like Erin Brockovich before, the heart of the film is highly inspiring in saying that if one woman could, any woman can. With or without a man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Joyless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the great cast from the "Silver Lining Playbook" reunited with the director but it doesn't work. Perhaps you can't get excited about a mop?The movie lacks pace. It is too long, slow and choppy. The male leads are wasted. De Niro has nothing much to do or say. Cooper is a one note cheerleader. The women are slightly better written then the male character. There is an annoying a out of TV soap opera scenes. The story is supposedly being told from the grandmother's point of view, even after she has passed on.The problem is you are expecting better and it is not much more then a made for Lifetime cable movie. No need to see it in a theater, it will be just as boring on a home platform.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a lot of joy in the first half but second half is an improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have written this in an earlier review of another film and I will say it again, if a movie appears bad within the first 10-15 minutes, it will usually be bad. Bit different here as the first 10-15 minutes of Joy were cringe-worthy. Hell, whilst we're at it, the first half of the film was largely forgettable. Luckily, the second half was better but that's not enough to warrant a dramatic increase in the score I give it. If I were reviewing the first half of the film alone, it would have warranted a 3. The first half's story was all over the place like a dog's breakfast and some scenes and such were totally unnecessary and done nothing to help the story flow through. It wasted about an hour trying to get the point across to, what I would imagine, a slightly bored audience. Negatives for this are the aforementioned script/story and David O'Russell's directing, one instance being where one character is taking and the camera is one another character (eg. Robert De Niro is talking yet the camera is focused on Edgar Ramirez). that normally doesn't bother me but for some reason, it did here. Acting was all right, mainly from Jennifer Lawrence who plays a strong female role as Joy and avoids making her weak in any way and Bradley Cooper. Cooper can be a little hit and miss as an actor but he was badly needed in the first half. Even Robert De Niro wasn't bad in some parts, though we know he is past his prime. Although her character was annoying, it must be said Virginia Madsen blended in to her environment well as I only knew t was her after the credit rolled. It's one of them movies where it's not too good, it's not too bad, it's not even quite right but it's just take it or leave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely hated this film . So much so it made me angry . I was angry because I cannot for the life of me understand the praise this film has received and why it has received academy award nominations. Why does is a film about a woman who is trying to sell a squeezy mop ever gets made in the first place ? The story really is as dull as it sounds . Duller in fact. I'm not a fan of David O. Russell anyway . Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle were overrated in my opinion but neither were anywhere near as bad as this . If I never see Bradley Cooper and his lopsided face fawning over " look at me I'm the new Meryl Streep" Jennifer Lawrence again in a movie it will be too soon and what was De Niro playing at ?? Another terrible performance from the once great man. This movie felt like a Sunday afternoon , made for TV flick , that my wife would watch and that I run a mile from. Sickly sweet with sentiment , so much so that you literally feel nauseated watching it. It's amazing that I managed to get to the end of this drivel. It's a bloody mop for Christ sake - Who cares ??? One of the worst films I have seen in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy: "We got here from hard work, patience, and humility. Don't think the world owes you anything because the world owes you nothing".The story is about a Long Island single mother who had to fight every inch of the way when she came up with the Miracle Mop - a self- wringing design that turned her into one of the most successful entrepreneurs in America.So I've just seen David O. Russell's new film "Joy" and it was pretty disappointing. This is coming from a guy who wanted this movie to be brilliant and it was on my most anticipated movie of December, but it sadly didn't live up to that exceptions.You had no idea how much I wanted "Joy" to be a great movie and also how I wanted it to be David O. Russell's best film, because while I wasn't a big fan of American Hustle (after re-watching a few times) but I thought this movie will bring him back to his old roots, because I've notice he picks style over substance in his last movie (Silver Linings Playbook isn't one of them). The story in the movie seemed to be laid back for David O. Russell, so he doesn't go too carried away with the style he presents in his movies. And there are a few good shots, creative camera work in some scenes, and that's really it. He dose nothing to the story that made it exciting or even interesting. I like David O. Russell as a director, I really do, but this guy is pretty far away from flawless.Jennifer Lawrence performance was the one thing that wasn't disappointing. She did a great and strong performance in this movie, but her Long Island accent was a bit off at times and you may think that the actually person herself that Lawrence is playing (Joy Mangano) sounds like that, well I did my research and let me tell you no, she doesn't. But all that side, she did a solid performance and she was the only likable character in this movie. Great work Lawrence.The story itself isn't that interesting coming to think of it. Just reading the story of what the movie is about isn't that engaging, but I thought with a huge cast like this, David O. Russell behind the camera and the trailers made it look promising, because maybe these more to this story that we don't know about, but in the movie stuff happens and are main character is going through hell...oh and these the unlikable characters in Joys life. This story is loosely based on Joy Mangano life.I didn't give a single crap about any of the character in this movie and that's this movie biggest flaw. All of characters (expect Joy) feels like movie characters and every time their say something it wasn't convincing and didn't feel real. Not once did I feel attached to any of these characters. Theses a lot of characters in this movie played by big name actors, but I just wished it was written and executed better.The first half of the movie didn't really know what it wanted to be. It was very scatted as it goes back and forward showing what Joys family life was like. All of that is trying to do some character development or just to flesh out her character, but I wish those flashbacks had a purpose in the rest of the story, as I felt it was thrown in there.Overall "Joy" isn't a bad movie, I mean Jennifer Lawrence basically saves this movie from getting a much lower rating from me. The movie looked good, it was well shot at times and even when I didn't like the characters in the movie, I still thought the actors where good. I wanted to like this movie but sadly, it was a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mop up this mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The movie is inspired by the true story of entrepreneur Joy Mangano (listed here as an Executive Producer) and her 1990 invention of the Miracle Mop. You should know that neither "Mangano" nor "Miracle Mop" is mentioned, and much of the story sprung from the mind of writer/director David O Russell. Also, if you have been a fan of Mr. Russell's past few films (American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter), you should be warned that even though there is a large cast of familiar supporting players, it doesn't play like his usual ensemble piece, but rather as a true star vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence (who plays Joy).This is a working class Italian-American family, and the multi-generational aspect is in full play as Joy (a single, working mom) and her two kids share the house with Mimi (Joy's grandmother played by Diane Ladd), Joy's mom (Virginia Madsen) who is a recluse dressed in 60's party attire and addicted to daytime soap operas, and Joy's dad (Robert DeNiro) and her ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) who share the basement. Tony is the rare combination of slacker-Tom Jones impersonator. Also involved are Joy's agitating and envious step-sister Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm) and Dad's new wealthy girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini). This family makes The Royal Tenenbaums look suburban stale.Flashbacks and dreams, along with the supportive words of Mimi, convince us that Joy is a creative genius, whose once promising abilities have been stifled by the harsh realities of raising kids, and overseeing a bunch of free-loaders who mostly never miss a chance to steal a bit of Joy's light. All of that changes one day thanks to glass shards in her palm and the close proximity of crayons and drawing paper. Poof! Just like that, Joy has invented a revolutionary new kind of mop.Given her family history and current situation, even when things go right for Joy, they never go all the way right. Having to borrow money from Trudy and depend on those who may or may not have her best interest at heart, makes for an endless chain of obstacles and challenges. But Joy is all about perseverance and self-actualization. The story emphasizes Joy's stick-to-it-ness, and the process of learning about the legalities and pitfalls of starting and running one's own business. Even those who should be supportive often ridicule and voice their doubts.The film shifts when Joy meets Neal Walker (Bradley Cooper) who runs QVC. This was the time period when TV home shopping was in its infancy. Joan Rivers (played here by her daughter Melissa) was one of the early stars, and Joy's Miracle Mop was one of the early successes. It's a new world to Joy, but she's a quick study and her tough-mindedness and sense of fairness and right come in to play on multiple occasions. The above is much more story than I would typically describe, but it helps make the point that although Jennifer Lawrence continues to prove she is something quite special as an actress, the story is a bit of a mess and the pacing of the film is clumsy ? slapstick blended with ultra-serious. It's impossible to connect with this oddball group of folks, who mostly seem to be pulled right off of various TV sitcoms. Even using the soap opera (complete with Susan Lucci, Donna Mills, and Laura Wright) as a parallel to Joy's life never quite works.Jennifer Lawrence's performance deserves to be ranked right with Joan Crawford's in Mildred Pierce, but the different styles of the two movies results in only one being unforgettable. Director Russell mines the fractured family/group in many of his projects, and given his immense talent, we can be sure future projects will be more in line with the level of his recent past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy to the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is the kind of woman whose shirt is always sullied with the stains of others. She is the linchpin to a ball and chain family of has- beens, could-have-beens and never-will-bes. They firmly wrap their collective fingers around her ankles like a decaying hand from the grave, and hold her until she becomes the failure that will justify their own. For if Joy can't do it, who can?David O. Russell takes what could have been another drab biopic about a person overcoming the odds, and makes a quirky fairy-tale of familial and business politics where Joy is Cinderella and Prince Charming is success. Ironically, halfway through, the movie lost me slightly as it gained focus, for its biopic DNA began to reveal itself. I preferred the freewheeling nature of the first half. And at times, "Joy" feels too chock-full of good ideas that don't give each other time to breathe, such as an interesting soap opera element present during the beginning of the film that doesn't go anywhere and then goes away. It reminded me of a similar tool used on this last season of "Fargo."I've read others who find that Robert De Niro was miscast as Joy's man-child father, but I highly disagree--they said the same thing about "True Confessions," where I also disagree. He nails the comedic nuances in Russell's script that a lesser actor--or actor not as in tune to Russell's humor--might have missed, such as his bashful smile as he flirts with a widow over the phone. Isabella Rosellini also stands out, though her character has a jarring conversion from farcical to menacing. Jennifer Lawrence continues her upward trajectory as an actor, getting a chance to flex her non- crazy muscles.While "Joy" isn't quite as good as it could have been, it's still a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Business has its charm. Even Goethe wasn't immune and celebrated it in his 'Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship' describing this young man who wants to become an actor and nonetheless loses himself in the beauty of the Double-entry Bookkeeping system, every time he has to perform it.And the present film is not bad: it's not boring, not badly acted (how could it possibly be?), edited or directed. It's not significantly different from thousands of other releases of the same genre. Even the moral message is the same. So it's not original. And I am not a big fan of David Russel either (among his films I really liked only 'Three Kings', 1999). Nonetheless I had a pleasant hour and a half watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm-hearted, inspirational film that will have particular resonance with women of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story line is based on true life of a female entrepreneur named Joy Mangano, who goes on to invent the retractable mop. While that sounds a tad boring, the movie is so much more than that. It's about finding your calling in life, sticking to your gut even when your life seems to be falling apart and your family creates additional obstacles for you, and following what it is, that you believe in. It is about perseverance. While there are lots of biopics on entrepreneurs, I can't remember seeing one specifically about a female inventor and entrepreneur. What's also refreshing is, it's not treated as a biopic which often have a documentary styled tone that takes itself too seriously, but is treated as a story about a dysfunctional family, where a young woman is struggling to keep it together, with her two young children, divorced husband still living in the basement of her house, her sad, socially withdrawn mother, and her philandering father, all living under the same roof. She is a woman trying to survive, and find that part of her that she had lost, the dreams of her childhood which she lay dormant given the circumstances of her life: shouldering the responsibilities of looking after parents, making a living to support her children, and taking care a house that always seems to fall apart. (i.e. the mundane and all too real responsibilities of adulthood.) Amidst the sacrifices she had made for her family, she had neglected the dreams of her childhood.What is a David O. Russell movie without the dysfunctional dynamics of a family?! I found the movie had a good balance between showing the tragedy of certain characters and their situations, and punctuating with some lightness. I was actually surprised by the amount of humor that's here, because the trailer gave no indication of any joy in the film. In fact, I had actually joked about the irony of the trailer, where Jennifer Lawrence's character never actually smiled, given the name of the movie. A character in this movie also makes a reference about Joy not being so joyous.It's also poignant without being too soppy, particularly in the treatment of its female characters. For example, I responded to Joy's mother who seemed to have given up on life, and confined her life to living in her bedroom with her beloved soap operas; choosing to engage with characters from soapbox, than the people around her. Don't we know people like that in real life? Russell infused some outrageous scenes, costumes, and dialogues from Joy's mom's beloved TV soap into the film, to make light of the circumstances.It was also refreshing to see Joy's relationship with her ex-husband without the drama and hiccups. I thought it was wonderfully done, and I loved the line about being "the best divorced couples". I also appreciated the fact, that her character wasn't romantically entangled with anyone in the movie, and the director made a point about emphasizing that she doesn't need a prince to come rescue here.See full review: http://www.artspeaksy.com/joy-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since there are already almost 200 reviews, I will go in a different direction. When I got to the middle of the film, I was thinking about the style of the Cohen's. This films starts with a brilliant idea. The funny moments are very good. They're stylish, peculiar, really funny and excruciatingly naughty.De Niro, as always, delivers some of the most pungent lines. Expectations grow inside you as soon as you see a plumber falling in love with Joy's mum... or the other way around.The cinematography is an element that plays a key role in the story. I wouldn't say this film is depressing. The tones, the lighting, the interior shots never lead the audience to feel depressed. And, since the relationship between all the characters is so dysfunctional and dystopian, the film feels OK with all the funny things that happen in the first part. Yes, dark comedy, but "open" comedy... they never tried to do anything else, just to put incredibly absurd elements to it so you enjoy them from the very beginning.What happens in the second part is superbly shot. A different approach, more stylised, more "in your face" and brutal. But as good as the cinematography is, the story certainly suffers of some sort of "what happened to it?" that can't be put aside. It's entertaining, yes, but a bit off-colour. The believability we had before (remember... comedy) turns into a serious affair. And it's not that brilliant.The cast is star-studded and Jennifer Lawrence definitely shines in the first part. I wouldn't say the same about the second part of the film... it struggles with the story and it is completely predictable (Jennifer still does a great job, more an X-Girl than Joy). I loved it, anyway, because it's full of "coenish" details, dark humour and wit. I expect something big in the future from this team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russell's turd of a script makes Joy a poor but not unpleasant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forced to watch Joy in order to have a legitimate opinion on Oscar season, I really wanted to hate it. I can't even do that!I love David O. Russell movies. The Fighter and American Hustle are both sensational movies and I even quite like Silver Linings Playbook for what it is. His direction of Joy is more of what I love about his films - warm and emotionally investing direction with memorable characters - even though I do believe its the worst one he's done in five years. He does a good job of conveying the highly stressful and emotionally draining lifestyle that Joy Mangano had to live with all of her incapable relatives on her hands. His use of the lively guitar strumming as background music for Joy's first sales pitch is inspired. But there's a lot of stuff I found utterly stupid even if it couldn't ruin the movie entirely. Characters are always kissing Jennifer Lawrence at random times - greetings, farewells, thanks - and it is almost like John Travolta was directing and saying "more face touching". A normal scene is playing out as Joy tries to find her lanyard and then one of her friends comes out with a line straight out of a Sean Maguire therapy session from Good Will Hunting. Russell has no idea how to balance his light moments with his heavy ones. The dream scene was one of the least subtle pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen, and for some utterly insane reason he decides to have her sing for about 10 seconds. My jaw dropped at the utter bizarreness of the whole thing.The editing to this film is all over the place. A film should have one editor who clears things with the director. Joy apparently had many and you can tell. Scenes are inconsistently constructed, with a crowd of people vanishing as the camera changes perspective. At least three times a scene is dropped in the middle of another scene, breaking up the latter for no reason. Different takes are obviously edited together as people are standing in different places between takes, pieces of conversation are missing. Large portions of the film are messy.I wanted to hate on Jennifer Lawrence because I think she's an incredibly overrated actress but she's probably the highlight of the film. Don't get me wrong, her nomination had nothing to do with her skill in this movie, she had nothing on competitors like Blythe Danner or Kiki Rodriguez. But she helps Russell convey the stress in Joy's life, and she shows anger and emotion when needed. Her whispered conversations with Bradley Cooper are the film's best moments. Her performance is far better in context that in the trailer - seeing important moments in the trailer is just painful to watch but in the flow of the film it comes close to working. By far her worst scene is when she has stage fright whilst selling her mop. There's no acting whatsoever, Lawrence is literally just waiting for the script to take her to the next thing she has to do. The biggest fault of the film is Russell's casting of Lawrence as a thirty- something mother of two. Not only is Lawrence 25, she's a young looking 25. She has baby cheeks and a sweet smile. Compared to Patricia Arquette from Boyhood or Sandra Bullock from The Blind Side, who have naturally maternal appearances, Lawrence is completely out of place. Even Brie Larson from Room put extra effort into her performance and had natural chemistry with young Tremblay. Lawrence and the actress playing her daughter are perfunctory at best.The supporting cast is stuffed full of characters because David O. Russell wanted more "strong women" characters also undergoing character arcs. I don't know who they are, because they aren't in this film. Robert DeNiro barely tries as Joy's father Rudy (does he have bipolar, because he has enormous mood swings which I can't be certain are meant to be in the script). Isabella Rossellini overdoes it as Trudi, Rudy's new girlfriend, a character barely established before she starts bankrolling Joy. Diane Ladd narrates the film (apparently as an afterthought) and contributes nothing even when her character carks it halfway through. Elisabeth Rohm is straight up terrible as the fictional half-sister of Joy, whether she is droning her lines or unenthusiastically injected conflict into the film. Virginia Madsen might as well not even be there. Bradley Cooper is the only saving grace as the super calm and very reasonable businessman in charge of the QVC network.It is ultimately David O. Russell's dreadful screenplay that causes Joy the most damage. It could not be more obvious that a white man was trying to write a feminist film here. At the start of the film a young Joy says "I don't need a prince", whilst throughout Joy glares down penis jokes and offers to help her. That's how Russell thinks women act and think. Worse are the scenes written for men to establish the patriarchy that Joy is fighting. Hearing DeNiro say "its my fault for encouraging her to be more than a housewife" gave me AIDS. Some scenes are so artificial and cliché that they are painful to watch - most notably any scene in which someone is selling the mop. Obstacles are created for Joy and then swiftly written over, creating the question as to why they existed in the first place. There's also the bizarre haircut = come into her own motif which makes no sense.The film could have been a 3/5 for me if it weren't for the film's final scene. Joy's children are grown up, DeNiro now sports a snowy beard, Rosselini is almost unrecognisable...AND JOY STILL LOOKS LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE WITH A JODIE FOSTER HAIRCUT. Mark your calenders, everyone. David O. Russell predicts that 50 year old Jennifer Lawrence will look exactly the same as she does today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JOY is a "joyless" picture. Director David O. Russell paints a world of people who's first words upon hearing of a new idea is "no". Plucked into the middle of this "joylessness" is JOY (Jennifer Lawrence) a "can do" person with a mind filled with ideas. Can she overcome this environment of negativeness and achieve her goals and dreams?This character is played by Jennifer Lawrence, what do you think?Lawrence has been nominated for the 4th time for an Oscar on the strength on her being the only true bright spot in this movie. This is the 3rd time that she has been nominated while being directed by David O. Russell and, clearly, there is a "chemistry" between these two. She obviously trusts him and he is able to draw out strong performances from her.I only wish this movie was up to her performance.As I said, Joy is dropped in this world of negative, populated by strong actors like Virginia Madsen, Isabella Rosellini and, most importantly, Robert DeNiro. It's good to see that he still knows how to act and not just clown around in sex comedies (but that's a topic for a different day). Unfortunately, I didn't want to spend time in the middle of these negative people. They weren't interesting, they were just negative and that got (at least for me) draining after awhile. Maybe that was director Russell's point. If so, I got it.The only other bright spot in this film is the work Bradley Cooper, who shows up for 3 brief (but welcome) scenes. I used the word "chemistry" earlier and that would be a word that I would use for the pairing of Lawrence and Cooper. Lawrence's performance was strong but positively radiated when she was playing off of Cooper. Unfortunately, these scenes are too few and far between to save this movie. I'd sure like to see a movie with these two playing off each other. Oh yes! SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK and American HUSTLE exists.See this movie for Lawrence, the rest will be an endurance test.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Joy is a 2015 American semi-biographical drama film, written and directed by David O. Russell and starring Jennifer Lawrence as Joy (loosely based on Joy Mangano), a self-made millionaire who created her own business empire. -Mangano was a divorced mother with three children in the early 1990s when she invented the Miracle Mop and became an overnight success, after which she patented many other products, often selling on the Home Shopping Network and QVC. The film is a semi-fictional and inspirational portrayal of how Mangano overcame personal and professional obstacles to rise to the top. -Joy received a wide theatrical release on December 25, 2015, and is distributed by 20th Century Fox. It earned mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lawrence's performance but criticized the writing and pace of the film, particularly the first half. Joy received two Golden Globe Award nominations including Best Motion Picture ? Musical or Comedy and a win for Lawrence for Best Actress ? Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Lawrence also received a nomination for Best Actress at the 88th Academy Awards--Critical response:-Joy has received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60%, based on 180 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's consensus reads, "Joy is anchored by a strong performance from Jennifer Lawrence, although director David O. Russell's uncertain approach to its fascinating fact-based tale only sporadically sparks bursts of the titular emotion." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by David O. Russell (Three Kings, The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle), I have always said to myself that even if a film is only nominated one Oscar, I will definitely watch it, but also this one did look and sound pretty good. Basically, set in 1989, divorced mother of two Joy Mangano (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jennifer Lawrence) works as a booking clerk for Eastern Airlines, she lives in Quogue, New York with her two young children and members of her family, including her ex-husband Tony (The Bourne Ultimatum's Édgar Ramírez). Joy's mother Terry (Candyman's Virginia Madsen) spends all day watching soap operas while lying in bed to escape her life, with Joy running the household, her mother and father Rudy (Robert De Niro) fight whenever he comes to the house. Her older half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm) as an overachiever always humiliates Joy in front of her children, her grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd) and her best friend Jackie (Dascha Polanco) are the only ones encouraging Joy to pursue her inventing ambitions and become a strong successful woman. Joy's father divorces his third wife and starts dating wealthy Italian widow Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), who has business experience, one day Joy and others take a trip on Trudy's boat, Joy drops a glass of red wine and tries to clean the mess with a mop, she cuts her hand with the broken glass when wringing the mop. Joy has an idea, she draws some random sketches, then drafts blueprints, she wants to create a self-wringing mop with a head that can also be detached and washed in the washing machine to be used again. Joy builds a prototype and convinces Trudy to invest in the product, they make a deal for low price manufacturing of mop parts with a company in California, and Joy also pays $50,000 in royalties, to avoid a potential lawsuit, to a man in Hong Kong who supposedly has created a similar product, the company bills Joy for faulty parts, but she refuses to pay the fees. Trudy advises Joy to take out a second mortgage on her home to help pay her costs, and looking for a quick, easy way to sell her product she meets QVC executive Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper), he is impressed and shows Joy his in infomercials, where celebrities sell entrepreneur's products through a telethon system, Neil tells her to manufacture 50,000 mops ready to sell. The first infomercial fails, due to the celebrity presenter being unable to work the mop, Joy insists she should present her product on QVC herself, Neil agrees to give her a chance, she and her product become an overnight success, the mop earning thousands on QVC, and things look up for the family, with Terry falling for hired Haitian plumber Toussaint (Heroes' Jimmy Jean-Louis). Following the sudden death of Joy's grandmother, Rudy and Trudy send Peggy to conduct Joy's company business in California, Peggy tells Joy she paid the manufacturer excessively raised production fees, Joy is angry and meets the manufacturer in California, they refuse to pay her back, they are also fraudulently about to patent her design. Joy lawyer explains that nothing can be done to stop this, forcing her to claim bankruptcy, she discovers the manufacturer defrauded her the entire time she dealt with them, so she confronts the owner and forces him to pay her back. A few years later Joy is wealthy and runs a successful business, she continues to look after her father, he and Peggy unsuccessfully tried to sue her for company ownership, Terry has found stability through her relationship with Toussaint and is the own family member not living off Joy, Jackie and Tony are still her most valuable advisers, the film ends with Joy helping a young mother pitching her new invention. Also starring Melissa Rivers (Joan's daughter) as Joan Rivers, Donna Mills as Priscilla, Susan Lucci as Danica, Maurice Benard as Ridge, Laura Wright as Clarinda, Alexander Cook as Bartholomew and Drena De Niro (Robert's adoptive daughter) as Cindy. Lawrence does give a performance worthy of award nominations being at first undervalued, then the gutsy and determined entrepreneur, there is terrific support from De Niro, Cooper and Rossellini, I heard critics saying that this film is a mixed bag, I certainly got the feeling that I did not know where it was going, it works well with the rags (normal life) to riches element, it is a funny and inspirational true story, an inventive biographical comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that provides its namesake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is a biopic about a woman who against all odds, starts her own business empire. Joy(Jennifer Lawrence), is an overworked mother of two children. Joy is the most resourceful person in her house. She also has to take care of her father Rudy(Robert De Niro), Tony(Edgar Ramirez), grandmother Mimi(Diane Ladd) &amp; mother Terry(Virginia Madsen) apart from her two kids, Cristy(Aundrea &amp; Gea Gadsby) &amp; Tommy(Tomas &amp; Zeke Elizondo). Joy realizes that, the creative spark that she had during her childhood, is no longer there. One day, she comes up with an invention that could potentially be, a huge success. However, this invention could also be a disaster. Joy goes about bringing this invention to life. Her family supports her but, continue to second-guess her. Joy is a fantastic film! The situations shown in this movie are very relatable. Joy's family is an average middle class family in America. The mundane, everyday activities that this family partakes in, have been realistically portrayed. This film is basically a story of how a person should never give up on their dreams, no matter what the odds are. This uplifting tale is even more fascinating because, it's a true story. Director David O. Russell has helmed another must see film after, Silver Linings Playbook(2012) &amp; American Hustle(2013). The performances are the highlight of the film. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show as Joy. Lawrence portrays the various emotions that her character goes through, with ease &amp; aplomb. Jennifer Lawrence truly is, one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Robert De Niro is outstanding as Rudy. Bradley Cooper is brilliant as Neil Walker. Edgar Ramirez is spectacular as Tony. Diane Ladd is amazing as Mimi. Virginia Madsen is superb as Terry. Isabella Rosselini is great as Trudy. Dascha Polanco is awesome as Jackie. Elisabeth Rohm is mind blowing as Peggy. Jimmy Jean-Louis is good as Toussaint. Aundrea Gadsby &amp; Gia Gadsby are adorable as Joy's 5 year old daughter, Cristy. The supporting characters are impressive, also. Joy is a joyous film. Go for it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joy isn't a movie for everyone, for it is one of those movies that aren't really action-packed. It's simply a blend of a very simple and inspiring story and an amazing cast that draws you in all the way. JLaw did an amazing job, she never fails to deliver any kind of story, and her chemistry with Bradly (already used to it) and Robert was really joyous to watch. I personally enjoyed every detail in the movie. The story was really nice and inspiring, in the fact that it isn't that extraordinary, it's rather simple and anyone can do it, if one is driven by the passion and strength that Joy has.So really Joy left me Joyful, and made my day.

		<fullReview>I'm not entirely sure what many of these people thought they were going to see. If you walked into the theatre blind; then I understand why your expectations for another Jennifer Lawrence movie were cut short as this movie is not the Hunger Games or American Hustle.This is a movie about the creator of a mop. This is the story of an overworked woman with a simple idea: a self-wringing mop. It is about how she dealt with being surrounded by people who were completely dependant on her, but who enormously underestimated her and tried to get her to give up at every turn. I also reject the idea that every character other than the protagonist was unsympathetic. Cooper's character, the grandma, the daughter and even the ex- husband were decently sympathetic. I did not have a hard time following the timeline. I was completely captivated by the story, and found myself having goosebumps in the more tense moments when Joy overcomes another obstacle. This is not The Wolf of Wall Street. Please don't expect anything like that. This movie does not try to be epic, and this movie is not trying to force-feed the audience an extreme feminist message. It is simple, and it is inspiring.I will be honest; I'm a 22 year old woman who has just started my career. I had a vested interest in this movie and was expecting to love it. It met all of my expectations, and I encourage anyone who is starting their career to see it. I would encourage anyone to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tenacity is within Jennifer Lawrence's character undoubtedly. When life does not bring you happiness, all your family is kind of inept and you truly believe you are not one of them, there is Joy, our brilliant fighter. With a huge weight on her back, divorced, with a daughter and just made redundant from work, she needs to do something because she is not a conformist. In pursuance of joyfulness, good luck and bad luck are with her. But she never gives up. Despite never seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, she moves on and on until climbing up the whole pyramid. A pyramid hard to climb but worthy ascending it. There is no lift to success and because of that Joy had to take the stairs. Along her journey, she interacts with the unfair and corrupt society learning the essential keys that will allocate her in a peaceful serenity. Being constantly at the cliff's edge and with nothing to lose, our brave lady makes her "all in" once acquired the necessary knowledge of it. Well-deserved end for our "mop-inventor" who can now seat on the master chair, knowing all the hard-won way it took her to have a untroubled sit on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Be honest I don't think this films plot is 8 stars worthy. It's a pretty decent movie. The reason I chose to rate it 8 is because of J-Law, she's really what this movie is all about and she deserves another Oscar for her role in this one - I really loved her acting!! Joy is maybe the sweetest, kindest and most caring person I have ever seen in any other movie and it's almost impossible not to fall in love with her. The story in this movie is really about friends and family, how they stick together despite of all their difference's and betrayal. It is a very warm and heartfelt movie and it brings comfort on a cold winter day. That's why I think this movie deserves 8 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put-upon housewife and mother Joy tries to be everything to everyone ? her eccentric mother, kids, grandmother, ex-husband, father, sister ? and finds a possible exit route when she invents a self-squeezing mop. But this may just cause more problems than it solves.Based loosely on a real life situation, this domestic drama marks a third collaboration between writer/director David O. Rusell, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper (although Cooper's part is little more than a cameo) and the second involving Robert De Niro. It is a relatively slight piece, where Joy is the everywoman we root for while she is fighting the demands of her odd family and the complications brought about by trying to market and manufacture her invention. I never thought I would be that interested in the fortunes of a mop, but there were times when I definitely cared, and this is due entirely to another terrific performance from Jennifer Larence which, to be frank, is far better than the film merits. The other cast members aren't in the same class, although the fact that they are mostly playing fairly unsympathetic characters doesn't help them.I enjoyed the film and it held my attention throughout although, as well as the slightness, it sometimes tries to be a bit too clever for its own good (there are soap opera inserts throughout which fail to make the point they were intended to make, whatever it was), and throws away its satisfying resolution to Joy's jeopardy almost half-heartedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wife's choice, but I was down with it. Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games, Silver Linings Playbook) as an entrepreneurial struggling mother, with Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper in support among others. That'll do.The start's full of promise. The opening 10 minutes do not mess about: you meet almost all characters of note, get a good feel for the situation and best of all it's just charming. Fun.Unfortunately, Joy lost me before its finale.I'd compare it to a tag-team match at the wrestling. They've all got the same premise: one of the good guys gets stranded in the ring, struggling for a while before he finally manages to tag in the stronger good guy for the happy ending.Unfortunately, Jennifer Lawrence as Joy took one too many hits before we reached a happy ending. I'd stopped caring. My wife put some laundry away.It's not J-Law's fault, it's just a top-heavy film. Where you look at the likes of Ali or even Forrest Gump (I know, they're lame comparisons, but bear with me), the chronology is nice and spread. With Joy, there are too many slow portions that take up time the finale sorely needed.The truth is you just aren't drawn in effectively enough. De Niro is surprisingly underused as Joy's father, he could've really added some depth here. Without wishing to compare to director David O. Russell's previous work, this piece is sorely missing the frequent smiles induced by Silver Linings Playbook.A lot of the relationships aren't believable either, critical for a biopic. Take Lawrence's titular character and Bradley Cooper's Neil. They err from friends to enemies to friends again too quickly: you don't have enough time to empathize, enough time to feel anything, before the scenario switches. He appears in a closing scene, the dialogue so forced it's cringe-worthy.The ending feels rushed too. Avoiding spoilers, the film develops towards a conclusion where Joy outfoxes some Texan businessmen. In between consecutive scenes, Joy goes from naive and fragile to a bona fide business bad-ass. It's missing that growth; which would've reinforced the meaning of this film.There are things to like though. A collections of scenes mid-film, where Joy is introduced to television shopping networks are particularly fun. There's enough about Joy, and particularly Lawrence's performance, to justify the admission fee. The movie begins with a dedication to the brave women (especially one) that inspired the film.I don't like knocking anyone, particularly those big enough to take on a film like this, but inspiration is perhaps the one thing truly missing. I'm sorry to say that it has been replaced by apathy. I would still recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle As A Loudspeaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is one of those movies that makes you scratch your head. On the one hand it is done by talented people and you can see the bones of a good story. But it is basically like a first draft that somebody decided to shoot anyway.For one thing the film has zero subtlety about its themes and metaphors. Zero! It feels like the director is screaming at you with a loudspeaker. And if it still went over your head then don't worry because the movie is so over narrated it feels like the film's makers believe their audience to be morons. That and the fact that this film sacrifices being a compelling tale in favour of being a hagiography of the Strong Independent Business Woman.And yet I couldn't dislike this film, despite its many flaws. What little story there is engaging and Jennifer Lawrence does her best to humanize the character of Joy. All the other characters remain on the level or cardboard stereotypes but Lawrence adds a likability to Joy that carries this film.I think that in the end it will be a subjective matter whether you like this film or if it strikes a chord with you. But even then Joy can at best be described as mediocre.</fullReview>

She also had a few other inventions but the mop is the one that got her started. Jennifer plays Joy. She grew up in Long Island and her family were the perfect definition of a dysfunctional family. Jennifer lives with her grandmother, her mother, Virginia and her ex husband, Edgar. Jennifer and Edgar have the perfect divorce; they get along better as friends than they did when they were married. Her father, Robert is having problems with his girlfriend and decides to move in, too. Robert and Virginia do not get along at all and they have verbal fights a lot. Virginia lies around watching soap operas all day; they do use some real soap opera stars in cameos. I know of Laura Wright and Susan Lucci and I'm sure there were others that I did not know. Jennifer's always trying to come up with an invention that will get her out of her dreadful life and the movie tells about her difficulties in reaching her goals, including developing an actual workable product, getting it produced in mass quantities and then getting it out to the public on cable channels, such as QVC and HSN. Bradley plays an ad executive that gives Jennifer her first TV break. It does have some good actors in it but it is a little uneven between being a comedy and being a drama; it is a little bit of both but not enough of either. It's rated "PG-13" for some language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 4 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are interested in the subject matter, it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge David O. Russell fan. The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle really helped get me into movies. So, when the trailer for Joy came out, I was stoked to see what could be another impressive credit on Russell's already stacked resume. Yes, Jennifer Lawrence's performance seemed to be teetering a bit overboard, but I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt to one of the best young performers out there today. I was right. Jennifer Lawrence kicks ass in this movie - but not like her bow-and-arrow wielding counterpart that made her famous in The Hunger Games franchise. Instead, throughout Joy, she makes a gradual, Breaking Bad-esque transition into a take-no-prisoners, ball-busting entrepreneur from an airport stewardess. The performances, throughout this film and David O. Russell's other credits, are of course, stellar. I'll be shocked if Lawrence, at least, doesn't receive an Oscar nomination, but don't count out De Niro, either. In the first act, Joy is somewhat pretentious, going for an ethereal take at first, but that angle gradually peters out with a certain plot twist. All in all, I'd say Joy is a bit of a dark horse in this years Oscar race, as the reviews haven't exactly been glowing, but it's certainly worth the time of anyone who's looking for some inspiration.</fullReview>

Interesting when the movie includes a 70s dramatic film, adding some strange yet acceptable cinematic inspiration.

		<fullReview>Now this is not my favorite movie of all time or even of this year, not even this month, but I thought it was OK. I have seen a lot of negative comments about this movie and I will explain why I like this but I would also like to know why others did not.First off I want to say that Jennifer Lawrence did a very nice job in this movie. She was my favorite part of the whole thing and she stole the show in my opinion. This was also a bad thing though because I felt like it was Lawrence playing as Joy with a bunch of other actors. De Niro, Cooper, and Röhm were characters that I thought did very well but they did not get a lot of screen time. I would have liked to see more of them in this movie instead of just Lawrence.Bradley Cooper also did a very good job, as I said above, and this is one of the reasons why I gave this movie a 7. Cooper, in my opinion, could have stolen the show from Lawrence. He captured the role so well and the first time you meet him, you are amazed, but that's it. It is not like you do not see him again but he rarely gets screen time after that. All in all, I did not think this movie was that bad. It wasn't great but at the same time it was not terrible. I understand that a lot of people did not like how cluttered the movie felt, but I did not feel that way. There could have been better direction but the entire movie was not terrible because of that.My advice: I would suggest going to see it if you do not have anything else to do. It is a movie that will keep you entertained but you won't walk out of the theater thrilled about seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I'll be in trouble for liking this film, directed by David O. Russell and starring Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert de Niro, Virginia Madsen, Elizabeth Rohm, Diane Ladd, and Isabella Rossellini.I wanted to see this film for several reasons. First, I liked American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook, with the same star actors and directed by Russell.Secondly, we have Joy's Huggable Hangers, and I have a friend who owns all of her products.Third, I run a website for the soap opera General Hospital, and three of the actors are in the film...playing soap actors.This is her story, and to me anyway, it's an impressive one. When the story opens, she's a divorced mother of two with her ex-husband living in the basement, and she works for an airline. Her mother stays in her room all day watching soap operas, a father who has just moved in with her, and she has a grandmother who thinks Joy is going to achieve great things.It's the story of somebody coming from nothing and creating great success, the underdog who gets the American dream against all odds.Jennifer Lawrence is such a likable and pretty actress, it's no wonder she constantly captivates her audience. She rings true as a harried mother in a house that's falling around her and a father that loses his temper and breaks things. When Joy faces defeat, you really feel for her. Right now, she's the ingénue of the month, as once Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts, Gwenyth Paltrow, Rene Zwelleger, Anne Hathaway, etc. - in everything. The question is, can she grow into leading lady roles? I think so. We won't see her as much as we will be seeing Bradley Cooper, he being a man, but she'll be around.Bradley Cooper is another one, one of the most likable actors ever. His character runs his business with a velvet glove rather than an iron fist - he's not a screaming bombastic man, but he knows what he wants and demands it.The rest of the cast all turned in fine performances, with Isabella Rossellini as her father Pat's (de Niro's) girlfriend.Entertaining and also inspiring, this is a sweet film with no CGI, no nudity, and no profanity. No wonder people hate it.This isn't Citizen Kane, it isn't Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It's a simple, sometimes sentimental story of a woman who never gave up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A OK film with a brilliant performance by jennifer lawrence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is an uneven biopic that never seems to pick up pace but is greatly benefited by an outstanding performance from Jennifer Lawrence.Joy is a biopic about joy mangano, A woman who rises to power when she creates the miracle mop and builds an empire.The film itself seems to have an uneven tone with a lot of pace problems and the direction and writing by David o'russell seems to lack sometimes, The cast that includes Robert Deniro, Bradley Cooper, Virginia Madsen and Isabella Rosanelli do a stellar job but Jennifer Lawrence really proves once again why she is one of the best young actresses working today as she immerses herself into the role of joy mangano and I would not be surprised if she won her second Oscar for this role.Overall joy is an OK film that lags in parts but is ultimately saved by Lawrence's performance. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that truly reveals Jennifer Lawrence's unique talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is the true story of Joy Mangano, a self-made millionaire who created her own business empire selling patented products like revolutionary mops through telemarketing. Despite how cheesy and uninteresting that sounds this is an excellent movie. First of all I never really liked most of David O. Russell's films (like Silver Linings Playbook-2012 and American Hustle-2013) but this one truly reveals Jennifer Lawrence's unique talent. She shouldn't have been nominated for Oscar for American Hustle and she shouldn't have won it for her performance in Silver Linings Playbook but in this one her undoubted talent unfolds to such an extent that I now consider her the best actress along with Charlize Theron. We can definitely say she's the next big thing in Hollywood. The story is really interesting and the film never gets tiring despite it's duration (124 mins). Not only that but it's really emotionally moving. In a nutshell you can say that it's an American dream story built through constant difficulties, a modern Cinderella story with a strong anti racist vision. All classes and races may come together and succeed if there is enough talent, confidence and persistence, that's the point of the film. Robert De Niro tries to copy himself in Meet the Fockers and Bradley Cooper is good but nothing special, like in all his movies. After all there is no reason for them to try to challenge the imposing star of Jennifer Lawrence, who really brings "Joy" to her character. Needless to say the film got nominated for two Golden Globes, Best musical/comedy and best performance by an actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engineering &amp; Product Development Dramatized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to point out any particular plot points, but some of the details I write may be considered a spoiler by some, so I checked that box to be cautious.I am an electrical design engineer by profession. I design new products for a living. These are not consumer-type products, but rather, electronic instruments sold to researchers, universities, and corporations. What was dramatized in parts of this film reflects everyday tasks for me. For example, having a supplier steal an idea as happened in this film (here's the spoiler) happens very rarely, if ever. Our suppliers sign a "Non Disclosure Agreement" with us (NDA). In my case, I specify electronic components, so I have a whole list of parts and suppliers. Our company does order custom components from other companies. Usually, there is a set price - we order, our vendor delivers, and we pay them. When we want more, we order more. Plain and simple.What is dramatized in this film is a supplier behaving unethically. Like I said, this is rare. We do, however, deal with patent trolls - people who see what we are developing, and then claim we stole their patent. That does not happen often, but it can make an impact on our company.The one major concern, however, is being able to sell an item for a profit that we manufacture. Because of the market we sell to, we can price things accordingly, and our equipment is made in the USA. Consumer products, however, have a much lower profit margin - they tend to be made offshore because of this, and a reasonable profit margin can be realized.I have to admire the tenacity of the protagonist of this film, and if I were hiring a project manager, she is exactly the kind of person I would want to hire. (I have a soft spot in my heart for single mothers anyway - I have worked with a number of single mothers who were either divorced or never married, and every one of them, without fail, has been a great worker. They need more flexibility, but they pay you back many times over with their productivity and high quality work.)I enjoyed this film very much. Also, as a church organist (I have a master's degree in organ performance), I heard high quality organ and choral music on the soundtrack, and the producer is to be complimented for selecting and using excellent music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read through some of the reviews of this movie, and I just don't understand the hate for it. Maybe having grown up with very strong willed women, this is an inspiring movie of everyday struggle. Is it world saving? No. Is it effect humanity? No. But there is something to be said about a woman who has put her life on hold through bad decisions to add a second act to it that inspires real chutzpah. Too bad the ones who watch it and didn't care for it, most likely had dreams die on the vine and are okay with it. Yes, you armchair critics who spend more clever quips attempting to be witty online then try to be something. That's what Joy Mangano did. Those who dilute her accomplishments are precisely the same that underestimated her in life. She seems to have no patience for those people. Instead, it seems she is more interested in go-getters that remind her that America does value dreams. If that meant survival against a behemoth of capitalism in...say, home shopping, so be it. It's not glamorous, but it's hers. And that's where I value the story. Too bad the negative reviews miss this aspect. Which seems to be indicative of how far America has fallen. It seems those who dislike its fabled quality, have the truest sickest cynicism towards the America I grew up with. Too bad. Jennifer Lawrence is sweet, funny and endearing, and when the world bends for her...as Joy, it truly meant something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy is a disappointing reunion, one that ends O. Russell's winning streak of good to great films over the past ten years or more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even after rewriting Annie Mumolo's script, O. Russell's reach hasn't extended further than a standard archetype or clenched a unique narrative line. His choices are curious given he has rarely made the same film twice and admirably cast star power while refusing to lull on what previously succeeded for the director. Disappointingly, Joy's story arc and themes of individualism and self-determination are curiously blasé and insubstantial, rarely trudging deeper than seeing a younger woman overcome life's burdens through her personal inspiration and self- belief that allows her to stand on her own feet. The narrative is made derivative by predictable obstacles to its goals of confidence, female empowerment and dedication to women, by dodgy business partners, financial problems and moments of self-loathing. The film doesn't achieve the director's usual balance of high drama and hilarious comedy because the laughs grow scarce when confronted by the film's sluggish duration, outstaying its welcome until it shifts from quietly humorous to tedious before the end. Sentimental gimmicks like Joy talking to her inner child and the narration of her grandmother (Diane Ladd) are no aid to the flat pacing. The early scenes show glimpses of the manic energy of O. Russell's recent films, with rants between the characters simmering close to the boil but merely teasing the perpetual madness we crave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nicely orchestrated, subtle story of female empowerment through realism and human interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't until about a week ago that I realized that I'd be seeing David O. Russell's "Joy" on Christmas Day and was simultaneously struggling to make heads or tails of the film's plot. The film's trailer seemed like a very low-key picture about a single mother's redemption via self-realization and determination. It wasn't until the first hour of the film did I realize this film was a biopic on Joy Mangano, the self-made millionaire who found overnight success on QVC selling the Magic Mop and other household appliances that made for convenience or ease of use.Perhaps it's because of the general perception of biopics in American cinema being clichéd or far too common or the desire to make Mangano a more general character rather than a pop culture figure, but for whatever reason, the marketing team behind David O. Russell's latest film owe Mangano some kind of an apology. Not only was the promotion for this film so vague that it obscured her story to audiences, who may have even wanted to see the film, it also undermined what is otherwise a strong story about the cyclical patterns of being an entrepreneur in modern-day American and what it means to aspire to be more than a woman being forced into domesticity by restrictive parents.As stated, the film follows Joy Mangano, played by Jennifer Lawrence, who is living every woman's worst nightmare - a single mother feeling anchored by her two young children, living in a house with her separated mother and father, in addition to her ex-husband and grandmother. Throughout her entire life, all Joy has tried to do is make her modest life work to the best possible degree, but she continues to get bogged down by poor circumstance no matter which way she chooses to go.Her mother always taught her that she'd go to school and meet a fine young boy, have a few kids, and spend the remaining days of her life attending to a mid-sized home in addition to a few youngsters while her husband served as the breadwinner. Her father placed larger expectations upon her, despite quietly thinking that she couldn't bear such stress of maintaining a job and making a success out of herself. Most of this kind of external, outspoken negative and restrictive energy would have most women screaming about their own independence and their rightful freewill, but Joy just bottled it all up, saving it for a rainy day.The aforementioned storm comes when Joy decides to capitalize off of an idea she had in her mind for a one-of-a-kind mop: it's a mop with a head that would be able to absorb the contents of a large room, be rung out without touching the mop-head itself, and have the same mop-head be detachable for washer/dryer use. The idea just seems crazy and logical enough to work, which leads Joy to creating prototypes for such an invention and attempting to sell them at K-Mart to no avail. With that, Joy is lucky enough to find Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper), an executive at the QVC network who helps give Joy the necessary publicity and exposure to make her invention a hit and propel her to overnight stardom."Joy" isn't your average story of rags-to-riches stardom, largely because the rags don't turn into longterm, or even momentary, riches. Every time Joy seems to get ahead, be it by achieving hundreds of thousands of sales of her mops on QVC or earning enough money to get out of debt, a new and uglier problem raises its head, be it the theft of her patent or her profits in some way. Joy makes multiple deals with the devil in terms of leaving herself vulnerable and helpless if things don't work out exactly the way she needs them to, including taking out a second mortgage against her home and borrowing copious amounts of money from her father's girlfriend all in the name of giving her daughters a better life.The biggest setback with "Joy," other than the lack of confidence in its story judging by the film's approach and the fact that it undercuts Mangano's namesake and significance for so long, like it's ashamed it exists to tell her story, is the disjointed direction. For the first hour, Russell conducts this film like a soap opera, undoubtedly juxtaposing the film with the ridiculous soap opera Joy's mother watches on a regular basis, by introducing numerous characters and numerous dramatic situations. Halfway through the film, Russell abandons this style to focus on Joy's rise to fame and the multiple setbacks she faces in a cynical world that ostensibly doesn't want her to succeed. Such dichotomous approaches would've worked well if they had served as the thesis for the two-hour film, but with this approach, the film comes off as woefully disconnected and miscommunicated.With all that in mind, "Joy" is well worth seeing because of the way it handles its titular character in a way that shows her as a victim to reality and a lack of true moral support, despite her own muted, personal desire to succeed in a hungry world. The idea of an underdog trying to succeed and take their bite out of a world where everyone is hungry for their own piece isn't new; Russell's decision to focus on a real-life figure clawing her way to the top whilst getting spat in the face no matter what she does and tying it together in a way that emphasizes female empowerment in a way that doesn't feel like a motivational poster is, in fact, new. The only thing you, the viewer, is asked to do is forgive a few narrative setbacks and mixed delivery. As always, this cluttered Christmas Day weekend, the choice is yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what was expected - much better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very entertaining and I liked it. It would have been a much better picture and would have had a bigger audience if they dropped off the two occurrences of profanity. After the first few minutes I thought "OK, here's another holiday film about a dysfunctional family. It was not that kind of movie, and the weirdness of the family members was just building up what Joy has been having to deal with all her life. While the themes "rags to riches" and "hard work only leads to being beat up by the big guys" has been done before, this story has lots of details of the main characters, who are uniquely colorful and entertaining. I read a few of the other reviews, and I think most of the negative reviews were written from a perspective of just trying to impress the readers of the writer's 'brilliance' in perception. The pace was right on, and I never took my eyes off the screen. Most movies are predictable, and that can be boring. However, this movie was NOT predictable and had many pleasant surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening day, my disappointment began when I watched Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robert De Niro for 2 hours, not the characters they portrayed. I never saw Joy or Neil.The story, while dramatic, did not seem to do justice to "Joy", the inspiration for the film. The film covered a narrow time frame reflecting the dramatic tension of her life at the time. The dramatic tension was well portrayed by the actors. I wanted more from the end of the film, the time jump supported by narrative did not deliver. The cinematography is compelling, with creative shots and effective close-ups. Another disappointment was Jennifer's hair, make-up and costuming which reflected modern 2015, not 1992. I appreciated the depth of the supportive actors, including Virginia Madsen, Diane Ladd, Isabella Rossellini, along with the recognizable SOAP actors.I welcome creative license to improve compelling elements of a story to create interest, in this film, the writers and director had the opportunity to make better selections.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was okay or what I would call "underwhelming". The first half of the film dragged out a bit and could have been condensed without losing any important information. The last half to a third of the film was glossed over missing out on details of how she moved on and became so successful. The storyline development was really lacking on the last part of the film. The first half is slow and somewhat overly detailed with monotonous information. At times it was repetitive and I wanted to "fast-forward" to move it along. We finally get to the point of the story where she takes control and then the story ending seems abrupt. Using a narrative to recap how she became successful was a disappointing way of bringing the story to a close. Could have been better. I left the theater not fully understanding what Joy's full success really was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie written and directed by David O Russell and starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper - a trio involved in the wonderful "Silver Linings Playbook" and "American Hustle" - is one to excite any cinema-goer and, as the cast list also includes such veteran actors as Robert De Niro and Isabella Rossellini, expectations were understandably high. But sadly the film is a disappointment and only the ever- watchable Lawrence in the central role elevates it above an even-worse assessment.The title refers not to an emotion but to a person, the American entrepreneur Joy Mangano. and the movie is a worthy attempt to show how women can be empowered and inventive if they pursue their dreams with passion and support. Perhaps any film about the design of a mop - even a so-called Miracle Mop that sold in huge numbers on the television channel QVC - was going to struggle to seize the emotions (after all, we are not talking about "The Social Network" and the creation of Facebook here). But the work suffers from an odd structure - there are early flashbacks and the voice-over is from someone who dies - and a weak script. So, really not much joy at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After scoring a hat-trick, Director David O. Russell stumps over his latest biopic, 'Joy'. This biographical comedy-drama on a woman's struggle, only to become a millionaire, has fine performances, but dull writing &amp; uneven pacing, spoil the fun!'Joy' is the story of the title character (Played by Jennifer Lawrence), who rose to become founder and matriarch of a powerful family business dynasty.'Joy' is a joyless experience. You can't connect to its protagonist or any other character here. Reason? The dull writing. David O. Russell's Screenplay is surprisingly motionless, offering close to no highs in the goings-on. You watch the story unfold, but all you get is an unsatisfying narrative. David O. Russell's Direction, also, lacks the bite. In short, The Writer-Director fails to deliver this time.'Joy' is saved &amp; remains watchable due to its fine cast, who manage to deliver. Jennifer Lawrence is sincere in her portrayal of Joy, giving her character some power, despite it being under-written. De Niro is fabulously unlikable as Joy's father, while Bradley Cooper is fantastic as the man who helps Joy's ambition. Virginia Madsen as Joy's mother, however, hams to the hilt. On the whole, 'Joy' needed a much stronger punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Stars Donot Read their Screenplays and DO NOT Deserve Oscars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is for David Russell to read and the studios who provide million of dollars to produce a film which is not worthy of any award and not worthy of even producing. We do not get the sense of real story but forced into stylistic directing and a big mess made with million of dollars spent for nothing. I could get that there was lot of comedy in the screenplay but the director did not know how to direct the scenes so that when people watch it ,they could laugh.Story: The film started out with the grandma telling the story. I was forced to look at the story from grandmother's point of view which was not really a big part of the film. Grandma had no role in who Joy was and her journey.It was a character which David thought would save the film in editing, but it did not. People are way smarter than you think. It seems like millions of dollars were spent to work days and days to shoot this film with director not really interested in the screenplay itself and after shooting the film, realizes that how he is going to create a film out of this big mess which he shot.Robert DeNiro: Robert is a good actor but I could see that he did not read the whole screenplay. Whenever you see him in the scene he is in, I could feel that he has no sense of his own character development in the story. All of his scenes had no cohesion. His acting in one scene is way off than his next scene. He is a divorced man who still lives in a basement of her daughter but he has not learned his lesson. I get that, what writer wanted to say, but the way character was portrayed was not believable. If DeNiro had read his full screenplay, then he could understand this character before playing it. It was Russell's job to make him read his screenplay. Him dating this new woman and every scene she was in made no sense.Bradley Cooper: OMG. I had some hopes for this guy after watching "American Sniper". But again he did not read the whole screenplay. He was totally out of character. His total focus was to play the role as seducer to Jennifer Lawrence. In his first scene when I saw him , I could see it in his eyes that he is just playing with Jennifer Lawrence on set without really caring about his character. Audience is not stupid. We can see what actor is doing on screen.If he has done his homework or not and if he is just seducing other women on set. Seems like David just brought you on set for few days and shot some of your scenes without really making you understand where this character is coming from.Jennifer Lawrence: Okay Jennifer! you are a good actress but you better choose and think carefully who you want to work with. Don't just accept roles because you worked with someone else before and they sent you a new screenplay. Film industry is brutal and if you do not pick your films wisely, you will be forgotten easily. I thought you were the only one in the film who understood the struggles of this woman Joy and you were true to the character. But how much can you do when other stars have not done their homework. You cannot make a good film by yourself. So you don't get an Oscar either because you pick wrong movies to work in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joy is directed by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle) and stars Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, and Bradley Cooper. It's the true story of a girl who had a pretty rough life. Nothing had ever worked out for her, even on the day she dropped and broke a glass of wine on a priceless boat deck. As she's mopping up the mess, when she rings the mop out, she cuts her hands on the glass. She is then struck by the idea to create a self wringing mop, and this is the story of how she does so. To start, Jennifer Lawrence, as always, does amazing in her role. She's done great in every role she's been in, from Katniss Everdeen to Mystique. Another good role in this movie is Joy's father, played by Robert De Niro. Anyone who has ever seen a movie with De Niro in it, you know he's great. He is considered one of the best actors of all time. So, of course, he does great in the film as well. He was actually the funniest character in the whole movie. The last good casting choice is Bradley Cooper. Bradley Cooper is the next big thing nowadays. He's done good in films such as American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook (also with Jennifer Lawrence), and American Sniper. He also does good in this movie, given his character is pretty bland and boring.Now, the plot does sound far-fetched, and it is. But, it works out well. The film has funny dialogue, and good plot progression. There is one scene towards the middle in which Jennifer Lawrence gives some amazing lines, and does an amazing job with her character. However, there are some parts where the movie doesn't work, such as the ending (no spoilers), but it works out relatively well for the rest of the plot. The biggest problem in the whole film is the characters. Although De Niro and Cooper do well in their roles, I never cared about their characters. I only cared about Joy's character throughout the whole movie, and that's not something you should want for your audience. I wanted to care about their characters, yeah, but I just didn't. If the characters would've been more rounded, or interesting, than this movie would be receiving a lot of better reviews from anyone and everyone. So, despite its rough ending, and stale characters, I still thought Joy was a pretty decent movie. I would give Joy a B, or a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy has many positive elements: a strong female main character who doesn't give up before the blows of fate; excellent performances from the whole cast; and David O. Russell's perfect direction, displaying enough style in order to bring the film an attractive visual and narrative identity while not losing any spontaneity. So, why does the movie feel so insipid and superficial? I think the answer is: mops. In other words, the central subject of Joy lacks of the necessary weight or gravity to capture us into the drama. At least, that was my impression; I enjoyed Joy more due to its individual parts than due to the whole experience. Nevertheless, as I previously mentioned, Joy has various pros, such as the brilliant performances from the whole cast, starting by Jennifer Lawrence, who feels absolutely credible in her role while displaying an overwhelming presence; what is more, she's perfectly complemented by Robert De Niro, Diane Ladd, Isabella Rossellini and Bradley Cooper. Another positive element from Joy is the well balanced soundtrack, which complements the tone of the scenes while reminding us of the nostalgic '90s provenance of the tale, but without abusing of excessively famous songs which would take us out of the movie. As I said on the beginning of this review: Joy is a film full of pros which, despite that, never reaches the critical point of emotion in order for us to feel involved in the story. Nevertheless, I think Joy deserves a moderate recommendation because it's entertaining despite its superficiality and it illustrates us about an ignored (maybe rightfully so) chapter of popular culture. Besides, I don't doubt the fact that there exist fetishists of mops who have finally found their Holy Grail. I don't judge them, but I don't share their enthusiasm either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies with a great purpose, but bad screenplay, despite it came from a good idea (I think thanks to Annie Mumolo this time). David O. Russell has not done a good job with the first part of the film where the action is slow, even boring. During the first 30min I was already worried I may fall asleep. It seems Russell has put all of his energy and focus in JLaw's character, even though this is not necessarily a bad thing, since it's the hole point of the film. Jennifer did a great job playing the role, which brings me to Joy - a divorced woman, mother, struggling with life, all by herself, but with big dreams and the ambition to achieve them. We see that kind of women everyday and I have to admit that I saw a lot of me in Joy and I am a man...even further, I was trilled to watch how determined she is and resolved all the problems she was facing. Have to say that Bradly seemed distracted, it felt like he doesn't appreciate the role! He played without energy, without any passion. And he is probably right, this character should not be played by an actor of his rank!! I was annoyed too, but that's what happens when you consider a role without reading the script first.Got to say, the soundtracks were very powerful!! Put you in the right mood...I could conclude I enjoyed the film despite the big flaws in the screenplay. I understand why so many people think isn't worth it. It's just not for everybody. Definitely will watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward movie - and with all the pre-release hype - I thought I would 100% like it. Well not so. the character development of her family left them as looking like squatters in her home (I think it was her home) - the mother, father, ex-husband. To me they had little redeeming characteristics, and with the strength of Joy - I got frustrated with her keeping them there. She was used by all of them. Possibly this is a New Jersey thing - but it bugged me. Joy had a great idea - got in over her head initially and learned so much as she grew as a business woman. The movie, in the beginning states that this is for women who are -- I forget - those who are trying to make a go of it?? So this is an OK movie - not great - and if you really want to see it - Redbox it. My only disappointment in Dec. was this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The road to success is rarely smooth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by real events, this David O. Russell motion picture tells of the struggle of a divorced single mother to make it as an entrepreneur while juggling woes with her immediate and extended family. Released with an enigmatic trailer and initial promotional posters that were just white writing against black, it seems that Russell intended the film to be seen with minimal expectations and there are admittedly some surprises in how the plot unfolds. Everything begins on a quirky note as we are introduced to Joy and her unusual living arrangements. Her reclusive mother refuses to leave her bed, lest she miss a soap opera episode. She is divorced from Joy's father, who has begun to share the basement with her own ex-husband, while her grandmother takes care of their kids upstairs! There are some even zanier moments to come as Joy dreams of herself starring in one of her mother's shoddy soap operas and attending a surreal funeral. The film nevertheless fails to maintain this offbeat tone throughout as Joy becomes set on selling her invention, no matter the cost, and while Jennifer Lawrence has several fine dramatic moments as she struggles to overcome the odds, the film soon becomes yet another tale of an underdog rising against the odds, only really distinguishable on account of the solid performances. And yet while it lacks the spark that made Russell's previous two Golden Globe winning comedies so remarkable, the film is often engaging to view and watchable to the end. Particularly interesting is all the gun symbolism and a decision Joy makes this towards the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is a 2015 American semi-biographical drama film, written and directed by David O. Russell and starring Jennifer Lawrence as Joy (loosely based on Joy Mangano), a self- made millionaire who created her own business empire.Mangano was a divorced mother with three children in the early 1990s when she invented the Miracle Mop and became an overnight success, after which she patented many other products, often selling on the Home Shopping Network and QVC. The film is a semi- fictional and inspirational portrayal of how Mangano overcame personal and professional obstacles to rise to the top.Joy received a wide theatrical release on December 25, 2015, and is distributed by 20th Century Fox. It earned mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lawrence's performance but criticized the writing and pace of the film, particularly the first half. Joy received two Golden Globe Award nominations including Best Motion Picture ? Musical or Comedy and a win for Lawrence for Best Actress ? Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Lawrence also received a nomination for Best Actress at the 88th Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of what you feel about Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle, or The Fighter, you have to applaud David O. Russell's auteurism. He really knows how to put his stamp on a film. Much like Woody Allen or Quentin Tarantino, there's something to be said of a filmmaker who does it his own way no matter what.Joy is an uplifting tale of the lady who invented the Miracle Mop. It's about the true struggle of the American dream. Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy, a single mother from a dysfunctional family. But that family of hers all lives under her roof. This includes her ex-husband, her divorced parents, her two children, and her grandmother. Joy has a lot of ideas, but doesn't live in a world where doing anything about them makes any sense. Nobody around her is successful. Even though setting is never really established (we never get the year or location), we can tell that it's a town where everyone just lives to survive. Until one day, when Joy's father starts dating a rich widow, who's acquiescently convinced to fund one of Joy's inventions.The first act of this film is spent establishing the craziness of Joy's life. She doesn't truly present her product until about 45 minutes in. Before that, we spend time trying to get accustomed to the oddness of this movie, with Russell perhaps borrowing, in a way, from Wes Anderson, taking pages right out of his book.Then the film really starts getting good when Joy makes a deal to sell her product on QVC. This is also when Bradley Cooper enters the film as Neil Walker, an executive at QVC. We get a behind the scenes look at something we never thought we'd get--a home shopping television channel. It's probably something we never even realized we wanted to get. But when it's there, we love it. It's, by far, one of the best things about this movie.It's hard to believe that there was once a time when QVC was revolutionary. "People can actually shop from the comfort of their own home?!" And Joy sprinkles this detail in there as well.If Russell can keep one thing constant throughout his films, it's the chaos he creates. This chaos comes from overlapping dialogue, intrusive camera angles, and a lot of yelling. Whether you see it as a good thing (Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter) or unnecessary (American Hustle), his style is established.In Joy, it works as both good and bad. The good is used when Russell juxtaposes Joy's chaotic home life with the magic of television. The bad is during the beginning when it's all we see and we need desperately to escape from it.The whole film is very surrealistic. Joy's mother is seen watching soap operas intermittently throughout. But we are let in on the story. Russell hires actual soap opera stars, including Susan Lucci, to play the fictional soap opera characters. We are also inside Joy's heads a few times as she dreams of different things, including starring in the soap opera herself.As a character, it's hard for us to put Joy's personality in a box. She doesn't smile much. Her demeanor is sometimes reserved, but explosive at other times. She is both strong and vulnerable, depending on the circumstance. You might say that this is attributed to the complexity of us as humans. Or you can just say that it has to do with the director's uncertainty of his character. Nonetheless, it's fun watching Lawrence perform a vast array of moods.But I really like this film. A lot, actually. Joy's hunger to make it in this capitalist society is inspiring. Her story isn't necessarily a unique one, but her situation is. So many of us have ideas, but the fear of failing hinders us. This film shows all of that. It also shows how one might overcome it.Twizard Rating: 91</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Find Your Enjoyment Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I've seen a movie where I didn't find, ah-hem, JOY in seeing Jennifer Lawrence on screen. Okay, fine, I haven't seen that panned House of horror flick of hers or Parts 2-3b of The Hunger Games, but the seven I have seen made me fall unabashedly and non-sexually in love with her?talent. Fine. She's gorgeous too, but, I digress.Clichéd or easy to write or not, Joy is a joy to watch. It's also hard sometimes, but just seeing the fantastic Jennifer from scene to scene, as she strays from Take-Care-of-Everything Mom to her own person, it's worth the trip. Her dysfunctional family would make just about anyone scream and makes you fight in her corner all the more.Joy's life is always on a thin thread while she manages her ex, her parents as exes and her bills and kids, but the inventor inside and that fire lit from her incredible grandmother/narrator makes her want to better everything, and everyone.Now, her journey of creating a product from scratch to sell and help everyone in the family is shown fairly neat and even though it does show some conflict ? as heart wrenching as it was, it does feel a little too easy, as if there was another hour or more footage to explain everything. As impatient as I am, I am happy with not having a three- hour movie here, though as skeptical as I really am, I would've really liked to see everything.That all said, this somewhat sugarcoated WOMAN film was uplifting and worth the journey. Kinda reminded me of a simpler Erin Brockovich, which, by the way was much better, but if you liked that, you will find Joy here. On a side note?unless Bradley and Jennifer are dating, or secretly twins, I don't see the absolute need to make them into this generation's Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. While Bradley wasn't necessarily bad here, he wasn't needed either and took a little away from the movie. He was an unnecessary distraction of what I wanted to know more about: Joy. Fine, same director, same actors?not everyone needs to be J.J. Abrams. Concentrate on the big picture, David O. Russell and not your entourage. Annnd, rant over. Enjoy the show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Good Parts, Family Characters Are Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea this movie is about the inventor of the Miracle Mop. I'm glad the trailers didn't hype up that aspect because the movie didn't really seem like a biopic at all. It tells the story of Joy.I don't see the point of having her grandmother narrate the story from the afterlife. It seemed pointless. I absolutely hated Rudy, Trudy, Peggy, and Joy's mother. Rudy tries to help Joy at times, but he's a leech like the rest of them. Trudy (along with Rudy) gives terrible business advice to Joy time and time again. She loans Joy money, but doesn't want her to make any. Why? Peggy hates Joy and constantly tries to sabotage her success. Why does Peggy hate Joy? Is she jealous? If so, of what? Joy was valedictorian in high school, but she hasn't accomplished anything after that, all her family takes her for granted, and she has no money. Joy's mother does nothing but watch TV and cause problems. They all do nothing but drag Joy down again and again, but it happens so much that I don't know why she keeps putting up with them. It's to the point that I don't feel sorry for Joy anymore. Her family hurts her, but she keeps putting up with them, so it gets to be her fault for thinking they'd help. Joy is really the only character I cared for. Most of her family members were terrible people, but even then, they could have had something to make me feel some sympathy for them, but they didn't.I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence, but I really liked her acting here. Robert De Niro does a good job too, but I lost interest in his character. There were some cool shots, and I liked the soundtrack. Joy's endless failures got repetitive, and her's was the only character I cared about, but I cared enough that the movie was mostly enjoyable. When she finally sells her mop on TV, I felt happy for her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Exciting, Solid Effort from David O. Russell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JOY is another exciting, solid effort from David O. Russell. The energy this time around is less chaotic compared to his last two films (Silver Linings Playbook, America Hustle), but it felt, strangely enough to me, more structured and focused; even though Russell these days is mostly attracted to characters advancing stories over plot. But my bias is that I don't care much for "plot", as I want films where characters dictate forward movement, even if that movement is less of a straight narrative line, and more of a squiggly kind of progress. Jennifer Lawrence, as usual, is delightful- this may be her best role in the Russell universe, though I will need to see it again to be for certain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know I was a little bit worried to go and watch Joy. I thought it sounded like a really nice and interesting movie, but it was not getting a whole lot of praise of recognition at all and a lot of people sounded pretty disappointed. But I must say this is a decent little film that we got here. I mean I really enjoyed it overall. I mean the first 20 to 30 mins of the movie is awful and cheesy, and really hard to get through, but once it gets out of that kinda over the top acting and story it becomes a really compelling film about a woman who really had to work, endure, and struggle to get to were she wanted to be. I feel like it talks to all of us as well. People peg this a radical feminist movie, but I am not so sure this is as feminist as it is just a movie about a person who decided to not take crap and get her life in order. The main character just so happened to be a young white woman and I also must say that Jennifer Lawrence gives another riveting performance that nearly brought me to tears. The film does have issues tho beyond its 20 to 30 mins it also has unnecessary narration that only came to be used for one scene and then was thrown away like it was nothing. It was a pointless move and didn't add anything to the film. They also brought up that Joy had a son, but he was never brought up in the movie so that was sucky. That being said overall this is a movie that is worth your time</fullReview>

All the characters are introduced all at once so you want to see how they all gel. Moreover the lead shows us what a brilliant young actor/ess she is..taking the lead in every scene and even out shining Bob DeNiro,,,not easy that, Being a seasoned movie addict who goes 3 or 4 times a week,,,I think we have at least 2 Oscar nominations this early o. best screenplay..best Lead ..maybe best support and probably best direction.Masterful little gem here,,,lot of negative reviews I think were expecting a murder of bad language,,,but none of it.

		<shortDescription>Fighting Ahead and Finding Joy Despite Huge Odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsThe latest feature from writer-director David O. Russell is a quirky but very perceptive dramaedy made in Russell's usual freewheeling style. He looks at what it takes to make it, the American Dream, familial dysfunction and love in spite of that pervasive dysfunction, and the loneliness of a long-distance runner. "Joy" is, for all intents and purposes, pure joy to look at and sit through, complete with postcard-worthy scenes, a mesmerizingly immersive script, fairytale like seamless direction from an in-form Russell (red-hot after delivering a trio of classics in "The Fighter", "Silver Linings Playbook", and "American Hustle"), an all-star cast at the top of their game for most parts, and Jennifer Lawrence wearing the pants.Lawrence is the standout as always and she delivers a very believable performance in the eponymous role. David O. Russell has certainly found his muse. As Katharine Hepburn was to George Cukor or Marlene Dietrich was to Josef von Sternberg, so too is Jennifer Lawrence to Russell. This is his third picture to feature Lawrence but the first to star her - or any woman for that matter - as the sole lead in one of his movies. The partnership has yielded yet another fruitful collaboration for all involved. In an era where we routinely bemoan the dearth of strong roles for women, "Joy" quietly enters the discussion and gives us exactly that.The film is a real tribute to the scrappy heroines of the 1940s when female-centric films were common. Think pictures starring Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Katharine Hepburn, or Joan Crawford. Yes, those are indeed lofty comparisons, but Jennifer Lawrence embodies the fierce spirit of those trailblazing heroines. What's old seems new again. She's an uplifting breath of fresh air. A woman with her eyes firmly set on the American Dream. I'll even go so far as to say that if Lawrence had been born before 1920, she might have stolen roles from Jean Arthur, Katharine Hepburn, or Bette Davis. This is a defining role where she comes in not aggressively "with a bow and arrow", as the director has noted, "but with her heart and soul". "Joy" will definitely please Jennifer Lawrence fans as well as viewers who enjoy movies with a strong female lead and viewpoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally I wasn't expecting much from this film considering its the same cast and director as Silver Lining Play book, but was pleasantly surprised. The Film is based on a women called Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) who struggles throughout her life, raising her 2 children and being a single mother. Despite help from her father (Robert De Niro), who by the way lives in her basement with her ex-husband, Joy cannot hold down a job to keep a roof over the heads of all the people living in her home. Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) gives Joy her big break by selling a mop that she designed on his television shopping channel (QVC). Despite the set backs that Joy receives perfecting her invention from family, friends and even business partners, she never gives up and shows determination even when the odds are stacked against her.A good film that shows hard work pays off in the end and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When David met David &amp; Wes &amp; Charlie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its squirmingly funny opening scene we know that this will be something of a soap opera but not viewed from the conventional angle. It's Wes Anderson characters with occasional flirtation into the world of Charlie Kaufman and even David Lynch and not a conventional biopic. At its heart we have the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence, everyday superwoman, who is a complete failure at everything except domestic maintenance, child rearing and holding down a lame job. Finally, suffocating under the weight of her self-imposed obligations, she decides to throw off those shackles and become who she dreamt of being all along. In her way are cartoon businessmen/gangsters, inept salesmen and scheming, jealous relations. Overcoming these challenges will require all her skills but even more so, her steely-eyed determination. It's a grand pantomime Mr O'Russell is attempting here and it almost comes off. The characters are quirky and comedic, the bad guys are charcoal bad, the factory that makes parts is empty and the product is drearily dull. It's just not quite quirky or funny or heart- warming enough. Yes, the entire affair hangs on the eponymous heroine but when you have an Academy Award winning actress at the top of her form that's no criticism at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 January 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Joy. A chance to see an new side to Jennifer Lawrence. In this film she plays Joy, a divorced mother of two, with a dysfunctional family, who all seem to rely on her to survive. Struggling to make ends meet Joy, who had always been inventive, comes up with that special invention which is able to make her rich, however the path to riches as we all know, never runs smooth. A little slow in places, but this film is worth sticking with as there are real highs and lows along the way. A solid performance from Lawrence, as she needed to show real swings of emotion at times as she dealt with her vacuous Mother, her demanding Father, and all the other hangers on who make her life so difficult, and who she stands by no matter how low they go to betray her. Based on the true story of Joy Mangano who built a dynasty from her invention, this film is worth donating a couple of hours of your time to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not just another dare to dream story. "Joy" is an interesting movie on several levels, although maybe not everyone's cup of tea.I had never heard of Joy Mangano before and I don't care about mops at all. Jennifer Lawrence is not my favorite actress. Frankly speaking, I watched this movie because of the poster ? it reminded me of "Almost Famous" (2000), another great dramatic comedy. And after watching it, I must say that Lawrence could really be the new Kate Hudson. Her kind of characters would fit her well.On the other hand, this may disappoint her fan base, generating negative reviews, since "Joy" is nothing like "The Hunger Games" or "X-Men". Told in an unusual manner on Hollywood standards, it has a bit of a European touch. An extra plus for the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mom and I were debating whether we wanted to go see this movie while on vacation. From the reviews we were expecting a pretty horrible movie, but we had time and nothing else to do, so we decided to see it anyways. We actually loved it! It was very interesting to us, especially because it was a true story. Others probably rated this with a low number of stars because this didn't have enough action or wasn't fast paced. It's also a comedy, and although some people said it wasn't funny, we thought it was because her wild family somewhat related to ours, and the soap opera scenes were so cheesy that they were hilarious, but I don't know if other people understood that it was supposed to be humorous. The acting was also very good. There was applause at the end at our theater. And people we rode in the elevator with also enjoyed it and were surprised when we said that it got such bad reviews. This would be a good movie to take friends or family that like more interesting plots over action. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silver Linings II: First time was a dance ... this time they wipe the floor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The team that brought us the 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012) and 'American Hustle' (2013), have once again given us a solid film. This time they tell the true story of Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop, and her Italian-American family.The film opens with the traditional icon and music of the '20th Century Fox' studio, but that is cut short as we embark on a weird and whimsical start to the film. The bizarre opening is a spot slow and at first appears irrelevant. We soon come to realize the significance of the opening.Jennifer Lawrence plays the eponymous Joy. She lives in what seems a big house with her big family. These early family scenes show a modern, but chaotic, family. This reviewer found these scenes to be some of the most authentic filmed. I saw those scenes in the film, and I have seen almost exactly the same ones in real-life too. The real-life Joy Mangano is an executive producer of this film, thus we should conclude that the early part of the film, as well as the rest of the film, is sufficiently close enough to the truth for her satisfaction.Joy was encouraged from her youngest days, but in her adult life, the early promise seemed to fail to materialize. Adult Joy seemed to be leading a hum-drum ordinary existence. Miss Lawrence, who previously, in 'American Hustle', played the dumb-blond bravely tackling the 'science-oven', here plays a sharp-minded innovator. Following a spillage, she has an epiphany, and invents the 'Miracle Mop'. Incidentally, it must be said what a pleasure it was, to see an actress wearing such authentically-looking soiled-clothing as Miss Lawrence does throughout this film. A good eye for detail was displayed there as well as in other parts of the film. Period-detail was good, both in the scenes, and as the characters aged. Family home-movies, and the TV, also gave authenticity. As did the well chosen music.David O. Russell who previously brought us Silver Linings and American Hustle, once again brings together Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper as cast, as he directs, writes, and produces, 'Joy'. We have to assume that they are all happy working together as a team. They certainly work well together. There is a natural authenticity and believability about their performances. They are joined by a good supporting cast. For me, a stand-out supporting actor, was Edgar Ramirez. Miss Lawrence has to develop a many-sided complex character. But this is also somewhat true for Mr Ramirez too. He too has different sides to his character, which are pleasantly revealed throughout the film. Finally, young Isabella Crovetti-Cramp was perfect in her small part.This film is not a drama about a couple of mentally-disturbed people just having a dance. This real-life story is a much more complex affair. It is a drama, with some humour and romance. There are interesting scenes as Joy first gives birth to her idea, then tries to develop it, and then make it a reality. The scenes where the idea is pitched, then the studio scenes, are nail-biting and poignant. Incidentally, the 20th Century Fox studio has it's very own small part to play in the story. The cut-throat business world is also shown well. As are the romantic scenes. Whilst not central to the story, the romance and family scenes, are rich and authentic, and round out the characters.Despite a start and finish that were both a spot slow, 'Joy' is an excellent and solid film from the team that gave us the 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle'. Miss Lawrence is a joy as 'Joy', as is the film itself. For we audience members, the silver lining is that there is still much joy to come from this play-book. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mop around the clock - a flawed but enjoyable flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under the assured direction of David O Russell, "Joy" tells the dramatized tale of the eponymous heroine, loosely based on the true life story of Joy Mangano. Jennifer Lawrence plays her as a struggling inventor trying to get the crazy idea in her head onto paper and then into the shops. When you consider that the product is a mop, this sounds incredibly dull. But the film is actually far from it. With all her worldly possessions on the line, the twists and turns of the plot make for a gripping cinema-going experience. (I could add a joke in here about coming out of the cinema all wrung-out, but that is beneath me).Creating the emotional backbone to the story are the dysfunctional family and friends who orbit planet Joy: her lothario father (Robert De Niro) and his latest belle (Trudi played by Isabella Rossellini as a conveniently very-well-heeled widower); her soap-addicted and virtually bed-bound mother (Virginia Madsen); her divorced husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) who lives in the basement; her half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm) always trying to get one better; her childhood friend Jackie (a stunning Dascha Polanco) and her encouraging grandmother (Dianne Ladd) who also narrates the story.Supporting this core is the "beautiful" (my wife's words) Bradley Cooper as the lead buyer/producer with the QVC shopping channel.Russell's style is to utilize flash-backs, flash-forwards, dream sequences and some startlingly unusual cinematography, making for a hypnotically watchable movie. However, the style is patchy and makes the film difficult to categorize: it resembles in places the soaps that are re-enacted throughout the piece; it has elements of a thriller in some of the more gripping scenes; it has comedic elements, but isn't really a comedy. The result is something that generates a degree of unsettling confusion in the viewer. Perhaps it is this inconsistency that is meant to mirror the roller-coaster ride that Joy's life takes, with the approach being intentional? It's unclear.I've also come to realize that I have a pathological hatred of narration in films (I blame "Blade Runner"), and for me the grandmother's over- dubs are both unnecessary and irritating. The acting turn that holds the whole film together is that of Lawrence who delivers an awards-worthy performance. She can act 'frustration' extremely well, with a side-order of 'steely determination' we've seen from her Hunger Games performances. Here she has full rein to exercise both. Russell's script (from the fictionalized story by Russell and Annie Mumulo) is generally sharp, building up a drum-beat of tension around some of the family relationships and early business decisions that you know are going to bite later. Portions of the script however I just didn't relate to, in particular Trudi's 'four questions' monologue which felt false and disjointed and jolted me out of my belief in the overall story.If you enjoyed David O Russell's earlier films, such as "Silver Linings Playbook" and "American Hustle" then I think you will greatly enjoy this one. My rating is based on my entertainment and enjoyment value, but the film is not without flaws. For that reason I doubt it will be as strong a Best Film Oscar contender as either "Playbook" or "Hustle" were.By the way, some of the scenes in the main trailers, and particularly some of Lawrence's promotional interviews, have given rather more of the outcome away than I would have liked ? so best avoided ? but there are still some surprises in the story that both thrill and sadden in alternate waves.(Please see the graphical version of this review at http://bob-the- movie-man.com - thanks).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wooden, overly sweet and sickly and simply not plausible acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a dog, the acting is wooden in response to a dreadful script and the narrative device of grandma over the top made me want to puke with its sickly saccharine litany of praise for Joy.De Niro was an awful character handicapped further by an awful script, saying in long monologues everything that he should have been acting.The out-takes used for the trailers including Lawrence handling a shot gun and the family wedding scene are minor mile-stones on the highway verge of a very long, dull drive through a barren plain.I got to the end (only just) and thought it must be a vanity project produced by the eponymous multi-millionaire.Trying to care about the characters is hard when all you want is to strangle Grandma to stop the cloying eulogy.Absolutely awful, don't go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was entertaining - although at times it was a little confusing with financial situations. I liked seeing a successful woman portrayed with struggles and dysfunctional family dynamics. That made it real.Joy's tenacity was inspiring, and I think a lot of people can relate to the financial strain after divorce and trying to find your place in the world. I hated the way her dad treated her but probably more so because I could relate closely. Joy kept our attention and even though some reviews say the plot was slow, I think real life develops slowly. It was realistic that things were not easy and success didn't happen overnight but took years of painful hard work with doors slammed in Joy's face along the way. I felt her pain and could feel the despair at times. It made it that much better and more emotional when she made it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I'm writing this review, Joy currently has an average rating of 6.7/10. In my opinion, I think it should have a higher rating. This film is full of great performances from the whole cast (especially Jennifer Lawrence as the title role) and brilliant directing from David O.Russell. This film manages to be inspiring as it tells the story of the title character, Joy Mangano, a divorced mother- of-two, who struggled to support her family and pay the bills. However, she comes up with an idea for a mop that could easily be wrung out without getting the user's hands wet and can be thrown in the washing machine and come out 'clean as new'. Joy is determined to get her invention noticed and does everything she can to make it a product. It doesn't come without its difficulties though. This film shows both the highs and lows of her journey as she went on to become a successful businesswoman and entrepreneur. As I watched Joy's story unfold, I felt incredibly inspired. Despite the lows of her journey, she never gives up which is what I liked most about her. Her determination made her likable and made us, as an audience, want her to succeed. Her family, especially her father (Robert DeNiro), are doubtful about her invention but continue to support her anyway. Jennifer Lawrence's performance as Joy is incredible. She truly understands Joy and manages to show her determination and is definitely Oscar-worthy. This film is, by far, one of the best films I've ever seen. Why this film is getting negative reviews is beyond me. If you're wondering whether to see this film, I'd definitely recommend it. There is no target audience, this film is suitable for both teenagers as young as 12 and adults. Overall, I think that this manages to tell the true story of Joy Mangano in both an inspiring and compelling way.</fullReview>

I believe everyone was casted well in their parts (Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robett De Niro all showed excellence and a good connection after the many films they have been in together). Although, I wasn't that pleased with the actors chosen for Joy's kids. The movie was well organized to fit the 2 hour mark and all scenes had everything they needed to help bring the message across while still being interesting. Joy is well written, full of good performances, inspirational, and an intriguing movie. Don't listen to the reviews - make up your mind yourself. 9.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really do not understand why so many people hate this film. It is not just the critics (rotten tomatoes has it at 60%), but the users' reviews I've seen come down to 1s and 2s out of 10. It is not a perfect movie, and certainly not the best David O. Russell film, but it still is extremely entertaining and well made. I really love Jennifer Lawrence's performance (I think that with her alone this film deserves at least an 8) and the rest of the cast is good too. I see some people complaining about lack of plot, but I really didn't need it. One of the most loved movies of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road is also short on plot, but when you have such good directors as Miller and Russell I don't see the problem. I knew nothing about Joy Mangano before watching this, so I wouldn't know if the "based on a real story" thing is just bullshit, but if it is I don't care. This was a fun, well-crafted, inspiring and emotional film-experience and I feel like some people should cut it some slack. I don't hear much people saying it is "the best" or "perfect", so I don't get why would you go so hard on the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something entrancing about this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this within a couple days of the Oscar nomination announcements, and it's very likely that Joy won't get the accolades as David O Russell's previous films but that's not to say that this isn't a worthy accomplishment on its own.Jennifer Lawrence (in her third collaboration with David O Russell) plays a single mom with big aspirations and a family that weighs her down. From a an ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) and father (Robert DeNiro, also in his third collaboration with David O Russell) who want to crash with her, to a judgmental sister, to a mother (Virginia Madsen) who's resigned to laying in bad watching soap operas, there's a lot of dead weight.Lawrence seeks to up her station in life through inventing a miracle mop and it's a long hard road ahead for her.The film is part adult family drama and part capitalist love story and both parts are infused with the inventiveness David O Russell produced with American Hustle. Joy is kinetic, enthusiastic, and, like American Hustle, the story is based on the instincts of the actors rather than the historical facts. It's an interesting way to make a "based on a true story" film and I'm glad that Russell is continuing to develop his method.A lot of the movie's emotional base lies in rich relationships. David O Russell has said in interviews that he was attracted to the project because it boasted the "Best divorced couple in America" which is just a little objectionable because it isn't until a couple scenes in that Edgar Ramirez's character stops being a dead weight and actually helping. There is a lot to praise, performance-wise, as long as the relationships are working, however, and Ramirez starts really shining when he's getting along with Joy. De Niro, Madsen, and Lawrence shine but that's always a given.If you like what David O Russell did with American Hustle, this film is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy - I tried to hate this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy, like Jennifer Lawrence's steely resolve, is an unconventional triumph. Right from the start I wanted this film not to work. It had all the hallmarks of failure. The entire cast reunited for another blast at home truths, an epic tale of family distrust and a central, all powerful female inventor that we all can connect with (even the blokes). No matter how the narrative chipped away at Joy's creativity and spark, she won us over with that quiet portrait, that 'you can't put me down' well, Joy!As inventor's go, director David Russell weaves a nurtured tale of a child born of a creative mind yet burdened by family. Yet ultimately it is this family (and ex- husband) that bring about the blossoming and true rendering of Joy's character. We all love a good invention; the twister mop symbolizing a down-to-earth tie between Joy and hard graft. The characters, especially Robert DeNiro's soft and put-down father figure, add much to Joy's continued rough ride through entrepreneurial business.I was surprised how eager I became for Joy to succeed. Like Joy, the audience is drawn into a continued putting-down like an animal beginning to wonder if they will ever feel the warmth of success after so many battles. Bradley Cooper's Neil adds much needed depth to the story with his calmness and schmuck-like success at the QVC shopping channel. He begins by trying to mold Joy into an existing format while already realizing her talent and eventual keenness for innovation. This story hits hard and throws punches when you least expect them. If only we all shared even one percent of Joy's determination to make her dreams real, we might all make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performance by JLaw but not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The David O. Russell biopic about Joy Mangano starring Jennifer Lawrence gives the young actor a chance to shine but other than that, it leaves the viewer bored and unsure of what is truth or just embellishment. Russell chose a strange way to tell the story with voice over narration from Joy's grandmother, played by Diane Ladd.Lawrence is at her best when the struggling divorced housewife yelling at her singer husband played by Edgar Ramirez who has another movie released at the same time, Point Break. As an audience member, I rooted for Joy's success, it's hard to root against the American dream.Soon we learn that another source of her struggles is her strange upbringing by her constantly arguing parents played by Robert De Niro and Virginia Madsen. Madsen is the only source of comedy in this movie, which is why I find it weird that this movie got nominated for the Golden Globe under the comedy group. Otherwise, I don't think it gets a nomination. De Niro plays Joy's father whose phone classified dating service sets him up with a wealthy Italian mistress. Isabella Roseellini is the source of some of the best lines of the film and her character Trudy is the source of the primary backing that helped Joy take the business idea to the next level.See more review at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame story but well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me clear I liked this movie but I am not without criticism.Joy is about a woman (Joy) inventing a miracle mop and becoming head of a big company. The road to this ending is paved with obstacles to overcome. Meanwhile she is also very busy with her complicated and full family life. And therein lies my criticism. It is a very cliché story. The story told many times of the American dream, the underdog making it big after a series of challenges. Blah blah blah it gets a bit annoying. Its a true story and in its genre certainly not a bad one but if you're looking for an original story this is not the movie for you.I was entertained nevertheless. What I liked was the story of the family, the interactions and dynamics. Some of it quite funny.Jennifer Lawrence is as always a joy (no pun intended) but I have seen her better. I also liked Robert DeNiro and Bradly Cooper. Really great was Diane Ladd in the role of Joy's mother Mimi. In light of the award season coming up I am rooting for her.In short, though its a cliché of a story it has enough redeeming qualities to make it entertaining and worth a watch. You'll have a nice time I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with no idea of what I was getting into. The trailer was not helpful in letting me know anything except for the fact that Jennifer Lawrence was going to star in a movie that feature the same stars of Silver Linings Playbook. I honestly did not get the butt smooching Silver Linings was given, it's OK, and for that matter, I'm not the biggest JLaw fan either, but I must say, Joy made me buy the product Lawrence is selling.The movie starts off like a situation comedy from the 1970s. Something created by Norman Lear like Maude or One Day at a Time. We get to know Joy, a divorce mother of two whose ex-husband, Tony still lives in the basement, and is ironically more supportive than her flesh and blood, who mean well but are too shattered themselves to be a good role model.Then the movie gets really interesting when she invents the miracle mop and goes through the motions to sell it. From here the movie starts to escalate with interest in what seems like the weirdest plot you can think of for such a critically acclaimed director and his juggernaut cast, but it's not. Joy is the perfect underdog story for anyone who knows what it's like to reach for the stars only to have people around you telling you to stop, cause you won't make it. It reminds me of the boxing movie Creed, but it's just a different type of ring Joy is fighting in.The way the story is set up, it just keeps getting better and better and you can't help to root for Joy when she succeeds and feel her frustration when the world screws her over. Jennifer Lawrence is a good actor, I can't deny that, and in the hands of David O Russell, she very interesting, Especially in Joy. This one is more worthy of the acclaim than Silver Linings Playbook.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting process of inventing and selling a product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Divorced struggling mom with a quirky family soap including addicted mom (a very funny Virginia Madsen) and dad (Robert de Niro) invents a special mop and makes it big. The process of invention and the business hurdles she faces are both interesting and entertaining. Jennifer acts well and evokes sympathy for the gutsy character. It's strange this was under the comedy category for the Golden Globes because her role is more dramatic than comedic. The highly flawed by funny family is the comedy part of this movie. Isabella Rossellini makes a welcome return to the big screen. If you read up on the real character you will find out that while the basic premise is similar (divorced mom invents mop) to the real person on whom it's based - a lot of the quirky family stuff is just fiction for the screenplay and that's fine.This uplifting and enjoyable movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the third time in as many years, Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robert De Niro are appearing in a film by the freewheeling David O. Russell. Make no mistake about it though, this is strictly JLaw's show. She plays housewife-turned mop inventor, Joy Mangano. In 2015's Joy (my latest review), Lawrence doesn't push her character too hard. Her performance is raw, underplayed, and it doesn't feel like she's grandstanding (or clamoring for an Oscar like in Russell's two previous flicks). This is probably the best work she's ever done and the movie despite having a sort of pat ending, is David O.'s strongest since 2004's I Heart Huckabees.Anyway, Joy's look is bleak and its statement suggests that events are slightly based on a true story. There's a fantasy element involved here, a dash of whimsy, and a vibe akin to the age old tale of "Cinderella". Joy's trailer tagline reads, "FIND IT". What I found mind you, was a sense of solace right after the closing credits came down. The only "joy" in the world is to begin. Duh.Russell who usually directs with messy fortitude, parlays things straightforward this time around. And for the first time in a while, his musical soundtrack (including lost long Rolling Stones nuggets, Bee Gees relics, and Cream favorites) really does fit the scenes and the rhythms of the actors/actresses. In Joy, he bullies and frustrates his viewership only to have them salivate for his muse to achieve the taxing, American dream. It's a bruising journey containing themes of cynical consumerism, unnecessary self-doubt, and family dysfunctionality (a David O. Russell mainstay).The story is as follows: Joy Mangano (Lawrence) is a single mother with two kids and an ex-husband who lives in her basement (Tony Miranda played by Edgar Ramirez). Her mother, her father, and her grandmother also live there too. Her mom (Virginia Madsen as Terry Mangano) does nothing but sit on the bed and indulge in daytime soaps. Her pops (Robert De Niro as Rudy Mangano) runs an auto shop and shares said basement with Tony after getting kicked to the curb (by one of his ex- wives). Joy always the creative type, works at an airport and is the poster child for misery. On an impulse, she decides to invent a revolutionary mop after spilling wine during a family boating trip. Unable to sell it by way of getting a loan from Rudy's girlfriend (Trudy played by Isabella Rossellini), Joy ventures to a home shopping network to get people to see its genius by purchasing thousands in bulk. The guy who helps her out, believes in her, and gets the ball rolling is executive Neil Walker (played by Bradley Cooper). Walker quips, "all right Godspeed, gold luck, here we go". Indeed.Now for the majority of Joy's 124-minute running time, Russell opts to make Lawrence's Mangano a veritable centrifuge. This semi-fictional character is under a strict microscope. Everything is on her, everyone judges her from a distance, and every other trouper (De Niro, Cooper, Madsen, Elizabeth Rohm) seems to be in her gleaming foreground. This again, harks back to the fantasy element I boasted about in the first paragraph. Nevertheless, with a couple of finger points, a couple of heavy breaths, and all kinds of starry-eyed nuances, Jennifer Lawrence just kills it. Academy Award nomination beckoning? I sure hope so.In conclusion, certain critics (not this one) seem to think that Joy's premise contains nothing that's at stake. I say hogwash. Sure were talking about selling a mop here but in jest, a woman's livelihood, dignity, financial standing, and sense of belonging (to her family) are forcefully on the line. According to the movie, Joy Mangano's world is a cruel one, filled with double-crossing business associates, cutthroat network bosses, resentful half-sisters, and buzzkill fathers. And yeah its ending (as mentioned earlier) has the need to wrap things up nice and neat. No matter. For ninety percent of Joy's running time, you sense that this is the culmination of everything bountiful to David O. Russell's, decade-plus career. It's the cockamamie, reverie fest he was born to make. Amen. My rating: 3 and a half stars.Of note: In Joy's early third act, you have Melissa Rivers deadpanning her late mother in a cameo via the QVC network. She plays Joan Rivers in a segment where she's selling product and wink winking to the audience. Neat. Also in bits and spurts, I had no problem with Joy Mangano's grandmother (played by Diane Ladd) narrating Joy's roller coaster plight. I just wish it was sprinkled more evenly throughout. Oh well, just a minor oversight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "joyless" drama bolstered by a great cast and humorous tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering how for most of the film its title character goes through various hardships, her name being Joy is almost ironic in a sense and yet it feels perfect for a film of this nature. A biographical drama based on the story of the woman who invented the Miracle Mop, Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence), the film follows Joy in her journey into becoming a successful businesswoman when the deck is stacked against her as she tries to support her family which consists of a troublesome father (Robert De Niro, excellent), a mother glued to her Television as she watches her favorite Daytime soap (Virginia Madsen), a jealous sister (Elisabeth Rohm), her ex-husband, an aspiring singer (Edgar Ramirez) and her loving grandmother, Mimi (a luminous Diane Ladd). The family scenes are akin to a soap opera on itself with the over-dramatics and breakdowns and at one point I was reminded of "All in the Family". As Joy finds her calling with her invention, she begins a new chapter in her life as she fights to achieve her goals even when it nearly destroys her. "Joy" was my first experience of watching a film by David O. Russell and I was engrossed by it, it was amusing and even touching at times but I found the approach to be somewhat uneven since the quirkiness it delivers comes across as overly bizarre and quickly becomes tiresome. The best scenes are set on QVC as we're given an up close and personal behind the scenes with Joy learning how the business works through Bradley Cooper's Neil Walker. The scenes shared between Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper best exemplify why they work best together, the chemistry they have is perfect and it shows.Jennifer Lawrence delivers a superb performance as the title character. Age being a non-issue when she is able to convey maturity in the way she does and I was most impressed by how she never indulges in overacting. Even in scenes where one expects Joy to scream, she doesn't. She keeps a low voice, allowing her words to cause an effect. Of the supporting cast, I found Isabella Rosselini to be a standout as Trudy, she reminded me of Maureen Stapleton in "Interiors", giggly and joyful yet tough and hard when necessary.Overall, "Joy" was a satisfying film. A fascinating examination into the life of Joy Mangano and how her will made her into the success she was. The eccentricity of the first half was overbearing, if entertaining (the daytime soap Virginia Madsen's Terri watches features some of the film's funniest and most fabulous moments), whereas the second half delivers a vast improvement supported by a fine cast, a solid direction and quick editing keeping the plot fast paced and electric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Performances, but Lacks Compassion and a Truly Engaging Story,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's an enjoyable film that follows the life of Joy Mangano, an entrepreneur who rises to fame after her invention of the miracle mop, the films dosen't take place after she makes it big, but focuses on the struggle and hard work she had to go through in order to make it in to the big league. The performances are terrific and honestly deserved a better movie, Jennifer Lawrence shines in the lead role and she is joined by an outstanding supporting cast that includes Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Virginia Madsen, Elisabeth Röhm and Édgar Ramírez. The style of the film is very strange, there are parts that feel like a normal drama, other bits that are comedic, there were even dream sequences that came across as weird and sinister, the director's approach to the whole thing felt uncertain, he clearly wanted it to be different from a regular biography film, but I think it would have been better off keeping it normal. I will admit I've come to expect more from David O. Russell and his usual cast, there is a certain standard he has brought us from his work, such as the Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle, and this movie certainly dosen't deliver, mostly because of the lack of relationship between the main character with others. There's a clear bond between Micky with several people in the Fighter, as there is with Pat in Silver Linings, but here Joy's relationship with every other character is never fully established, we know how she gets along with her mother, father, grandmother, ex- husband and so on, but because she never really had enough scenes with any of them all of the characters, including Joy, never become truly compelling, and it makes the overall story much less engaging, I never found myself truly caring for anything tragic that happened to them. A well acted film that is jam packed with flaws, Joy is an enjoyable film that is worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix, but you certainly shouldn't go out of your way to see it, unless you're a die hard Jennifer Lawrence fan. Follows the struggles Joy Mangano went through to get her own invention on the market. Best Performance: Jennifer Lawrence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Warning! May Contain Spoilers**So It's Christmas day. The house is covered in Gift Wrapping and Half eaten plates. Time to clean up you say ? Nah. Like 7,000 other holiday patrons I crammed my self into a movie seat at my local Megaplex to see Jennifer Lawrence's new flick.Jennifer Lawrence (Silver Linings Playbook , American Hustle) Once again teams up with Writer/Director David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook , American Hustle) to present us with the movie land version of the woman that brought us the Miracle Mop. And we need it for this one.First off Acting was fine , Including Lawrence who really carried this one, with notable help from Edgar Ramirez (Tony). A good flaky jerk father figure role by Robert De Niro was had as well.The Writing. Well , we all saw the quirky eccentricities of David O. Russell in Silver Linings Playbook. We all saw what they did when placed in Jennifer Lawrence's Capable hands. Sometimes that formula really works well ( Big Trouble (2002)), However most of the time you get a discombobulated mess that strains your disbelief. The Writing of Joy is the latter. I Don't fault Russell too much. After all audience tastes are swinging to the more real life , authentic sort of 1970s style drama these days.For what were undemanding locations, the filming was on par , but the writing was just splattered all over the place , thus creating a washing machine style Hurk n Jurk with the films flow.I don't feel I wasted Christmas here , but I did not see Guardians of the Galaxy or the Shawshank Redemption either. If you are a Jennifer Lawrence Fan , or even just tired of the hunger games , this one is a good one to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The format of this flick just kept reminding me of the Twilight Zone! This is one weird flick! Everyone seems to be hypnotized into their character and each actor is almost an astral projection of that character. I don't know how else to describe them.This movie is the forever sure American crowd pleaser Horatio Alger rags to riches tale. Joy comes up with the 'Miracle Mop' invention in the 1980's and beats the odds against her to market her invention. Sure enough she succeeds and becomes rich and famous. Along the way or rather, through her journey, for every triumph there is a tragedy. We've all seen this plot many times.What holds this flick together is the other worldly feel to it. Jennifer Lawrence carries the torch start to finish. Isabella Rossellini looks like a Madame Tussauds wax figure. Robert De Niro can be as bad or good as he pleases because what is it going to do, hurt his career? Not. Bradley Cooper is ten minutes from becoming a zombie in this flick!This movie is average at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1990 Joy Mangano invented the Miracle Mop.It was a complete flop and nearly bankrupt her and her family in the process.The US shopping channel's top sales on screen sales people couldn't work it and so her 'once in a lifetime' opportunity to make her millions turned into standing on the cusp of losing them instead.So she took matters into her own hands. She asked QVC to let her sell her mops herself on screen explaining "I'm just like everybody else out there. I'm a mom, I work, I have a house to clean, things to organise. We all have certain similar needs, and I address them." This came across in a very real and engaging way on QVC and the rest was history. She is now a $3 x billionaire.In Joy, Jennifer Lawrence puts in a performance that not only captures this spectacular rags to riches story but breaks your heart along the way. There really only is one Jennifer Lawrence with her myriad looks, faces and delightfully subtle intonations. JLaw is a force of nature.So too is David O. Russell, her doting director, who has now cast her in his last three excellent movies, including Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle (and, in all three, he places the brilliant Bradley Cooper alongside her). Always, the effect is cinematic magic. No less so here despite the relatively lukewarm reaction from IMDb voters and critics alike. (How can this be so?)The script appears to takes many liberties with the true life story for both comic and dramatic effect, but who cares it's a movie. The ensemble gathered around J Law's star vehicle performance also include a rejuvenated Robert De Niro as her morally dubious father, Isabella Rossellini (no really), Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Elisabeth Rohm (as her rather hateful half sister). It works.Three, maybe four, times this movie made me completely fill up, not because of the fantastic human story but because of the remarkable performance by Jennifer Lawrence and the stunning direction of her by Russell.Ignore the critics. Just, not this one. You'll thank me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most funny and uplifting movie in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was above and beyond anything the so-called "critics" said it was. I have written many screenplays in my life. They are to be experienced on screen, not read and analyzed after you see it on-screen, unless, of course, the movie files and explanations are forthcoming like bees on honey. This is a must see film and rightly deserves a place in best picture and best actress category. Ms. Lawrence is up there now, with Kate Blanchett and Myrle Steep. Ahead of her time? More like child genius. I would say, "look for her in the future" but her future is our present and she has not only entered the upper echelon o top actors, she owns the screen and has entered it in flames. (reference intended). now, about the move itself: there are so many packed in side moments ALONG with Joy's complete struggles against corruption and greed, and we are with her every step of the way. The comedy outlets provided by a perfect denier, sometimes Rosellini, susan lucci, virginia madsen, were in sync with all the mushy "i will make things and help people" philosophy Joy has as a child. Yes, a bit mushy was the grandmother death and yes, I would take that out, but it's okay. It was okay, because you can never have enough sympathy for our heroine that never ever gives up when her own family asks, demands and basically gives her no choice. This is just from her family, not the sleazy businessmen/mop makers she encounters - and on her own terms to boot. This is an uplifting movie like Norma Rae only funny and with much more sensitive and a higher skilled actress who will rule on screen, the next 25 years or so. Kudos, hats off, to my new star and hero. (and really, from the Hunger Games- who knew she had so much more in her than a Lara Croft? This writer and critic knows movies and knows what is great. Yes I do and I say, go and then go again. And in one year, rent it for the losers who failed to see it.thought the reviewers were nuts. Go see this film, enjoy the funny relationships, the bossa nova'Tom Jones" husband intro. Everything in this movie works so well, the trailer was not as good - the movies more than delivered. ignore the morons from rotten tomatoes, they are old icky people who lack the ability to get involved in storytelling from many different angles. There were so many little things that added up to a many different laughs and then right back to drama. Most movies that are comedy/drama cannot make up their minds and fail. This one is simply, yet complicated. Funny, yet dramatic. Seriously Jennifer Lawrence has taken over what Myrle Streep only started. She should win the Academy Award the second time and we'll see her in all our futures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real surprise- a very inspirational tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the cinema to see Joy. I had looked at the reviews before I went and I was disappointed to see a 6.7 rating- I was expecting something in the 7s or 8s. And let me say one thing- this film was the biggest surprise of 2015- Partly because I thought I wouldn't be that great due to the ratings. The Acting was extremely good,especially Jennifer Lawerence. This was easily her greatest performance of her career so far- definitely a Oscar Nomination coming her way. Robert DeNiro and Brad Cooper were fantastic as well(as per usual). The script was written- The Characters had depth, the structure was strong and the message was clear. I think Joy suffered low ratings because men were rating it. But I assure you that any woman who saw this would love it and relate to Joys Struggle. I honestly think this film deserves a best picture nomination, although I know it won't get one. Sadly this is the Case, but I hope films like Joy can change the lives of women. Joy is strong, smart, generous and brave- she is a good example of a great person that we should all strive to be. Don't bother about the 6.7 rating, go and see it, and you'll see how this film is a 10/10 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than lives up to its title, another huge hit from J Law and David O.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is from David O. Russell, has all its favorites, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, and of course the always brilliant Jennifer Lawrence at the center, its a true story based on a genius woman, so whats more to love?! I don't know if the film is perfect or not, or if it could explore more of the main true character, and what not, but to me a perfect film is one that no matter what makes you feel it is perfect, makes you have a feeling hard to explain that goes far beyond satisfaction. And so, to me, the film more than lives up to its title and is perfect. I think the script is just great, showing the most important moments either in the story or of the characters, basically if you see the film you can have a pretty great idea of what an amazing woman Joy is, and what her equal amazing story is. You get all you need from all the characters, that serve their role in the story. There's just so many great moments in this film.The performances of course are more than perfect, but obviously JLaw just steals the show, as usual, giving a brilliant performance that is just once more proof that she can do anything and shine. She was the perfect choice to portray Joy, because obvious reasons aside, she has that real world natural feeling that makes you believe in everything.There's plenty of the usual style one would expect from David O. Russell. And also as usual the production values are great, from the production design to the sound and score is just amazing.This is a film that will glue you to the screen, it's 2 hours that by the time they are over you ask for more because its hard to believe 2 hours have passed by. It's a really immersive film, that showcases what people can really achieve if they believe in themselves no matter what other people say. And thank god we have brilliant, brave people like Joy or this world would be a wasteland, Its such a shame there's so much more of the other people.Anyway, the only less good thing i have to say is that you don't really have the notion of time, you never really know when the story takes place (unless you are familiar with it) nor do you have notion of time passing by, days, months or years.But see this film, its a joy to watch, its a drama for sure but you will laugh many times thanks to some very funny scenes throughout. And in the end, no matter how more you would want to see, the arc of Joy and the other characters is closed and will you have a tremendous feeling of hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True story about the delusions of success in the American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Joy stands in the street in the snowfall at the end of the film the snow is obviously false ? large hunks of blown bits of foam. But that's the film: a real life soap opera about the mix of myth and reality that makes up the American Dream. That's why the film opens on a soap opera scene as it occurs on the set, which we later see narrowed down and reframed for the TV screen. The film weaves together fiction and life, truth and lies, connections and betrayals, all tightly wound ? like a self-wringing mop.David Russell uses the real-life story of Joy Mangano to demonstrate the mix of ambition and failure, possibility and fiction, that makes up the myth that America is the land of opportunity where anyone can realize their dream. For the bulk of the movie the title and the heroine's name seem a bitterly ironic taunt. Joy knows no joy. The brightest kid at school, class valedictorian, a dreamy and creative fantasist and inventor, she leaves her brilliant future behind her when she abandons college to look after her just divorced mother. Mother Terry spends her life on her bed watching the soaps, leaving Joy to tend to her and Joy's two tots. The soaps star real-life soap stars (e.g., Susan Lucci, Laura Wright) in an invented saga of the disasters and tribulations of a successful businesswoman. They are a retreat from reality for Terry but a bitter foreshadowing of Joy's business life. Casting real-life soap stars as fictional soap stars is another variation on the mix of fiction and reality. So is casting Joan Rivers' daughter as Joan Rivers. Joy's husband Tony is a victim of the American Dream. The Portuguese immigrant dreams of becoming a successful singer. Two years after the divorce he's still living in Joy's basement rehearsing for his dead end local club gigs. He won't be the next Tom Jones. He embodies the failure of the dream success. Still, he has the character to remain Joy's friend and protector. He's proved right to reject the advice forced on her by Joy's financier and father.In contrast to Tony is the Haitian plumber Toussaint, who comes in to fix a broken pipe under Terry's floorboards but stays to break through her antagonistic shell into an apparent relationship. This is the American Dream working at a modest level, giving an immigrant the chance to live a modest success without unrealistic aspirations of glory. Toussaint has the character to live a realistic ambition that Tony lacks. Joy's father Rudy is another modest American success story, a small auto body business owner. When he hooks up with a wealthy widow, Trudy, he succeeds her Morris whose hard work left her with a fortune. Joy turns to her to help fund her invention of an advanced mop, but Trudy keeps her in constant uncertainty and humiliation. Even after her success, Trudy and Rudy force her into premature bankruptcy, Rudy undermines Joy's business strategy, and ? as the narrator reveals at the end ? lost an attempt to sue her for possession of her entire company. This is not the Father Knows Best American family. To the contrary, Joy's parents remain violently bitter even after their divorce. Rudy's other daughter Peggy, by his first wife, is jealous of and antagonistic to Joy. She conspires with Rudy against Joy. At her lowest point, when it appears Joy will lose her mop patent and company to her fraudulent parts supplier, Rudy apologizes to her for having nourished her delusions of being special. The only positive figures in Joy's life are her grandmother Mimi and her own little daughter. Joy isn't presented as an American Dreamer but as a self-reliant, creative woman who, having been clobbered by life, resolves to pull herself out of the dump. The obstacles amass but she forges on. She doesn't go on the shopping TV channel because she wants to become a star but because she thinks she can do a better job selling her mop than the channel's star seller but hapless mopper could. Joy is a success because she knows her own abilities and does not accept either defeat or her family's discouragement. Granny Mimi appreciates Joy's qualities and encourages her. As the film moves between the reality and the fiction of American success Mimi continues as our narrator even after she dies. Fiction outlives reality.That's the thing about the American Dream. There is an element of truth to it ? America is the land of opportunity. But there are no more guarantees about its rewards than there are about the prospects of a successful marriage ? as Rudy drunkenly and viciously rails at his daughter's wedding. America, like families and like life, offers opportunities but with it dangers, threats, betrayals, disappointments and terrible dishonesties. Ultimately there is no dream promise in America, only what you make and find in yourself. Perhaps the film's central emblem is Joy's mop. It's a dense weaving of cotton strands that are far more absorbent than earlier mops. Like Joy it can simply take more. It can be wrung without touching the dirtied head, which can be removed and tossed into the washer. This film is a dense, complex, inventive twist of a story that comes clean on success and failure in American families and business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely - though rich and quiet, a powerful Life Choices type adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unexpected pleasure. Jennifer Lawrence drew me in; then the depth and "truth" of the story got me to enjoy it all. I read some negative notices saying it was "boring." I can see why a nervous person might say that - this movie is about that deep place inside us where we make our life choices. That may not be a thrill like a car chase or a shoot-out, but it was immensely more engaging.I don't care if this is a faithful biopic or not. It might be - but it doesn't matter. The script and narrative were about the heart - make that Heart. Life often sucks; sometimes disappointment could easily be life's middle name. This story was about a woman who slogged through the pile of doodoo life dealt her, found the family and love and joy (and all that good stuff) that is at the core of us all, made the tough, life affirming choices and persevered until strength and happiness (and grace) were her real, genuine experience.Robert Di Niro's character was a bit of a bully - passive-aggressively, AND aggressively. I like cheerier stories, and would have chosen to eliminate that character, or at least his prominence in the story. Same with her mother, and Peg, the half sister. But to the character Joy's credit, she tolerated them all, without undue fuss and without rancor. My first impulse would not have been to do that - and I found Joy's forgiveness and grace inspiring.Overall, excellent movie. I am surprised the poo-pooers had the gall to post their whiny little cries of "boring!" and "what's the POINT?" online, for the whole world to see how shallow and dull they are. Oh well, takes all kinds, I guess.Lastly - I think it must be time for director David O. Russell's recent cinematic shtick to be over. That is, the Di Niro, Lawrence, Cooper trio thing is on the edge of becoming tiresome. All are so talented - but they need to move on to higher and brighter pastures, with different people.

		<shortDescription>too long and somewhat boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although a good and inspiring story, I felt this film was way too long and somewhat boring at times. It was loaded with stars who were nice to see and they all did a fine acting job. But I feel they could've found better child actors throughout. It just dragged in spots and I found myself thinking: "let's get on with it." The driving scenes and peripheral mundane action with family members could have been eliminated and not affected the story very much. And I definitely could have done without all the negativity and bad language in the wedding scene! When it was revealed that the story was of Joy Mangano near the end, I would've enjoyed seeing more about her other inventions and successes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The casting of Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro suggests this is going to be a good film. It's not. It's over-stylized with caricatures rather than characters, a cartoon approach to telling the story, and very little humour. Presumably the three actors wanted to work together with writer/director David O. Russell again after Silver Linings Playbook, regardless of how weak the script actually was. This was the wrong writer/director for this particular story which could have been quite interesting if it had got a straightforward telling.We give it 2 stars for Jennifer Lawrence. Bradley Cooper was in a very minor role and DeNiro has lost his mojo entirely.</fullReview>

Odd David O. Russell take on the American Dream with Lawrence as the titular heroine a ne'er do-well, long suffering middle class matriarch wanna-be whose brilliant idea - a hands-free, self-wringing mop - ultimately lifts her from mediocrity into , well, a successful businesswoman. While loosely based on a true story the screenplay by Russell and Annie Mumolo is a tad too off-kilter with nary a likable character outside its lead (Lawrence acquits herself with some heavy-lifting on her slender shoulders) yet a game cast.

		<fullReview>All I knew about Jennifer Lawrence was that she plays the lead in The Hunger Games, a genre that has absolutely no appeal for me and thus, by definition, I haven't seen. I did, however, read a positive review from a critic I tend to agree with on balance and on that basis I checked it out. There was a dodgy moment early on when Robert de Niro showed up and it soon became apparent he had a major role rather than a cameo; de Niro is someone I have always considered vastly overrated and his performance here did nothing to change my opinion. Jennifer Lawrence on the other hand turned out to be half-decent and acquitted herself quite well in what I suspect is a 'female kicks ass' role similar to the one she plays in The Hunger Games. There were some insights into the world of TV channels that exist solely for merchandising and on the whole it was painless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J-Law and directing: good. The script not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Joy, I came out happier than I thought I would, as I was prepared for total disappointment by early reviews I have read. However, J-Law was completely on point, as it still seems no one can bring a performance from her as David can. I also found the directing of the movie very interesting, which has the trademark of David O' Russel, as you can see in Silver Linings Playbook or American Hustler. For me the setbacks arise from the script, which comes off as weak, as you don't really understand what is the message David is trying to convey. I believe that in his attempt to have several stories of brave women it resulted in a movie somewhat confusing and you cannot help feeling that the end result is very flat. Nonetheless, as I said, Jennifer is great and I hope see her at some awards, but I am not sure if the movie is good enough to carry her to the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lively, charismatic, if broad, work from Jennifer Lawrence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy itself was really disjointed and messy. American Hustle was messy too, but in a more substantial way. This was a decently entertaining film, very inoffensive, but without much effect or weight. The screenplay needed a lot more work because the ingredients to have made it work seemed to be in its grasp, yet it never fully came together. The cast is very good though and the reason it works at all. In particular, Jennifer Lawrence is a joy (sorry for that). Like always, she's extremely lively and and endlessly charismatic. She makes the film work more than it should, and she brightens the whole thing up. So, that's a positive. The problem here, and it's become more obvious with each new Russell-Lawrence collaboration... she seems to work in broad characterization. It was more obvious in American Hustle, but that character called for over-the- top mannerisms and performing, but it does seem like Russell is taking away so much of her nuance that she showed in something like Winter's Bone. I think it's a very good Lawrence performance here, and not many people I could accuse of being unsubtle and still really good. The reason she's so good is because of her energy and natural charisma, but I do think she relies a little too much on really obvious "acting" at times. So as odd as this sounds, I kind of loved her here, yet I do acknowledge that I hope she and Russell either stop working together or tone it down. Odd, I know.</fullReview>

It shows the greediness of those who work near you, but you don't know that yet; that strangers believe in you more often than your friends.

		<shortDescription>Russell's quirky family members are hit or miss, but rags to riches tale of QVC entrepreneur, is riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked David O. Russell's "Silver Linings Playbook," then you'll like "Joy" even more. Both have their share of quirky working-class misfits but unlike "Silver," Joy is based on a true story. Russell is on much firmer ground here in his half-fact, half-fictional chronicle of Joy Mangano, inventor of the "Miracle Mop," who parlayed a simple but clever household item into a multi-million dollar fortune.Since little is known about Joy's personal life, Russell conjured up his own take on what Joy's family might have been like. Joy did have an ex-husband Tony, who lived in the basement of the family home even after they were divorced. Russell imagines Tony as a failed nightclub singer and his fictional take works well, as the character adds to the necessary comic relief. Slightly less successful is Russell's portrait of Joy's mother who is addicted to soap operas. Russell reproduces the soaps in a series of flashbacks, beginning with a black and white show from the 1950s. The joke wears thin after a while and the mother never rises above the level of caricature (the mother's attraction to a Haitian plumber doesn't really go anywhere either).Joy receives emotional support from her father Rudy, who owns a failing auto body repair shop in the neighborhood. Robert De Niro plays the father as an over the top, irascible curmudgeon who ends up moving into Joy's house after breaking up with a girlfriend. De Niro shows off his usual shtick coping with a significant anger management problem and here often battles things out with ex-husband Tony. Diane Ladd is entrusted with narrator duties as the supportive grandmother who believes that Joy is one day destined to consummate her rags to riches daydreams.Peggy, the half-sister, seeks to upstage Joy whenever she gets the chance. Peggy is the only character whom Russell invented completely out of whole cloth and doesn't work well at all, as there's really nothing redeeming about her.Things really begin to pick up after the introduction of the quirky family members. Rudy begins dating Trudy (artfully played by Isabella Rossellini), an Italian widow who bankrolls Joy's dream with an inheritance courtesy her late husband, a successful businessman. In fact, it's on Trudy's small yacht, that Joy comes up with the idea for the Miracle Mop, after she must swab the deck following an accident involving red wine.Joy (the movie and the character) becomes more and more interesting as Tony is able to have her meet with someone who works for QVC, the fledgling cable TV channel that turns Joy into a star. Joy gets to meet the go-getter QVC executive Neil Walker (played pretty straight this time by Bradley Cooper), who proceeds to sabotage Joy's quest for success by having one of his TV sales agent's blow the presentation for the Miracle Mop on live TV. Having convinced Joy to manufacture 50,000 mops anticipating a successful broadcast, Walker finally gives Joy another chance and she becomes a big success after doing the presentation herself on TV. You would think that this would be the end of the story, but happily it isn't! Russell knows he needs a dark moment at the end of Act II and for his protagonist to accomplish what she set out to do at the beginning of the narrative. Joy must do battle with the manufacturer in California who has been unfairly raising his prices and throwing her for a loss. In the best scene in the film, Joy discovers that the company has been using her design illegally but ends up being arrested for trespassing. Back home, Trudy's lawyer advises her that she must file for bankruptcy after Peggy signs an agreement with the manufacturer without Joy's knowledge. Joy moves past her darkest moment and travels to Texas where she confronts the owner responsible for cheating her and gets him to sign an agreement, paying her back all her royalties plus interest.What makes Joy so interesting is that she must overcome three major obstacles before claiming victory: pitching the Miracle Mop on her own; uncovering the misappropriation of her design by the manufacturer; and successfully negotiating a contract with the manufacturer's owner after discovering he has committed fraud. Just when it appears she's successful, a whole new set of obstacles appear which she must overcome, before declaring her "final victory."The first third of Joy is hit or miss?but once Joy's own story begins in earnest, the viewer is hooked. Joy's rag to riches story is "feel good" just about all the way. The success story of this talented woman should only be tempered by the fact that part of her success was due to the intervention of someone who inherited quite a bit of money. There are plenty of other "Joys" out there with talent that only need a "connection" to bankroll them. In this case, luck (in part) was on Joy's side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Joy" is definitely a David O. Russell film, but a more accessible and uplifting one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believing in yourself can be one of the most difficult things to do. When the people closest to you, the circumstances of your own life and even the past mistakes and present doubts which we all have, seem stacked against you, it's tough to push forward to reach your goals. Even when you do believe in yourself and remain determined to reach those goals, sometimes things just don't work out. We rarely hear the stories of those who try their hardest and always fall short, but when we hear a story of someone who overcomes the odds and fulfills his or her potential, it encourages us dreamers. Such a story gives us hope. Such a story gives us? "Joy" (PG-13, 2:04) As a child, Joy did great in school and always liked to make things. She seemed destined for something big, but, adult Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) is being held back by something seemingly inescapable ? everyday life. She's the kind of person who takes care of daily tasks, family members and basically whoever and whatever needs taking care of. Joy has bills and a mortgage to pay, so she works as a put-upon airline reservation agent. At home, she's a put-upon daughter, mother and ex-wife. Living with her are her two small children, 5-year-old Christie (played by twins Aundrea and Gia Gadsby) and 3-year-old Tommy (twins Tomas and Zeke Elizondo), Joy's mother, Terry (Virginia Madsen), who does nothing but sit on her bed and watch soap operas on TV, Joy's gruff and stubborn father, Rudy (Robert DeNiro), Joy's grandmother, Mimi (Diane Ladd), and Joy's ex-husband, Tony (Edgar Ramirez), whom she allows to live in her basement. Joy's half-sister, Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm) is the only close family member who doesn't live in the house, which is good, considering the tense rivalry between the two women. This is Joy's life.After one particularly stressful day, Joy literally dreamed up an invention which she became convinced she could market, in spite of her lack of business experience. Joy used her daughter's crayons to draw what became "The Miracle Mop", a self-cleaning mop, which would never have to be replaced. She has her father set up a pitch meeting for her with Rudy's new girlfriend, Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), the eccentric widow of a successful businessman. With Trudy's initial investment, Joy sets up production in Rudy's auto repair shop. After some frustrating experiences trying to find ways to market her invention, a QVC executive (Bradley Cooper) agrees to put her product on TV. After a couple more fits and starts, the product is a success, but Joy's struggles are ongoing. To ensure her long-term success, Joy has to overcome obstacles caused by her lack of capital, some dismissive potential partners, plus difficult and unscrupulous business associates, not to mention jealous, greedy, negative and unsupportive family members. Absolutely nothing comes easy for Joy, but she's determined to make something of herself."Joy" is a typical David O. Russell film ? with a few notable exceptions. He has cast Lawrence, Cooper and DeNiro (all doing their usual outstanding work) in his third film in a four year span (after 2012's "Silver Linings Playbook" and 2013's "American Hustle"). Russell's script and direction display his signature quirky characters, although he has dialed back the eccentricity. This film is as enjoyable as "Hustle" and definitely more family-friendly than "Hustle" or "Playbook", as Russell makes "Joy" only his second film to earn a "PG-13" from the MPAA. This film is also more uplifting and focused than those other two. As with "Hustle", Russell takes liberties with real-life scenarios, bending a true story to his will. What he gives us is a dramatic, funny and inspiring tale that goes beyond the challenges overcome by one specific person or gender. It's unfortunate that the producers saw fit to take even more liberties in their marketing of the film. The movie's trailers seemed to consciously avoid letting movie audiences know that this is a film mainly about the invention and marketing of a mop. Then, the combination of the title, the movie poster's images and the Christmas Day release date seem intended to make the film look like a Christmas movie. Maybe it's just me, but I find deceptive marketing practices offensive and feel that they tarnish the reputation of what is otherwise an excellent movie. Although this film lacks some of the spark and energy that Movie Fans are accustomed to seeing from David O. Russell, "Joy" is an accessible, entertaining and hopeful film. "A-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why oh why oh why do we have to be submitted to the ignorant delivery of a female story as 're-written' by a blo**y man? This is the big failing of this production. The screenplay and direction are appallingly wrong. The story runs like a paint by numbers story board with barely any dialogue given to the principal character Joy. What? This woman, who knows she has a fight on her hands the moment she decides she's going to bring a new innovation to market, says hardly a thing when the inevitable problems start surfacing? No No NO. There are some fab actors in good roles in this production but, they can't deliver superb performances if they have no material to work with. David O Russell inserts an incompetent QVC presenter Todd who nearly sinks Joy's product. Well, David O Russell, you nearly sunk this story. A shame for everyone else connected with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does a white businesswoman, who has a net worth of 50 million US Dollar, do before she hits the 60 (not just on her bank account but also in years of age)?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exactly, she gathers a budget of exactly that amount in order to produce a movie that celebrates herself. The Masturbation of Joy Mangano is an entrepreneurial success story that brings every capitalist by heart to the edge of their cinema seats. The trailer promised a heart-warming story of a young woman who set out to become an inventor and who against all odds risked everything she had in order to make her dream come true. That this invention turned out to be a self-wringing mop and her dream to become Americas Number One home shopping queen on television is less disappointing than the way it is portrayed by the awarded American film director, screenwriter, and producer David Owen Russell, who we know from tear dropping movies such as Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and The Fighter (2010). Even Jennifer Lawrence who we love from movies such as the Hunger Games, in which she performed the role of the rebellious yet empathic fighter who led the revolution against authority, the government and corruption, was seemingly uncomfortable in the role of Americas 1% self-glorification. The American Dream of the 21st century has a new face, Joy Mangano, portrayed in a movie that tried to be funny, dramatic and courageous but somehow managed to not be any of these. Still, it is entertaining indeed ? like a circus, which makes you laugh for the wrong reason and then reminds you that you should not be supporting this. If we are looking for movies that encourage people to stand up for what they believe in and pursue a honest and rebellious life there are probably better ones to come in 2016 than the story of a white New Yorker woman who in-depth herself on the costs of her children to benefit the American economy. Now I am off to see the Hunger Games again, as fiction these days seems to be a much more honest inspiration than the, at the same time released, memoir of a millionaire.</fullReview>

Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as a daughter of a mother(Virginia mad sen)with anxiety problems , a father (Robert De Niro)who is a womanizer, grand daughter of Mimi(Diane Ladd), wife of Venezuela immigrant Tony( Edgar Ramirez) and a business woman. the scenes where Joy is cleaning the floor, having conversations with mom, catching up parts of soaps on TV with her mom, making friends with dad's girl friend Trudy (Isabella Rosellini) and then bargaining and making genuine efforts to sell her idea on TV with Neil walker (Bradley Cooper) are great. Jennifer Lawrence deserves Oscars for best acting. This movie is all about her . She is terrific. Excellent direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Best thing about this film is Jennifer Lawrence by far her performance is amazing. The rest of the cast was also good but nothing really amazing to say although the movie has a dumb idea for her in order to make money i mean a mop? seriously? And it moves pretty slow but the good thing is that Joy keeps you entertained but still i think that American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook were way better since the cast and the direction were much better. The story isn't something special but it's still a great movie that gives great messages. Another thing that i didn't liked tho that was the young cgi Robert DeNiro i mean really? didn't they do something like that with Grudge Match back in 2013? Anyways Joy packs a great performance by Lawrence even if it has 2 or 3 little problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director David O. Russell continues his streak of movies which are worth the experience. I got the general impression the true life story of Joy Mangano was probably crazier than what is depicted here. Although, there is no shortage of faint and rude souls around the main character done beautifully by Jennifer Lawrence. She shines as young girl and woman who rarely lets anyone tell her what to do. In life it seems people generally aren't supportive about new ideas and certainly family can be the worst. This story rings true because it's not simply about the glory but it's about character when issues arise. The cast here is excellent as Russell clearly loves DeNiro, Lawrence and Cooper and this movie will inspire anyone who has a passion to make their ideas come true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie but it has a Few Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really sure what to expect of this film but I knew that I was a big David O. Russell fan and I knew that I was going to give it a shot just because of the director. Also, what is this like the third time he's worked with Jennifer Lawrence? You can't go wrong with talent at least. I enjoyed the movie but there were a few decisions in the film that left me scratching my head. Still a decent movie and worth a watch but I don't believe it's one of Russell's best. I'll get to that in a moment but let's talk about the story first.The story focuses around the titular character Joy (Jennifer Lawrence). Joy grew up with a knack for inventing and creating things but her life has gone in a completely different direction in large part because of her family. She supports two children, her ex-husband, her mother, and even her father is a recent border in her home. She finally gets sick of it and an idea comes to her after a crappy experience mopping (that sounds weird but it's true). She creates a new kind of mop and starts looking for ways to create her mops on a massive scale and sell them to people around the country. Easier said than done.I can't really complain about the talent in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence is a surprisingly good actress for her age and she always manages to impress. Joy is tough as nails but still has a soft side when it comes to her family. She's basically the family's boss although she's the third generation. It's great to see this young woman order everyone around and go out of her way to succeed. Robert De Niro plays Joy's father Rudy and does a much better job than I've come to expect from him. Don't get me wrong, De Niro's an excellent actor but I feel like he's been phoning it in for a few years now. He gives a great performance here though and he gives the film some much needed levity. Rudy seems to have his heart in the right place but his head is in the clouds most of the time. Everyone else does a great job but these are the two that stand out to me. No weak links as far as the acting goes though.The way the movie is filmed surprised me a little bit. The editing and the story itself is very fast paced which means that you need to pay attention or you're definitely going to miss something. It's not bad to be fast paced but it did surprise me for this kind of movie. The characters really help to make the story enjoyable because I honestly don't care about mops whatsoever. It is interesting to see what one young woman had to go through just to create, patent, and sell a single invention. It makes it all the more satisfying when she succeeds.I enjoyed the film but there are a few story elements that I could have probably done without. I think Russell agrees with me since many of these story elements were dropped thirty minutes into the film or were used so sparingly that I'm not really sure why they were there to begin with. First, Joy's grandmother starts out narrating the movie but there's very little narration throughout the film and I'm not sure why we need it. Spoilers ahead so be warned. The grandmother dies during the course of the story but she still continues to narrate everything. I guess she's talking to us from beyond the grave. Second, there are some very strange scenes at the beginning of the film showing characters from a soap opera that Joy's mother watches. Again, this didn't come off as necessary to me. It just felt awkward. Finally, I would have liked to have seen a little bit more explanation why Joy's sister hates her guts so much. We know she does but her reasons are pretty vague.The movie really is good but it felt awkward while I was watching it. Joy's story is encouraging and the characters are all interesting and feel very realistic but I could have used less screen time for the soap opera stuff and the narration feels completely out of place. I would still give it a recommendation if you want to see a decent story about a woman that has to put up with a lot of crap but it definitely won't be for everyone.</fullReview>

If you are a people person you will love it. It starts very funny and gets a bit less funny about half way through as many have said but that is necessary and worked for me. If you have an even slightly dysfunctional family you will get and love this film. If you understand people at all, you will get and like this film. If you are a sci-fi nerd, it may be too emotional for you. A very good film and a very pleasant surprise. My favourite by this Director so far. Fully recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic female empowerment tale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'JOY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new comedy-drama flick from writer/director David O. Russell, starring Jennifer Lawrence (it's their third time working together). The film also reunites Lawrence, and O. Russell, with actors Robert De Niro (for the third time) and Bradley Cooper (marking Lawrence and Cooper's forth pairing together, in a film, and O. Russell's third time working with Cooper). The movie tells the true story of Joy Mangano; a self-made millionaire, who started a business empire, selling her invention 'the Miracle Mop'. O. Russell directed and co-wrote the film, with Annie Mumolo; it also costars Edgar Ramirez, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Isabella Rossellini. I absolutely loved the movie; and found it to be yet another masterpiece, from David O. Russell (one of my favorite filmmakers). The story begins in 1992; when Joy Mangano (Lawrence) was already divorced, with two kids, and working for United Airlines. Her mother (Madsen), grandmother (Ladd) and ex-husband (Ramirez) were all living with her, and her kids, in Quogue, New York. Her father, Rudy (De Niro), moves back in with Joy; after breaking up with his second wife. Rudy then begins dating a rich Italian widower, named Trudy (Rossellini). While spending the day with Rudy and Trudy, on Trudy's boat, Joy breaks a wine glass. When she cleans up the broken glass, she comes up with the brilliant idea of a 'Miracle Mop'. Joy then becomes obsessed with following her dream; of becoming a successful businesswoman, by selling her new idea. The movie is classic David O. Russell; it's filled with crazy oddball characters, and extremely bizarre comedic situations (involving them). The film also has powerful, and very inspiring, dramatic moments. All of the performances in the film are impressive, but it's Lawrence who really powers the story (once again). The film is a classic female empowerment tale; Lawrence's 'Joy' character makes her dreams come true, almost entirely on her own, despite interference from multiple loved ones (and other complications) around her. It's another inspiring classic from David O. Russell, and Lawrence is a the top of her form!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/CoUgbXLzKSQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rather Small but Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy (2015) *** (out of 4)David O. Russell's latest tells the true story of a woman named Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), a single mother of two who is overwhelmed with the various obstacles in her light but she manages to create what will become known as the Miracle Mop. This film shows the struggle that the young woman had to go through to see her vision come true.The best thing you can do entering this movie is not to expect anything like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK or American HUSTLE. I think JOY is a pretty standard movie and I must admit that I was wondering why so many talented people would be involved in a story that would probably be better on television. I mean, the first thirty minutes I kept wondering what it was in this story that made the director and cast want to invest their time in the making of it but as the film went on it got much, much better and much warner to where you can see the heart that I'm sure attracted everyone.Again, JOY isn't a masterpiece, a great film or anything close to the previous movies from the director but if you stick with it I think it's a fun but small movie. The best thing the film has going for it is the fact that it tells a simple story about a simple woman who was capable of something big no matter how much of a beating she took. There's a certain heart captured in the film to where you can't help but root and cheer for this woman and feel downright heartbroken for her whenever things don't go her way. JOY really takes off once the creative side of the character begins and especially a scene where she has to go on live television to try and sell the mop.Lawrence, as no surprise, gives a very good performance as once again she's asked to show off a wide range of emotions and she perfectly captures all of them. She's certainly believable in the role and especially the single mother aspect and how she pretty much has to be the one constantly holding everything together. Bradley Cooper only appears in a few scenes but he's also very good as is Edgar Ramirez, Diane Ladd and Robert DeNiro in his role as the father. It was great getting to see Isabella Rossellini back in action as well as Virginia Madsen.As I said, JOY isn't any grand material and it really does seem like something that should have been on Lifetime. I'm not saying the film is bad but I think people have just come to expect more of Russell but I think that might be a tad bit unfair. This is a rather small movie so I can see why the director might just want to take a step back and try something different. JOY is certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting (most of the time)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get straight to it, then. Joy is an interesting film, and follows a brilliant central character, but unfortunately just isn't as compelling as you'd expect. I was impressed by Jennifer Lawrence's performance, and the biographical story held my attention from start to finish, but beyond that, there wasn't much in this film that really stood out.I'm sounding a little harsh there, but it's because I wasn't particularly struck by this film when I know its director can do better.However, there are definitely elements that were good here. Jennifer Lawrence puts in a very well-held performance to show how this woman developed over the course of her life, overcoming her initially difficult circumstances with her tough attitude to succeed in business. As a result, Joy is not only one of the most likable characters played by Jennifer Lawrence, but also a very interesting person, because she's not always nice and happy, she's imperfect, and that makes her the most interesting part of the film.In terms of the story, watching Joy develop is captivating, as is the story that revolves around her, although to a slightly lesser extent. I was interested in how she was having to find all these different avenues to promote her product, and the comedic elements occasionally (but not always) added some more enjoyability, but I still wasn't truly engrossed, because the story about her family, which is still a large proportion of the film, just doesn't grab your attention.The problem with that part of the story is that it tries to show off the chaos of her family life, but doesn't add any real drama to the plot. In comparison to David O. Russell's brilliant Silver Linings Playbook, which successfully showed off a dysfunctional family and created huge drama around that, the strained relations in this film come off as more annoying and often dreary, without being at all dramatic.As a result, there are large portions of this film that just aren't that compelling, and that hurt my overall impression of the film in the end. Joy is an interesting film in general, with a great central performance, but it's ultimately not the most impressive film you'll see this year, owing to its poorly balanced story that regularly left me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how this movie is getting knocked around as much as it is, especially given the fact that it's about 10 times better than "American Hustle," another David O. Russell movie with many of the same actors. The story is far more organized and the script far less sloppy than "Hustle." Jennifer Lawrence does another tremendous job here. Robert De Niro and Diane Ladd are great. It's an enjoyable and heartfelt story that features a strong female lead (which is rare enough to still feel novel) and is a perfect match for Russell's surrealist style in a way that "Hustle" never was.Is it an underdog movie? Sure, but it's not overly sentimental about it. Are there flaws? Absolutely. Russell still needs some sort of editor to rein him in, but the mistakes he makes here are far less egregious than the ones that turned "Hustle" into a movie that was 15-20 minutes too long on the front end and 20-30 minutes too long on the back end.Because of how much I was disappointed by "Hustle," I went into this movie braced to be disappointed again. Instead, I ended up being pleasantly surprised. It feels, to me, a little bit like a pile-on here. Watch the movie and judge it for yourself. But the way that people want to dog this film is just confusing to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joy is not a great movie. It even borderlines between good and bad. The main problem is the inconsistency in it and horrible tonal shifts. I feel like Jennifer Lawrence has done a good job but it's hard to buy that she's in her late 30s. A bit miscast. Robert De Niro was wasted and he could have been a so much better character to work on. Also, there are no stakes in the film. As soon as trouble comes, it is fixed 5 minutes later. That's not very good storytelling. But it has redeeming qualities. It somehow keeps you interested despite major flaws and gets better as it progresses. Some individuals saved the film from being worse than it is. In the end, it's probably David O. Russell to blame for the biggest flaws, which disappointed me because I think he can be great, but he's often playing too safe. The prime example is this film.In the end, I think it's worth watching, but it won't blow you away.</fullReview>

Suspense is well built, especially the scene where Joy gets a phone call and has to rush back to the house.

		<shortDescription>Solid cast, fascinating true story of a '70's entrepreneur--a splendid woman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story, Joy depicts the rise of the titular female inventor and entrepreneur, Jennifer Lawrence, who rose to fame by hawking her Miracle Mop on QVC. The story is much more than about business success, for Joy is a 1970's housewife who supports four generations in her house, including her ex-husband, Tony (Edgar Ramirez).One of the strengths is the sympathetic but realistic tale of more than one failure by a woman who has had enough of it early on in her life. That she is a woman is a card never played by director David O. Russell, who could have legitimately called on it in a time when Joan Rivers and a few other accomplished women were just beginning to break through the ceiling.Neal (Bradley Cooper), the producer of QVC, gives her the first break, but not because she's a beautiful, albeit untried inventor, but because she can sell him on her mop. Even with a businessman father, Joy has serious business setbacks that would have crushed a lesser human. But she is resilient and resistant to awkward attempts to direct her business by an unauthorized sister and his dad's wealthy girlfriend, among others.Although Russell has danced through several dramatic and comedic hits, most with Lawrence and Cooper, I can't remember his intruding the drama with awkward voice over narration by Joy's grandmother (Diane Ladd). The smooth-running film didn't need help from a voice, even if it projects into the future to explain Joy's success to come. Joy is a solid drama peppered with humor and a fine ensemble: De Niro is no stranger to playing a conflicted father with a big heart, and Ramirez does a good Bobby Cannavale from Venezuela.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many may watch "Joy" and say that it feels a little to happy and like a fairy tale, but before I watched I did my research and found out the film is based on the real life story of the "Miracle Mop" inventor Joy Mangano. And as with anyone who has success with business their climb to the top is filled with setbacks and headaches and this picture showcases those moments in Joy's life also. Directed by David O. Russell he again employs his cast favorites of Lawrence, De Niro, and Cooper still Russell tries his best to make a film about life and the ups and downs of it and how it spans thru the years. Well little miss it girl(Jennifer Lawrence)is Joy Mangano a lady who's a single mother facing tough times as her mom(Virginia Madsen)is a soap opera watching addict and on the side Joy helps take back in her father(Robert De Niro)and also she helps with his auto repair shop. So Joy has to have thoughts about a better life right you guessed it she wants to be an inventor and she has created a hands off "Miracle Mop" that absorbs and picks up a lot. Slowly but shortly this leads her to stardom when her exposure of the product goes on TV(remember QVC)in front of a big time network head(Bradley Cooper)and with a little luck and help from friends and family the sales of this mop product take off. And Joy becomes a matriarch of family business. Overall this film I didn't find great yet it does give hope showing that no matter how one does struggle in life miracles of success are possible even if it does absorb up in the form of a mop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lawrence is the only saving grace in an otherwise tepid affair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Joy" marks the third film that director David O. Russell and Jennifer Lawrence have joined forces, following on from 2012's brilliant "Silver Linings Playbook", and the less impressive "American Hustle" a year later. With this latest offering, O. Russell decides to explore the story of Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano and her rise from struggling Mother in onerous money problems to a business aficionado.O. Russell's strength usually lies in his writing but here it eludes him, making for a story that can never be fully realized. He seems to get caught in between two minds with what to tell and how to tell it. There's a lot of unnecessary scenarios and cheesy sub-plots wedged into the main narrative, which is essentially the film's downfall. In addition to that, the slew of characters we're presented with don't particularly add anything notable. O. Russell has always had a knack for creating memorable roles for his actors but the talented cast which include Robert DeNiro, Isabella Rossellini, Diane Ladd &amp; Bradley Cooper feel almost like filler parts, with none of them able to really make much of an impression. The film's most redeeming quality however is the star herself. Lawrence gives a lively and unwavering performance, doing just about enough to make us give a damn about Joy Mangano. But like her co-stars, the script stifles her from doing more with the character. Good work from Lawrence, but it's a missed opportunity because she could have been great.There's not much to write home about when it comes to "Joy". We've seen these tales of people in hardship striving to turn their life around told many a time. This film doesn't stand out in any way from the others due to the sloppiness of the screenplay, pacing issues and lack of care. Lawrence is the only saving grace in an otherwise tepid affair.</fullReview>

Creative editing, showcasing that movies are not bound by linear plot development.Russell knows this is heavy subject matter and blends unique film-making techniques to entertain and engage the audience.The battles of real life - family, personal, and business - are well depicted. The movie remembers its viewers and does not pass undue stress to them. Timely and creative scenes of wit remember the viewer.The catharsis Joy has from her dream was amazing - funny, emotional, timely. The stage was set for the rest of the film.There is no point going through life without purpose. We should put ourselves to fullest possible use because the price of living is so high due to our suffering and eventual physical death. "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied." Psalm 13:4"Delight in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart." Psalm 37:4Joy is an emotionally intelligent person and possesses abilities that are produced by heightened senses of self-awareness, self-management, and empathy. Therefore, she was better able equipped to obtain her goals. I was struck at how she mounted effective arguments by marshaling data and material from previous discussions to convince Neil to give her a shot. She turned his own words against him. Daniel Goleman would be proud.I hope the real Joy is happy, humble, fulfilled, and understands that the riches of this world are fleeting and that her heart is directed toward Heaven."Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

		<fullReview>After a successful run of 3 acclaimed films, David O. Russell makes another hit, barely. The first act of Joy wholeheartedly embraces the trademark roughness of Russell, however it does so a little too much. As a result the film feels disjointed and aimless. A fact that provides to be even more disappointing considering the stellar second and third acts that follow. Furthermore, the performances by Cooper and Lawrence (more so in the latter) are brilliant, as expected from a David O. Russell film. Most notably the two stars chemistry shines in the intro to the QVC TV station, a scene filled with so much energy and power that it feels like the scene is seconds away from exploding; an effect that places this scene as a favourite of 2015. Additionally, Joy joins the small group of films that have seamlessly integrated de-aging CGI onto actors (in this case DeNiro). Despite the entrancing second and third acts, the inclusion of the out-of-place grandmother narration and poorly structured first act holds Joy back from joining the league of "classic" David O. Russell films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I took quite a bit from this film and take more and more upon repeated viewings. I find it interesting that many other reviewers describe this as predictable (so was Titanic or any other true story), without comedy or drama, and full of characters and situations that no one cares about. I found the opposite to be true and thought the characters were intriguing and amusing. I was quite inspired by the tale of an underdog striving to win in the midst of overwhelming odds. No, it is nothing new but to me a story like this never gets old. I find lessons in this film upon paying attention to the family, most of whom were naysayers. In business and in life there are not many people you can count on and Tony proved to be a gem. It also emphasized the importance of looking out for yourself, understanding the devil is often in the details but sometimes you have to discover this by reading and seeing for yourself and making a phone call. I also appreciated the little trinkets she kept and the nod to them at the end. It made me think of the achievements in my life, how hard they were to attain, and how much they mean to me and taught me about who I am. I was able to glean all this by watching this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simplicity and rawness that made for an incredible piece of cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy was arguably one of the best films of 2015 due to a rawness and simplicity O. Russell poured into this piece of film. Jennifer lawrence, as always, delivered a passionate and committed performance where she fully embodied the character of Joy. The storyline, although not to complex, was uplifting and reflected the struggles of a hard working mother who wanted nothing more than to fulfil her potential. i would hugely recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of O. Russells previous works, such as The Silver Linings Playbook, or anyone who appreciates cinematography. i think Joy will be one of the leading runners in the 2016 Academy Awards, in particular for direction and Screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director David O. Russell continues his hot streak of great movies with his latest, "Joy" that takes the concepts of 'Believe In Yourself' and 'Never Give Up' out into the back yard, beat them down, half dead, till they can finally fight back. It's an emotional roller coaster ride that only Russell's go- to girl, Jennifer Lawrence can deliver and she did, and anybody who's ever had doubts about Lawrence as an actress will come to terms with her hard hitting abilities after watching "Joy."Co-starring David O. Russell's usual suspects like Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper, accompanied by other equally outstanding talents such as Edgar Ramirez, "Joy" is inspired by real life entrepreneur, Joy Mangano who went through difficult times to eventually become multi-millionaire through her miracle mop invention and her Ingenious Designs company. So I'm not sure how faithful "Joy" is to this true story because it's not an adaptation, it's original screenplay and I think David O. Russell injected much of his signature style, the family aspects and how certain family members can often hold you back.Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy who since she was a little girl has always been fascinated with creating and inventing, she has sharp imaginative mind, but it gets locked away for years after her parents divorce and her marriage crumbles. She finds herself being the center of the universe of these good- for-nothing penniless family members and ex-husband mooching off her. Struggling to raise her kid while keeping her head above water, she taps into her childhood wonder and focuses on an idea. But it's not an easy smooth- sailing journey because her family members, as always, get in the way, doubting her, telling her to be realistic and just forget about her dreams. Joy keeps pushing through the storm, working on getting the right people and getting the right investments to believe in her idea, anytime there's a glimmer of hope, something else often comes in and crushes it. But Joy keeps rising up again and again and again.Much of "Joy" reminds you of David O. Russell's "The Fighter," any moment I was just expecting Jennifer Lawrence to get in the ring and point to people around her and say, 'I'm the one fighting OK, not you, not you, and not you.' But in all seriousness, I think part of the appeal of stories like "The Fighter" and "Joy" which I'm sure captivated David O. Russell as well is the underdog achieving American dream despite discouraging voices around them, it's the same reason why we champion Rocky Balboa. And Jennifer Lawrence is so fierce and fearless in her performance, it really is a privilege to watch her do her thing, because her wide range of emotions are absolutely incredible and it's so effortless on her part. You feel for her character, Joy, every step of the way.I think "Joy" is a very important film that everybody and their grandmas should see, because it doesn't just show the hardship of entrepreneurial spirit, but it also goes to show that the road to having the life that we want is not easy. There are moments when you think Joy is finally going to catch a break, but something happens that pushes her down the stairs to rock bottom again. But it's all in the trajectory, Joy chooses to search inward for strength and keep looking up. Many of us can relate to this story, especially yours truly, I've lost count how many times people have told me that Rama's Screen isn't going to get me anywhere, that it's just a hobby, that I shouldn't give it a 100%, but I think you don't have to struggle through owning a business to understand where Joy is coming from. Yes, life happens, I've heard that excuse a thousand times, but it doesn't mean that you can't happen too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow unexpected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing in the pre-commentary warned me for this being a good film, especially not what it would involve. Or better yet would evolve into.I saw the trailers, as to many films I most of the times look at the trailers first some I watch afterwards. Well let me just say I thought I was going to watch something completely different when viewing this trailer. I thought it was going to be something like Bella Mafia (very bad film, in case you're wondering). But I meant the story line, it being a crime kind of film with Jennifer picking up the sword defending the family honour. I know this may all sound crazy but I forgot all the text ans stories written after I watched the trailer.Maybe I was under influence I don't know, it was a happy treat. It was Bob (a.k.a. Robert De Niro) being Bob I guess. It was youngster Jen, carrying this film to high altitude. Would I want to it again? Yes definitely! Because of Bradley Cooper (who's becoming more and more good at his job.)? No not for him.Great acting, good shooting, good directing, not all of it! Yes definitely a recommendation! No Spoiler, but just an alert to be careful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lawrence is a Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joy is written and directed by David O'Russel. It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Isabella Rossellini, Édgar Ramírez, Diane Ladd, and Virginia Madsen.Joy is the story of a family across four generations and the woman who rises to become founder and matriarch of a powerful family business dynasty.Rolling off that premise, the average reviews of renowned critics, and O'Russel's last entry, Accidental Love, I was skeptical towards this movie and its comedic approach to ts real life subjects. This is precisely why I'm happy to admit, I really enjoyed Joy.Though muddled and tonally deaf, the character of Joy is brought to life in full autonomy by the power of Lawrence's surprisingly devoted performance. Able to shift between moods almost instantaneously and proving her prowess in combating veterans like De Niro and out shining them, Lawrence was the best part of this movie and I predict an Oscar nod and possible win. Though She was magnificent the problem lied in the construction of her character.In the first, and by far the worst, act of this movie, Joy is introduced as a lovable, hardworking, overly sentimental, and beyond awkward girl. This doesn't compliment anyone in the cast for the fact that she isn't different or strange enough to stand out from her equally dull and clichéd family who have uninteresting confrontation and unbearably uneven Banter. This leads to a satire that becomes what it tries to satirize, that being a soap opera. With that said, Joy is also too strange to be relatable and too awkward to be endearing.The first act also suffers from over crowding and unflinchingly annoying characters, for example Trudi. A lot of the characters in act one are used as plot devices, which would work if they weren't developed upon more than the leads. This leads to a very confusing roaster of characters, most of which don't make it to act two.Moving past act one, this movie blossoms into something truly entertaining. O' Russel's unwieldy writing finally compliments Joy as she gained some confidence. No longer awkward or strange, Joy finally became a relatable hero that I wanted to root for. Moving past our main protagonist, the stakes were raised and the tension build, in this act leading to an improved sense of humor, a new found focus, and a palpable family drama. This act also produced one of my favorite characters, Neil Walker.Neil Walker, portrayed by Bradley Cooper, is the only other character that manages to distinguish himself from the lot. Cooper is brilliant in the role as he dawns this often times obnoxiously slick but never the less intriguing character.Act three keeps this new found focus and delivers a well crafted twist ending, that'll fox viewers who weren't wholly engrossed in the movie. By act three Lawrence more than proved her worthiness for another Oscar, by completely reinventing her character enough so everything evens out. Though I do praise act two and three and condemn act one, all three acts do get caught up in Oscar bait which did, somewhat, lessen the bite of the climax.Joy works as tremendous showcase of Jennifer Lawrence talent and as a moderately compelling, if a bit uneven, biography. Joy gets a B or a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite thankfully never quite feeling like Oscar bait, David O Russel's Joy feels like a movie that's trying just a fraction too hard to please. It doesn't fall over at any of the hurdles biopics usually do, but it manages to create a few problems of its - ones that could have been easily avoided with a slightly changed script.The films biggest asset is obvious - Jennifer Lawrence. She's lauded from nearly every corner for her passionate and committed performances and once again she gives a brilliant performance here, albeit one different from how it's portrayed in the trailers - this is not a huge, operatic performance like in Silver Linings Playbook. No, this is a much quieter performance, one that finds subtlety where another actor could have found histrionic fits. It's compelling stuff, and the best performance I think she's yet put to screen.Alas the film doesn't quite manage to frame this performance as well as it could have. The chief problem lies with the writing of the rest of her family - the bittersweet drama of family has been a central theme of David O. Russell's work since he first started making movies, but here it just feels a tad over the mark. Joy's family mostly seem like horrible people in this movie, and whether that's true to life or not it doesn't work in the context of this movie. The contrast between Joy and her family is too stark, and comes off false. More depth needed to be written into this supporting cast.The script otherwise is as witty and sparkling as the rest of Russel's work, and features some great performances outside of Lawrence. Dascha Polenka is proving to be an incredibly warm on screen presence, and despite their characters falling into the aforementioned trap of being slightly too nasty, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro are both reliably compelling and interesting. The final 45 minutes, too, are a big asset - they're the most entertaining portion of the movie, as the plot shifts into fifth gear and an air of desperation (and later, glorious triumph) sets in.Verdict? Not quite the sum of its parts, but very entertaining and an easy Oscar contender in many areas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More great characters with an inspiring story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't too sure what to expect going in to 'Joy'. I had absolutely loved David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook', but hadn't enjoyed 'American Hustle' at all. This film certainly seemed to be more along the lines of the former but I couldn't be absolutely certain. After the first 15-20 minutes I wasn't having much fun watching it and had almost written it off. Then things changed. The character establishment period was over and interesting plot points began to be set up. Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro began to steal scenes and then the always brilliant Bradley Cooper came into the equation. And suddenly a very fine film had begun to envelope. It's no secret that Russell is an expert in creating characters. His movies are filled with quirky individuals who are a lot of fun to get to know and a delight to share their story with. And what's the easiest way to bring your brilliant characters to life? Find the right actors/actresses to play them of course. So every year (Russell has become a lot more prolific in recent years) now we get a film with an almost identical cast. It's quite unique in a way, I can't think of another example of a filmmaker doing this, at least not in the modern age. And as long as the actors continue to get Oscar nominations out of his films and his films themselves also continue to be nominated I can see no reason why either party would or should ever pull out of this little arrangement.I mentioned earlier I wasn't sure which of Russell's two previous films I'd seen it was going to be most like. It certainly was most like 'Silver Linings Playbook', but it would have to be said it really is its own type of film. 'SLP' was a love story, 'AH' was a crime/drama and this was really a biography first and foremost I'd have to say. Lawrence really was superb in the lead role. Watching her act is almost like getting a massage, you just sit back, relax and let her work her magic. De Niro and Cooper were equally fine in their supporting roles and every one else involved was very competent. It seems to me this film has been marketed in a strange fashion that may turn a few people off but I hope it doesn't because there's a very fine film here that deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A desperate housewife gets bored of her mediocre life and decides to do something about it by creating the best mop ever and starting a business. I found that a lot of people don't like this film, and I don't really get why. I think it was another great movie in the Russel/Lawrence/Cooper series, or whatever you want to call it. It is not without its flaws, but all around it's a great movie with some stellar performances from the whole cast, and I think that is what drives the movie. I watched this film with my sister, and we both liked it; it was fun and strong. It might not have had the biggest and most extravagant of shots, but it fitted the movie. I liked this movie and recommend it if you are a fan of Russel or just want to watch a fun but strong movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joy is the type of movie we need more of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review has a few spoilers.David O Russell and Jennifer Lawrence have done it again, with Bradley Cooper coming in at the midpoint.Though I feel this time they might not get the Oscar, I feel they deserve it more for JOY than for any other film they've done as a team so far.This is a rags to riches story, but it is RAW. You watch the main character shatter to pieces, with her own family holding the clubs.While some of the dialogue is a bit too on-the-nose, especially near the end, the script was wonderfully done.The director knew how to linger on a shot just enough to convey what was needed, even if words weren't used.While judging anybody's acting ability has hardly been a great skill of mine, from what I can tell the acting was superb. Anyone who has ever wanted more out of their lives so far - they will become Joy for the duration of the movie.I wrote a blog post of business lessons learned from this, which you can read at www.authordavid.com but they contained far too many spoilers to justify including here.If you've already seen star wars (or don't care) and you want something real and relatable for your creative, inventive spirit, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hiccups in style and pacing can't bring down Jennifer Lawrence's strong performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As told by her grandmother (Diane Ladd), young Joy's story begins at Rudy's Bus and Truck metal shop, where the naturally creative girl entertains herself through paper models of forests and castles. She envisions a world of wonderment and special powers that transcend the mundanity of life in a small town, further helped by her grandmother's regular words of encouragement. But as she grows up, Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) realizes that she's fallen into maddening routines and hopeless mediocrity amidst a complicated circus of familial failures. Not only has she not achieved greatness, but she's also stuck in a dead end job in a dead end life.Joy's mother (Virginia Madsen) acts like an invalid, spending all of her time in bed watching soap operas; her half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm) holds her in generally low regards, often making condescending remarks; and Joy's ex-husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) lives in the basement - an uncomfortable arrangement, but one that allows him to help with their two children. And then her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) is dropped off by his current fling, to be similarly relegated to the basement as yet another overcrowding addition to Joy's chaotic household. At times, Joy's exasperation causes her outlook on real life to merge with the outrageous scenarios of the soap operas continuously playing on her mother's television set. But when Rudy's new girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) provides the funds for Joy to manufacture and sell an invention ? a self-wringing mop ? Joy is enlivened once again with the hope of breaking free from the monotony and becoming the powerful matriarch her grandmother always knew she could be.In this initially light, quirkily frantic, peppy, fast-paced comedy, it would seem that a little adversity can't stop Joy from realizing fame and fortune. But this slice-of-life picture soon becomes a whirlwind of uphill battles and stupefying skullduggery, where businessmen are inherently evil and family members are hopelessly incompetent allies. In its scrutiny of manufacturing and marketing and commerce among cutthroat professionals, "Joy" takes its fragile, human characters and shakes them to their cores. But it knows how to manifest feel-good, inspirational moments too, imparting a zing and a sleekness to the overbearing nature of Joy's discouraging collaborators (who should be part of her support system) and humiliating confrontations with lawyer-encircled fraudsters.Joy's true-to-life story (based on the real Joy Mangano, inventor of the Miracle Mop) is given director David O. Russell's trademark eccentricities, full of editing gimmicks (like messing with the timeline); speedy conversations full of naturalistic hysteria; and relatable melodrama in ordinary settings, surrounded by opinionated family members who exhibit plenty of aggravating personality flaws. And yet, with all the editing techniques that Russell surely feels will elevate "Joy" to be something more artistic than a mere heartening tale of unlikely success, it's those very additives that nearly detrimentally becloud the brilliance of the hugely likable protagonist. But hiccups in style and pacing can't bring down this strong female lead, brought to stimulating life by Lawrence's easygoing, levelheaded acting and joyous embodiment of unwavering determination in the face of crippling economic ? and psychological ? hardships.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David O. Russell reunites for the third time with his cast to die for and manages to keep us hungry for more as the action takes unpredictable turns following Joy's journey to success. Jennifer Lawrence, Russell's incredibly talented muse, is portraying real life Joy Mangano, the 23 year old woman who invented the Miracle Mop.It took a long and bumpy road to become a hit and the movie covers this aspect wonderfully with entertaining theatrical cues,good visuals and a cool soundtrack. The story is compelling, full of female determination, family issues, business betrayal and mischief-makers. Lawrence proves to us one more time why she is one of the best actresses we have as her energy and strength keeps us at the edge of our seats.

		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying this is not David O. Russell's strongest film. What made American Hustle, Silver Linging's Playbook, and The Fighter tour de forces were the complexities of every character. Joy's main (and quite frankly only) focus is on Jennifer Lawrence's character. In that sense, it is superb. The other characters aren't flushed out very well. However, that doesn't mean this movie isn't satisfying. The story is just fascinating and intriguing, I was honestly surprised how at the edge of my seat I was at times. The soundtrack is exquisite (as always with his films). The distinct editing style of David O. Russell films is there (which I personally adore very much). And though the supporting cast is never as compelling as most David O. Russell films, they do add the thrive of the main character's goals. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>
