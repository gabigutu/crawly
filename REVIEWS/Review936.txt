		<shortDescription>A masterpiece! Spiritually uplifting. Touches the heart and soul deeply.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is perplexing to read a few comments below that rubbish this film. To me, and to so many others, it is unequaled in it's beauty, sensitivity and deep spiritual perception into this amazing world that we inhabit.Really, I think if anyone watches this film and cannot feel uplifted to the heavens, then they must be spiritually deadened by cynicism and negativity.Even without DVD and the big screen, we have enjoyed repeated viewing of this EXCEPTIONAL film. I first saw it in Sydney, in Panavision's huge screen, and was totally blown away by the cinematography as well as the profoundly moving music. But even on VHS here at home, it touches me ever so deeply.10 out of 10. An incredible experience!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sensual and Spiritual Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baraka is an ancient Sufi word, translated as a blessing or as the essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds. With the theme of man's diversity and his impact upon the environment, Baraka is a documentary photographed on six continents in 24 countries including Tanzania, China, Brazil, Japan, Nepal, the U.S. and Europe. It has no story and no dialogue, yet transcends geography and language to provide a sensual and spiritual experience that enables the viewer to look at the world in a totally different way.When the film opens, a lone snow monkey sits in the middle of a hot spring, biding its time. The expression on its face is one of deep reflection and weariness. When it looks up at the stars, then closes its eyes, shutting itself off from its surroundings, I sensed my own inner longing for the infinite. As the film progresses, we see the edge of a volcano in Hawaii, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, the Ryoan-Ji temple in Kyoto, Lake Natron in Tanzania, and the fire plains of Kuwait, their oil fires burning after the 1991 Gulf War. Through Fricke's camera, we glimpse various forms of religious expression from the chanting of monks to tribal celebrations in Africa and Brazil. Baraka is almost like an updated version of Godfrey Reggio's 1983 film, Koyaanisqatsi. Using speeded-up images of hectic big city life with its homelessness and deprivation, interspersed with mountain vistas and forests, it depicts the mechanical nature of modern life as contrasted with the beauty of the natural world. This film allowed me to see things I never knew existed, and to glimpse patterns of interconnectedness and a sense of balance and proportion in the world I was barely aware of. I was moved to simply look into people's faces and have them look back at me, allowing me to connect with the universality of the human spirit. Fricke has said that Baraka was intended to be "a journey of rediscovery that plunges into nature, into history, into the human spirit and finally into the realm of the infinite." Unique in its beauty, sensitivity, and perception, Baraka succeeded, in the course of 90 minutes, in moving me from the humdrum of everyday reality to a calmer and more spiritual space</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true GAIA experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first experienced (that's the most striking word for it) this movie at the Gothenburg Film Festival 1994, I was truly amazed. Never before - or since - have I had such an over all explain-it-all feeling after a show.Ron Fricke has made a documentary about the World today for a day: starting at dawn with monkeys in hot springs in Japan, and the morning rituals of various religions. This is followed by the awakening of the human race, both in the big cities and on the country side. Brilliantly edited together follows every aspect of human daily life combined with the general changes of the planet itself and all the ecological systems upon it.The over all glue of the story are the various religious rituals. Maybe this is my personal interpretation, being a teacher of Religion, but the only time giver, except for the turning of the sun, are the praying times and times of worship peoples practice around the globe.My comparison of the film to the GAIA idea (that the Earth as a whole being a unit, a living organism) is detectable both in the way every different cultures shown are found to be very similar to one another, as well as the speeded up people at side walks and zebra crossings look very much like the stream of blood in the veins of an organism.All in all this is a marvellous movie pointing out both the uniqueness of the individual and the unity with all people. Go see it - now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To do describe this work of art simply as a "movie" would be inaccurate and unjustified. More akin to a tone poem Baraka is.Is this what the world would look like to a god, a being who experiences time differently than we do? While Koyaanisqatsi effectively drilled its message, "Humans are destroying the planet!", into our hypnotized minds, Baraka lets you ponder and meditate its multiple meanings. Are humans just another part of the ecosystem, behaving as any other organism would with our capabilities? Or are we different, even alien, to this world?10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone of revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Baraka' is a work of art which rates amongst the greatest achievements in the field. As with any masterwork, it is something one will have to pursue. For those that seek it out at the proper time, 'Baraka' can act as a milestone of revelation. What the viewer takes from this film will solely be determined by the life experience they bring to it. 'Baraka' is unique in that it actually requires a commitment of time and concentration. This is a film that communicates its message without utilizing standard film language. Those that try to make the images conform to the conventional notions of Hollywood story telling are likely to give up in frustration. For a film with no plot,characters or dialog, it communicates an astonishing number of profound themes. Those who are familiar with National Geographic or the works of David Attenbourough will have little trouble in identifying the fascinating locals and tribes, but be forewarned: there are reasons that there are no subtitles or text on screen. Personal discovery is at the heart of the filmmaker's intentions. The ambient soundtrack by Michael Sterns weaves the images together on a separate plain, producing a hypnotic pathway for the images to flow. Once you allow yourself to be pulled along by this current of sound the images will link themselves together and the true revelations hidden within 'Baraka' will make themselves apparent. You may find as I did that your subconscious will be at work on 'Baraka' for many weeks after the experience, unlocking doors to a greater understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PERFECTION! ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few movies can actually be truly inspirational. A lot of movies make you feel good while watching it. This is different. This movie can breathe life back into your soul. It will brighten your outlook. It will make you think and keep you thinking long after the movie has ended. And even the most bitter of cynics (like me) cannot deny it's beauty. It will always remain one of my favorites. I cannot make it my favorite movie since it is so powerful and different I don't consider it a movie but an experience. It requires just a smidge of patience to suck you into it. But once it does you cannot avert your eyes. The most spectacular images ever. Not an ounce of pretention to it. No hollwood bull. Brilliant. Moving music. Do not miss this!!!! If you have a DVD buy this one. Watching it on a small screen will severely cut it's impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This for me is the film for a desert Island...you know?...If you could only take, one book, one wine, one loaf of bread, one piece of music? One Lover, Well, this would be my one movie....This film in my opinion is so extraordinary that it needs as special 11 or 12 category, just as J.S. Bach, and Dickens, and Shakespeare would need such a category. This film is spellbinding and can be viewed and understood on many levels. I do not personally see or feel the "Environmental" message from this film that many do....or at least to me it is only one of many sub- texts....I do see an oil painting placed directly on my soul, or rather etched there by the sinews of this film, as a comment on man, all of his glory and wisdom, and all of his failings as well....that and so much more. For me this is the greatest film of all times. Nothing else even comes close...I could go on but I won't....to what end....if you have seen it and you wish to discuss it. write to me, I would be happy to hear from you on this wonderful film..</fullReview>

I saw this movie on the big screen for the first time (and this is a movie where it truly makes a difference to see it on the big screen). My friend and I got out of the movie and said, "Can you believe what we just saw?"I think it is one of the most beautiful movies that I've ever seen. One can argue whether the point that the director was trying to make was made or even needs to be made. I don't know. I just know that at the end of the movie, I was overwhelmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(1) A copy of Baraka. Steal it if you have to. (2) The biggest, clearest TV you can find and 5.1 surround. (3) A fabulously-rolled spleefer as long as your arm. (4) Phones off the hook, and an empty house with the lights out. (5) A recliner with a seat belt. (6) 96 minutes of your time.I am 30 year old factory worker who loves NASCAR and Hockey and own 3 carbureted cars - 1 parked in my backyard that hasn't ran in 2 years AND I could probably pass for the guy who might spit as I offer you confusing directions if you stopped to ask, but I have never seen anything anywhere remotely close to this masterpiece. It's so good that it runs through my head while I'm slugging away at work covered in factory germs. The Burgan oil fires (the fire we possess) to the Australian steel workers (our ongoing need to keep the fire going) to the Auschwitz gas ovens (what we choose to do with it) is pure cinematic genius. For me, the Whirling Dervishes forward is my favorite scene. Where it slides from the mosque in Mecca to the cathedral ceiling at the Vatican is absolutely mind-bending. I feel like crying every time I watch it, yet I'm not all that religious.Aside from all this film brings with it, it's not for everyone, and I can understand that. I was 17 when it came out and probably could have cared less. But for a blue-collar hick in need of a shave like me, I'd take this movie to prison if I was allowed.When you see it for the first time, don't ask questions. Turn the volume up as loud as you can and just watch it. Baraka will provide you with everything you need. 10 thumbs out of 10, and not just up, but way up. Can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More beautiful; less meaningful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is natural to compare Baraka with Koyaanisqatsi. The two films are similarly structured, both sans dialog, both a collage of video images set to nontraditional music.Baraka is without a doubt the more visually beautiful of the two. Many of the images here are, almost literally, poetry in motion; others are among the most awe-inspiring I've seen anywhere.On the other hand, the complaints of some of the other reviewers about the editing are not without foundation. Whereas initially the central themes seem to be the wonders of the natural world and the various manners of worship of societies around the world, we are somewhat surprised to find segments showing an egg production facility, Taiwanese prostitutes, and scavengers at a Calcutta landfill. We are left wondering about relevance, and suspect that the editor unwisely indulged an urge to make a quick and none-too-subtle political point.Equally importantly, the images in Baraka often depict quite exceptional scenes or places--the gas chambers at Auschwitz, say, or the pilgrims at Mecca, or various other religious monuments. Thus Baraka more or less forfeits any claim to be about "ordinary life" or somesuch.Koyaanisqatsi, on the other hand, hewed to ordinary images from more-or-less ordinary life pretty much from beginning to end; one exception may have been the dynamiting of a housing project, and of course there is the final image of the rocket disintegrating. But for nearly its entire length it stuck to a central theme, contrasting man's world with the natural world. Thus it carries meaning precisely by virtue of its rather more ordinary (but nonetheless often quite beautiful) images, whereas Baraka seems to have largely forsaken deeper meaning in the pursuit of stunning visuals.So there you have it. Both are very valuable works, but in rather different ways. Baraka is not entirely bereft of meaning, of course, but what meaning there is derives from the individual images, and not from the film as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In theory, I'm the target demographic for this. I'm content to simply encounter fine photography; I have a deep curiosity of indigenous cultures ? meaning in my case the original culture before being reinvented for tourists.And yes, I share a concern about big companies and the blindnesses they elide. Plus, I value anything Carroll Ballard does. Fine man. I think this was targeted at people like me, people who think "Koyaanisqatsi" was febrile. It just conflates respect and understanding with a lowbrow stoned mysticism. People like me, who are penetrated by the natural parts of "Hearts of Glass," the ending of "In the Mood for Love," and Terence Malick's magical notions of vision.This doesn't have Phil Glass's ponderous music, and that's in its favor. I don't think Reggio understood Glass's music: its post-postmodern industrial music. Every phrase contradicts every vision in the film. That's been replaced here by insipid but appropriate space music. Also, this time around, we have more of a narrative: nature (good), indigenous religion (good), civilization (bad), religion resolved in civilization (good, but not as good, rather bittersweet).Photographing natives for Westerners is a tricky business. The best I know is "Legong" which succeeds mainly because it was a labor of love. Despite its colonial context, it was respectful. Probably the worst is "Himalaya - l'enfance d'un chef," a much better movie but it turns the native people into a sweet consumable for Western eyes, a confection to enjoy but not comprehend.Native people are not intrinsically wonderful. They are as evil and ecologically inept as we. The magic is in the difference, not the being itself. Romanticizing something as is done here, does a great disservice because what we see has nothing to do with what or who they are, and everything to do with excuses we make to ourselves in order to exist.Friends, when you watch these "natural" people, take a moment to consider that everything you see is posed. Every scene was prefaced by the director arranging and prodding and placing them and us just so.Consider that every photo you see here of nature is perfectly framed to be wholly contained in the boundaries of the screen: Nature isn't like that, its an infinite flow. What we have here are the motivational posters neatly snipped from nature and bounded. These are sound bites and as a result are every bit as repulsive as political utterances from the "other side."One scene is a ritual ceremony of lovely native women undulating. Its truly wonderful cinema. No mention of the ritual itself: celebrating the scarring closed of pudendal lips after circumcision. There's a nice scene of an Australian marking his face with color. It says a lot that the color is acrylic and the instrument he is using is a plastic comb.Really, the world deserves better, and so do we. Stay away. Though pretty, this is exploitive stuff, closer to the "Mondo" films than Rimpoche.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot but lacking coherence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most impressive part of Baraka is the beautiful photography. Almost every shot is made with such devotion. Some scenes are very overwhelming. But what I miss in this movie is coherence. Fricke tries to show too many things, too many different cultures, religions, a bit of bio industry, a bit of burning oil fields, a bit koyaanisqatsi etc. It's not fully clear what he's trying to say, let alone that he confronts with a strong opinion. That already shows in the way the beginning is edited, shots aren't fully finished before they cut to the next shot, it almost feels (ironically enough) like he's got too little time to show everything he wants to.It's interesting that Ron Fricke was director of photography of Koyaanisqatsi which was released about 9 years earlier. Koyaanisqatsi (same IMDB user rating!) does have that coherence, that strong opinion which you can't get around while watching it. All means, style, music editing etc. are used to serve this one purpose: to let the spectator experience this overpopulated, overstressed world.In my opinion, Fricke should have focused on less different subjects and connect them by a much stronger and clearer message. That would have turned Baraka into a master piece. (I wonder why I see so many people on the credits who worked on Koyanisqatsi too, except for one person: Godfrey Reggio, the director. Does that have to do with clashing opinions on this kind of movies, which may explain the difference between these two movies?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've noticed quite a few people are sick and tired of the message this film was allegedly trying to hammer home. you folks need to relax. it's nothing more than a collage of images showing an extremely broad range of subjects. i personally thought it was extremely well made and i did think it was visually stunning and the music was also excellent. so it included kids picking through landfills. so what? it's something that goes on in our world and the director wisely chose to include it. i never got the impression that someone was trying to tell me that technology is responsible. it showed busy city streets, and it also showed serene mountain and jungle environments. was it trying to convince me one should be chosen over the other? i didn't think it was. it was doing what the film's creators were trying to do.... show various aspects of life. different going on's in our world. what was the point of showing jews at worship in jerusalem? what was the point of showing monks going about their daily lives? how about the funeral pyre in india (i'm assuming that was india)? people walking down sidewalks? was the director trying to tell anyone "technology bad!". none of these subjects have anything to do with technology. if you got the "technology bad!" message, then you're probably a little hypersensitive and are trying to defend yourself against accusations that haven't been made (at least not by this film). reading way too much into a collection of predominantly neutral and stunning images from around the world.the sheen</fullReview>

With lots of slow pans which dwell on the mystery and beauty of exotic cultures and countries and a 96 minute run there's not sufficient time to do the planet justice.

		<fullReview>This is a moving film, with beautiful photography. I could not recommend it highly enough! I think many of the critics on this site have missed the point of what Baraka has to say. Yes, we know about modern medicine, and electricity, and what the Romans have done for us. Baraka isn't some Luddite, back-to-nature manifesto. It is simply an emotional connection with some of the more remarkable features of Earth and humanity in the late 20th Century. Some of it is beautiful, some of it is sad, some of it is awesome, some of it is messed up. If we had to send a documentary about our planet to an alien race, without the use of language, Baraka would be perfect. This film will not stroke your ego or give you some action adventure hero to identify with. What it will give you, if you have any sense of wonder left in your cynical 21st century head, is a spellbinding, spine-tingling, goosebumpy look at your own world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would suggest watching a directors version with commentary, which would hopefully provide some context to the film. While the images are beautiful and powerful/moving, I felt that something was missing. There are over-arching themes to the film (poverty, suffering, the beauty of nature), so it is not a completely arbitrary montage of pretty pictures, however I felt I was uanble to properly process/understand and appreciate many of the images because of their lack of context or any explanation.I also wondered that in showing us the diversity of human experience the film mainly concentrated on the "exotic" images of Africa and Asia. It was as if European &amp; Caucasian was considered the "norm" and everyone else was "exotic"/"unusual". It would've been nice to show that beauty and suffering are truly universal - not just in these "exotic" locations. It seemed to contradict what I felt the film was trying to promote (that we need to remember to hold a more global view of the world instead of only focusing on ourselves.) Instead it felt like a little like a priveleged person trying to pretend they are an objective observer without acknowledging that they are also member of the same group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but not as satisfying as "Koyaanisqatsi"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally caught up with the film some 13 years after it was made at the recently concluded Dubai International Film Festival. To my regret I missed meeting the director Ron Fricke.Ron Fricke had played a very important part in the film "Koyaanisqatsi" one of my favorite films. He was the lens-man and co-writer. "Koyaanisqatsi" was aided by two other brilliant minds--the director Godfrey Reggio and minimalist musician Philip Glass."Baraka" or the essence of life did not have inputs of Reggio or Glass. On the other hand Fricke had better equipment (65 mm/70 mm cameras, polymorphic lenses and 10 years of added experience post-"Koyaanisqatsi") for making "Baraka" than in the path-breaking Reggio film. The superb early scenes of the mountain primates apart, "Baraka" provides entertainment and viewer satisfaction that is simply overshadowed by the philosophical and structural brilliance of the Reggio trilogy. I wonder why Reggio did not use Fricke in the last two works in the trilogy.Fricke's eye for visuals is commendable. But "Baraka" misses the spirituality of Reggio, it merely strives to copy Reggio's work. Probably Reggio's years of solitude and prayer as he prepared to be a monk gave him the philosophical edge over Fricke's obvious craftsmanship. While I am not devaluing the obvious merits of "Baraka" I really wish Fricke, Reggio and glass team up again to make another film to relive the magic of "Koyaanisqatsi".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I not seen Koyaanisqatsi previously (although one does not just "see" such a movie) I may have thought more highly of Baraka. However, after about half an hour I found myself mentally ticking off what scenes had not been shown (eg the military vehicles lined up, the comparison of people to chickens/sausages and so forth). In the end I decided to watch the rest of it because I had set aside a couple of hours to do so and couldn't be bothered doing anything else.Whether one likes Philip Glass or not (I happen to like SOME of his work), nevertheless his music gave an overall unity of emotion that did not appear in Baraka. Perhaps 4 out of 10, and that for the excellent cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently re-viewed this film and still believe that the message is needed. While I have heard detractors say that the message in this film of environmentalism and social justice is "simple-minded" and that they have, as film critics, achieved a level at which they are above these types of things, obviously we as humans are nowhere near being beyond this level. As you grow older perhaps films such as these become again sophisticated, especially if you are in the sciences or social sciences and admit in the end that you don't have all the answers to the age-old questions posed silently by this film: processes of creation and destruction. It is now 2004 and we are no closer to understanding the implications of environmental and human destruction shown on this film as we were when it was first released. Film critics who are tired of this type of message perhaps need a few more years of research and living to again appreciate simplicity.</fullReview>

I was able to identify some of the places in the film, but there was no narration or subtitles to provide information and/or context on what we were seeing. It was like watching a whole series of nothing but establishing shots - the kind you get in a regular narrative film that helps to introduce the viewer to the characters and the story. Unfortunately, there was no story in "Baraka" and no characters, either, unless you count all the people who stare expressionlessly and motionlessly into Jon Fricke's 70 MM camera. We get speeded-up time-lapse photography of hectic big city life with its sweatshops and homelessness and squalor, juxtaposed with scenic vistas of nature's wonders, with mountain ranges, lakes and imposing ancient ruins - images that seem to imply the following simplistic message: "modern civilization - bad"; "primitive societies and lands untouched by modern man" - good. After awhile, tedium sets in. The widescreen DVD looked great, but I found myself enjoying the short behind-the-scenes documentary more than the feature. It detailed a little about the difficulty of filming in so many different locations and it was a relief to see something that puts you into contact with real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>_Baraka_ is a foolish rehash of _Koyaanisqatsi_ with a dull, neutral, worldbeat soundtrack and emotionally manipulative images of man's abuse of the environment. Because its politics are so obvious, the film moves away from the graceful art with which _Koyaanisqatsi_ conveyed the same message and into tiresome, preachy hyperbole. What's more, the images presented of other cultures are exploitative since they make no attempt to explain their meaning or significance to the Western audiences for whom the film is so clearly intended. Without imparting knowledge or real understanding of other cultures on our planet, the experience of world culture that _Baraka_ provides is little more than a taste of exoticism--the world as a Disney amusement park--which we can forget about easily as we listen to our top 40 hits during out next workout at Bally's. I am so negative because I cannot _believe_ the self-righteous and self-congratulatory tone of all of the other reviews!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glorified roll of stock footage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one can even call this pompous indulgence of the wet dreams of a cinematographer a "movie," it's not a very good one. With all due respect to Ron Fricke, a master of camera-work (and absolute god of time-lapse photography), his film would be greatly improved by the presence of an actual director. Every shot in the film is fabulously composed, perfectly executed, and left to mold on the screen until every bit of life is drained from it. That part of the audience which manages to stay awake is rewarded with nothing but more endless tedium, as Fricke drills his environmentalist message into our heads with all the subtlety and grace of a jackhammer outside an apartment window.Particularly offensive is Fricke's conceit (the natural one of a cinematographer) that this material can be presented absolutely objectively, without any consideration of context or (God forbid!) perspective. The viewer thus must either shut down his or her mind and nod dumbly along with the grating score, or face 90 minutes of utter revulsion - as happened in my case. Recommended only for the particularly agreeable, the insomniac, or the time-lapse photography enthusiast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are We All Slaves To The Rhythm Of Life?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are at all familiar with the 1983 film Koyaanisqatsi, then you'll be sure to find that Baraka (whose title translates into "essence of life") runs along similar lines of having no actors, no dialogue, just a constant procession of very vivid images that all (even in a roundabout way) relate to specific, recurring themes. (This time around one of Baraka's main themes is that of various world religions) After calmly sitting through Baraka's 95 minutes of startling camera-work, striking images (from 23 countries), and meditative, ambiance music, I am now quite convinced that this world we live in is, indeed, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad.And, sure enough, religion (this includes all sects) is, in one way or another, the very thing that is at the root of all this mass madness. If you ask me, the only unity and "oneness" that religion creates is that of the profoundly insane.Anyways - I found it somewhat unfortunate that out of the 23 countries visited in this DVD, Canada was one of the nations that was noticeably excluded from said production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had not heard of this movie until recently. It looks awesome on Bluray.Let's get it out of the way, this is beautifully shot, it's very interesting, and the music is good too.However, please, we should all (including the film makers) stop pretending that this represents human life. In real life, no matter where in the planet, things don't happen in slow motion, with "world beat" music in the background, and in optimal lighting. Same goes for the time lapse stuff. And don't get met started on the film maker's own admission (in the bonus features) that they staged some of the scenes. You can film many things in every day life, using the techniques of this film, and give an audience a completely different point of view than this film does. And if you don't think this film is trying to promote a particular point of view, then you really shouldn't vote or reproduce. Look at what the movie shows. They cut from crowds of humans in a large city, going through their daily routines, to crowds of baby chicks being sorted. You really don't think they are trying to tell you something and influence you?!?! Or when they cut from an aerial shot of a massive field crammed with US war planes to a Jewish soldier holding a rifle at the wailing wall and then to the burning fields of Kuwait, you really don't think there's a meaning in there? You think that order is a coincidence? Hmm, why is it that the footage of the native people is shown in slow motion, with beautiful harmonies in the background, yet the scenes in the cities are sped up and accompanied by frantic drums? If this film is supposed to be a representation of human life, why not show both at regular speed? Because if would be boring and not make any money for the film makers, who pretend to only be in it for the art.This movie is beautiful to watch and shows cultures from around the world doing interesting things. But don't forget, it's footage from selected cultures, in selected countries, put together in a selected order, with music meant to manipulate your emotions as you watch. Don't take it too seriously, real life is quite different from this, that's what makes the movie fascinating.</fullReview>

The masterful imagery and sound of the film is easily a more profound statement then many films could ever dare to convey. Perhaps the film's purity is both a triumph and downfall, but I prefer to think of it solely as a triumph. If it happens to come your way, sit down, stay still, and watch this film from beginning to end- you won't regret it!Viewers and filmmakers of the future will be hard pressed to witness this point in human reality again, so you need to watch it before half the earth ends up looking like the waste dumps of Calcutta some day.</fullReview>

The seminar was only for freshmen (there were like 13 of us) and it was run by 2 seniors who are Comparative Religion majors. Anyway, the experience of watching this film was amazing!!! i felt like each image was very interesting and thought-provoking. i think you have to be in that kind of mood though, because it is by no means an "entertaining, action-packed film" it's very unusual and everyone can get something completely different from it. either way, i think it is an amazing project and i would recommend it to anyone who wants something different. i am also interested to experience it while high, as i'm sure that would make it a completely different experience as well.

		<fullReview>The fact that this film was made at all is a feat in itself. To put together the financing to lug a 70mm camera and motion control equipment to 24 countries is an amazing accomplishment - even more awe inspiring when you actually view the film. Let me start by saying that I am not a religious person, I do not belong to any faith; but I am spiritual in the sense that I believe in a universal force and global connectiveness.On average, I try to see this film once a year. Over the course of a year, I find that I meet new friends where we have a connection intellectually, spiritually or philosophically. It is these new friends that I invite over for an evening of conversation, dinner and then a viewing of Baraka. The people I invite to see the film are those in my life that I feel would take something from the film. Don't get me wrong, I think that everyone should see this film - I mean that some people are not ready to see it.It is always interesting to see how the course of discussion changes after the viewing of the film and the impact it makes on the group. I've probably seen Baraka 6 or more times, but in yearly increments. Everytime I see it, I identify with some new layer of it - depending on my own head space. It is always refreshing to revisit.This film is the media equivalent of a mountain in a landscape of anthills. For once, the pause to reflect is revered over the A.D.D.- inducing, machine-gun editing of modern media. Society as a whole could learn so much if observation was more important than consumption. If we had to hand a film over to a visiting alien race to put life on earth in a nutshell, this would be the one. Thank-you, Mr. Fricke for doing it so damn well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When, atop snow-dusted mountain, you countenance the day's burning embers unfurling like crimson ribbons beneath a churning sky-scape of blushing clouds, doesn't it just make you want to... buy a car with optional four-wheel steering and an eight-speed automatic transmission? Advertising has co-opted just about everything for its evil schemes, especially the noblest and most sacred works of the creator. In fact, as suggested in Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi, the natural world may now exist purely to support its all-encompassing technological counterpart.So it's entirely appropriate that Koyaanisqatsi DP Ron Fricke's time-lapse cinematography should have wound up having such a major impact and influence on the world of commercials (particularly gas-guzzling car adverts) and multimedia corporate presentations. Things always look better when the clouds are soaring overhead like Frisbees.Fricke's own chill-out classic Baraka shares its antecedent's time-lapse techniques and literally unspoken remit, though drops all pretence of coolly dispassionate neutrality to unreservedly endorse the spiritual, while simultaneously showing planet-wrecking industrialism the door via a roving montage of geopolitical images; a 'National Geographic'-style Rolodex of exceedingly pretty pictures through which the viewer is invited - or forcibly steered, through musical cues and pointed juxtapositions - to join the dots, appreciate the oneness of all things and draw sage conclusions about the state of the planet.Unsurprisingly, these are of the 'factories = bad' and 'primitive tribes people = good' variety. In the style of Koyaanisqatsi, Baraka shifts from the natural world, with its indigenous peoples and religious ceremonies, to mass-market consumerism, urban poverty and the detritus of warfare, before returning to nature, sacred ritual and a final spectacular image of stars jockeying through the eternal firmament.Just in case we should ever miss the point, the film settles into a repetitive groove of set-up - punch line. Beauty - horror. Or even horror - horror: the film's silliest sequence segues from the burning oil fields of Kuwait to a bunch of cowboys stoking the furnaces at an Arizona coal mine, then cuts to the ovens of Auschwitz. The skulls and bones of the Cambodian Killing Fields are but seconds away. So just to make that clear: that's an indictment of Saddam Hussein, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot and... those genocidal coal miners of Arizona? Detail - reveal: here's some gorgeous shots of the Amazonian rain forest. And here's the poor little guy whose home the loggers are chopping down - a body-painted tribal child, peeping shyly through the heart-shaped leaves while an elder stares wistfully into the lens. These staged, static group portraits, also a fixture of Koyaanisqatsi, add further layers of artifice to the proceedings, but are undoubtedly meant to humanise the swollen masses of the Earth.In fact, they have just the opposite effect and when focused on peoples of developed nations (ie any passing commuters or coal miners the filmmakers have stacked in front of the cameras like store front dummies), are practically employed as show trials: Behold, Exhibit A! Wretched bread-heads who've never so much as sniffed a peyote button!Here they are again in fast-mo, leaving vapour trails of light and colour as they ping around train stations like pin-balls, or courtesy of an over-cranked camera, stagger down the road in slo-mo like zombies with briefcases. Only the priests, dervishes and hierophants of whichever denomination apart from Christianity (crucifixes = bad) escape the transforming terror of the time-lapse.In Baraka World, religion (the more esoteric the better) is unquestionably a Good Thing. Elsewhere, an Oriental monk walks ever so slowly down the pavement tinging a bell, while all about him, those harried pedestrians scurry to their offices like obedient little ants. Bad pedestrians! Scurrying is naughty. Work is wrong. Tinging is good.On the subject of tinging, Baraka's doomy score isn't a patch on Phillip Glass' undulating masterpiece for Koyaanisqatsi, and those generic ambient drones often accompany markedly different continents as if the makers were concerned that introducing more indigenous music at appropriate junctures might be harder on developed world ears. Not everything sounds like Peter Gabriel meets Buena Vista Social Club.We're on safer ground in South America with those ubiquitous pan pipes, and in Bali, with the jolly and percussive 'Ramayana Monkey Chant'. (Do our ears deceive us, or is someone really intoning the phrase "Chee-ky mon-key"?). The metropolis, a forest of skyscrapers, is a real jungle - judging by those pounding tribal drums. But why not introduce a blast of pop or R'n'B? Or, for that matter, intelligent drum and bass? The stuff city dwellers genuinely engage with and live their lives to? In Don't Look Back, Bob Dylan suggests a 'Time' reporter would get closer to 'the truth' by filling the magazine's pages with a collage of "a tramp vomiting into a sewer. And next door to the picture, Mr Rockefeller... on the subway going to work". The fact the filmmakers have chosen photogenic images of Calcutta's 'untouchables' picking through landfill - as opposed to, say, Ivory Coast down-and-outs begging for euros on the Paris Metro - speaks volumes about post-colonial prejudices. We're back with the Romantics and their noble savages. Third world porn.It's a shame Baraka is saddled with the old smug, elitist hippie pieties, because in most other respects, this is what the movies - at least IMAX - was invented for. There are places on this Earth that resemble the stuff of science fiction, and Fricke and his crew have visited pretty much all of them; crumbling moss-covered ziggurats crowned with a harvest of stars; parched desert landscapes beneath rolling, purple skies; and fantastical temples, home to exotic lizards with ancient shaman faces.Yet the filmmakers aren't terribly interested in non-humans, aside from their cutely anthropomorphic uses. In the opening sequence, a crimson-faced snow monkey sits in a hot spring like an old man in a bath and looks plaintively around him, probably trying to figure out which rock that Middle-Eastern flautist is hiding behind.</fullReview>

The editor should be shot! He has no sense of good pacing or timing and does not allow the images to flow together (it should look like a dance with film this beautiful). The sound track isn't that great either. I loved Kawanisquatsi, but this is nothing like that!PS The credits show the director as one of the editors.

		<shortDescription>Baraka is life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz who observed that "it's judgement that defeats us". Many people felt that Baraka should have given more details of what you were looking at and why instead of only presenting images. But all the locations are listed at the end, it's easy enough to find out which location is where and any history behind it. Baraka is a film that shows you life, a wide spread of life, and presents it without judgement. This is what happens, this is what is going on in the world of 1992; what you make of that, think about it, feel about it, do about it - that's up to you.That's not to say that there isn't a certain amount of guiding going on. The central message being sent to us is a simple one - we're all the same really. Shots of various religions kissing venerated objects follow each other, shots of a Yakuza full body tattoo cuts to tribal body decoration. Everywhere people stare into the camera. There is no attempt to tell us their thoughts, their backgrounds, their lives. The point is to wonder.What you take from Baraka will be personal to you. Some parts you will remember better than others. You may return to it at different times in your life and find different things. You might watch it two days in a row and find different things. Indeed, the scale of the film is such that it really requires repeat viewings, there are simply too many images to digest first time through. And images is what Baraka is all about, each one a living photograph. Fans of Edward Burtynsky will be immediately at home here in some of the vast landscapes and the Asian assembly lines. Each individual scene is so precisely tracked, time-lapsed, composed or lit that it could stand alone. If there's one initial criticism of Baraka, it might be that 90 minutes of this is just too much. Repeated viewings remove this obstacle, however.Baraka was made in 1992, so already parts of it are lost to us. Kowloon Walled City, which appears only briefly, underwent demolition within a year of the film's release. The burning oil fields in Kuwait was a current political event. How stunning these images are to us today, but how much more so in 100 years? Really a film like Baraka ought to be made every 10 years, to help us look at ourselves and evaluate what we are and what we're doing.My personal answer is yes, absolutely. Though it was high-definition before high definition existed and many of the scenes and images are now familiar, a great many still are not. Familiar scenes may even give us respite, which allows the in between moments to hit us still harder. Scenes of homeless children sleeping against hot air vents, or of a burning corpse at a Ganges cremation, or of tiny chicks being dispassionately sorted and flung through disinfected steel machinery, having their beaks scorched and ending up as battery hens. Much of Baraka is beautiful. Some is unpleasant, some is uncomfortable, some is amusing. Often there is beauty in the sadness, or sadness in the beauty. Baraka is life; make of it what you will.</fullReview>

Example : comparison between how baby chicken are treated in the industry and people on the subway. Or piles of bones with piles of weapons... The only ideas described are : - nature is beautiful - every one has the same spirituality (at least the same rites) - cities are steamy, polluted and people are sad in it - industry is bad, because people do over and over the same thing (computer tobacco) - war is bad, because people died - then we go back to nature is great (but at night this time)This movie doesn't develop ideas or reasoning : it states the writers points of view.

		<fullReview>Take a trip around the world with cinematographer/director Ron Fricke, one of the creative minds behind the art house classic Koyaanisqatsi. Baraka is pretty much the same formula. It is slightly inferior but effective nonetheless.The reason it is inferior has to do with the fact that unlike Fricke, Godfrey Reggio (director of the 'Qatsi' trilogy) knows how to assemble imagery in a way that can deliver a message. Baraka is mostly imagery, with no thematic value, but it's still highly educational. It shows us every nation, creed, and colour on planet earth in a plethora of detail. The imagery is bold and assertive, yet also aesthetic and fluid. Of course it also goes hand in hand with an equally vibrant score.Koyaanisqatsi may be unforgettable, but Baraka is the next best thing. It has a heck of a lot to show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So now and then I try to watch a not so average documentary. That's how I've already seen "Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe" (about all kinds of insects) and "Le peuple migrateur" (about the migration of all kinds of birds). I must say that I liked both a lot and they sure made me look forward to other documentaries of this kind. I like the concept of a documentary with nice images and music, but only few spoken words, so when I had the chance to see this "Baraka", I was really looking forward to it.Normally I try to tell something about the story of a movie, but in this case that is impossible because this movie doesn't really have one. It is just a collection of all kinds of scenes with several subjects. You'll see some images from our cultural heritage (like temples, churches,...), from all kinds of people (Aboriginals, South American Indians,...) and nature (volcano's, the ocean, waterfalls,...). Everything has been compiled into one solid and unique documentary that doesn't need words to describe what you are seeing, but tells its story only by the images and the music that accompanies it.At first I must say that I was watching it with an open mouth because it all looked so beautiful. But that feeling didn't last and that's a shame. When after about 30 minutes of nice images, the part with all the death and the misery started, it all got a little bit too much for me. And I'm not even talking about the Cambodyan concentration camp where you will see some skulls and bones lying on one big stash or the Nazi concentration camp where you are confronted with the ovens and some possessions of the murdered Jews. Even the awful treatment of those little chickens, I could cope with (although with difficulty). No, what really shocked me the most was the close-up of the ritual burning of a corpse near the Ganges river in India. I know that it happens this way and I've seen images of it before, but never have I experienced from this close how a body was almost completely dissolved by the flames, except for the head, which was only slightly burned and out of which the smoke escaped out of every whole. I'm normally not faint of heart, but this was just too much for me. Perhaps it doesn't evoke such strong reactions in every person, but I had my father cremated a couple of years ago and knowing that this might have happened to him too was emotionally devastating.So in a way this documentary left me with a double feeling. I liked the biggest part of it, like the scenes about people, nature and culture, a lot, but other scenes were a bit too much for me to handle. That's also the reason why I will not give this documentary the 10/10 which I was about to give it in the first 30 minutes. I give it a rating of 7/10 instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually stunning but not as powerful or coherent as Samsara.A documentary on...everything. No narration, no annotations or sub- titles, just images. We see majestic mountains, wildlife, religious and cultural ceremonies and customs, geological phenomena, landscapes, human habitation and how this impacts on nature, industry, urban living, poverty, military weapons and the effects of war, monuments to atrocities, art and architecture. The images are taken from all over the planet. While they might seem random at first, there are links between the different scenes...Quite amazing, visually: well selected and filmed images. It's like a National Geographic video without narration. Interesting themes too: nature vs mankind, war and its effects, the extent of human cruelty, the extent of human creativity, the superficiality and dullness of our daily lives. However, I found the individual scenes a bit ponderous at times, as if the director lingered on one subject too long to take up time. Also, the themes weren't always that clear, profound or well thought out.The problem might be that I watched Samsara (also directed by Ron Fricke and released a year after Baraka) before Baraka, thus some of the novelty had worn off. Samsara seemed more coherent in its message and had better pacing. Maybe if I had watched them in reverse order, my feelings on the two would be reversed.Overall, well worth watching. A very original documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There may be many approaches when choosing film as a medium of communication.The concept of music and images without the contribution of a spoken script, leaves the viewer with a much greater possibilities of interpretation. We have to keep in mind that it is almost mandatory to plunge in the movie through these two unique means in order to let go. Then the experience should be more direct and pure.The result is a highly sensory and spiritual cinematic experience. The approach is totally unbiased. Do not judge or criticize anything. Only presents the images as they are, without the intervention of the spoken or written. I've read some reviews that the film has a message (enviromental, etc...).The movie has no message.No message at all.My view: As a result, IMHO the movie makes us see the world, not as a small part of the picture, (in fact, is what we see in all the movies), but as the the whole picture. Also, being a broader perspective on the human condition, it becomes easier to see ourselves not as individuals, but as a small part of a huge and complex mechanism which is Planet Earth.This approach would also apply to the chaos and randomness which are our lives seems to be tied. The movie makes us aware of the ephemeral nature of each situation, which is due to the impermanence of all forms, good or bad, life and death. Ultimately, all this might suggest the existence of a deployment of a higher order and purpose.Just for introspective viewers. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A collection of expertly photographed scenes of human life and religion.This is generally listed as a documentary, which is probably fair. But really, it is more of a work of art. There is no story, no political message, nothing we would call "documentary". It documents a broad swath of humankind, and even beyond humankind. Religion, yes, but also so much more.What stands out is the quality of the photography. This was 1992. Maybe I am mistaken, but I do not believe we had anything close to high definition. Maybe we had certain narrow uses, like IMAX, but nothing like the standards of today (2015). Because of the improvement in technology, this is probably an even more beautiful film than it was twenty years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The everything film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BARAKA is a 1993 film, shot by Ron Fricke in some 24 countries, that is a sort of documentary on three universal themes: 1) the grandeur of the natural world, from the peaks of Everest to low deserts, 2) the oneness of the human race illustrated by juxtaposing almost identical shots from vastly separated cultures, and 3) the desire for a connection with something transcendent. Shot in 70mm film, watching the Bluray on a projector or a large-screen television offers one of the most visually stunning cinematic experiences around. There is no dialogue or voice-over, no characters, but the enormous amount of footage is presented here in a way that gives BARAKA a gripping dramatic arc, and it's a sequence that, on repeated viewings, increasingly seems the most matter-of-course way in which all this could have been edited.With unquenchable anthropological curiosity, Fricke identifies commonalities that link us all. A shot of a Japanese mafioso's tattoos, for example, are followed immediately by a shot of the same on an indigenous resident of Papua New Guinea. But's not only exotic tribalism. A shot of Japanese schoolgirls looking at the camera is mirrored later by an almost identical shot of low-caste girls in Calcutta. Don't expect a mushy call for tolerance; Fricke's editing indeed makes a convincing case for appreciating differences, but there is nuance.Fricke's occasional use of footage from churches, mosques, temples, etc. is less an advocacy for belief in religion than an extension of the commonalities he identifies. Human beings have an urge for contemplation as solace among the complicated and sometimes senseless world around them, and they draw on inner sources of mercy to go against the cruelty that people show to their fellow man. The consequences of a world cut adrift from calm and compassion are shown during a heartbreaking sequence that ranges from Auschwitz and the Cambodian killing fields to homeless across the globe and teenage prostitutes in a Bangkok nightclub.The footage is accompanied by an array of musical pieces which help to set the mood for each series of shots: minimalist loops form the soundtrack for scenes of industrial production, we hear harsh bagpipes as the camera tours the burning oil fields of Kuwait, and Dead Can Dance's "The Host of Seraphim" plays during an indictment of poverty worldwide. Some of musicians involved are rather New-Agey and would never have a place in my music listening, but when integrated into the film they are remarkably effective. The 5.1 surround sound excellently balances cinematic effect and faithfulness to the scenes portrayed.I've watched BARAKA many times now, each time discovering many new things and always being moved, whether to pity (Calcutta garbage-pickers) or wonder (the unreal glittering hall of Shiraz's Shahcheragh mausoleum). I would certainly rank it among my favourite films. Will you like it? That's hard to say. BARAKA is my go-to Bluray when friends and family want to try out my fancy home theatre setup with HD projector and surround sound, and while some of them have been just as stunned as I am, others don't really care. Apparently many people, even those with a well-rounded education, don't have much curiosity for things outside their own everyday experience, and so Fricke's survey of world cultures doesn't resonate with them.(Note that while Fricke created a 2011 follow-up called SAMSARA, I would recommend staying away from it, as it is less focused and only repeats BARAKA to diminishing effect.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bold statement certainly, however Baraka has an immense beauty that is surely universal in appeal. It is a documentary that's without narrative or narration, it captures a veritable plethora of imagery that reminds us that Earth is indeed a baraka, which is Arabic and Hebrew for 'blessing'.Any attempt to derive meaning or identify connection becomes merely incidental as you're presented with the hypnotic scenery that Ron Fricke and his team have captured; it must have been difficult for them to cut their glorious footage down to 97 minutes. The film traverses verdant jungles, epic mountain ranges, sweeping temple complexes, arid deserts, imposing cityscapes and haunting landmarks of evil such as Auschwitz and the Cambodian S-21 prison. Its human subjects are of all colours and creeds, with much of the film focusing on those who are less fortunate and sometimes utterly destitute. It is a sensational and occasionally disturbing cross-section of the planet's landscapes, cultures and history.The stunning wide shots and time lapses are scored with heady ambient music by Michael Stearns. His music is a cacophony of tribal chants, chimes and drums that's vital in creating Baraka's truly sensory immersion. My favourite piece is Baraka Theme, its broad, sonorous notes create a vast scope that perfectly accompanies the boundless panoramas.There are so many moments I could talk about, I could throw effusive adjectives at almost every frame, however I feel mere words can't do it justice. Baraka is a purely cinematic experience that's somewhat futile to describe.However, one memorable sequence I will mention is the factory processing of chicks that's interspersed with the frenetic pace of the Tokyo railway commuters; it is fascinating and ultimately quite unpleasant as the birds' destiny in battery cages is revealed after having their beaks burnt. The camera offers insights into an array of factories, showcasing their subjects' perfectly rehearsed skills in computer hardware assembly, textiles and poultry.It is a film that demands to be shown on good equipment, a film that serves as a benchmark for one's TV or projector. Apparently, it was the first film to receive an 8K transfer, what an awesome experience that must be, most likely better than real life!When Baraka sadly finishes, you eventually move your eyes away from the screen for the first time in 97 minutes and realise that you've been dead still the whole time as you check your watch, surprised to see that many hours haven't passed. It is a triumph that the moving image alone can achieve such engrossment.86%www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not here to completely slander "Baraka". That would be a disservice to Ron Fricke's jaw dropping camera skills and directorial efforts. It's sad in a way, because I had just viewed his most recent outing "Samsara" (2012)."Samsara" featured better pacing, much better music pieces, smoother transitions between cultures and even though it was the final in a trilogy it honesty felt like a "quasi-remake". On multiple viewings I have really tried, but I feel "Samsara" totally rectified all of Baraka's short comings and I understand how unfair it is compare a directors efforts, especially in-between a 9 year gap. Unfortunately, that's just the way I see it.Saying all that, I still really want to view "Chronos" (1985) someday. "Baraka" has some gorgeous imagery throughout it's 1 hour 30 minute running time, but for 40 minutes of this picture I found myself really underwhelmed. As much as I love the premises of Mr. Fricke's work, and adore the camera shots being employed. I can only recommend "Baraka", if you have the patience to wait for the more provocative stuff in the 3rd act of the picture.Final Verdict: My appreciation of the picture has gone up as time goes by, but "Baraka" is showing it's age. I can appreciate this was a way to see the world without mass exposure via holiday trips or the Internet. But I really think "Baraka" will age much sooner than later. 7/10.</fullReview>

Baraka explores the most beautiful and breathtaking landscapes one can ever imagine. Director Ron Fricke used a special time lapse camera that he invented for this film. He had used his imagination in the ways that will blow your mind. I loved this movie for the way The Earth was explored and how the small pieces were put together to show nature, landscapes, wildlife, culture, believes, society, industrialization, urbanization, war. Most amazing thing is the usage of time lapse camera, and i can watch those scenes again and again. This is a must watch for nature-lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Words Need Be Spoken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does a movie with no words or characters have such a huge impact? I still don't really know but Baraka had that impact on me. This movie came out in 1992 and shows life in many shows and forms. It is a strange but intriguing genre of film but it is amazing. Baraka means hope in English but what it actually means is up to the viewer. From the streets of New York, to tribes in Africa, to clouds floating above mountains, Baraka dives deep into the planet we live on and really made me think.The shots in this movie, with the music intertwined, were beautiful. A New York Street is shown with the traffic moving like clockwork while drums are playing almost in sync with the traffic. The entire hour and a half movie is like this. This movie touches upon every religion and group of people we have on Earth. The audience sees the different people in the world but we also see how similar we are. Yes a typical American lifestyle is a lot different than the people in other countries that have tattoos and piercings all over their body, but seeing how we share similar problems is brilliant. Throughout the movie we see the positive and negative aspects of our world, past and present. People are shown happy and sad but no matter what the culture there are shots of people staring right into the camera and into the depths of my soul. They break the cinema wall, in a regular movie actors never stare into the camera, but with Baraka regular people stare right into the camera and the emotional impact is huge. Children stare and you wonder what they are thinking about, are they happy or sad. Most stares are blank and innocent. It shows how innocent people really are and how we take those innocents away.This movie really made me think about the word we live in and how people treat each other. People are so cruel to each other for no reason. People discriminate based on religion, why? This movie shows each religion I can think of and they basically follow the same principal. We as a species are so similar to each other but we treat one another like garbage. There are shots of Auschwitz and the Cambodian massacre. Human skills and bones still sitting there. These people were killed for no reason and as a viewer it's sad. I loved this movie. It made me think and want to change. I don't judge people but it made me want to make a greater effort to treat people better in general.Nature of our world is also beautiful. There are shots of animals, specifically monkeys and it is adorable. There is a sequence very early on of a monkey hanging out in a hot bath and it just sits there. A raindrop slightly falls on his nose and it just stars at it as if it's annoyed. It is subtle things like this that I really loved. Nature is truly beautiful if you look at it the right way. Shots of nature were the ones I liked the best, especially waterfalls. I don't know why but I love waterfalls. I also loved the clouds running over mountains like a strong river current. It looked like somebody was stretching out a cotton ball for miles and miles. Music makes the movie. If you don't believe me, then you're dumb for one. Watch this movie and tell me you didn't like the music in this movie. Philip Glass composed the music and after I saw this movie I immediately got the soundtrack. It's so beautiful and captivating. It captures each individual moment perfectly. Sometimes there are different cultures singing or chanting and sometimes it is natural sound from the world itself. It's repetitive and slow but effective.Overall, Baraka is a masterpiece. I have never seen a film like this but I want to see more. This is a rare and beautiful genre that makes you think about the world we live in. A movie like this can't be too long and it can be a little boring at times but I watched this movie in the "proper" state of mind. I strongly suggest you watch this movie in the "proper" state of mind, you won't regret it. I will see this movie again and the upgraded blu ray made it ten times better. The picture quality was the best I have ever seen and the sound quality was right up there as well. Baraka gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and the mind blow of the week. Words are not enough to describe this movie enough and it's fitting because there is not one word of scripted dialogue in the film at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glimpse of a divine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this Ron Fricke's documentary way back in 2006 on TV. it did make a great impression about being something mysterious but I couldn't pay serious attention to it owing to other preoccupations. The film, however, had always remained at the back of mind. So when I saw it for second time recently ? this time on a large screen - I was awestruck by the sheer magnitude of the film that made me restless till I wrote down that rewarding viewing experience. When searched on the Internet, one gathers that the word 'Baraka' is a Sufi word - meaning blessing of God in the form of spiritual wisdom or the divine presence. And how truly and spell-bindingly this film brings out that essence even though not a single word is spoken throughout its entire length of 96 minutes! Directed by cinematographer himself, the film was shot in 6 continents covering 24 countries including my own and neighboring Nepal. Baraka showcases unforgettable snapshots and moving images that transport us to glory &amp; vastness of nature, natural wonders, serenity, spirituality, sacred sites, rituals, prayers, tribal life, city life, industrial sites and also the man-made disasters that threaten the mankind as well as earth's other creatures. These powerful images establish the links between humanity and nature?how our own life style reflects on the natural rhythm of the planet. As the film progresses, these images begin to creep onto our consciousness, rule our feelings and finally evoke compassion. By dispensing with dialog or any visual text, this film gives altogether different dimension to documentary film making that defies the hitherto tradition. Music composer, Michael Stearns's hypnotic and soul-stirring music is the real icing on the cake. It combines visuals with musical artistry...a magical blend of ancient?folk?traditional?global to modern music. His music definitely deserves large chunk of success this film has earned.Not only the images are mesmerizing and a great visual feast for eyes but also the film is equally soul stirring experience that connoisseurs &amp; film buffs can't afford to miss. Surely deserves 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same comments apply here as in Koyannisqatsi. Yes, it captures a myriad beautiful things, ecstatic dances natural and manmade. Yes it shows conflicting urges in humankind for transcendence and destruction. It wants to elevate us to a vantage point from which to view a larger world that we would call spiritual.In the silent era they were making "city symphonies" to eulogize the booming modern city, this would be a "world symphony". But it eulogizes a simplistic view. It all issues forth from a hopelessly Eurocentric view that finds exoticism in faraway places, sacredness in monument, purity and ceremony to be the same thing.But see, spirituality is not sending a postcard back home from a temple you visited, it's learning to see this world anew, every small thing that you come across. It's an entire way of seeing. At the root of a transcendent vision is the Zen koan of koans, the question who is it that sees?And this is simply not made from someone who can see farther than the monument he wants to erect. We fly from the pyramids to the Angkor Vat to Persepolis in a matter of minutes, gorging instead of harking. We fly from tribal dances to the urban dances of traffic to the devotional dance of pilgrims around Mecca. We cut from Japanese businessmen in their modern hotel capsules to stylized shots of a Buddhist monk in the street with his alms bowl. Nature is never allowed to be itself, it has to be nature as we want it to be, a Rennaisance notion that is at odds with modernity. See, for this filmmaker it takes nothing short of the Taj Mahal at sunset to comprehend the world's beauty and nothing short of Kuwait oil fields ablaze to comprehend the destruction. There's a truly astonishing sequence of rebirth near the end, with a solar eclipse and an African dancer bouncing up as if a soul is leaving to return. But all of it together has the adverse effect. We see the mundanity of the sacred and not the opposite, which is the spiritual essence. This is a touristy view by someone who thinks that going to Bodh Gaya to meditate under the bodhi tree will grant special insight, that it will take nothing short of a sacred place. Either way you may appreciate this verse:A monk asked, "When there's not a single cloud for ten thousand miles, then what?"Zen Master Baoshou said, "The clear sky also gets the staff!" The monk said, "I don't understand why the clear sky has an error."Baoshou hit him with his staff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Masterpiece; delights each of your senses in ways you can't imagine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally shot in 24 countries on six continents, Director Ron Fricke calls his film 'Baraka' "a guided mediation on humanity"; it is, indeed. Even with no narrative or a regular flow of events, the breathtaking shots from around the world show the beauty and destruction of nature and humans. Whether one's high or not high, for an intelligent person who has interests in the fields of art, nature, human life and culture, this film is a trippy meditation on our wide and varied existence on this planet. 'Baraka', in Sufi, means "a blessing, or as the breath, or essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds." From meditative slow motion to bewildering time-lapse photography, Ron Fricke (cinematographer and director of the film) captures the scenes with such earnest interest and curiosity, it's like watching memories of places you haven't even been to, and firing various random thoughts in your mind that you never even complete. The incredible soundtrack by Michael Stearns which is sort of a hybrid world-music, and on-site recordings help push us to the dimension where all these thoughts take place.The film begins with a few shots of the mountains, then moving onto showing a snow monkey relaxing in the hot springs of mountains in Japan; it looks so calm and deep-in-thought, reminiscent of human life. It goes on to show so many diverse places and peoples, it's really difficult to list all of them here because there are so many scenes that are awe-inspiring. But just to mention, the most spectacular and memorable sequences include: the Kecak dance (Balinese Monkey Chant) at temple in Tampaksiring (Bali, Indonesia) - dance of Maasai tribe in Kenya - Japanese Buddhist monk on a pavement in walking meditation, with a bell an bowl in hands, asking handout in such a peaceful way - the mass and systematic breeding of chicks in a factory - scenes of photographs and abandoned buildings of Auschwitz in Poland (concentration camp) and Killing Fields in Cambodia (Khmer Rouge torture chambers) - dance of Dervishes in Istanbul (Turkey). And for me, the most powerful and absorbing stretch of sequences start with a father and son on a cycle, on a street in India, and ending with the Butoh dance of Japan; a hauntingly beautiful and enigmatic score accompanies these scenes, which makes the whole sequence out-of-this-world.It's thousands of stories etched into a single movie. Legacies, history, cultures, diversity, pain, suffering, joy, humanity - it's like watching and experiencing so many things at once. It makes you proud to be a part, though the tiniest, of all this. If one can watch only one movie before he dies, this should be it. If an alien race comes to this planet and wants to learn about us, this is the movie they should begin with. Before dying, this is what I would want to see last, thinking all the while - though I may not have been to these places and seen or known them firsthand, but to be able to know of their existence is enough for me.It's one of the best non-verbal documentaries ever made. Watch it on the biggest screen and the best resolution possible, because it's the kind of experience which never leaves your mind, and delights each of your senses. To not have seen this visual masterpiece is to deny oneself the knowledge and understanding of our very existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand the need to compare Baraka to the qatsi trilogy but honestly I can't agree that a comparison is in order. The two movies have different purposes. Baraka, to me, seems to take you on a journey through humanity and how each of our actions are connected to another; whether or not we want to believe they are, our choices do influence seemingly non-connected events. This movie gives a vivid view on how inter-twined the entire world is. The qatsi trilogy is different in the fact that it tries to show the errors in human interaction and how our poor choices have ruined lives of others, almost to the point of being pious. Any of the 4 movies are definitely worth watching but none of them should be compared. Its much like comparing apples to oranges. Both are fruit, but both serve different nutritional purposes, one for vitamins to enhance your performance (baraka = oranges) and one for fiber to fill you with substance (qatsi trilogy = apples).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baraka is a wordless documentary, but not without a message.It does have a logic to it, and despite its sheer beauty (after all even the burning oil-wells of Kuwait can be beautiful), it ultimately seems to me to be misanthropic to the core. Primarily it contrasts and parallels an old world and a new world, and shows how they are linked, how they are ultimately the same, how we in the new world, who think we're so different and superior, are actually not different at all. It says: humankind is a writhing mass of superstitious and miserable minds doomed to repetition, inflicting and suffering pain, and impassiveness, whether they're swaying at the Wall, going round the Kaba, shaking the incense, producing food, consuming food, working on a factory, going to work, etc... but it all can be composed together in a work of art and beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...in boredom! The purpose of a movie is either to entertain or to educate (documentaries primarily). This series of pictures (I hesitate to call it a film) does neither. With the possible exception of those who've lived all their lives under a rock and/or are somehow oblivious about the fact that there are many different cultures and scenic views out there in the big world.While the photography in this work is breathtaking, with exceptionally sharp and detailed pictures of a wide range of cultures and exotic geographical locations, it doesn't really mend the fact that there is absolutely no point or message to be taken out of it. It's just a moving slideshow of beautiful (and some disturbing - most of us already know that there is a lot of evil in the world too) pictures, accompanied by slow and extremely boring music. There's no narration, no context and no point in it, except to show what we already know (hopefully anyway); it's a big world out there. Everything moves along slowly, and is dulled down further by the slow, repetitive and boring music. As far as boredom in moving pictures goes, this is unparalleled.If you want to study the world in a more meaningful way, watch some documentaries on National Geographic, or buy a large coffee table book of pictures from the world, and view it with your preferred choice in music playing in the background. The "message" will be the same, but you'll get a more satisfying experience by being able to flip the pages at your preferred speed and listening to music you actually like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was reading through some the comments out of curiosity. and i felt so compelled to create an account and give my opinion.some people have called this movie pretentious. the definition of pretentious is making claim to or creating an appearance of (often undeserved) importance or distinction". if life isn't deserving of distinction then i don't know what is.these people simply do not understand beauty. they analyze. they project their own ideas and in the end judge it based on the reasons they believe it was made. impatience. making claim to a message they believe to be conveyed. there is no message. it is what it is. and if there is a message you perceive that you wholly reject that simply reflects what you are not willing to accetp from within the tiny world you live and judge within.from start to finish this film is perfect. you just have to see it with one eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tree really does make a sound if it falls down in a forest with no one around to hear it! This film proves it! It is visually, audibly, and intellectually stimulating on a higher level - especially if the viewer is in the right mind-set.The immense complexities of the relationship between the earth and her people are so well-depicted in this film.The soundtrack is almost hypnotic, and fits perfectly with the visual presentation. There is not one bad word I could say about this film. Everyone I've had to pleasure of showing it to (with at least an average IQ, lol) has enjoyed every frame of this movie. I will say that when it was viewed by someone who was not ready for the amount of thought and introspection that is required by the lack of dialogue, the viewer made this amusing comment: "I've been sitting here for three minutes and not one person has said a single word. I don't get it?" LOLThe cover is right on the mark when is states that mere words do not do the film justice. And I am pleased that a mere word is not uttered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never filled out a review before, but after reading the above review, i had to register... Maybe folks of the above mindset should stick to Hollywood dialogue. The message is a little more straightforward and 'what to think' is easily supplied. Baraka is a visual journey through the dawn of civilization and man's enormous impact on the earth, and vice/versa. IMO, the director is not making much of a statement for the positive or negative about this, simply observing the amazing process of consciousness embodied...there's obvious correlations made by the order in which clips are played: a scene of rushing water changes to a time-lapse shot of clouds rushing over moutaintops, creating a waterfallish feeling...synergy. "As Above, So Below". Shots of small villages move to cities, move to skyscrapers. Sound clips of rhythmic breathing are merged with time-lapse shots of New York traffic. .....and there's the eerie shots, where the cameraman picks a single human subject, and slowly zooms in closer and closer on their face, whilst the subject stands perfectly still...you sense the thickness of identity, the veil of separateness that we all experience. How much our personalities are facades, masks...the infiniteness of a universe that contains so many beings to witness it's expansion!!This movie offers a chance at intuitive understanding of what you see. There are many ways to say the same thing, but one way to say many things: leave it up to the viewer! Of course, what you have to gain from it depends on where you're looking from.</fullReview>

Modern and primitive are contrasted by showing native cultures and suit-and-tie cultures. Tribal customs and hut-dwelling are juxtaposed with modern society's architecture, transportation and much more.  The film deals objectively with environment and religion. It makes a strong statement about the animal kingdom. In short, Baraka is a film about life. I highly recommend the film. It's seen best on a wide-screen tv or at the theatre. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a spectacular production! This film is made purely for evolved human beings. I am shocked that this sensational movie has been rated only 7 stars. This is of course due to the fact that some people really have no idea what life is all about. I read a review stating that this movie has spectacular images without any meaning, or a story or characters. I must remind this person that this is not a documentary called "Around The World" and just because some people lack concentration and understanding doesn't mean the film was empty. Our lives are empty. There is a very unique story told to the whole of mankind, trying to awaken us from this robotic and sick society, reminding us where we came from (the stars) and reminding us what exactly we came here to do (evolve). The film is about spirituality, nothing else. There are no mistakes in it. Nothing has been missed. This is the only film humanity needs to watch, but because most of the population is blind to the truth, living pointless lives into an unconscious road of self demolition they see this "BLESSING" as a "Tour Around Planet Earth", wondering where those places are. Watch the film, as a whole don't separate everything into pieces. Unity is one of the hidden messages in this remarkable film. There is a very specific reason for missing out subtitles, because they would only drive you away from the point Baraka is trying to make. Buy this film, watch it (with your eyes and ears open), then buy the soundtrack for it and meditate. That is what this film is all about. It tries to bring you closer to meditation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie perked my interest because its title was also the name of a character from Mortal Kombat. Of course, I now know it's a Sufi word for something like "blessing." I'm willing to bet that some of the other reviewers here at the IMDB first glanced at the flick for the same reason I did, and are too embarrassed to admit it. Heck, that could be the reason why you, the reader, are here. But enough with destroying my credibility! I read over the reviews, thought it looked interesting, and jumped at the chance to see it when I discovered a copy at a friend's house. She had gotten it free with her DVD player, and had never watched it.To be fair, I saw this on a 13" TV, albeit one with very sharp picture quality and some good speakers. This is the kind of movie that would probably look better at an IMAX, which I'm guessing is where this movie originally played.Baraka is not without merit. It looks great. Many individual sequences are quite memorable. Indeed, it's been a few months since I watched this, and the city streets, the chanting and rocking tribe, the chicken plant, and the pyre on the beach are still stuck in my head.As a whole, however, it plays like National Geographic roulette- random shots of random, albeit beautiful, things without any sort of tour guide to help the viewer along. All the scenes are sorted out nicely, but when played together, it all gets kind of jumbled. It's hard to connect a coherent theme. I wonder who funded this, too - 70mm film isn't cheap.The visual style and techniques range from impressive to somewhat mundane in parts. When it's good, it's very, very good. When it's not so good, it's not terrible, but it does make one wonder what might have been if either something was happening, or if those responsible would have gotten a little more creative with the directing and editing. I am by no means saying they should have made a commercial, MTV-style 96 minute music video (I prefer long shots to fast edits, and I hate MTV), but the scenes that stand out in my mind that I mentioned above are from when both the images and the editing were working together in top form. Some of the scenes here might as well have been from a slideshow.The soundtrack is similar in quality to the visuals- depending on the scene, you are either entranced or wishing it was better.Let's face it- you want to watch this movie because:1) You like the whole different cultures, beautiful photography formula, in which case you might as well spend your time reading an issue of National Geographic2) You're a new age hippieor3) You're a confused Mortal Kombat fanAll in all, there are better things out there than this movie. It looks nice, it sounds nice, it's pleasant to look at, but underneath- there's really not much holding it all together. Worth a rent, perhaps, but not really worth seeking out. NG is a much better, more insightful source of the same material. It is a nice experiment, though, and I'd like to see the formula refined and perfected so that we could get a true masterpiece in whatever genre this belongs in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rich detailing of the human spirit and human creation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination of sound and images has warranted a wide variety of films with a lasting impact, but Ron Fricke's Baraka merits a unique one because of how much it shows and how little it actually says. Shot over the course of twenty-four countries on six continents in only a fourteen month period, Fricke captures some of the most immaculate images of the Earth, showing it, its people, and its natural beauty all in one richly photographed film. At only ninety minutes, this is a film with an impact guaranteed to hit you harder and harder after the credits roll.Fricke takes a look at numerous corners of the Earth, particularly the impoverished ones, with several individuals struggling to survive or forging a method of surviving in the tumultuous lands where they reside. Fricke photographs the wildlife, the communities, and the precious landscapes that exist in these areas, in addition to showing landmarks like the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, Lake Natron in Tanzania, tribal celebrations in Kenya, and even monks gathered in a monastery.It's fair to assume that Fricke is tired of seeing staged events of human life, or even exhausted from hearing shortchanged and ignorant remarks about people from other walks of life. Just by looking at what he decided to capture for the film, and how he wanted to edit it together, shows a person that is incredibly in-tuned with life around the world and appreciative of the Earth's natural beauty. However, Fricke doesn't dare neglect what he feels has made the Earth flawed. In one interesting sequence, Fricke juxtaposes factory-life with ordinary life in the city, at first showing employees in a cigarette factory and a countless number of baby chickens on a conveyor belt, waiting to be processed, and finally showing the society that embraces such things as cigarettes and freshly cut/prepared poultry.I watched Fricke's followup to Baraka, Samsara, a few years back, and was absolutely marveled by many of the same features this film bears: impeccable natural beauty, a consistent tone and flow despite no narration whatsoever, divine cinematography, and one-of-a-kind sights and sounds. One of Samsara's many extractable morals was that the Earth is so complex and richly detailed and layered that it took many years to perfect and create to reflect the life we know in present day. Through numerous shots of calamity and destruction, however, we saw how that film detailed that something so beautiful and complicated could be demolished or lessened in an instant.After watching Baraka, I can see how that idea was kickstarted. Fricke has no qualms about examining the ugly with the beautiful, or even finding a complex middle ground along the way. With this kind of layeredness, the film is prevented from being one you can view from only one way. Baraka is a free-form, impressionistic film with some of the most striking photography ever committed to film. If there's one film that's a testament to human spirit, human creation, and even arguably godlike creation, it's this one.Directed by: Ron Fricke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Heartbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baraka means blessing in many languages, and this documentary uses the techniques used for Koyaanisqatsi, and it is not a surprise, given that Ron Fricke was the main cinematographer of that film, and directed this one in a similar manner, using time lapse cameras frequently. There is no narration, only music, mostly of the soothing Zamfir pan flute variety, and Fricke traveled around the world to capture worshipers at the Wailing Wall, natives of Africa praying to the sky, and other forms of religion that are practiced across the planet. The contrast of the major cities with scenes of men and women running like hungry little ants, with the serene footage of the beauty of nature works well. We also see the great destruction that we have caused with the rape of the earths natural resources. Maybe the leaders of every nation should be forced to watch Baraka, for a real education of what happens due to their careless policies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen to the heartbeat of existence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Baraka" is not a picture in the ordinary sense. Not a word is spoken, there's no plot, not even a clear main thread throughout its one and a half hour duration. However, in the Sufi language "Baraka" means "the thread that weaves life together", and that's as close to an introduction, summary or even meaning as you might get. What you experience when watching suggests a view on the human condition as a whole, seen through the lens of spirituality, but you be the judge of that. There might be more or even something entirely different for you to discover in the flood of impressions. Objectively the film is a collection of breathtaking images, of landscapes, natural phenomena, of people, cultures, performed rites all over the world, branching off to rush hour mayhem filmed in time lapse, South American sweatshops with thousands of workers putting cigarettes together, sorting chicken, you'll see children begging on the streets, prostitutes waiting for customers, right down to sights of the holocaust and the killing fields of Cambodia.The material was shot on six continents and 24 countries and while of course filtered and selected through the process of editing, representing no more than a subjective approach, the picture undoubtedly invites to reflect and meditate, also thanks to the ethereal music and sound effects. Some scenes leave deep impressions: Like an Indonesian monk tolling a bell intercut with an African youth jumping in imitation of a gazelle as part of a ritual - to name just one example. It's almost as if there's a hidden heartbeat somewhere in all of existence, and here's someone who at least made it possible to get a glimpse of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Photography 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way I view Baraka is that it is a moving photograph. Every single frame of this motion picture is a candidate for a photography exhibition. It is immensely interesting, expertly photographed and edited. The camera always pans ever so gently, and some scenes which are played in fast motion are amazing because of the intricate motion of the camera over long periods of time.Even though there is no voice over, the music conveys a mood for every shot. Over all, I felt that the director/photographer felt a sense of wonder towards the world, which he wanted to convey through this picture. The scene in the landfills of Kolkata, India conveyed profound sorrow at the lives wasted in performing the most useless of human tasks, while the scene of children playing in the urban landscape of Rio de Janerio, Brazil leaves one with a sense of joy.The faces of the subjects in the movie tell stories, even though none of them speaks a word. The people in megalopolises, together with the people of the tribes tell the story of humanity.This movie is a must have in the Blu-ray format.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I agree with everyone else that this is a very moving film and had some of the most beautiful photography I've seen. I didn't find it uplifting however. Going from the tribal shots to the city shots really shows what direction the human race is going in. We have gone from tight-knit communities with close kinship and communal bonds to a society of distant looks and self-absorption. Specialization of labor has stripped many of their sense of purpose and mundane and repetitive work have crushed the souls of so many. We're headed towards unsustainability, and for me this film highlighted with alarming effectiveness just how much we've lost touch with our roots and our respect for everything else around us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite there being already so much written about this movie, it is yet quite hard to describe its fascination.It is definitely no popcorn blockbuster with freaky SFX and a thrilling plot.And I would not call it a documentary, because you expect something completely different when you hear that term.It is something like a walk through a gallery of paintings, however paintings which are living and actually displaying the reality of our world. No fiction, no directed actors, no storyline.Besides the gorgeous scenes in this film, it also lives of its cuts. The scene changes are very soft and subtle, but of great power. To offer an example, there is a scene where polish workers in some sort of a factory plant, maybe glass works, are shoveling sand into a big oven. This is pictured in slomo, you can really feel the heat, the exhausting labor of the men and the present smell of burning in the air. Then the image zooms slowly into the fire, still in slow motion until the burning heat takes up the whole picture. And suddenly the location changes to the crematory of Auschwitz, letting you shiver of horror.After having watched the film you will realize that there indeed is a kind of a plot, the scenes are not randomly combined but in a meaningful order.I saw this film on Bluray in a pro home theater. And I was really overwhelmed of the brilliant quality of the picture and the sound. This experience is SO intensive, touching and unforgettable. If you ever worried about spending some bucks for a bluray upgrade to your home entertainment system - get this film and you won't regret it.This one is a timeless masterpiece. There is so much detail inside that you might watch it several times and still being left impressed.</fullReview>

But with its simple and well-shot look at other cultures outside the "norm" it reminds us of our roots and early collectives, showing that at so many levels the human race has been capable of co-existing with this planet as an aspect of the world rather than its conqueror. The stunning visuals and exquisitely spot-on sound track highlight a look at where we've come from and where we are going, even if the Celtic music makes it difficult to recognize the Kuwaiti oil fires set by Hussein for what they are at first glance. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough, even if I am also forced to admit that more than three or four viewings start to detract from the magic rather than add to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Protest or Celebation ... Or Both?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As part of my school's syllabus, our English class were required to do a film study unit. For our first film, we studied Baraka.I thought it AMAZING.We were required to present a discussion, talking about whether it is a protest, celebration, or both. Personally, I think it's both.In the beginning, it's celebrating and demonstrating cultures rich in tradition. In the middle and towards the end, it is comparing and showing other cultures and what they have reduced themselves to, such as the child prostituion and the homeless families.The montage of scenes uses emotional and appropriate music to help dramatize and bring the message across clearly. For me, the soundtrack was an integral part of this experience.There is no dialog, only a series of scenes, both moving and terrifying, which can often be more effective that speech."A picture is worth a thousand words" is something to remember when viewing 'Baraka'.There is definitely a sense of juxtaposition. For example, the beautiful, serene images of Earth's natural beauty, and then there is the desperate child prostitutes and homeless people. It shows the difference and makes the viewer reflect on what some cultures have reduced themselves to.The movie slides from scene to scene using very slow and smooth movements, and sometimes a quick flash to dramatize. It is not a fast film, so this use of editing is appropriate in showing this.I think that this movie can be approached in a few ways. Being subjective, this movie could be about finding your inner traditions and what beliefs you still have while you have conformed to the materialistic surroundings.I believe that it is a protest. Simply because, for example, the Monks performing the 'monkey dance' towards the beginning. They are so happy and content with their tradition, and don't seem to have a worry in the world, yet when i viewed this film, most of my class laughed at what they were doing. I found this extremely rude, because they would be ashamed for us, and what we believe in. We, the modernists, believe in the internet as a culture and we conform to everything everybody is doing. Yet, we are the ones laughing at them. Although they weren't in the film, the Amish (people who refuse to use technology and live as though they were in the 1800's) are 100% content with themselves. They don't have the worries of modern world, and they are detached yet so very happy. I think we have reduced ourselves so much that we have lost all we used to believe in.I live in Australia, and our indigenous, the Aborigines, were shown in 'Baraka'. This was so foreign to us, for in our town we have next to no indigenous people. This proves to more of an extent how much we have immersed ourselves in becoming more technologically advanced and don't think of the outcome of losing out basic traditions. When my class saw the Aborigine, it was almost like it was foreign to us, even I felt this way, and that made me feel disappointed in myself.This movie is, for me, perpetually amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole world in a nutshell - and what a stunning nutshell it is. The subject: humankind and its relationship with the eternal. Shot on 70mm its visual quality exeeds that of 'ordinary' 35mm film. Panning down the snowy mountains the viewer encounters a monkey in a steaming pool - this amazing creature, I felt, truly exuded the essence of eternity. It seemed it had always been there and would remain so till the end of all time. There is a shot of a 'red Indian', member of a rain-forest tribe - his face painted in red - whose stare is from this and out of this world. I find it one of the most amazing shots in the film, similar to the one of the child peeking through the plants that they chose for the cover. But there are so many achingly beautiful shots that it's hard to say. Yet another one shows two mules or donkeys pulling a wagon up a hill and in doing so, I found, portrayed the hardship of life in one single shot. It is no doubt a masterpiece. Filmed over more than a year throughout 24 countries at a budget of $4m its certainly a super whooper of a documentary. The music is also breathtaking. Though I would have preferred if they had recorded all of it on site as I find it can feel a bit contrived with these soundtracks at times. But in a way I'm happy that they stayed just short of making the perfect film if ever that were possible as that leaves room for other filmmakers to step in (if you get my drift - with a dv camera and a $500 budget). I would not have gone for the speedy effects either, which they especially computer-programmed their self-built camera for. I would rate it 9,7 out of 10. It sure is one of my all time favorites. People who love this one should also look out for 'Workingman's Death' www.workingmansdeath.com which also knocks one for five. These films capture the essence of what it means to be human. True art!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Creative Writing class watched this movie, and even though I'm the teacher's aid and I wasn't responsible for watching it, I was immediately glued to the screen! I highly recommend this movie to artists of any kind, or anyone who is worldly or wishes to be so. It was raw and emotional and many parts of it gave me chills!The absence of a plot did not make Baraka boring, as I thought it would, but it was jam-packed with fantastically shot footage and very nice, cultural music. It showed not only familiar places, but many areas of the earth that most people haven't seen. Baraka does a wonderful job of opening your eyes to the world around us that is generally ignored - this is a movie that everybody needs to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stunning piece of cinematography, a must watch for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a breath of fresh air this collage is. From the opening scenes the viewer is submersed in scenes that seem to be from a different time and place. The piece has no narrative and no plot, but just interweaves amazing cinematography and music. Some of the shots are so beautiful, they make me want to cry. The film helps remind you of that things still exist in the world that we seldom see, or maybe notice.Baraka does try to put across a moral standpoint, though, and this may be a little hard for some viewers. As well as showing the beauty of nature and man, you can also see the madness and destructiveness. There are some admittedly dark points in the film. Even so there is no excuse to watch this epic piece. The music is a highlight of the film, as are the rich colours and depth of photography.I believe the director, Ron Fricke, is a work on a sequel at present. If you liked the similar pieces Koyaanisqatsi or Powaqqatsi then you will love Baraka.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baraka is a breathtaking journey that gives a sense of the big picture. The rhythm between the picture, music and sound is mesmerizing. This true cinematic masterpiece reminds us of the fact that all beings on this planet, including all of us humans, are in the same boat. It's almost a collective out of body experience where you realize that your story is really just another story. The fact that there is no narration brings the image even closer as it lets it speak for itself. You won't be able to take your eyes off of it. Not even for a second.Make sure you crank up the sound on a nice set of speakers. This film is meant to be viewed in a state of the art setting - big screen, big sound. You'll see why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful fusion of musical brilliance and cinematic genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to say anything about this film except that it is an absolutely masterful work of art. I could watch this over and over again. Certainly if you have a good audiovisual set-up with projector or widescreen and a good sound-system, the film knocks you for six. The message for me was cosmic in its proportions, and the cinematography was tastefully and powerfully chosen to deliver it. But even more magnificent than the imagery for me was the music - haunting, at times aching with pathos and at other times majestic in cosmic grandeur - all of it bordering on the sacred. My favourite sections of the score were the theme accompanying the images of the stars moving across the sky (with that diminished fifth adding upper harmonic richness to the cathedral-organ majesty of the harmony); and, best of all, the music that accompanies the images of the poor people salvaging what they can find on the rubbish tip - combined with the imagery, its enough to punch holes right through your heart.To the people who made this masterpiece of cinema - I thank you with all my heart - this Earth needs more geniuses like you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What initially caught my attention was the strange name Baraka which sounded so special. I wanted to know what this word means, why the movie is called Baraka. Then while I was watching the movie, I almost cried. My emotions and thoughts were so strong that even now - 5 years after I have watched it - I see scenes from the movie in front of my eyes. What impresses me in Baraka and makes the movie so special to me is the pure beauty and peace that pours out from the scenes. This combines with unearthly beautiful music! This year I have seen other documentaries (We feed the world, Earthlings, etc.) that deal with the topic about relations between man and nature/environment. They are also more naturalistic. In contrast, Baraka does not make any clear statements, simply shows and provokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is "Koyaanisqatsi " done right for the sensitive type.Is it a film? I don't know. So if it's a good film, I don't know either.This magnificent work, however, touched me more than any other movie I ever saw (and I've seen A LOT http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=757316). Must be because I just love to have the right part of my brain (the non-verbal, non-linear one) titillated, like in "Eraserhead", "2001", or long sequences without dialog in De Palma movies. And just like in "2001", when eschatologic implications are present, I'm all eyes and ears. I was with "Koyaanisqatsi" too, but for several reasons I didn't enjoy it much.The first time I saw Baraka, when I got out the theater, I simply couldn't speak for half an hour, finding myself in the total incapacity of building sentences. The left part of my brain was kinda shut down. Great trip! *LOL* There should be a special reward for the people who made this piece of Art, that is so timeless that it will certainly live longer than most filmed productions. Glorious 70mm cinematography with unique, breathtaking, unforgettable images.Baraka is to be attended in premium conditions: no noise, no children running around the room, good 16/9 TV set, no hurry, no non-stop-talking "friend", good loudspeakers... it's quite worth the effort.</fullReview>

The visual imagery is amazing along with the soundtrack, this film is perfect for those of us who are tired of the hustle and bustle and mindless chitter, chatter of everyday life. It was made a decade ago but I only stumbled across this recently. I think it applies well to today's society whose inhabitants are in dire need of spiritual cleansing and rebirth. It not only fills a spiritual peace that's unseen in many of today's story-oriented line of films and documentaries but it makes political and social commentary while doing so. The most amazing thing about this film is there are no words spoken. It is like going on a spiritual retreat!</fullReview>

It's more a collection of stunning shots from all over the world that seem just random in the beginning but reveal a complex composition toward the end. The story is told with the fantastic photography, contrasting the superficiality of the western world with deep spirituality of other ancient cultures thus revealing perplexity of the modern way of living.Ah, what the heck, I'm just losing my time writing this review, you should see a masterpiece like this by yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>much of the footage and even music for this movie came from an earlier project that director Godfrey Reggio worked on, called 'Koyaanisqatsi'. . . . http://imdb.com/title/tt0085809/ . . . Koyaanisqatsi is a bit dated, as far as colors and quality goes, but it's still interesting. but Baraka is more directed toward ethnic and cultural diversity than Koyaanisqatsi, which is more about urban sprawl and the effects of mass culture. baraka is an extremely beautiful film, and for those of you who are looking to see it, expect something more of a documentary set to music than a traditional movie with a plot and characters. it's a film i love to have playing in the background of social events. it's perfect for providing good music and great visuals.</fullReview>

It is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, and what makes it even more of an impact is that there's no special effects. The beauty you see is real! you live in that world! but also be aware that it has some very serious messages about the pain and suffering in the world too. Overall, watch this movie if you're among friends and if you're ready to devote your attention to it or you will become lost. My eyes never left the screen, and never wanted too. This movie should be a requirement for all people in the world.In a few words, revealing, magnetic, raw and exotic.Baraka, the essence of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price of Consumption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every hour, countless billions are spent on propaganda, advertising and other mystification's to sustain the delusion that the crisis-strewn society we live in today is the best and only one possible. This movie attempts to put the the everyday life into the contrast of the everyday destruction of the same planet that keeps us alive. As life in the western world constantly draws itself further and further away from the sort of sustainable environment we have lived in for the past million years, Ron Fricke highlights, with this movie, the contrasts that separates our constant consumption and economics based society, from the nature balanced world we used to live in. It contains some of the most beautiful images and scenes from around the world. Not a single word is spoken during the 1 hour and 36 minutes the movie runs, yet it has more to say than any other movie i have ever watched. it will leave you thinking of distant memories of very different past, and it will make you question the way you live your life."If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite" William Blake</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a stonie factor, Id toss this up to a 9. Actually on most rating scales Id give this a nine, however to watch something this "serious" (which it is, although can be viewed for no other reason but pure eye candy) I wouldn't attempt to put it on after watching Family Guy. Nor is this the kind of film you recommend to a buddy, unless they are buffs of a sort. Visually, audibly and intellectually this movie is very impressive. The underlying message of the film presents itself in (at first) a very subtle manner leading you into a fairly typical "Discovery Channel" vibe. Very easy to be sucked in, deep couch affect... which makes for a very startling and moving change of pace as the underlying message begins to make itself clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starting with a monkey in a hot water up in the mountains with that strange look in the eyes for the infinity, "Baraka" (a Sufi word for "blessing", "the essence of life") is not merely a documentary, but according to the director, a rediscovery! It is "a journey" to humans, nature, human society and what may be considered as "blessing" to human. From deep jungles into the high skies, all at the same time and through your own eyes! From temples to mosques and pyramids! From ancient times to the very modern life of the time! All in all, the best way to take another deep look into humans!

		<shortDescription>This picture is truly worth (more than) a thousand words!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baraka is a unique experience. Unlike anything else you've seen. It's a tale of 'blessings', told with images and sounds only. No dialogue. It's a journey through all the different aspects of humanity on Earth. We see different tribes, different religions with their temples and rituals, different ecological environments, and the effects of human intervention. We see the evolution of our species, from the ancient tribes to the modern man. Always on the run. But it's not all roses? From the mass production on the assembly lines we fall further down to the reality of poverty and war. But this picture is truly worth (more than) a thousand words! The director, Ron Fricke, is the master of time-lapse photography and this is his treat to the viewers. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but surely everybody will agree on this film. Viewing this picture my thoughts wandered off to many related documentaries (BBC's Planet Earth, The Power of the Planet, Life), movies (Avatar, A Space Odyssey), games (Civilization, Uncharted, Journey) and music videos (Michael Jackson's Earth Song). If any of these excites or intrigues you, then you definitely should watch Baraka. Frankly if you're interested in humanity, you won't be disappointed. And although it's made in 1992, it's timeless and withstood the test of time wonderfully. It's a great source of inspiration. Rating: PG-13 / 12</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>death is a life-changing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes the same approach as Ron Fricke's first project, "Chronos". A combination of photography and music is used to create what begins and ends as a moving picture. This is not a documentary or a scripted event - just cinematography and music (again by Michael Stearns).Unlike the earlier film, "Baraka" is long and far-reaching in its focus. The same main aspect is in play - nature versus civilization - but the latter is not simply seen as negative force here. There is a focus on religious, cultural, and societal rituals, the things we do that give life meaning. People are not merely dots in a landscape. This time, they are captured in movement and portrait, living and breathing. The endless repetitive actions of a species that values free will so much seems absurd at times, like prisons or cages chosen voluntarily. But everything you read into or get out of "Baraka" is left up to interpretation. You are not forced in any one direction.There is a breathtaking, life-giving sensation that drives "Baraka" forward. It seems to see some small part of every significant aspect of life, including death. The breadth and power of this film cannot be understated. It is the single strongest experience of pure cinematography that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gorgeous cinematic storytelling without narration in the same vein as "Chronos" and the "Qatsi" trilogy. It's a broad look at our planet with an emphasis on the human impact, for all the good and bad that entails. "Baraka" centers itself on a series of stunningly beautiful looks at nearly every important modern issue, from religion to culture to naturalism to warfare, with a magnificent eye for composition and a light-handed touch that allows the lessons being taught to be the viewer's own. A perfectly downplayed soundtrack, mixing ambient noise from each setting with a wide range of genres and moods, further envelopes us into the scenario without standing in front of the picture. Breathtaking work that literally left my jaw open more than once, and a genuine revelation on Blu-Ray - this is the disc you really need to show off your home theater system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Splendid Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times when living in our planet is resumed to routines, wars, slangs like "Faster, Bigger, Better and More", here's a documentary to make us stop, watch the images and think about what we're doing with our planet, our estimated Earth and its destiny that seemed to be repeated over and over again, destruction and more destruction. Pollution in the skies, shattered and devastated lands, and not only the physical space but ourselves too, we destroyed ourselves simply because we want more things, we want things faster, bigger and technology allows us all that but it also breaks everything we know."Baraka" is a documentary with a non narrative style that approaches Godfrey Reggio's Qatsi trilogy (and almost coincidentally, Ron Fricke, director of this film was cinematographer of "Koyaanisqatsi" and some of the images captured are very similar, the concept is basically the same). Here you're going to see beautiful and splendid images from around the world (filmed during 14 months) with ordinary situations (or not sometimes) but presented in a hypnotic and mesmerizing way, followed with the music of Michael Stearns, in a nice symmetry. It tells about the chaos in everyone's lives, and also of instants of peace, religion, and time for dazzle with amazing locations in New York, India, Brazil, Egypt and another countries beautifully captured by Fricke's lenses.I always love this concept in films and documentaries, specially if they have a wonderful and thoughtful idea along with incredible moments and all, it's a challenge that doesn't work for everybody, but to me is something positive even better if the images presented have a sense of surrealism. But, for some peculiar reason "Baraka" didn't embrace it a whole idea or something where I could say that it had an message or a purpose of making a statement, something that you'll always gonna see in the Qatsi trilogy (technology evolution versus mankind's evolution). It has things to say in its images of crowded cities, cars running, people praying in their different religions but it's not direct in saying something neither says what the word Baraka means (trivia section says this: Baraka is a blessing, or the breath, or the essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds.) From here, you have a general idea of what the film is about.In a short note, the music played here is nice, it works sometimes, but Stearns is not Philip Glass, a composer who really knows how to move us with his themes and sounds.With all that in mind, good and not so good things, Fricke's film is a wonderful and splendid experience that will last forever in your mind and with luck in life because works like this, that are magnificent in telling something relevant and powerful about the human life and the human condition in all ages and stages, are timeless, unique and, I'm gonna repeat myself again, beautiful. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world is an amazing place! From the inspiration of director Ron Fricke comes this journey through the world in which we live. To describe this film as thus keeps it in simple terms; but by no means does it justice. In truth, "Baraka" defies definition.It is a glimpse at a world we neither know nor understand, yet one we live in and contribute to every day of our lives. Full of imagery both startling and spectacular, the film owes its tangible success to sound and vision. The aural delights are from Michael Stearn who haunts us with the help of several global musicians; and the visual feast is from Fricke himself with his worldwide cinematic team.Yet "Baraka" is something more than a sight and sound spectacular. It has a life of its own. Certainly one comparison I derived from it was that of city life and village or peasant life. To us, the latter makes little sense, yet when you observe our way of life as depicted by Fricke, you wonder if we fair any better.A must see.

		<shortDescription>A true Gaia experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first experienced (that's the most striking word for it) this movie at the Gothenburg Film Festival in 1994, I was truly amazed. Never before - or since - have I had such an over all explain-it-all feeling after a show.Ron Fricke has made a documentary about the World today for a day: starting at dawn with monkeys in hot springs in Japan, and the morning rituals of various religions, followed by the awakening of the human race, both in the big cities and on the country side. Brilliantly edited together follows every aspect of human daily life combined with the general changes of the planet itself and all the ecological systems upon it.The over all glue of the story are the various religious rituals. Maybe this is my personal interpretation, being a teacher of Religion, but the only time giver, except for the turning of the sun, are the praying times and times of worship peoples practice around the globe.My comparison of the film to the Gaia idea (that the Earth as a whole being a unit, a living organism) is detectable both in the way every different culture shown are found to be very similar to one another, as well as the speeded up people at side walks and zebra crossings look very much like the stream of blood in the veins of an organism.All in all this is a marvelous movie pointing out both the uniqueness of the individual and the unity with all people. Since that first time in the theater, I have revisited this "place" several times, and the verdict is still the same. Go experience it - now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beauty and barbarity of human existence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I taped this film years ago when it was first released and thought I had lost it; this morning, however, I found it and watched, what I believe to be, the finest documentary I have ever seen. I sat mesmerised by the fabulous photography and marveled at the beauty of life on this rock that we call home. Of course this life is ugly and unfair because we are ugly and unfair and this fabulous film displays both. Baraka, as opposed to the negative IMDb commentators who have ponderously and pretentiously argued, is not trying to move the viewer to any social or political viewpoint; rather it is simply showing with brilliant cinematography and editing the complete panoply of human life as it is.The themes examined were not over-drawn or designed to set the viewer on any particular intellectual path; however, they were signposts of various human activities that are dominant in our life: war, religion in its many forms, human decoration, occupations in their many forms--in short Life on Earth. Call me stupid or naive or a dupe but the film was just a collection of what we are and how we try to maintain ourselves while we are alive. This maintenance involves just some of those themes listed above: the monkey celebration from Bali, the cremations on the banks of the Ganges, the Whirling Dervishes of Turkey, deactivated bombers sitting on an Arizonan airfield, iron ore blasting in Australia, gold/diamond excavations in Brazil, electronics assembly in China. Like human life, some good and some bad.Why should people seek out this brilliant film and use their valuable time to watch it? Because it is a film of beautiful images of our life on this planet. The images are, unusually, not just of western life but of human life in general. I do not, as some commentators believe, think that the director's selection was trite; it was as it is. Good or bad, it is our rock and he photographed its inhabitants brilliantly.</fullReview>

Thats another film with no dialogue that makes sense or a conventional plot - just a series of images.The images in Fricke are diverse and range from historic monuments to religious rituals, a volcanic eruption, several fast-moving images of modern cities with all their attendant hustle-bustle and scavengers in the slums of Calcutta.Everything is filmed beautifully and quite watchable. For me, the most impacting were the religious ceremonies. They seemed to belong to the past. The entire chicken sequence was stunningly filmed too.While a lot of the varied scenes are subtly linked with each other, most do not seem to suggest a natural progression of ideas - at least to me. Not a conventional film but worth a viewing. Some moments are worth more than one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Fricke continues his evolution with this movie. He started out as the cinematographer on Koyaanisqatsi (and writing credits) and then moved out on his own. His directorial debut (Chronos) was a little light on the symbolism and a bit heavy on the tourist trap. This movie, I think, is Fricke's best (and the closest he has gotten to Reggio's Trilogy).Fricke definitely has an eye for getting the "shot". The imagery in this movie surpasses Chronos. He definitely learned from Chronos. There is less use of the time elapsed shot or sunlight movement. This genre is hard to describe. It is a medium that has no dialog, no words, and no actors. A story is told through images and music. It is hard not to like the imagery in this movie. Fricke's use of high end cameras (65-70mm) makes everything pop, shine, glitter, glisten,etc. This is his advantage over Reggio. Reggio's trilogy is plagued by budget problems and poor film stock. One can see all the flaws in the video. Reggio makes up for it by allowing Philip Glass to weave the score and by infusing the movies with meaning. Fricke pulls off his best impression of Reggio with this movie, however, it still isn't quite up to snuff.Fricke has more people/cultural shots in this movie. He also makes a statement about various relationships (man/machine, man/nature, man/man,etc). There is definitely a sense of communal humanity, even in the choice of the name of the movie, Baraka. It is a Sufi word (and used in other cultures as well) that refers to a blessing. You get an idea of this global community simply by the number of places Fricke traveled to get the shots. Traveling to 24 different countries allows one to get some unique and incredible shots. It cements our differences and our similarities, all in the same images.He definitely has more focus with this movie (as compared with Chronos). I did get a sense of this movie being a pseudo-combination of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi. I did very much enjoy his use of local cultural song/dance instead of dubbing in a score.I highly recommend this film. It is quite worthwhile. It is a lighter fare than Reggio's Trilogy, but good nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music of course is great, the film itself is one prolonged search for the mysterious. Through scenes of different rituals that people go through, the movie shines on the different ways humans seek this mysterious, whether knowingly or unknowingly (the scenes with the accelerated cars and pedestrians being one way we seek the mysterious unknowingly)! If you have ever wondered whether there is anything awe-inspiring beyond the physical in the world, or perhaps within... this movie is a must. The rituals leading to the unity with the world and the transcendence of our humanness into a realm, forgotten in Western civilization, where one is one with the universe. How beautiful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would definitely recommend this movie for those who live in the comforts offered by the industrialized countries. There is so much for us to understand from it and grasp the immensity of humans and nature itself. Right from the scenes depicting the flora and fauna that our planet bears to the music and the variety of cultures makes it a very moving experience. I was also impressed by the fact that there is no commentary or dialog and it only enhanced the effects that the movie might have on its audience.If only we could live seamlessly with nature it would be a much more rewarding experience. Full credit to the director of the movie for providing a visual treat.One of my favorites!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in Montparnasse Paris on the only 70mm screen in Europe. Viewed this way Baraka is so much more visually stunning than on the puny video or DVD where much of the complete image is lost. For example in the opening shot of the bathing baboon, a snow leopard comes down to the water on the left. I was so utterly blown away by this experience, I watched it again on the next showing. Pure magic. Do not underestimate its power either. My teenage kids watched it a bit and they both have incurable travelust. It really has worked its way into their consciousness. We did a retrospective a couple of months ago and realized one or other of them had been to most locations in it even the very wild, hard to get to places. One point that your commentators seem to have missed is that Ron Fricke took ten years to perfect his equipment and collect all the images. Just an amazing feat longer than most marriages. I've spotted quite a few outtakes in advertisements and I think it has been sampled quite a bit too. Does anyone know if Ron Fricke is making anymore films?</fullReview>

I guess this is not for those with ADD, however I can not imagine the movie with dialogue. The music is all you need to sit back and experience. My favourite scenes were probably the Chickens and the Indian Squatters, and I found only the tree-cutting scene perhaps a tad preachy (still very interesting though).

		<fullReview>I have read several reviewers complain that Caucasians have been denied their place in Baraka. However, director and cinematographer, Ron Fricke already covered that angle in 1983's Koyaaniqatsi. In that film Frick photographed Los Angeles, Manhattan and Las Vegas. Caucasian faces abound so I disagree with that argument. It's obvious that Fricke wanted to move on to other parts of the world. What a success it proved to be! Every aspect of this film is amazing.I first saw it in 1993 at the Laemmle Sunset 5 in West Hollywood. When viewed in its full 70mm glory with that thunderous score coursing through your body it's truly an amazing experience. *BLUSH* OK. I admit I was moved to tears at one point near the end. The images and music became so powerful. Those time-delayed tracking shots are amazing. I love the awesome photography of the inside of mosques, cathedrals and synagogues. Places and people that many of us will never see in our lifetimes have been lovingly captured by Ron Fricke. I watch this DVD at least once a month but it's not the same on the small screen. You should check local movie listings in your area because sometimes it'll pop-up at smaller, art-house type theatres.Here's something interesting: Has anyone else noticed the similarities in some Madonna videos to Baraka and Koyaaniqatsi? Specifically, "Ray of Light" (1998) is very similar to many of the sped-up shots in Koyaaniqatsi. "Nothing Really Matters" (1998) has some very stark similarities to the Japanese section of Baraka i.e. white-faced Japanese with tortured faces and slow-moving geishas. "Bed Time Stories" (1995) included shots of a twirling Turkish Muslim man...as Baraka did 3 years prior. Seems like the material girl is a fan of Mr. Fricke. Who isn't?</fullReview>

I can't say that about "Citizen Kane," about "Vertigo," about "The Godfather," or any of the other films that often get top billing in film history. One cannot say it about "Koyannisqatsi" either.Some of the montage does come across as editorializing, that's true. A bit heavy-handed in spots, that's also true. But some of the connections that are drawn are also very subtle. You have to watch repeatedly, and very carefully, to catch it all.Even the ugly people look beautiful.

		<fullReview>Yes this movie has no words, no dialogue, and no plot. But never before have pictures and music made me feel so alive and yet insignificant at the same time. For the naturalists and religious people alike it blends the people and geographies of the world into one common theme of being defined by the revolution of our planet, the rising and setting of the sun and the tides. The poetry of the pictures will capture anyone's heart and make you want to travel to the amazing places that are photographed. To call it a film isn't fair; it's more of an epic poem with peaks of emotion; it lets one see things they'll never see again. It's perfect viewing when one feel's lost in the rush of things, being forced to stop and take a moment to reflect on who we are in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After first seeing this film (this is no movie) in 1997, I was astounded by the depth of the director's vision. My reluctance to this type of film disappeared in the first scene, those sleepy monkeys keeping warm in hot mountain springs.Ron Fricke has assembled a series of images that begin with captivating natural landscapes, combined with various photographic techniques and a wonderful original score, to achieve meaning. And the meaning I read into this film rang very true... the evolution of human intelligence is utterly destructive. Man came from nature, out-evolved it, and proceeded to destroy it...If you like this film, and with a 90s audience it's one of those films that falls into the 'acquired taste' category, then I recommend Koyaanisqatsi, directed by Godfrey Reggio and photographed by Baraka director Ron Fricke.A wonderful film, one of those you just know will be hated by most people because they just - don't - get it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately brilliant and deeply moving....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon my first viewing of this film several years ago, I was quite taken aback at how powerfully the film affected me. I was lucky enough to experience it in its full cinematic form in a special screening. Now, several years later, owning a copy of the video, I can only say that it is ever the more jarring and harmonic.As both a film maker and a student of world religion and thought, this film seems to speak to me in a way that few have. It is impossible to not compare Koyaanisqatsi to this film, both seeming to speak from a similar voice. However, comparing both films, I am far more drawn to this work. I have always disliked the minimalist soundtrack of Phillip Glass in Koyaanisqatsi, and I adored the warm, surrounding, complex score of Baraka. However, beyond the sheer art of it, there is a spiritual aspect that exudes from it's soul that is immeasurably powerful. Even the title, Baraka meaning ?Blessing' and ?Breath' (as opposed to Koyaanisqatsi, meaning ?A life in chaos'),there is an overwhelming sense of harmony and interconnectedness.Perhaps as a piece of entertainment, it could be considered slightly weak. However, if used as a tool for inner understanding and a tool for meditation and understanding, I have found it to be an absolutely brilliant work. I have used it several times in spiritual healing ceremonies, and each time the person has left with a change. I severely recommended sitting back with this piece, turning out the lights, crossing your legs, and meditating on it's true message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people will try to simplify the purpose of this film by lumping it into one category or another. Is it a dissertation on returning to a more environmentally conscious way of life? Is it an essay on the evils of technology? Is it art? Is it just tripe?For those who need to simplify it with one POV, here's a new message: get over yourselves!If you are the type of film-goer who primarily likes an easily identifiable storyline, you will most likely not enjoy this film, so don't even try.If you are one who is sick-and-tired of environmentalist "gobbly-gook", then you will probably be preset in a mind frame that will not allow you to enjoy this film (and I'm not being judgmental about it - I'm just stating the truth).If you are a zealous environmentalist, you will probably enjoy the film but will give it some moral prejudice that I doubt even the director initially intended in setting out on this project.But, if you have an open mind and are willing to view a film that gives one an alternative view of what life on this planet is about, then you will probably be marveled at the beauty and serenity that abounds in this film. This film doesn't simply put down technology or the advances of our civilization. It shows us (as Gandhi put it) that there is more to life than making it faster. This film is an incredible journey on the natural wonders of our world, as a counter-perspective on the many films that explore the technological wonders of our world.If you can see beyond black-and-white perspectives (one way or another) you will see this film for the spectacular exploration of natural beauty that it is. It is artistic as well as informative. It is as beautiful as a Monet painting, and as exacting as a cello concerto. This film is about more than storylines and artistic expression. It is about experiencing the world as it is.If you need to be morally judgmental about this work of art, then you are missing the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Snow capped mountains appear to set the opening landscape for a monkey sitting in a natural hot spring. Tribes recreate the Balinese monkey chant. Monks meditate and perform rituals. There is no narration, just music, sound effects, and visuals.We see volcanoes, portraits of natives in face paint, funeral dances, and beautiful waterfalls with rainbows. We see city life (factories, subways, chicken factories, circuit board manufacturing, a meditating monk with a bell, and the homeless) sometimes played at fast speeds by the director, who (in his 'A Closer Look') says he wants to record everyday events in an interesting way.Then the visual journey turns a bit educational, exotic, and dark. We ghostly observe death camps, the Tiananmen square, oil fires, and portraits of soldiers with weapons. Mass rituals ensue, Islamic worshipers are nicely captured, ornate palaces, and other religious dances.The final scenes recall the beautiful beginnings and showcase an eclipse, the sun, the stars, and rotating dancers."Baraka" has selective and beautiful cinematography. It's not 'Planet Earth' that tries to understand behavior. It's more interested in supposed universal archetypes as if alive 'in our very cells'.I enjoyed the visions of Egyptian monuments, the whole opening winter scenes of the hot springs, the waterfalls, the stars at night, the pyramid style agriculture, the Islamic worshipers walking at Mecca, the artwork inside religious palaces, and the stature soldiers in China. Most of all I like that the director took care and time to create a work of art. But I thought it's message was absurd, unclear, and scattered at times.*Criticism Follows! Fans Should Avoid.*I think it misses many aspects of our humanity, such as science, philosophy, reason, and non-religious morality. For example, the monkey sitting in the hot springs demonstrates absolutely masterful cinematography (and it just plain looks cool), but the point behind it is nuts. The director labels it 'meditation' and has the monkey sit in for a meditating monk, as if monkeys can meditate just well as a thinking human being (as if the only thought needed to understand these images and ideas are accessible at the level of unintelligent little cells).If 'Baraka' is a correct view of humans, please help us! People have nuclear bombs!This film is very viewable if you want to see some of the absurdities of humans. We have some of the craziest beliefs on the planet, but sometimes those ideas get us to behave in novel ways. This film allows the viewer to sit like a ghost and observe rituals that wouldn't happen without ancient traditions and superstitions. These very rituals could be turned to more resourceful ends, so perhaps we have something to learn from its emphasis on dances, natives, rituals, and meditation - maybe we could use them to get people to behave in patterns ideal for scientific advancement.But I had the feeling that the film reduces our humanity to our superstitions, our environment, our 'spiritual' oddities, our homeless, our wars, and our mindlessness. The only part of our minds even remotely portrayed on film is our creativity. We create customs and traditions that modify our behaviors into new arrangements. But most captured by the film are ancient and in opposition to progress and future creativity. It utters the typical conservative, or even liberal, desires to preserve cultural heritages and refuse to let them go extinct or evolve to more thoughtful and uplifting patterns.But is this all we are? Do we think? Do we progress and engage in science? Are we mere unchanging, nutty monkeys? It seems we also adapt to our environment and manipulate nature to further our power over nature. NASA is one of the greatest examples because it explores in such a disciplined way, rather than in the way a business and profit driven scientist does in a Michael Crichton novel.Where are the images of us going to the moon? Where are our giant telescopes (including the Hubble), our particle accelerators, our mathematical geniuses, our growth in technology (which requires intelligent workers, not lines of automaton human workers), our advancements in medicine, our discovery of atoms or evolution or genes or relativity or quantum theory, our modernization of advanced capitalism and small business (not just chicken farms and old style labor factories), and our electronic communications and connections.The ending completely lost me and had me thinking people are really, really close to self-extinction. We see a circle of people watching a native jump up and down, worshipers circling religious sites, people publicly bathing and praying -- we're done for! Forget all your efforts kids, don't worry about studying, your efforts are little compared to the circle of wandering and dancing and jumping morons and the meditating monkeys of the world!</fullReview>

They look for some sort of message that the movie is supposed to say 'look how humans are destroying earth' or 'look at the state of our planet.' At no point in the film or even on the box does it say this. On the box it does say ' captures the very essence of man's relationship with earth, both harmonious and catastrophic', but this does not for a second suggest that the whole film is about humans ruining earth. This movie is simply supposed to be aesthetically pleasing. It is the same as looking out your window, or taking in a view, but here you can see further, see views and things in countries you may never see. It shows you the wold you live in, both cities and country, the diversity of culture and the different looks of land. Being so critical with this movie is just anal, you might as well look out your window and criticize that tree for being too tall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning visuals, gorgeous soundtrack, a superb look at the life of our planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating...this is a movie that everyone over the age of 20 should see. Indeed it's my favourite movie of all time. The film consists of sequences shot in nearly 100 countries, of different human cultures and people(singing, dancing, chanting, resting), animals in their natural habitat - extraordinary shots that make you feel like you're right there with them and can see what they're thinking, and landscapes both beautiful and terrible. There are several sections to the film each evoking a different emotion, but the overriding impression is of complete awe at the sheer beauty in the world. You have no idea how diverse this planet is until you've seen this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was profoundly touched by this stunning masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen hundreds of movies. The derivative business of artificially lavish spectacles has produced thinner and thinner gruel for the soul. Ron Fricke's "Baraka" is a full-course gourmet meal in heightened Reality. Stirring music, compelling cinematography, and flawless editing achieved an unforgettable synthesis of mystical expression.The "lamentation" chapter concludes with three white-painted women of Japan doing a loose, tragic dance before a dark red backdrop. I've always been able to take or leave Dance in movies, and never understood the big deal about synchronized dancers or why people found them entertaining. The use of slight slow motion here (and throughout the film) lent great dignity to the dancers. For the first time in my life, I was truly moved by their art. Like the Spirits in Dickens' Christmas Carol, Baraka took me on an unflinching journey of our world's heartbreaking sorrows.The journey is worth taking--hope is not lost. After all the beauty, frenzy, and mystery of our world, Baraka goes into the sobering (and somehow comforting) field of Time. The juxtaposition of modern public statues and the ancient ruins of lost empires was brilliantly handled. Without being heavy handed, Baraka issues a sacred call for peace and brotherhood instead of strife and destruction. If you're inclined toward holistic, right-brain perception, you will treasure Baraka. I've watched it six times and it still gives me a calm fuzzy white-light feeling in the "third eye" region of my brain.Thanks to the IMDb for putting the link from Koyaanisqatsi's cinematographer to this film. I discovered it here and ordered it from Amazon.com the same day. The Hi-Fi VHS version was incredibly powerful, with rich color and clean crisp images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly stunning work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first say this (which was two days ago), I had no idea what to expect. I had been off watching movies for a long time, simply because I felt that film making was no longer an art, and merely a way to make money. My best friend invited me to her house for a little movie night. Finally, I agreed to come, as long as we could watch something that didn't involve singing high schoolers. She promised me we wouldn't, then told me her little sister wouldn't be there so we could watch what ever we wanted.It turned out to be Baraka. She refused to explain to me what it was about and just popped it into the DVD player. After watching for five minutes, I was captivated. The whole world had suddenly been brought into my friend's living room and into two twelve-year-olds' eyes. It was amazing to see so many people-in suffering and in happiness-and know they are not so different from ourselves.Many moments were tearjerkers-i.e, the WWII concentration camps, the homeless children begging for money, the poor Indian people in the dumps, etc., so by the end of the film we were wiping tears away from our eyes. Even the most beautiful parts made me cry-like the Whirling Dervishes. Just seeing something so different and wonderful made me sad to think it could all be destroyed by the senseless wars we get ourselves into.Not many movies can be called art. It truly takes a lot to make a film worthy of that title. This one deserves it. It helped me rekindle my interest in cinema and drove me to watch some of the greatest movies ever made. Baraka not only changed the way I saw the world and it's people, it changed the way I looked at cinematography and what truly makes the greatest artists great. This movie will fill you with hope and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nature and civilization, in wonderful 70mm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a better appreciation for Baraka the second time around, as I could really get further into what director Ron Fricke, simply, wants us to see. The first half of the film, and even going into the scenes showcasing different degrees of civilization, gives the impression of the best National Geographic film, visual-wise, ever made. In fact, it almost has something in common with the silent documentaries, by telling little snippets of situations and looks without a shred of narration. This time though Frike- following under his previous DP success of Koyanosquatti- uses the camera to his utmost advantage. Through crisp pans and tilts, followed later by truly spellbinding fast-motion photography of the cities, the visions given to us are freshened, untarnished in some way. And the mixture of images, from the simplest at the photographers disposal (just putting faces, animals, mountains and the clearest ocean), to the primely ritualistic.Two scenes specifically, amid all of the various successes in experimenting with the progression of the movements, still shake my consciousness. One is the truly other-worldly scene of the hundreds of natives doing a ritualistic chant and, well, groove, as image and sound combine to just tear apart expectations. The other parts lie in the glimpses of the soon-to-be metropolis cities, the roughness and the pieces of buildings and life put together. It's a memorable experience, if you give it a chance or at least might be in the mood for some feature-length trips into the sections of Earth circa 1992. There's nothing overly philosophical about it, but if it does stir some thoughts it's not a bad thing; like the best documentaries it informs with a direct point of view, this time with some intensive curiosities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Consider yourself lucky if you get to watch this movie in the correct state of mind. It's a journey of glimpses into the nature of the human animal and the rock in which we inhabit. Observations of our culture's spiritual impact on the earth and our own selves. An examination of the globally silent celebration we all share. A God's eye point of view forcing you to look straight into the mirror for the first time. Who or what are we? Just what is it that's going on here? Not a word is spoken in this dance of glorious cinematography into man's most iconic visual and musical metaphor for existence. However, you must be in the right state of mind.

		<shortDescription>Films like these still needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently re-viewed this film and still believe that the message is needed. While I have heard detractors say that the message in this film of environmentalism and social justice is "simple-minded" and that they have, as film critics, achieved a level at which they are above these types of things, obviously we as humans are nowhere near being beyond this level. As you grow older perhaps films such as these become again sofisticated, especially if you are in the sciences or social sciences and admit in the end that you don't have all the answers to the age-old questions posed silently by this film: processes of creation and destruction. It is now 2004 and we are no closer to understanding the implications of environmental and human desctruction shown on this film as we were when it was first released. Film critics who are tired of this type of message perhaps need a few more years of research and living to again appreciate simplicity.</fullReview>

When looking for a social evening of chatting and eating, the film is an excellent background feature to dip in and out of when the talk dries up. The images also provide talking points, such as images of an aborigine cut with the image of a lizard - why was that? Or the image of the battery chicks, thrown around as if they were a bundle of tennis balls - an interesting clip that jars with the rest of the film.In all, it is a must see film, but one that needs less popcorn, and more of a mixed mezze.</fullReview>

For many people Baraka is the definitive film in this style. Breathtaking shots from around the world show the beauty and destruction of nature and man. Coupled with an incredible soundtrack including on site recordings of The Monks Of The Dip Tse Chok Ling Monastery."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, "wow" is all I could say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A travelogue-type documentary would have been much more enjoyable to watch. However, the director makes no mention of the people or places being filmed, so the camera floats around the globe, aimlessly, for the full length of the movie. Which wouldn't be so bad if Mr. Fricke didn't take such pains to deny the existence of his camera. I'm no big champion of cinema verite, but watching some of these scenes, like say a tribal dance, is unsettling precisely because the depth Mr. Fricke's camera goes into these people's lives and rituals as it continues to refuse acknowledging its own affect on them. In other words, Mr. Fricke seems willing and able to engage in the dynamic between himself and the viewer. At the same time he denies the humanity between himself and his subjects, many of whom look confused and bewildered, presumably not having the slightest clue how their images will be appropriated and sold. It is this denial of one half of "the equation" of humanity in the production of this film that is perhaps its most critical flaw - as presumably the film's whole "point" rests on the very attempt to tie all of humanity, films and film-makers and audiences included, together. The movie then becomes a frustrating exercise in trying to ascertain the "reality" of Mr. Fricke's camera, not the apparent wonder of humanity. The only thing the film has going for it is Mr. Fricke's gifted use of slow-mo and time-lapse photography. It quickly becomes tiresome though - after the novelty wore off, I was left to sit through the next 80 minutes wondering when the camera would finally have something to say.</fullReview>

I found the sections covering the modern cities like New York to be the most interesting even if it basically consisted of using time-lapse photography.In the end I found this film unsatisfying because it had no overall point. Sure, the images (even on television) were often striking and beautiful but the director only occasionally makes them into something cohesive. Perhaps narration from a specific viewpoint would have given the film more of a purpose.Overall, a disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really hard call when it comes down to a mark out ten.Firstly, for it to have been made at all, it deserves 10/10. The quality of the camera work deserves (in my opinion) around 8.5/10. If you are one of those 80% of Americans who don't even own a passport, I'd strong suggest you never bother to waste 92 minutes of your time seeing how the majority of the planet works.I reckon there's only a tiny, tiny percent of that 80% to whom this film would make any impact. And also, I guess, even widening the horizons of a tiny percentage of that 80% would make a difference.Alternatively, if you agree with the concept that "No man is an island", it's 92 Minos of chill that allows you to re-focus on the fact that we all travel on the spaceship earth.At this level, there are several problems. Mainly that Coppola/Reggio/Glass/Fricke have already covered much of this ground - with the "Koyaanisqatsi" trilogy, which if nothing else was one of the originators of this concept, and with Glass as the composer, has a unique and ground breaking (and now much copied) sound track.Also, there are more recent concepts (eg "One Giant Leap") which move the original idea forward.So, in summary, I'd rate this as about a 6.5 on IMDb, but a five star on Amazon to encourage anyone who had ever really considered the concept to get involved.Anyway, preaching over - would love to hear from anyone who agrees or doesn't!! Merry Christmas to everyone, Roger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10% art, and 90% male bovine waste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackson Pollack defended his art by arguing that a painting was literally just a layer of paint on a two dimensional surface. In this manner, he could claim that his work technically deserved to be hung alongside the masterpieces of Rubens, Michelangelo, and Jacques-Louis David. But to the layperson, that argument amounts to a hill of beans. Ok, so Baraka is a "film" (do you see what I'm getting at here?). I watch films to be entertained, not to think or be pounded with parallels, subtle messages and 'the grand scheme of things.'Baraka is an exercise in capturing the diversity of the human culture inhabiting Earth, touching down many times (through editing) on the criminal infestation of the self-righteous Western culture in parts of the world where the Western culture has no business being (especially with the highest possible quality 70mm camera). This arrogance is instantly communicated by the dramatic opening hook of the movie, which shows a wild primate relaxing in a hot spring. (it's bad enough that we force other human cultures to conform to what we consider to be the (disgustingly misguided) optimal way of life, but to go so far as to introduce a wild, naturally water-fearing primate species that water is for more than consumption is just WRONG. Millions of years of nature went right down the drain the day National Geographic threw a monkey into a watering hole to see how it would react). Regardless, the collection of high-quality stock photography known as Baraka may inspire cinematographers to employ innovative and seamless time-lapse techniques that they may have been previously unaware of, but I would hardly call this a "film" as we know "film" today. I can ponder this work and emerge with a pretty good bead on things if I REALLY force myself to, but to be honest, this is a pretty time consuming piece that will force you to look at your watch more than any film you've seen before (unless you've seen the pseudo rain forest film "Der Ursprung Der Nacht" ["The Origin of Night"], finished in 1978 by the German artist Lothar Baumgarten. Now that's a film that you REALLY have to struggle to make sense of (and it's 20 minutes longer and 13 times more boring than Baraka)). There's nothing new here. If Ron Fricke wanted to introduce his audience to samples of culture that he believes we may have been previously unaware of, I would have liked to have had many more shots of places that weren't such recognizable cultural hotspots of the world.</fullReview>

The usual cries of 'war' and 'corruption and destruction of the environment' and 'loss of human dignity' are offered an only salvation in spirituality and religion. But the film attempts to present all religions as valid and holders of a truth, and melodramatically at that. Shots of New York busy streets and chickens down a conveyor belt are SUPPOSED to make me forget that life can be more than just barefoot dancing in front of earthen huts with no electricity, no vaccination, no dental care...It's always hypocrites that say 'oh this is so bad the way we're living' but then fail to go off to Siberia or the Amazon or the Sahara and live there, if they really want to get away from it all..It's an intellectually poor film with several muddled ideas about the meaning of life that has, nonetheless, some good moments for which you have to see it at least once. It's OK so long as it doesn't actually move you in any way, it shouldn't make you think because it comes with NOTHING.Nothing new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pioneering films like Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi and Naqoyqatsi divide those who are aware of our planet and how we have succumbed to a society of eagerness that drives us to survive with pityful qualities. The insight to other methods of exsitence is a pleasure to the western culture (culturless, depending on how you see it) can open our minds to recognise what part we play in out civilisation on this planet.This film represents with a frail structure and story images of the people and places of our planet in all of its capacity. It's a mind dwelling journey and portrayed well, though I do not agree with the soundtrack - its weak and acts only to flavour our ears away from otherwise silence. The music bares very little if any relation or emotion sincere to the images. The music gets on my nerves, no development, and very little compotional thought. I do feel that with a presentation like this, the music should play as vital role as the visuals. The Qatsi trilogy music and image is very closely related.There are many simililarities to the Qatsi trilogy but of course enough is different to keep watching. Some great filming and ideas but this is clearly an attempt at something that has already been done and a remake genre is not necessary as it does not really present anything new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I will say that those 3 stars I gave this movie are simply for the photography. This movie was beautifully shot, great landscapes, etc.Now for the rest of it.I watched this movie while under the influence (not alcohol), and while normally this would increase my interest in almost everything, this movie bored me. While I marveled at how beautiful the shots were, the director holds the shot in one place looking at almost nothing (maybe somebody standing there, simply staring at the camera) for a lot longer than he should've. So, once I had taken in all the scene had to offer, I still had to wait through anywhere from a minute to five just for a scene change. The music was repetitive and dull, seemingly picked out of one of those "World Music" CDs from Time Life that you see advertised late at night. I was just so bored I actually fell asleep a few times.All of this while a bunch of other friends of mine marveled at how the message seemed to transcend the images and made so much sense that it touched their souls.I read the other comments, about how this was a life changing movie, etc., etc. To me, this wasn't a movie, there was no message, it was just a way that the director could get money and then travel the world for free and stage shots with locals with the "Do something that the Americans would find weird." message in mind.Again, if you're a huge fan of cinematography, pick this up. If you want something coherent and not presented with such a vague, pretentious message, go watch something actually entertaining.</fullReview>

A bunch of pretentious artsy junk churned out to impress those whose tiny minda enjoyed Memento.</fullReview>
