		<shortDescription>Ceylan's Best Film for Several Years Exposes the Superficialities of Modern Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Cappadochia, central Anatolia, WINTER SLEEP (KIS UYKUSU) focuses on the life of Ayd&#x131;n (Haluk Bilginer) a retired actor who now runs the Hotel Othello. The name is significant, as it reveals his true preoccupation with performance, a trait reinforced by the framed bills on his study wall. With plenty of family money at his disposal he has no need to work, but that does not stop him from screwing every penny out of his tenants with the help of his henchperson Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan). Although perpetually drawing attention to his poor background and unhappy childhood, it's clear that Ayd&#x131;n's life revolves totally around himself; and that the only way he can salve his conscience is to make charitable donations, preferably anonymously. With KI&#x15e; UYKUSU we are back on thematic territory that director Nuri Bilge Ceylan previously explored in KASABA. He readily acknowledges Chekhov as an inspiration for creating a world where no one has much to do except talk to one another. Ayd&#x131;n busies himself with a variety of tasks, including writing a column for the local newspaper and writing a book on the history of the Turkish theater. His sister Necla (Demet Akba&#x11f;) spends much of her time lolling on the sofa and wondering whether she should forgive her ex-husband for an unhappy marriage. Ayd&#x131;n's wife Nihal (Melissa Sözen) is equally indolent; her sole aim in life seems to be to chair a committee of prosperous locals dedicated to raising money for the local school.Stylistically speaking KI&#x15e; UYKUSU is slightly different from Ceylan's earlier work; there are fewer reflective sequences designed to prompt reflection on the landscape and the elements, and more face-to-face confrontations between the protagonists. They emphasize the basic emptiness of their lives, as they have nothing to but talk and talk, in contrast to their tenants - for example the local imam Hamdi (Serhat K&#x131;l&#x131;ç) who wonders about taking a second job so as to make ends meet. On the other hand these lengthy conversations draw attention to the protagonists' love of surfaces; unable (or unwilling) to engage with life's realities, they would rather talk at rather than with one another.The unbelievable landscapes of Cappadochia in winter, with its fairy chimneys and unspoiled Anatolian terrain, offers a point of contrast to the characters' musings. While they spend their time both literally and mentally imprisoned within Ayd&#x131;n's hotel, the landscape offers a reminder of timeless virtues, as well as the fact that nature continues to flourish in spite of humanity's best attempts to destroy it.The film comes to a climactic conclusion when Ceylan brings the indolent characters into contact with those forced to eke out an existence in harsh conditions. Nihal offers a financial gift to Hamdi's family; but fails to understand how such an act of apparent goodwill represents the ultimate insult. As Hamdi's brother &#x130;smail (Nejat &#x130;sler) contends, it is nothing more than conscience money to atone for the fact that Ayd&#x131;n's family were responsible for causing &#x130;smail's son Ilyas's (Emirhan Doruktutan's) pneumonia earlier on in the film. Meanwhile Ayd&#x131;n discovers to his cost that the local educator Levent (Nadir Sar&#x131;bacak) has a jaundiced view of all wealthy philanthropists. Yet such experiences do not lead to any form of redemption. The film ends with Ayd&#x131;n and Nihal sitting morosely in their deserted hotel, looking out of the window at the snow-covered vista beyond, imprisoned by their lack of perception.This film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes; it deserves every success. A modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the chance to see tonight this movie in "Positif" (a french, highly rated, cinema review) "avant Premi?re". When I made the usual reservation for Positif readers/ subscriber, the reservation told me (and it is listed in the invitation) "we remind you that this movie lasts 3h and 16 minutes....". Unusual....I was aware of that, but , as Michel Ciment pointed out, in his introduction, there are 1h 30 minutes movies which seem to last 4 hours....and here, "on ne voit pas le temps passer" un-consciously used the title of a song by Jean Ferrat).And, indeed, this is true. Very few "important" events happen in the film, but the degradation of the relation between the two main characters takes place little step by little step, and each dialogue is captivating, while the cast (all the cast) is wonderfully playing. Some scenes are surprising by their underneath violence (how a gift turns out to be an insult , and how the outrage is returned, is a flabbergasting sequence) The location in Anatolia, the winter atmosphere, and the remarkable photography adds a piece of charm to the film. At the end, you will remember that it all started by a little stone thrown at a car.... and wonder how you were so much immediately entrapped by the intrigue, so much that it could have lasted as long as the mother and the whore, another lengthy movie, you would not have complained.I do not want to spoil you by describing the plot, but it brings so many reflections about society, aging of a relationship, and a couple, that ... you will want to see it again (which I will certainly do when it is theater released in August). It is an absolute masterpiece, and likely the best film of the decade......(and of course Ceylon best so fat) Go to see it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never seen something like this before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing Kis Uykusu, I was sure that poetry in cinema can only be achieved through the means of lyrical texts and enchanting images. Tarkovsky, Tarr, Lynch, and more recently Zvyagintsev through their dreamlike and time-transforming images allowed me to feel something that seemed infinite. And still, after seeing their movies, the only comment I have is a gesture - my right hand bumps the left side of my chest. No words needed, it touched a part of me that nothing else, it seems, can touch. And here we have a perfect opposite. Apart from the dreamy environment in which the film takes place - an environment into which I would gladly move every winter with a few of my best friends - everything is very realistic. Lots of over-the-shoulder reverse shots and looooots of dialog. But the dialog is perfect. It takes on Shakespearian proportions, intertwining subjects of love, respect, dignity, man's responsibility towards society, man's self deception, nature against grace, power against subtlety. All that is caught up into a tale of irony, which revolves around Aydin, who owns a hotel named Othello. He is a writer, but is questioned by his sister about his sincerity. Does he write whole-heartedly or only as a consequence of his ego? Why does he donate money?Aydin is a strong, influential man, very similar to many 50+ men I know. His sister is experienced and intelligible, maybe even more than he, but seems she doesn't have the energy to care for any cause. The contrasts in their world-views underline the theme, I cherished the most while watching this movie: Why should we care for a worldly cause if we can't even learn to care for small causes, care for people that are closest to us? Shouldn't we first learn how to feel people around us? Aydins wife seemingly still hasn't forgotten how it is to feel. She understands poor people, but has never been in a penniless situation herself. That's her Achilles tendon; she constantly returns to the same point after a good deed, she never goes beyond. None of the characters do. It's like a spiral that one can not get out of. Unlike the film as a whole (a connected circle which really offers you understanding of the subject), the progress of the characters doesn't seem circular but spiral. By means of tiny progressions and by wisdom they acquire through the opposites they find in people they love most, these characters start to learn about themselves. When I was talking to two of my friends after the film, (even though they weren't as thrilled about the film as I was) they both remarked that they were constantly comparing the film characters and situations to the people and situations from their own life. Even though we haven't experienced the exact same situations as the characters did, we've experienced the same emotions. At least once, we've posed to ourselves the exact same questions about our life experience. It's this amazing universality that strikes you, in a positive way, the hardest. Even though we only get a cinematographically astounding shot every now and then, which is really the cherry on top of the cake, this film is in its core carried by the universal human experience which is put into shape of a moralistic tale.But this moralistic tale never preaches to us; it only gently sways our emotions, exploring the dualities in ourselves and never, even at its very end, allowing us to have an absolute opinion about who is right and who is wrong. It's like life itself, never only positive or negative but always somewhere in the middle; light in dark, dark in light.Read this along with my other film reviews (Leviathan, 12 angry men, The imitation game) on: http://filmmind.tumblr.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece from one of the greatest film makers of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winter Sleep is a masterpiece by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a film shining with literary eloquence and incisive social criticism. Aydin ("intellectual" in Turkish) is a failed former actor, now a hotel owner with sufficient inheritance to make him command the stage as a condescending "king" of a village in Cappadocia. He feels licensed to instruct, intrude and judge, not only on his pitiable tenants, but also on his disaffected young wife Nihal and divorced self-doubting sister Necla. This sentiment ostensibly extends to poor, uneducated and religious classes of the country, making Aydin a stereotype of the Turkish elite. The brutal taming of the horse is an allegory of his marriage; young and pretty Nihal is just another decorative item in his life, not an individual with her own rights and pursuits. Aydin also epitomizes a male-dominated society, cutting across levels of education and affluence. A glimmer of hope comes with a stone breaking the glass. While ruthlessly and decisively able to overpower everyone else in his reign, Aydin is disturbingly challenged by a stubborn 10 year-old boy Ilyas (Arabic equivalent of Elijah, a harbinger of the Messiah). Putting the lens on the perpetually pretending psyche of the western-styled intellectual, Winter Sleep portrays the Turkish nation struggling between the East and the West. Aydin claims to have ideals and ideas but has no intention to make a difference for the good, does not even attempt to empathize with his fellow citizens. His articulate quote from Shakespeare echoes a confession. It's no coincidence that Nuri Bilge Ceylan was charmed by Chekhov, a like-minded author from yet another nation torn between civilizations. Hats off to 2014 Palme d'Or judges for their audacity. By recognizing the value of Ceylan's work, they have enticed global audiences to risk 3 hours 16 minutes of their time to a non-commercial film, a feast of cinematography and acting bundled with literary gratification.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I saw Uzak (Distant, his first film) years ago and enjoyed it immensely, I've made a point of seeing every film Nuri Bilge Ceylan makes. Unfortunately, his esteem in my mind was gradually fading while others, like the Russian Andrey Zvyagintsev's were rising, his Leviathan is an excellent film. With Winter Sleep, though, Ceylan has made a masterpiece- easily his finest film, and I am in awe of his talent. To make a film that is a character study of a small hotel owner's life at its twilight into such a profound meditation on so many themes...pure genius! And to learn that this movie didn't get nominated for an Academy Award...fortunately the French awarded it top prize at Cannes. It's better than Ida and Leviathan (though Leviathan is a powerful, important film). Extremely well acted; beautifully filmed. The power, though, is in the dialogues...rare the emotional and intellectual intelligence on display here. An absolute must-see for fans of art-house foreign language cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rich portrait of interpersonal tensions and emotional sufferings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Nuri Bilge Ceylan had made adventurous efforts in his movie "Winter Sleep". Rewardingly, Palme d'Or Awards was passed onto his hands in 2014. A stunning feature of this movie was the eloquence of major characters. Because of this distinct feature, the audiences need feel comfortable to catch up with a large amount of intellectual debates and accusative questionings between the characters, in order to tap into the characters' inner worlds.During three hours and sixteen minutes, a rich and deep portrait of various emotional sufferings are gradually unfolded. The audiences are exposed to intense conflicts between the rich and the poor, a complacent brother and his critical divorcée sister, an egoistic husband and an unhappy young wife and also a naive philanthropist and a resentful villager. Also, there are explosions and accumulations of negative emotional outbursts such as distrust, prejudice, loneliness, fear, suffocation, delusion, cynicism, hopelessness and hatred.While viewing these interpersonal tensions and emotional despairs, it seems to me that our characters were all wearing shackles which had stopped them from finding their true inner strength. For Aydin, the shackle was his distrust and emotional rigidity. For Necla, it was her disapproving attitude and reluctance to change. For Nihal, it was her pessimistic view of her future. For Hamdi, it was his deeply-rooted shame and hatred towards the rich. For Hamid's little son Ilysa, it was his inability to fight against social unfairness. For Hamdi's bother Ismail, it was his involuntary submissiveness and unresisting. And perhaps due to these emotional scars, they all felt deprived of freedom and thus pushed each other into corners in order to feel justified. Mr Nuri Bilge Ceylan opened an abundance of philosophical discussions in this movie. Seemingly he was unwilling to provide effective solution to ease any of these social and interpersonal tensions depicted in the movie. Nevertheless, Mr Ceylan did examine Aydin's self-revelation after he clashed with his sister Necla and his wife Nihal. When Aydin's false ego was badly stricken, the loneliness and pain in Aydin's heart must have been unbearably agonizing. From that moment, the movie started to openly unveil Aydin's vulnerabilities. He contemplated at his parents' graveyard. His messy hair was flying nowhere in the snow, looking terribly sad. When he showed genuine care to the young motorcyclist, that warmth didn't returned back to him. The releasing of a wild horse back to Anatolia steppe could indicate his longing to loosen his own rigidity and forceful mind. While waiting for his run-away train to Istanbul, he frankly demanded the company of his assistance Hidayet. He paid attention to a dead fox lying beside the rails in the snow and even checked birds of prey on the nearby tree. He watched the dying rabbit pitifully during hunting. At the end of the movie, Aydin admitted to himself that he was unable to live through life without Nihal. At this point, when Aydin acknowledged his emotional vulnerabilities, it appeared that he regained his peace and order, and even kicked off his long-term writing project on "the History of Turkish Theatre". Aydin perhaps realized that he no longer needed to be the superior one who was emotionally distant to people and himself, who felt like a king by being a columnist in his imaged kingdom, who loved his own civilized manner to contrast others'clumsiness, who was relying on rigidity to feel strong? Overall, this is a thought-provoking movie, managed by a master director and performed by impeccable cast. I would love to watch this movie again after a few years, as I wish to comprehend more of its richness and depth when life rewards me with more personal experiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Brace yourself for 3 hours and 19 minutes of heavy listening. Yes, the film was named Palme d'Or at the most recent Cannes, and the dialogue is exceptionally well written, but this isn't one you can just kick back and enjoy. It requires some effort. The two big "action" sequences involve a 10 year old boy tossing a rock and later, his too proud father dropping something into a fireplace. The real action occurs between the ears of the viewer as we assimilate the moods and nuances and double-meanings that accompany the stream of conversations.Award-winning director Nuri Bilge Ceylan co-wrote the script with his wife Ebru Ceylan, and that probably attributes to the sharpness and poignancy of the relationships between Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) and his wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen) and his sister Necla (Demet Akbag). Much of the film is devoted to one of two things: Aydin making himself feel important, or Nihal and/or Necla voicing their opinions on why he isn't. While that may sound simple, the wordplay and grounded performances often leave us with the feeling that we are eavesdropping on very private conversations.Filmed in the breathtakingly beautiful Cappadocia region of Anatolia, the geological spectrum contrasts mightily with the near claustrophobic interior scenes that dominate the run time. In fact, when one of the characters does venture outdoors, viewers will find themselves breathing easier and in relief of the stressful intimacy of other scenes. Hotel Othello is cut directly into one of the more picturesque hillsides of the area, and owner Aydin spends his days locked away in his office, kicking off his latest article bashing societal and morality changes within the village. Aydin has a pretty easy life, as he has inherited the hotel and numerous income producing rental properties from his father. Aydin's career as a stage actor also adds a bit to his local celebrity (and ego). He fancies himself an important man with an important voice, and never hesitates to broadcast his charitable offerings.Aydin lives at the hotel with his much younger wife Nihal, and his recently divorced sister Necla. The dysfunction abounds as none of the three much respect the others, and manage to express this in the most incisive, passive-aggressive ways possible. There are two extended (each pushing 30 minutes) exchanges that are unlike anything you may have ever seen on screen. One has Necla letting Aydin know what she thinks of his articles, while the other has Nihal finally coming clean with her feelings of being held back, emotionally captive. Both scenes are captivating and powerful, yet voices are never raised and facial expressions are crucial. This is intimate filmmaking at its best and most uncomfortable ? psychological warfare would not be too extreme as a description.Conflict is crucial for a dialogue-driven film. Some of the best include My Dinner with Andre, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and 12 Angry Men. These are the type of movies that cause us to study all the subtleties within a scene ? not just what is said, but how it is said and how the message is conveyed. Pride, loneliness and despair run rampant through the characters here and the philosophical discussions force each to lay bare their soul. For so little action, an undercurrent of wild emotions flows through every scene. In addition to the three leads, there is a character named Hamdi (an Islamic teacher/adviser, played by Serhat Mustafa Kilic) who plays the role of peace-keeper and mediator. His constant smile is but a mask he is forced to wear in his role, and I found his character the most painful of all to watch. The title may be interpreted as either a "hibernation" or "sleep-walking through life's final stages", and both fit very well. The hotel provides a cave-like hiding place for Aydin, as he pretends to play his final role ? that of an important man in the village. There are some truly masterful moments in the film, and it's easy to see why it appeals to only a certain type of film goer. Inspired by the short stories of Chekhov (The Wife, Excellent People), as well as the writings of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Voltaire, means the viewer is investing emotionally in characters quite full of resentment and oh so dishonest with themselves. It's an undertaking that is difficult, but does offer the opportunity to test one's listening skills and ability to read body language. It also comes with wisdom such as ? Donkeys lead camels (you'll have to watch the movie!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece. One of the best films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The truth is, when you read that this monster of a 3.5 hour film is the shortest 3.5 hour film you would have ever viewed, you don't believe or understand how that could be true... until, at least, you have sat through every satisfying scene of this extraordinary piece of cinema. Every single scene, every single piece of dialogue is acted to and filmed with absolute perfection. The film reels you in from the very beginning and does not let go. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. There is no better way the Director Ceylan could have captured Cappadocia. Having visited myself, I feel as though Ceylan has managed to capture Cappadocia on screen better than I ever saw it through my own eyes in the few days I was there. It is horrifyingly beautiful!!And the main character, Aydin, is a treasure to behold. He is such a talented, but yet flawed man, he is so human. Every character Ceylan has created is so human. That's what makes this film sooo amazing! Every character is so different in nature and personality to the other character, yet we somehow manage to relate to every one of them. This is the kind of film where not much happens, but your jaw drops at every scene because Ceylan has filmed reality better than most of us live it. It is honestly quite scary. Most of our lives mutter on without us ever reflecting on it, properly anyway, because we don't really get the chance. However, when you watch Winter Sleep you can see a part of yourself in pretty much every character. You understand every person's actions in the film and there is no greater exemplification that, at least between the three main characters, the line of good and bad is ever so blurred. Everyone has their reasons, everyone has good intentions, but yet people just cannot get along harmoniously because they are naturally different.Anyway, without going too far, the film is deep, and very interesting to watch. However, at the same time, the film is extremely humorous. Not your typical 'comedy.' In fact, if you like 'comedy' you probably won't laugh once during this film. The film is such an accurate portrayal of reality that it is funny. Watching the films as Turks, ourselves, the depiction of Turkish society, the mannerisms, the behaviourisms, and the actions of the characters, it's akin to living and breathing Turkish culture. I can think of many examples throughout the film, but without extending my review too long, I will only provide one example. For instance, in almost every scene, the characters are drinking tea. So typical. In another scene, as soon the characters finish drinking tea, coffee is ordered. It's not just the outcome, though, that is funny. It's the way Ceylan has captured the scene...so brutally honest, there is no sway from reality whatsoever. I was honoured to be one of the first to watch this film at the Nova Exclusive in Melbourne. We were born and bred in Australia, but our Turkish culture is still imminent in us. This film is so universal everyone can enjoy it, yet somehow it is such an accurate depiction of Turkish culture and manifests the problems we humans all face across the globe - it really is no different no matter what nationality, culture or race you come from - ultimately, we all have to deal with relationship dilemmas!!I found it amazingly funny in an interview I read with the director Ceylan who responded to the potential dark humour in the film..."I don't do comedies - I don't like laughing" - or something along those lines. Just as he muttered those words he burst into laughter himself. Ceylan has a tack for intellectual art. He has created something so beautiful it will require many repeated viewings just to digest the full glory of this masterpiece. I would love to re- watch it immediately!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his latest, Winter Sleep, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's characteristic obsession with his country's variegated topography takes him to Cappadocia, a remote stretch of the Anatolian countryside whose strange mound-like formations provide the backdrop for an intimate tale of marital take-and-no-give that's been stretched (for no apparent reason other than indulgence) to over three hours. Much like the lead character, a charismatic former actor who now runs the Hotel Othello, Ceylan's film doesn't know when to let an argument rest. The obvious analogue here would be Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage; the key difference lies in Winter Sleep's absolute refusal to let anything be at emotional stake. The husband expounds, his wife or sister rebuts, and then he uses his considerable rhetorical acumen to put them in their place. A subplot dealing with a dispute between the hotelier and his tenant farmers seems left over from an earlier film. And in case there were any doubt as to the fatuousness of Ceylan's approach here, look no further than an excruciatingly protracted scene involving an envelope stuffed with money and a crackling fireplace telegraphs its inevitable conclusion from the start. Perhaps such inexorability is Ceylan's true theme. If so, he still has to answer for taking nearly forever to get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Engrossing, Mesmerizing &amp; Satisfying Films Of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Winter Sleep arrives with high expectations but succeeds amazingly well in living up to its new-found honour for this Turkish drama is simply one of the most engrossing, mesmerizing &amp; satisfying narratives to surface on the silver screen in the past year, and is definitely one of the best films of 2014.Set in Anatolia, the story of Winter Sleep concerns Ayd&#x131;n; the wealthy owner of a mountaintop hotel who was once an actor but has since fallen into the hibernation mode over the years. The plot covers the chaos his self-involved persona brings to his small kingdom as the animosity of his loved ones &amp; the poor people under his reign begins surfacing once the winter approaches.Directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, the film takes a very methodical, patient &amp; firm approach with its narrative which does a stellar job in slowly unraveling the inner details of the various characters inhabiting this story. The entire story is an amalgamation of one conversation after another but it's how each discussion begins &amp; ends plus seamlessly switches from one to another that makes it such an immersive experience.The locations are wonderfully chosen, set pieces are finely detailed, the hotel itself creates a calm but secluded ambiance which becomes all the more suffocating on the advent of winter. Camera-work is mostly still yet effective plus the landscapes are beautifully photographed, its 196 minutes of runtime never really bothers for the most part, thanks to its breezy storytelling &amp; the score makes its presence felt just when it's required.Coming to the performances, every single actor here chips in strongly in their given roles &amp; leave nothing to complain about. Haluk Bilginer delivers a magnificent performance as Ayd&#x131;n, and is brilliantly supported by Demet Akba&#x11f; &amp; Melisa Sözen who play his sister &amp; wife, respectively. The rest of the cast also shines since each character is deftly scripted &amp; gradually developed which differentiates them from caricatures.On an overall scale, Winter Sleep is an intensely gripping, masterfully told &amp; exquisitely layered study of a self-righteous character that also takes an interesting look at failing relationships, old age regrets, class divides, and the morals of right &amp; wrong. And despite its challenging runtime, dialogue-driven plot &amp; slow-burn narration, it manages to be a truly immersive &amp; absorbing cinema that's worthy of your time &amp; money. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Shakespeare to Sartre: Excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've spent a long time to write a comment on this movie, as I couldn't rely on my judgment about Nuri Bilge Ceylan, who is one of the best directors that Turkish cinema could have ever nurtured; so it took a very long time. Finally I've come up with something to say. If you're one of the people who's always looking for something worth watching and who are sick of superficial movies with cliché stories, Winter Sleep is what you need. For my point of view, this is Ceylan's second best after Uzak (Distant), the movie which also conquered Cannes Film Festival and many other international festivals.You don't need to know the story ? there isn't one. There are only 3 basic characters, let's say, three reflections of beings represented by real actors of this life. It's not a coincidence that the lead character of the movie was once used to be an actor in the story. And Ceylan is using the actor's real life images on stage to dramatize the effect. So it's not easy not to think of what the real actor has done in real life, who also performed in Shakespeare Globe Festival in Antonius and Cleopatra in UK, and the photo background in his room is quite visible. The character always speaks of the virtues "conscience" and "morality", none of which he has, and also he uses the word "ignorance" as if he is in a war with it. He might not seem ignorant to you, but deep down, he is ignorant to what he is and everyone around him. He is like the emperor over a small capitalist system he's created and looking down on everyone as if they were beneath him. This is why he is struggling so hard to make everyone think that he's got all these virtues. However, just like Sartre's play "No Exit", it is through your actions and by other's reflections upon you that you can define yourself. In Ceylan's play, three main characters of "No Exit" is Aydin, his wife Nihal and his sister Necla. Knowing there's no escape in facing the reality, to what he truly is, the fear of losing overtakes him. Either he has to accept his "essence", or leave ? a spoiler: he can't leave. He must be in "hic et nunc", he is unable to leave.As a reminder of a play in the movie, Shakespeare's play "Richard III" has the most striking quote of the movie: "Conscience is but a word that cowards use, devised at first to keep the strong in awe". , stating Aydin's fear of exposing his true identity and using "morality" as a tool to fight it. The word "conscience" has sickened his wife, Nihal, who can't accept him for what he is anymore, but she isn't able to "choose" her identity either. Therefore she is stuck with him. And his sister Necla disappears right after the truth is spoken to her face: she has done her part in the play.I must say I am amazed by all the references in the movie and it doesn't really need a plot. Ceylan has outdone himself in writing the scenario and of course, most applause should go to the actors who have done an incredible job, especially Haluk Bilginer in creating such an ambiguous character.And thank you Ceylan for speaking up for what is silenced in Turkey, this movie's going to be remembered with one of Cannes Festival's photos, the lead actors holding the text #Soma. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Mindfully mysterious character piece..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turkish screenwriter, film editor, cinematographer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's seventh feature film which he wrote with Turkish screenwriter and art director Ebru Ceylan, premiered In competition at the 67th Cannes International Film Festival in 2014, was screened in the Masters section at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival in 2014, was shot on locations in Turkey and is a Turkey-France-Germany co-production which was produced by producer Zeynep Ozbatur Atakan. It tells the story about a columnist named Aydin who lives in a small town with his wife named Nihal and his divorced sister named Necla, and who one day after meeting a man with his assistant regarding the acquirement of a horse, becomes involved in a situation initiated by a student.Distinctly and precisely directed by Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated interchangeably from the main characters' viewpoints, draws a thematically versatile, non-political and conversationally reflective portrayal of a once promising theatre actor, an uncle whom is preventing his brother from further complicating a predicament and making amends for his nephew's actions, a Japanese couple and a wife engaged in a project. While notable for its distinct milieu depictions, reverent cinematography by cinematographer Gökhan Tiryaki and production design by production designer Gamze Kus, this dialog- driven and narrative-driven story about human complexity which is somewhat inspired by short stories by Russian 19th century author Anton Chekhov, depicts some densely interrelated studies of character and contains a timely instrumental score. This increasingly atmospheric, ironically humorous and internally involving three hour and sixteen minutes narrative feature which is set in Turkey in the 21st century, where the journey into the human soul proceeds and where a husband begins engaging in his spouse's project which she has started independently from him, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, measured continuity, philosophical contemplations on essential questions, concentrated and noteworthy interplay, masterful cinematic scenes and the commendable acting performances by Turkish actors Haluk Bilginer and Serhat Kiliç and Turkish actresses Melisa Sözen and Demet Akba&#x11f;. An ingeniously literary, cinematographically understated and mindfully mysterious character piece which gained, among other awards, the Palme d'Or at the 67th Cannes Film Festival in 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark, non-pithy version of Polanski's Carnage, this character study focuses on a wealthy, aging intellectual (Haluk Bilginer), who owns an isolated hotel where he lives with his young wife (Melisa Sözen) and divorced sister (Demet Akbag). With the arrival of a snowy winter, the relationships between the three deteriorate to a disturbing extent.There is little physical violence in the movie (a slap in the face and an animal shot dead), but the amount of psychological conflict is unsettling. Superb performances and a sharp script make the increasingly venomous confrontations between characters riveting.Once again, writer/director Nuri Bilge Ceylan borrows from great Russian literature: a tense sequence with an envelope full of money is a possible homage to a famous scene in The Idiot, and I counted at least three short tales by Anton Chekhov which inspired various plot developments (A Nightmare, The Wife, Excellent People). 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrittten (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no gainsaying that this is an incredibly beautiful movie, or that the dialog is well written. The problem is that there is much, too much of it. Comparisons to Shakespeare overlook the fact that Shakespeare is a marvel of economy - and also that he wrote action plays, by and large. Each of the dialogs is well-written - but there are too many of them. And with all the talk, some important points of character are never resolved. The central character is Aydin, a retired actor and heir to a number of rental estates in Anatolia. His wife is decades younger. How did they meet? How did the unlikely marriage take place? What did she want or expect? Etc.None of this is addressed - instead everything is expressed in present tense. No one except Necla (Aydin's sister) has a personal history, and even that is only partially described. But all of this is actually pretty important to understanding how they came to where they are.I don't mind pictures in which nothing much happens, which is certainly this one. I do have a problem with movies that seem premised on the notion that simple artiness is sufficient. It isn't.Finally, the incredibly dull musical score consists of various piano selections from the romantic masters - sort of like that Bergman picture in which the only music was a Bach unaccompanied cello suite. That tells you all you need to know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You always float to the surface like olive oil." Necla (Demet Akbag)Although the landscape of Turkey's Anatolia region could have been the center of Winter Sleep, its rugged terrain is not. The heart of this dark world as it prepares for winter is Aydin (Haluk Nilginer), a wealthy landlord and former actor, whose challenges are rent-delinquent commoners and a rebellious young wife, Nihal (Melisa Sozen), who has attained an identity as a seeker of charity for villagers. As his sister suggests above, he has the ability to dominate and set himself apart like olive oil, being nearly lonely with his power.Almost as if director Nuri Bukge Ceylan had wanted not to recreate Dr. Zhivago, this wintry drama (over 3 hours) is not romantic in a traditional sense: no swelling music, no smothering snow, just characters in close quarters gaining warmth from their fires and from their universal need for love. Even Aydin struggles to understand and shepherd Nihal into his conservative world of judgment and accountability as he forces his way into her charity's books to protect her and probably his fortune.When a small boy throws a rock at Aydin's car window, a chain of events unleashes to draw together two proud worlds?owner and vassal?to reconcile pride and owed rent. Running parallel is his fight against Nihal's pride and his own paternalistic intrusion into her world, where he can be counted on to snoop.That's partly because he writes a column in the local newspaper that covers oddities, for Aydin, like a local imam, whose great sin seems to be that he's unkempt and doesn't carry himself like a cleric should. Aydin's sister is there to point out his arrogance and to remind us that even in this remote world human beings can show their pride as well as any American politician.This Palme d'Or winner at Cannes is as commanding as the best laid thriller except that its dialogue is demanding and its sensibility way out of the ordinary, even for the notoriously distancing Steppes. Winter Sleep is neither cold nor soporific?it is life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you embody so many themes in one single movie with such great care and dedication? This motion picture lets you see everything you want to see and perhaps even more. With this I'll also add, its quintessentially a Nuri Bilge Ceylan film, so you cant expect any over- the-top gesture or quirk. Its life at its natural pace. Whether an audience sees it or not, its there, in all its beauty and tragedy.Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) runs a small hotel in Anatolia with his wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen) and his sister Necla (Demet Akbag). His life appears to be a serene one at first. He seems calm, handles everything with care, looks as if he has a grip on almost everything. But does he?When the film begins we have no idea who these people are and by the film ends, its as if we know their core, so much so that its shocking. That is the power only possessed by great films, which this one is, in my mind.With this film, Ceylan has reached to a whole other level of film- making. He not only co-wrote some of the best conversations ever to be captured on film, but also had the ability to stage and dramatize it. On a personal level, I just feel this is that kind of a film which would be cathartic for some, highly profound for others and some might just find it boring owing to its length. But one thing is certain, it has captured the truth of the characters as one would catch lightening in a bottle (if one ever could). Its worth a watch, at least once, and that goes for every single person on earth!Do catch it sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aided by the stunning Anatolian rock formations, 'Winter Sleep' is beautifully shot, especially the final images.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nuri Bilge Ceylan's new film 'Winter Sleep' is a family drama set on a stunning mountain hilltop hotel in Anatolia, Turkey. The ageing Aydin (Haluk Biginer) is the wealthy hotelier, a retired actor who owns a lot of the properties in the area, and spends his days writing for his local newspaper.Aydin is married to the much younger Nihal (Melisa Sozen), and his divorced sister Necla (Demet Akbag) lives on the premises too. Wealthy to the point where he doesn't need to worry about anything, Aydin casually mopes around finding something to do, and generally creating a nuisance of himself. Most people tend to have a reason to dislike him, and this includes his own family. With his wealth extended to his family, these people spend their days doing nothing but still hanker after making a life of purpose.So much time on their hands leads to bitterness, as evidenced in the ongoing bites and petty quarrels between the three of them. Nihal is the curious one, who lives separately from Aydin who gives her the freedom of their modest kingdom. She still feels trapped, blaming Aydin for bringing her down when she's attempting anything of her own making. He's made out to be more monstrous than he seems, slowly being forced out of his own home by everyone.'Winter Sleep' is a contemplative, deeply serious study of wealth, family dynamics and communities. Conversations and arguments are often literate and earnest affairs, discussing anything from the role of the artist, the role of Muslim men in the community, to enabling evil-doers to uncover their own consciences.Aided by the stunning Anatolian rock formations, 'Winter Sleep' is beautifully shot, especially the final images. One majestic scene involving the capture and calming of a horse is a cinematic marvel, and a troubling study of a mans innate desires superceding all others. Although nothing much happens, everything slowly does, as does in life. Even Aydin is forced to change his ways, whether you are rich or poor you still have to earn your happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffocating Virtues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) is a wealthy man, a former actor who now runs a hotel in Cappadocia. He also writes a column for the local newspaper, and is researching for his planned book about the history of Turkish theater. Nihal (Melisa Sözen) is his beautiful and much younger wife. Necla (Demet Akbag) is his divorced sister. Also involved the family of Aydin's poor tenants who could not pay their rent for several months already. The friendly and gregarious Hamdi appeals for compassion, while his older brother, the impetuous jobless ex-con Ismail and his sullen young son Illyas, could not hide their contempt for their landlord. This film is about the various conversations and confrontations between these people. These may begin as abstract debates about not resisting evil or boredom or donations, yet they all end up being very personal. There is no real plot, just a lot of seemingly random dialogue. Although, there are arguments that seemed endless and repetitive, these confrontations were eloquently written with very meaningful words for both sides of the issue. These long talky scenes were riveting despite their length and you hang on to every word they were saying. The performances of the actors of these flawed characters were faultless and so natural.The cinematography of this film is so amazingly beautiful as it magically captured the unique topography of Cappadocia during the wintertime. There were several picture-perfect haunting scenes throughout, specially those about the Anatolian horse, the cemetery, the train tracks, the tree with the birds, the rabbit in the brush, the town, the hotel -- all covered with pristine snow. The close-ups of the actors were all so perfectly framed to achieve maximal drama. The use of mirrors to vary the camera shots were very good. I admit that the 3-hour and 16-minute length of this film can be felt. However, you do not really mind this time running as you listen to intellectually-stimulating emotionally-rich conversation. This film is a masterpiece of world cinema by acclaimed Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, truly worthy of its Palme d'Or during the Cannes Film Festival this summer. This should be a shoo-in to at least be nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You're actually a well-educated, honest, fair and conscientious man. But sometimes you use those virtues to suffocate people, to crush and humiliate them."-NihalLisbon &amp; Estoril Film Festival #1This was the first time I attended the Lisbon &amp; Estoril Film Festival, this year being its 8th edition. This year's festival opened up with a must see, Winter Spleep, a film I absolutely could not wait to watch. It has gotten a lot of great buzz around it, especially since it won the Palm d'Or back in May, which basically catapulted this film into the radar of all movie lovers. I went in with reserves still, because I mean, it's a two hundred minute movie and it is not every picture that can own that run-time, still I was excited and hoping for great things.We follow the mountains and the landscapes of the startling and breathtaking Anatolia, in Turkey. Winter has arrived for these poor, distanced, isolated villages and with it some cold winds and trouble have to come stay. Aydin is a retired theater actor, a rich, influential man within the villages near him. He has now settled down in his hotel in central Anatolia. He seems to be lonesome but mildly happy and satisfied with the life he leads, a simple life that one is. He writes for the local newspaper, he writes about too important matters for such a small newspaper which no one reads. He's working on his new book about the Turkish theater and this way, he's able to keep focus and not lose his mind for the hopeless silence and isolation of the landscapes.Trouble starts when a family, who has lived in a house that Aydin has rented them for many years, can't pay him for their stay in the house. Has a consequence, Aydin's lawyers are obliged to go and rifle that family's belongings and leaving them with little to live with, even their dignity. Aydin, knows little about the matter and lets the lawyers and his friend Hidayet to take care of the problem.The first episode happens when a child, that leaves in that house with his poor family, hits Aydin's car with a rock and consequentially breaking his car window and almost making a car accident happen. Aydin and Hidayet take the child back home, where his father is waiting. The child is soaking wet, since he had fallen in a river while trying to run way. It is here that we have a confrontation between the man who has seen his dignity and the dignity of his family taken away because of their lack of economical possibilities and the man who's basically, even if in an incidental way, the one who has taken it. This is a 5 minute dialogue, which starts very quiet, building up an unbearable tension until a climax that felt unavoidable.That's basically what the film is all about, the movie is narratively driven by its dialogue. The film is divided into a more or less episodic series of dialogues where people ultimately lose control, let their masks fall and speak their mind, even at times more with the purpose of hurting each other, more than to have an actual argument. There's a clear contrast here between the pale, quiet beautiful natural backgrounds and the strain and hate that's being unleashed. We are talking about twenty minutes sequences of just dialogue, some may be even longer. This could have resulted in a bore but it doesn't, because we can totally relate to some of the dialogues that always feel genuine and because they are so compelling, rich and filled with several layers of development. Almost every single sequence, ultimately leads up for a quiet climax (when it comes to sound) but a catastrophic one to the characters that we are following.Winter Sleep was far from being a bore at the theaters, the environment was fantastic, the film does have its wits, whimsical moments that often resulted in huge laughs and I thought the run- time was totally bearable, but yeah I mean it is a two hundred minute picture and I think it's safe to say that the movie extends its visit for a little too long. I had had a long day behind me and I started to feel the weight of its run-time in the last forty minutes or so. My numbing neck and aching legs probably didn't help, so I was a bit inpatient for the film's ending. I was impatient because the film was starting to lose me, the dialogues were no longer grabbing as tight and because I wanted to know in what note this film would end.When it comes to craft, well this is pretty much spotless. Cinematography is gorgeous, some tremendous images go through the screen through its run time. It's not only well crafted when it comes to cinematography for example but also when it comes to storytelling. Narratively it's bold and engaging and it creates its own set of rules.Winter Sleep is a film that I respect massively, I probably have to say though, that I respect it more than what I actually enjoyed it. It's a huge, colossal film that nearly owns it's two hundred minutes, even if it was way too much for my numbing back and drained energy. It's a film that will surely only be appreciated by a small amount of people, Nuri Bilge Ceylan has gained in me a follower but I don't believe he will make many friendships with main audiences who will soon discard such a long, slowly paced Turkish drama. It is a challenging film that ultimately rewards its audience with some powerful images and palpable strain. The audience in the theater seemed to be in awe, me I was simply left satisfied and with a huge respect for the piece.Rating:B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disconnect, separation and making the best of what you have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winter Sleep is a long movie. At three hours and 15 minutes, this film will make you actually look at your clock before hitting play. It won Palm d'Or at Cannes and I had no idea of any of this until I saw it on Netflix this week. There's a lot of substance to this movie and a great deal can be said and debated philosophically. I'll just stick to what really stood out for me.The Disconnect Between ClassesAydin, the protagonist of the movie, is a wealthy man, well educated and, in kid mind, generous and kind to those around him. What becomes apparent early on in the film is that he is also detached from the practical ongoings of his estate. His property is rented out and managed by lawyers and helpers, he does not know his own tenants, and he's oblivious to the issues they are having.When a kid breaks his car window with a stone, he's shocked and surprised. He does not realize that debt collectors and the police had a conflict with the kid's father, that the father has no job, and that they live of one person's wage. If this were a more predictable film, you would expect Aydin to realize these details. It doesn't happen! In fact, the only way Aydin tries to help the less fortunate is by donating a great sum of money to the charity his wife, Nihal, is organizing.This same disconnect is present in my own life, and likely in the life of many of the people around me in the same social class and age group. Our idea of helping the less fortunate is donating to charity once a year or jumping on some online viral bandwagon every so often. And do we really do it to help, or do we do it to help ourselves feel good?Just like Aydin writes a weekly column in the local paper, so do we write our blogs and Tweets and Facebook posts preaching whats's right and showing off our opinions and moral stances. But in the end, how many of us actually take action or speak from experience rather than simply from philosophical realms?The Physical SeparationWhat is captivating about the movie from the get-go is the setting. It's filmed in Cappadocia, Anatolia, a region of Turkey. The landscape and the homes are truly unique. Aydin lives with his wife and sister in a hotel they own. This hotel is built into the mountain, in a way, and it has the feeling of a castle. Aydin is like a kind ruler, and this castle is separating him from the rest of the people, adding to the idea of disconnect.While he sees himself as a sort of benevolent ruler, we quickly see that practically nobody feel this way about him and he's actually disliked even by his own family. His helper runs all errands, and the ruler sits oblivious in his tower. His sister challenges his moral standpoint on the notion of evil; his wife feels like a prisoner with no purpose in life; his subjects despise him behind his back.This separation does not happen only in remote regions. This separation is a daily reality in the society we live in. Very few people live in communities where they interact with their neighbours, or even with their own family. People are separated by vast geographical distances, going far from home in search of materialistic gains. And even those who stay close often just shut themselves in, watching Netflix all day or spending hours on their smart phones. Aydin fails to see past the his own mountain fortress. We fail to see past our computer screens.Making the Best of What You HaveSad ideas aside, there is a sense of redemption buried somewhere in the snow. Aydin claims he worked all his life, and it is only in his old age that he's as wealthy as we see him. Maybe it's unfair to judge him so harshly. Maybe he was not really meant to be a ruler and his detachment is a byproduct of his lack of interest and his moral high ground. He used to be an actor and his current goal is to write a book on the history of Turkish theater. That's not so wrong, is it? A quiet life on top of a mountain, removed from the problems of the village? Isn't that what many of us want after a life of work?And what about the tenants who failed to pay rent for many months? If they lived in Canada, they would have been kicked out a long time ago! It's clear that even though the people around Aydin are unhappy, he's actually content with his station in life. He tells Nihal that he still realizes the value of having a warm room and a roof over his head, while she talks about doing greater things in life. I couldn't help but agree with Aydin: we often forget what we have and, like Nihal, we get stressed with wanting more and more from life. A simple shift in focus could make us happy: just focus on what you have and consider that billions of others would give anything to have a full fridge, a warm house, and people who love them.There: I tried to end it on a more positive note! Hope you will watch this long but rewarding movie! Thank you for reading.</fullReview>

Characterised by the dominance of its scale over the scarcity of people, yet each character present on screen consumes it to an almost suffocating fullness. Real, articulate, overbearing. The conversations start very well behaved, sincere and forthcoming with the ease of the mature, and turn into the inescapable deadlock which the place imposes. A merciless incompatibility of human relations in despair from their interdependence. No where to go, nothing to resolve, a clear realization of this situation resigns each to his chamber, on a bed, a couch, a writing desk, staging ideas or vocations to cover underlying personal crises. Whoever seeks solace only aggravates his situation further because in a place like this hypocrisy does not live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chekhov meets Shakespeare in Turkey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were times during this film when I felt I had slipped into a filmed Chekhov play along the lines of Anthony Hopkins' "August"(1996). However, this film has a rhythm and vitality few films of Chekhov have offered. The exotic setting accounts for some of this. Mr. Bilginer's magnetism, conveyed in his husky voice and exquisitely trained eyes, lifts every scene he is in to a high level of tension and engagement.This is not a moralistic film, in my opinion. It is, as the castrating Necla says while needling her brother, "realistic". It displays human nature with its flaws without harsh commentary. The characters themselves do all the judging and muddling. Nihal feels she is a strangled Desdemona despite her accommodating Othello's (Aydin's) tolerance of her youthful angst. Necla lives off her brother and resents it. Aydin is an enabler and insecure in his own worth.Aydin is the misunderstood patriarch. He doesn't even understand that he is a patriarch, no matter what good he feels he is doing. He fails to see the real context of his part on the stage of his environment. He is the gentrified landlord, but sees himself as an innocent businessman in a system he did not create. Nihal fails to understand her charity is selfish and lacks human understanding. Necla talks about not resisting evil as a good thing, because she cannot resist her own evil sadism toward those around her.This is perhaps the first film of this length which I was truly sorry to see end. I was not tired of the characters or the setting. I could not have imagined I would feel this way about a film about winter in Turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the Three Hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winter Sleep is a great movie on different levels. Unlike his previous film, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, Ceylan's use of poetic language is spare and not central to his new film. Instead, the focus has shifted to character studies through Bergmanesque scathingly revealing dialogues that makes the similarity of the title to the film Winter Light maybe not entirely coincidental.But what makes the film unique is how it works well as a psychodrama but it doesn't confine itself to the inner lives and struggles of its characters. On a different level, the characters can rightly be coming out of a Dostoevsky story, each representing an archetype, the wealthy (the bored and jaded, the sensitive and empathic but trapped in a bubble of luxury, the distant and arrogant pseudo-intellectual taking his moral and cultural upper hand for granted) and the poor (the subservient, the frustrated and hateful, the resigned and meek.) Ceylan's keen observation on how the poor and the wealthy, each destined to live in their own bubbles, see themselves and fail to understand the other makes their inevitable clash, as the hunting scene might suggest, more like a law of nature than due to their personal demons and character weaknesses. Maybe some of the arguments in the film can be read in the same Dostoevskian vein: the artists putting words into his characters' mouths to argue and counter-argue what he himself has been grappling with. But even during those conversations, the undercurrent of psychological drama is present; the question is not just what they are arguing or whether we agree or not but what motivates them to say what they say. What feels a bit thematically out of place from the rest of film though, is when Ceylan becomes Dostoevskian in a melodramatic way in a scene where Ismael refuses to accept the money from Nihal. And aside from a few scenes where it feels the movie is losing its steam in this more than three hours of a marathon, Winter Sleep is a considerable achievement and one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rural tensions reflect current issues in Islam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nuri Ceylan's Winter Sleep explores the need to find values one can live by in the contemporary world free of religious trappings. Set and filmed in rural Turkey it represents the elemental pivot point between Islam and the West.The film is essentially the anatomy of Aydin, a secular intellectual/artist/businessman, who pretends to conscience and morality as he judges (and oppresses) others but falls well short on both counts himself, frozen by his arrogance. Aydin has retreated to run a small hotel which he keeps "natural," preferring muddy roads over gravel. His inherited property made him wealthy, a condition he also defends as "natural." He writes a weekly column in a small local paper, but won't venture into a major publication. When Aydin gets an email from a local teacher he summons his wife and neighbour to hear her adulation, under the pretence of asking their advice on responding to her request for financial help.Ceylan makes Aydin admirable and sympathetic, then gradually exposes him. His vanity in reading that email is our first clue to his failings, as well as his alienation from his wife Nihal. At first a beautiful enigmatic phantom, she emerges as a repressed, young woman who has finally found self-realization in running a charity project. Aydin spoils that by taking over her bookkeeping. He suspects the others of fraud and wants to preserve their family name. That, we later learn, he has already compromised when he turned earthquake victims away from his hotel in order to accommodate the paying members of relief agencies. His association, not Nihal's inexperience, would poison her project. Aydin also tries to remove himself from what's happening around him. When a second- generation tenant falls into rental arrears, Aydin claims his assistant Hidayet and his lawyers do everything on their own. Aydin feels no responsibility for the cruelty a wild horse suffers when caught for him. Aydin frees the horse when he leaves Nihal and sets out for Istanbul. He is jolted into self-awareness when he instead goes for a drunken evening and morning hunt with neighbour Suavi and schoolteacher Levent. Levent's babble confronts Aydin with his earthquake shame. The combination of brandy and guilt give the controlled and controlling Aydin his first breakdown. He vomits. The next morning he shoots a rabbit and finds it, still quivering with last life. That breaks down the detachment he has maintained between himself and the abuses of nature he has ordered, whether toward animals or his tenants. He returns to beg Nihal to forgive and to stay with him. His catharsis awakens him from his winter sleep.In a breakfast conversation Necla proposes to confront evil by submitting to it. She postulates that instead of resisting evil, thus further provoking its agent, by submitting to it one can perhaps arouse the malfeasant's conscience. She even considers asking her drunken ex-husband to forgive her for divorcing him, in hopes that might convert him to sobriety. "Islam," of course, means "submission," though that usually refers to Mohammad not to evil. In addition to his secularity, the other Islamic cornerstones that Aydin violates are brotherhood and charity. Neighbour Suavi is literally what Aydin is metaphorically: a lonely isolate, who after his wife's death closed off several rooms and retreated to his living room stove. But Suavi has warm relationships with others, like the teacher, and he has actively joined Nihal's project. Aydin's callous treatment of his suffering tenants and the earthquake incident prove his total lack of charity. When he gives Nihal a large donation it's to try to buy off her anger at his intrusion. Of course, he tells Suavi and Levent about his "anonymous" gift to bolster his image. His "charity" is disqualified by his self-interest.When Nihal gives that money to the unfortunate tenants she turns his conscience money to effective use.That family is a microcosm of current Islam. The younger brother Hamdi is the local imam, who gives sermons and struggles on a small salary to support his jobless older brother Ishmael, his sister-in-law and nephew, and their aging, ailing and ungrateful mother. Despite their long tenancy, Aydin has allowed the family to be dunned by a collection agency, the police, and confiscators of their TV and other goods. Ishmael was humiliated by an assault in front of his family. Hamdi serves the community with Koranic wisdom. But he can't mediate between the wealthy landlord and the violent rebel. Hamdi reluctantly accepts the money from Nihal, but Ishmael proves self-destructive in his sense of violated honor. Ishmael went to jail for stabbing a brute who stole his wife's underwear and then teased him. Now, as he recounts his various shame by Aydin, he rejects the money that would restore his family's honour and throws it in the fire. "Ishmael," of course, was Hagar's son, the original Moslem banished from Abraham's family. The original Moslem here becomes the first radical. The Grade V boy Ilyas is an intensely resentful figure who stones the landlord's van, then falls into a faint and a fever when his imam uncle tries to get him to apologize to Aydin and kiss his imperious hand. If Ishmael's burning of the money evokes the self- destruction of the Islamic militant, son Ilyas represents the outer-directed destruction to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Winter Sleep' is the first movie I've seen from Turkish leading director Nuri Bielge Ceylan. Running over three hours long, 'Winter Sleep' is the longest movie I've seen for several months, and, considering the schizophrenic way I'm used to see movies (albeit my absolute love for cinema), I was surprised that I managed to stop the reproduction of this long piece only once, and for demanding physiological reasons!'Winter Sleep' is a wordy, long study of its characters, an authentic visual novel that resonates great Russian classics like the ones from Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky or?Checkov (or the masterful Bergman's room dramas like 'Autumn Sonata'). The key to see 'Winter Sleep' is to be calm and patient. Virtually every scene is stuffed with dialogue and they can endure up to twenty minutes each, which is intellectually drying and makes you feel you can't deal with the next one?but as you waver on to continue to see 'Winter Sleep' or not, the movie has already hooked you on its story again.Aydin it's the central character of 'Winter Sleep' (superbly interpreted by Haluk Bilginer) and he appears in virtually every scene of the movie. Aydin is an intellectual, he's the 'king of his small kingdom', as he himself says, a kingdom constituted by some properties that he rents and his hotel, 'Hotel Othello'. As the people who form his small circle gradually confront him with their opinions about him (first the tenants of one of his properties, then his sister Necla, and finally his wife Nihal), Aydin is forced into a introspection (which constitutes the last act of the movie) concerning him and his relation with his little world. The conclusions Aydin takes from this reflection and how they change his behavior is the ultimate point of 'Winter Sleep'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winter Sleep with Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This account has potentially very serious spoilers. Please do not read unless you have seen the movie.I watched Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter Sleep this week, twice actually. It was a wonderful, deep, multifaceted movie. There is much I could say about the movie, the rich plot, and the wonderful director (and, with his equally talented wife Ebru Ceylan, screenwriter). So much of it has been said here and elsewhere that I don't need to repeat it. However, I think the story is far richer than even most commentators seem to acknowledge (perhaps they are more circumspect than I). Instead, I will give a very short summary, and then discuss what I think is one of the, if not the, most important parts of the film (and which constitutes a spoiler ? this is your second warning). I will generalize somewhat, to partially protect, despite my warning above, readers who have not yet experienced this masterpiece.The film is very closely based on Chekhov's short stories "The Wife" and "Excellent People," with some dialogue being verbatim. As many have pointed out, "Winter Sleep" is a story of how Aydin, a self-deceived man becomes a more self-aware man, although whether his fundamental isolation has changed is ambiguous. At the beginning of the movie, his world is literally rocked. From there, he begins a long and highly ambiguous progression. His beautiful wife Nihal, however, is enigmatic, bored, and isolated in several ways from her husband. She leads, however, a charitable effort to improve impoverished schools in the area. Is it truly altruistic? We see later in the film how her charity seems to be very narrowly focused, and might benefit another character in particular, and herself vicariously.Most fascinating are the tangled webs of relationships in the movie, both acknowledged and unacknowledged. Aydin seems at times to be suspicious of his best friends or distant acquaintances, including one older friend whose complete role we may never understand. Meanwhile, Nihal has even more complicated, even deeply secretive relationships.What sort of secrets? Nihal appears to have an unspoken bond with Ilyas, a poor boy. In an interview with the Guardian (November 13, 2014), Ceylan says that he was inspired by some of Chekhov's short stories, and one in particular, but is reluctant to say which, for fear the film should be seen as an adaptation. "I don't want to talk about it," he says. "It was a starting point. There was a little dialogue, but mainly description. You cannot say there was a story but there was a sense of life there." As both "The Wife" and "Excellent People" are dialogue-heavy, and Ceylan has acknowledged his indebtedness to at least "The Wife," it appears that he is speaking of a third story. The interviewer, however, does not seem to acknowledge that. I think that one relationship is key to understanding the movie, and it appears based on a not-quite-halfway-through part of Chekhov's story "Dreams" (*big* spoiler alert there). "Dreams" includes much speech, but it is more like a monologue. Transferring a description of a familial relationship described there to the film requires some reversals of roles, but the absolutely critical personal decision about class and choice remains the same. (Intriguingly, "Dreams" also includes a dog as a touchstone, and barking dogs are one of the curious motifs of the film, extending even after the final fade).To me, this deeply complicated relationship explains so much of the movie, from the launching of a projectile at its beginning to actions (and silences) later. Nihal has a sharp, visceral, almost unexpected reaction at a key point, which is explained by this bond, as are key actions at the end of the film. Even without the "Dreams" connection, the relationship seems clear.Viewers may disagree. It deepens the film's moral ambiguity. Some may object on chronological grounds, but Nihal's youth seems to admit of several possibilities (although one seems most plausible). Perhaps the most critical piece of seemingly contradictory information occurs when Nihal seems to mistake the ages of two other characters (earlier, Aydin does this). However, her body language and the pauses seems to me to indicate a serious attempt at deception, rather than genuine ignorance on her part. Particularly important glances between Nihal and Ilyas are also exchanged at various times during the movie, seeming to acknowledge what goes unacknowledged. What remains silent in this movie is often as profound as what is spoken.In just one example, a dialogue occurs early on where Aydin's sister reproaches herself and says that if she had remained with a troubled individual, that person might not have sunken to their currently low state. Nihal, like all of us would, assures her that that is not true and that she should not be taking the blame. (There is also a veiled reference to a "truth" that was spoken years previously ? undoubtedly important but never explained). Later we see, however, that the dilemma over what action should have been taken in the past extends to the her life too - that a third, troubled character could conceivably be a better person if relationships had turned out differently (and yet another might have been benefited too). This interpretation regarding "Dreams" makes this early dialogue, which otherwise raises some "why is this in the movie" questions, even more rich and meaningful. At the end of the movie, it is Nihal who realizes that the assumptions (and self-deception?) under which she has been living have been irrevocably changed. An open question remains how many characters are aware of this secretive relationship - I would argue at least two, based on the pregnant glances. That may also explain the violent, if futile gesture at the beginning of the movie.Because of this movie's deeply involved, moving plot, wonderful acting, and unexpected richness, this is one of the most profound and best movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

Instead, the impact of movie on me is, the story is based on two concepts: Willfully hypocrisy and willfully blindness to reality.Those concepts make Kis Uykusu a classic movie. Schubert, Dosto referred movie posture and Kapadokya location support it as well. Another remindings are: Dosto reminding money burning scene, poverty details, Shakespeare, Tarkovsky reminding horse scenes, traditional religion references.The telling is so alluring that every single watcher would be withdrawn to the story and feels similarities to the characters. In the end, it is inevitable since the piece is a classic one. Perfect acting makes it quite easy as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the critics that have compared it to something like an epic Russian novel with its penetrating observations on the human condition and philosophical musings. The film deals with a whole host of issues like pride, how we create our own prison, how we protect ourselves through self-deception, how ego can fuel seemingly charitable motivations, how we can suffocate others through good intentions, generational divisions, the notion of resisting evil in order to bring out the good in others (which sparks a darkly humorous debate among the characters).I found the film to be very shrewdly written in how it constantly reinforced certain character traits in different contexts. As I stated before, the character of Aydin (even while instructing others that the road to hell is paved with good intentions) likes to justify himself with his good intentions and doesn't want to mislead people: he defers the tenant to his partner about the debt, he's always reading his articles on potentially touchy issues to his sister for feedback, and even little things like the way he expresses uncertainty to the client about the Omar Sharif movie that was filmed in the area and how he examines the pictures on his website after the client asks about the horses at the hotel (the horse being captured and subsequently set free was also a nice touch of symbolism).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that has stayed with me for months after I have seen it. It was on at a film festival and based on my regard for "Once Upon a Time in Anatolia" I was keen to see this one.There are scenes of great visual storytelling involving the horses. The main character and hotel keeper imagines himself as some kind of Chekovian / Shakespeare. Or rather he is like that but without the insights that a great playwright might have. He likes to pontificate on local events in his column for the local newspaper but the reality is much more mundane.I liked the scene where he realises his wife has disconnected from his world view and he pretends to go off on one of his business trips to the city. In reality he heads off to a neighbour's farm where he drinks with his buddy and the local school teacher who inadvertently lets slip a few home truths.Despite all of this it is a great movie- head and shoulders above almost anything else being made today. if they cut a few of the longer speeches out it would be a better movie but still great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pure, plain and gripping. one of the best films of 2014</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of the Palme D'or in 2014, Turkish Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter's Sleep succeeds on many levels as a cinematic achievement. Just as other movies in his oeuvre, Ceylan again takes a simple story, and combines it with an exquisite cinematography, well-drawn characters, crackling dialogue, stimulating use of image and sound and a well-balanced black humor. The result: a brilliant piece of cinema in every aspect.While the film's central theme seems revolving around never-ending tirades and mind games between protagonist and the people in his surroundings (his family, friends and his tenants), actually the film focuses on a man's internal struggle, an array of moral dilemmas, a clash between value systems, a complex tapestry of relationships, and matters of faith, empathy and feeling. Also, the humdrum of remote small-town life in the darkest time of winter is exquisitely reflected. Just like his previous works, Ceylan opts again to keep the running time to a considerable length in order to bring a novelistic effect to his simple yet thought-provoking story. It lasts more than 3 hours and has a slow, measured pace, but no single moment or line feels extraneous. It never drags or gets boring. Definitely, he is a story-teller in the true sense.Similar to his former movies (such as "Climates", "Distant" and "Once upon a Time in Anatolia") , Ceylan again takes advantage of his background as a photographer. The picture is gorgeous from the first scene to the last, thanks to the wintry Cappadoccian setting. He creates an out-of-this-world mood, mesmeric and melancholic, suggesting that his characters are somehow cut off from the realities of the world. The attention to authentic details is impeccable. The hotel, that cut directly into rock, serves as a perfect ground for movie's gloomy atmosphere. Beautifully lit cave- like chambers, with crackling log fires in the background provide an excellent place for expansively conceived, circular debates.Likewise, all characters are well-drawn and well-cast. Incomprehension of another's feelings, and intellectual and emotional dissimilarities of characters are exquisitely portrayed, and reflected into ponderously long, but sharp and crackling dialogue. From cynical, selfish and privileged Ayd&#x131;n (Haluk Bilginer) to fragile, oppressed and embattled wife Nihal (Melisa Sözen), and to confused, depressed and resentful sister Nermin (Demet Akba&#x11f;), all characters are trapped in their cocoons of emotional loneliness and insipid existences.Gökhan Tiryaki's cinematography is outstanding in the use of lights, shadows and dark contrasts that enhance the story to such an extent. Majority of scenes starts with a long shot in long take with static cameras. Indoor scenes are inter-cut with powerful close-ups, all with the flavor of artsy photography; with reverse, changing camera angles and pans and tilts. Sharpness and colors are glorious too.Last word: Pure, plain and gripping, one of the best films of 2014. This is a kind of movie that makes you think over and over again about the distances inherent to human relationships. (8.4/10)</fullReview>

However, the movie is ponderously slow and, at over three hours, incredibly long. This tests your commitment and engagement, and ultimately the movie is quite dull.

		<fullReview>I didn't want the film to end like Aydin did't want to take the train to leave Cappadocia. In every scene step by step I felt how alienated the characters are from their true selves. There was a worrying despair in Aydin's situation that he belonged to nowhere, neither Cappadocia nor the upper class life of an actor. In the end he admits to his wife that he isn't the charismatic actor she expected. His wife Nihal and his sister Necla makes Aydin confront with his reality to a degree. The free-spirited motorcyclist man symbolized to me that unlimited freedom was also a state of alienation like dogmatic conservatism. The only scene that I didn't think realistic was Nihal's confrontation when the money she gives as a gift is turned into ashes by the unpredictable man, Ismail. Turning a gift like that isn't something inherent in Anatolian culture. But from one of Ceylan's interviews I felt that this may be something he wanted to inject as a value to our society. I think this is a movie of confrontations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is undoubtedly not only a master work by Nuri Bilge Ceylan,but also one of the best films created recently by any director regardless of origin and/or name. As with the majority of the people who have already had the chance to view the film, its length - the duration - of almost 3,5 hours makes you fear and skeptic. But with the first scene of the film you loose the sense of time and watch the scenes flow one after another more like real life than a man-made film. As with all Nuri Bilge Ceylan films the graphic quality is excellent. But the real power of this work is the realty, the detail and the warmth which the director has given to the characters. I was a bit surprised when the film came to the end. Was it really 3,5 hours spent on a cinema chair or was it a period of life I lived with Aydin Bey (the main character - a former theater artist)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There would seem to be something inherently uncinematic about the chamber drama: a work tied to one, domestic space and the conversations that ensue therein. With Winter Sleep, rightly celebrated Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan proves, like Bergman before him, that the chamber drama can indeed be high cinema. While most of the scenes take place in interiors, in only a few different rooms, Ceylan and DP Gokhan Tiryaki create brilliant master- shots in which the characters converse. There are a handful of exteriors of the Anatolian steppe and they are, characteristic of Ceylan, exceptionally beautiful. Interior or exterior, the color palate of the film is beyond reproach- consisting, as the title suggests, almost entirely of winter hues.One of the themes that, it seems to me, connects Celyan's films is the gradations of power, sometimes brutally absolute power, that people wield over others in contemporary Turkish society. In the director's "Three Monkeys" modern Turkey was portrayed as an almost feudalistic society, except that capitalism had enabled different layers of classes, and thus different layers of serfdom. The bourgeois suffer for the infractions of the wealthy, and the poor suffer for those of the bourgeois. In "Winter Sleep" the power dynamics are more emotional than economic, though the latter still comes into play. Indeed, as much as this film consists of interactions between family members in private spaces, it may subtly be Ceylan's most socio-political statement. The characters are former Istanbulite "cultural elites" holed up in the majestic if impoverished Turkish steppe, most focally Aydin, a former actor and son of a local land lord who has uncomfortably inherited his dad's power, as well as the coldly beautiful ancestral home that he has converted into a picturesque hotel. Aydin tries to shield himself from moral responsibility for the misery imposed on his destitute tenants, a struggle for which his wife Nihal tries and fails to assume responsibility. Aydin consistently tries to blind himself from his real affect on the world by commenting on society in a weekly newspaper column in which he tries to come off as bearing properly Turkish sensibilities- promoting a fine line between "modern thinking" and religious propriety, even though he has no use for religion, is of Europeanized taste, and seems more comfortable chatting with his foreign guests in English than relating to the local people, or indeed, his family. The most consistent theme in the interactions between Aydin, his wife, and sister Necla is whether turning the other cheek will lead one's tormentor to see the wrong of their ways. These characters do, indeed, seem to employ this technique in their interactions. Nihal, for instance, accuses Aydin of causing her misery. Aydin asserts that he is a "modern husband" and that she is "free to go as she pleases", though reminds Nihal that she will be impoverished if she divorces him. He then offers to give her space by rejoining society- Istanbul, hoping that she will feel guilty for hurting his feelings and ask him to stay. This passive-aggressive give-and-take is repeated in superficially different ways throughout the film between different sets of the three relatives. On the verge of leaving for Istanbul for the winter to give Nihal and Necla some space, Aydin instead goes on a drunken hunting trip with an old friend and returns to the hotel, bearing a slain rabbit as an offering to his family. The only internal dialog in the film is its last lines, in which Aydin acknowledges to himself, though not to his family, his terror of the thought of being without them even though he knows they no longer love him. The family thus remains stranded together in the isolated, beautiful ruin of their ancestral home, Ceylan's metaphor for contemporary Turkish society. Consistently hoping the other will implicate themselves for the misery around them, the characters emotionally oppress one another by telling each other that their unhappiness is their own doing since they are all, after all, free to do as they please in the modern state of Turkey. The "freedom" of a supposed modernity is thus the medium by which society's subjects incriminate one another. While Ceylan's film is most specifically an allegory of modern Turkey, it could serve as commentary on the oppressive freedom of "liberal democracies" everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art film has its moments, but is not for the casual film-goer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film I have seen by Turkish director, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a film festival favorite who won the main award of the 2014 Cannes film festival with this. I wasn't thoroughly convinced by it (it's too long, almost three hours and fifteen minutes and the characters engage too many times in aimless philosophical discussions), though it has its moments. It is a mostly "true to life" film, though being true to life doesn't always makes a movie interesting.The main character is Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) a retired actor who lives in picturesque Cappadocia managing a boutique hotel he has inherited from his father that is seemingly carved in rock. He has also inherited properties in the surrounding area. Aydin sees himself as a sort of the area's enlightened feudal lord, though some of the villagers would beg to argue with the enlightened part, as he is often in violent conflict with those who are late with the rent. Among them is the tough ex-convict Ismail (Nejat Isler), who lives in a dilapidated house with his wife, their son Ilyas (who at the beginning of the movie throws a rock to the car in which Aydin was driving) and his brother Hamdi (Serhat Kilic), the ingratiating, obsequious local imam. Ismail would return towards the end of the film with one of its best scenes, when he pointedly rejects and destroys a valuable present brought by Aydin's wife.In the hotel, Aydin lives mostly with his nagging, recently divorced sister, Necla (Demet Akbag), his tough, capable assistant Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan) and his younger, beautiful wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen). Aydin and Nihal doesn't seem to be getting along very well, and Nihal tries to enliven her boring life by engaging in charitable work with the area's broken schools, an activity that Aydin mocks. Necla and Nihal criticize Aydin as arrogant and presumptuous. He spend most of the time in the hotel writing a column for the local newspaper (a paper no one reads, according to his sister) and preparing a volume on the history of the Turkish theater (Ceylan might be a bit as presumptuous as Aydin: in the end titles, he quotes Chekhov as a main influence on him).Not much else happens in the movie in terms of plot, as it is mostly about the relationship between the various characters. The characters are recognizably real, though none of them is very likable. Interestingly, there is a clear distinction between the secular outlook of Aydin and his immediate family and the conservative values of the impoverished, religious villagers, all of whose women use the Islamic scarf.I wouldn't recommend this film to a casual film-goer, but those who appreciate difficult, arty films, will probably enjoy this. All the acting in it is phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one thread in a magnificent tapestry of ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most interesting of the many long and interesting conversations in Winter Sleep is initiated by Necla, Aydin's sister, when she proposes the idea that 'evil should not be resisted'.&nbsp; What if, she argues, that by not resisting those who intend to do us harm they might lose the desire or need to hurt. &nbsp; It is in on the face of it, of course,&nbsp; a ridiculous idea.&nbsp; The confident, cultured, articulate Aydin cannot be bothered to even consider it. He immediately jumps to the unassailable example of Hitler and the Jews.&nbsp; That's the result when you don't resist evil.&nbsp;And of course it is when the threat is to a&nbsp;people, a nation, perhaps even&nbsp;a planet or some fundamental ideal. But even&nbsp;this is terribly slippery territory;&nbsp;the determination of evil is not an absolute and always depends on what or who is defined as evil, and by what or whom it is defined.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; But in jumping immediately to the macro, Aydin is avoiding his own case. What about here, much closer to home, in fact his home in which they are in sitting, the home where Aydin practices his own form of evil against those he sees as some kind of threat ?-what he perceives as evils that must be resisted.&nbsp;The setting is after all, the Hotel Othello and is not Aydin a sort Othello&nbsp;himself?&nbsp; It is not a perfect comparison but consider?. the young and beautiful bride who began by "idolizing" him; the Iago within&nbsp;who whispers against her.&nbsp; Aydin's Iago is not an outside enemy but himself. As Nihal says to Aydin when he&nbsp; disingenuously asks what he should feel guilty for, "you are an honest, fair and conscientious man but you use&nbsp;these virtues to suffocate, to crush and humiliate people."&nbsp;That&nbsp;is exactly what he has done to her. Aydin has seen her attempt to make a meaningful life for herself as a threat against him.&nbsp; Her growth and independence is some form of evil done to him that he has to resist.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has reduced her work to improve the education opportunities for the local village children&nbsp;to an 'interest'.&nbsp; Nihal 'cares about these things' he says to a visiting neighbour when he commands her to join them to ostensibly consider a charitable request he has received from a local young woman.&nbsp;In fact, he cares nothing about philanthropy;&nbsp; the former actor has seated his audience to witness a sort of&nbsp;one-man show as he reads out the petitioner's flattering admiration for him and the weekly column he writes for the local newspaper.&nbsp;When Nihal's work finally comes to fruition with a meeting of a new funding council (which, significantly, includes the same neighbour) Aydin dismisses them all and particularly her as hopelessly naive . As it turns out she is foolishly generous, but that is for her to find out not for him to pre- determine. For now, Aydin demeans Nihal by offering to 'check' her books.

He has allowed himself to be totally vulnerable.&nbsp; Metaphorically he too has ceased to resist.&nbsp; Is it too much to say that he has&nbsp; purged himself of not only of his own evil&nbsp;but also the false perception of evil in others that has possessed him?&nbsp;It does seem that way when the next day on the hunting trip, with a single shot,&nbsp;he hits a&nbsp;grazing rabbit.&nbsp; But when he approaches his catch he sees it is still breathing.&nbsp; As with his other victims,&nbsp;he has known exactly where to aim leaving them barely alive.&nbsp; But were they in truth any more of a threat than a rabbit foraging for a bit of food?&nbsp; The other half of the resistance to evil equation is properly determining what is really 'evil'.&nbsp; Aydin has mistaken his enemies.&nbsp;As he returns home, he know that his resistance to what he has perceived as evil (in this case Nihal and her desire for a relationship of mutual respect) has been futile.&nbsp; His voice- over accepts that he has lost Nihal's love.&nbsp; He will not fight for it now, it will be enough if she will simply allow him to be in her presence. But is that the last word?&nbsp; After all, Aydin is a changed man and there is perhaps a good chance that having found himself, he may indeed find a way back to her.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's headache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock, the great man, said that drama is life with the boring bits cut out (He'd know). Unfortunately in this film, all the boring bits were left in. And then some. If it hadn't won the Palme De Yawn, you wouldn't find the type of sycophantic reviews currently on display. 'Stunning' 'Emotional' 'Masterful' ? Incredible what people can project so they can feel superior. Let's get down to the bones. Yes there is drama here. About 45 mins worth. That's being generous. It is beautifully shot. The locations are wonderful. The direction is more than competent. There is a certain amount of poetry and/or style involved. No doubting any of that. However, let's get to the heart of the issue. At three hours fifteen, its two hours too long. Snail paced Euro films are great. I love them. Yet the conversations within go into a loop. It's like a bad argument where no one makes new ground yet on it goes, repeating itself. Any self-respecting person would have walked away after assessing the time they were wasting. A good editor could have created something decent out of this. There is interest within the scenes, only because it fools you into thinking that something significant is about to happen. It's a lie. Your life, on a bad day, is much more captivating. It's a shame because the performances are very good. Set within the famous French Film Festival after a couple of joints and a bottle of Cab Sav I'll say this is the best film ever too, at least since the previous year when 'Blue is the Warmest Colour' won, (which was worth its three hours). This simply feels like a director set free without the reins of a producer with balls. Perhaps prior success earned him carte blanche. Perhaps given the turmoil north of its borders, the fact that Turkey produced it made an impact. I hate saying that because I've been to Turkey and they do make great films but political correctness (righteousness) has never been more powerful than now.There's cinematic poetry here, without a doubt, especially given its promising beginning. Real artistry. It mostly occurs in the short outdoor scenes that are edited like a normal, albeit, art film. It's the extended yawn parade indoors that ruins this film. It will be forgotten about in less than a year. In ten years from now, people will be laughing that it received as much acclaim as it did. In fact it will be completely forgotten. Its limpid conclusion will be the metaphor for its ultimate footnote.</fullReview>

Huge unwanted pregnant pauses, moody silences, all the narcissistic art house red flags, on the same par with the equally boring "The tree of Life" from a few years ago! A major disappointment, I was actually looking forward to it but after slogging through the first slower than slow 70 minutes I realized that it was not going to get any better, yet I stayed for till the end, bigger fool I! "Winter Sleep" is an ironic title because it certainly lead me to the land of nod!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An epic, great film, one of the masterpieces of cinema of all times. The acting is absolutely fantastic, the actors actually take a grip of the viewer and one cannot but be bewitched by them. The setting in Anatolia and shots are great, contrasting greatly with Western cinema so full of clichés and stereotypes about relationships. Each scene is like a painting, a painting which breathes of life, simplicity, and complexity at the same time. The story is to be understood on multiple levels, yet there are great questions to be answered probably only after the film has finished, it contains probably some of the great themes of humanity, all surrounded by the great enigma we call 'life'. A great film for all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winter Storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes script, acting and directorial skill to keep a film flowing while still captivating for over three (3) hours. Some credit goes to Chekov for the framework of isolating peoples of different educational; economic; status; etc. backgrounds in one isolated arena and let them duke it out - verbally. The other credit goes to the carved cave dwellings, some of which date back about a thousand years while others are more recent, of the more recent some are quite elaborately constructed, one of which is the film's setting - a modern caved hotel. Incidentally, the source material for the hills/cliffs is volcanic ash - Tuff (looks like sandstone), a serene natural beauty contrast to the human personalities. Film should have been titled "Winter Storm" as a cabin fever style escalation of verbosity, mostly on issues that range from individual/personal values of the film's characters to more abstractly, human values in general, begin to provoke animosities and distrust. The central foil is the hotel owner, Aydin, and because of his appropriately stone like demeanor the diatribes just bounce off of him; even seeming to reflect more of the accusers themselves. I'm inclined to think that a bit more editing would have produced the same film in a little shorter length, but then too we live in a time driven, multitasking environment in contrast to the film's appropriate - time moves glacially slow setting. So the film's molasses slow tedium may have had a purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't sleep through Winter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting nearly a year, I was finally able to see the film that won Cannes in 2014, Winter Sleep, also the first film I've seen from Turkey. Winter Sleep is a sober, serious film, centering on Ayd&#x131;n, a wealthy hotel-owner and landlord, his much younger wife Nihal and his sister, Necla. Ayd&#x131;n's vehicle window is smashed by a young son of a tenant, furious over having their possessions confiscated for months of unpaid rent. The boy's uncle tries to patch things up, but Ayd&#x131;n is unimpressed with his tenants. Suffering from hard luck, they see Ayd&#x131;n as a tyrant, though he doesn't personally manage his properties. Winter Sleep is overlong and slow but not really boring. The main drama is the emotional drama in Ayd&#x131;n arguing with Necla and Nihal, who both seem interested in breaking away from him. Necla picks at Ayd&#x131;n's writings as safe and presumptuous in dealing with topics Ayd&#x131;n doesn't know about; any writer will appreciate how that feels. Nihal is annoyed with him for meddling in her charity work late in the game. Then at the end, the tenants refusing Nihal's charity- indeed, throwing the equivalent of thousands of dollars in cash on the fire- is striking. This is a man insulted by charity from the "oppressor." I do feel a little sorry for Ayd&#x131;n- his sister and wife seem to do next to nothing, but are unappreciative of him, and he is unaware of some of the harsher acts done in his name.I liked Winter Sleep; it's a solid film, not much to dislike. But I can't say I was wowed by it- I wasn't devastated by it, or particularly moved by it. Even though it won Cannes, I can still understand why it missed a nomination by the Academy, and why they showed their love to Ida (2013) instead.</fullReview>

Anyways, absorbing, mesmerizing, pretty haunting work here. The cast is aces all around, and the film does a great job of really creeping up on you and keeping you more and more hypnotized as you're immersed in the conversations between these fascinating, well- developed characters. Definitely the best foreign-language film I've seen this year and very strongly recommended.

		<shortDescription>A different but rewarding experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At over three hours, I was very surprised at the speed which this passed by. This isn't just thanks to the incredible photography and landscapes, but also the dialogue which was consistently intriguing while essentially going nowhere, much like the characters inhabiting the small village.This is a movie without a plot, rather it is a multiple character/relationship study, with some humour littered about as the lead character seems to be one of those people who revels in others' mistakes and enjoys pointing them out, as he is always right. His and his friends interactions with the rest of the cast are somehow captivating, it is action through dialogue. Whether meaningless talk that defines the characters, or more philosophical conversations that bring to mind Russian extensionalist writings, it is the dialogue and the character studies that make up the action. Not a movie for everyone then, I feel I say that a lot but a three-plus hour Turkish film is probably not most folks' cuppa tea. Especially when the conversations get heated ? it's a lot to ask to read all the subtitles and know who is saying what. But the movie paints each character so well that for the most part, I could tell who was saying what through their attitude and manner of speaking.I enjoyed this one immensely, and having never heard of the director Ceylan, I am keen to check out his filmography as soon as possible. Deserving of its Palme d'Or without a doubt, as their isn't a moment where either we see long takes of the incredible cave-like village/hotel and the surrounding areas, all of which look absolutely stunning, or again carefully photographed indoor scenes that again somehow provide for entertaining dialogue despite their being little in the way of narrative. This also rivals Under The Skin, TGBH, Force Majuere and Interstellar for the visual spectacle it provides.I read many comparisons to Bergmann's work, and while this is somewhat true, much like the same comparisons with Force Majuere, they aren't quite accurate. Both study the human condition in its true form: flawed personalities and the results of these. However Bergmann for the most part had one character that was the subject of study, and their flaws were often much more psychologically troubling and dark in atmosphere. This however is a study of an entire village, a metaphor for the various flaws and vices that make up humanity in our society today.One fault that could be aimed at the movie was the running time, as there is no question that in three hours, one would have expected more significant events to occur. I do think that this element should have been explored further, but the simply amazing cinematography, by one Gökhan Tiryaki , and the strangely consistently interesting conversations were by far enough to overlook this. The script was extremely well written, and each conversation revealed more layers of each character's personality. There is no narrative, no plot, but the study of a small community and the secrets and unhappiness that hovers over most living there is quite masterfully done.This is certainly a new experience for me, as I haven't quite seen a movie with such an obvious lack of a narrative, but yet it managed to intrigue, entertain and make me laugh. The ending at first seemed abrupt, but in hindsight it made perfect sense. An ideal ending for an extremely interesting multiple-character study that slowly reveals layers of each character. Some are likable, many aren't, yet their character's gradual progression as people was enough the to satisfy this viewer. It did remind of Bergmann, but in a much less dark and more subtle way. Not to mention this film follows the lives of multiple characters, all whom belong in a hierarchy of sorts, as one owns the hotel, others rent and are subsequently lower, and for the most part are treated as so. A significant event near the end of the movie signifies an actual plot device, and in hindsight I can see why it happened.This is an ambiguous film, it leaves a lot to your imagination, and you're enjoyment of it really depends on the limit of your imagination. If it enjoys sprinting the 100 metre dash in under nine seconds then you will see this film and then want to see it again immediately. If your imagination is slower than a sloth doped up on endone, this perhaps isn't a film for you. But if you use your head, and follow the conversations littered throughout the run-time, you will find yourself intrigued at the many subtleties of the film that are executed with perfection. A good eye is required, and a certain understanding of humanity and personality traits doesn't hurt.Another gem to end the year, 2014 has been filled with amazing movies and the pace does not seem to be letting up. It is extremely encouraging to see not only improved quality from the US, but also many British movies and non-English films that say a lot more than you might think. I feel different cultures approach filmmaking in their own unique way. This is certainly a unique movie, and as it progressed I felt like I was learning simple things about the culture of the characters ? a high number of Muslims, a subject lightly touched on.4.5/5 ? Strong in every facet but narrative/plot, but considering the goals of the movie and what it sets out to do, this absence feels right. It reflects the fates of most of the characters well as a general metaphor for where we are as humans today.</fullReview>

I have to say, this IS a good movie! However, I am not completely convinced as many other reviewers here, that it is a masterpiece. It is way too long. Half of the audience fell asleep. I think that in 2-2,5 hours the director would be able to convey the same message as in 3,5 hours. The dialogs were too long and sometimes difficult to follow. The characters were well developed and the actors were extraordinary. The photography was beautiful and the director managed to present the whole atmosphere of the approaching winter in the remote rural areas of Turkey. All in all, the movie was well structured, but for me it lacked something to be a masterpiece. Maybe a little more dynamics.</fullReview>

There are so many levels to human nature and each level has been touched on in such a rich way in the movie such as brother-sister, husband-wife, wife-sister-in-law, father- son, boss-employee, friends-friends, manager-customer, locals-foreigner relationships.

		<shortDescription>Choking a beautiful wild horse for your movie?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie put me to sleep with its disingenuously drawn-out dialogue and I awoke to the sounds of a screaming horse and an undoubtedly real scene of a horse being choked with a rope in a river. Nevermind that the overly stark and obnoxiously quiet opening scenes foreshadowed some kind of violence of this sort. (Can we break out of that predictable formula, or are we addicted to this cycle of cinematic domestic abuse?) As soon as I heard "You need you a nice, wild horse," I knew some scene like this was coming. I just didn't think, in 2014, that it would be real. We're talking about a time in digital movie-making where you can realistically recreate Leonardo DiCaprio getting mauled by a grizzly bear with a perspective and detail so visceral, you're left checking your own body for damage. Instead, Ceylan chokes a horse. No, Ceylan, you don't get to do this in 2014 and not get sued. Hope you learn your lesson. Your exploitation and torture of that beautiful creature is unforgivable. And if you're going to insert ever-so-predictable scenes of animal torture in your movies, try not to put your audience to sleep with all that formulaic "quiet time."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first impression after watching this acclaimed movie was that it did not strike me as a Palm D'Or award winner, and that the story was too drawn out. 196 minutes would be considered long for a film by any standards, and personally I believe what makes a good movie includes the director's ability to tell a good story within the attention span of your audience. What added on to the feeling that this movie was way too long was the fact that some conversations were not as intriguing or revealing as the director or playwright thought they would be. The amount of bickering was in excess, and it was trying the audience's concentration and patience. This could have been handled better; the interpersonal affray could be sharper, the digging up of old feuds, the dirt dishing, the flinging of family skeletons all felt lukewarm. There is, of course, no lack of dramatic irony; this was well appreciated at times, even if it was an age-old cliché to have a husband pretending to leave town in the hope of catching his wife unawares. The screaming hypocrisy of the middle class and the bourgeois embodied by the chief protagonist was well played. He lived contentedly in his snug little comfort zone in self-deceit, oblivious to the world around him and the needs of others, fussing over trivial matters and oozing with self-importance over his petty articles, believing himself to be a pillar of spiritual and literary influence he hardly was (as pointed out by his sister). The ever widening rift between the social classes mocked the charity work by Nihal to the poor, for her it was a hobby, something to channel her energy and efforts into to dissipate her boredom to be married to a rich old man whom she did not love. Thus her utter dismay and disbelief to have her well-intended charity backlash with such fury (tossing stacked cash into the fireplace to spite must feel powerful), yet she had never envisaged that her kind gesture was an insult humiliating honest poor folks who were used to earning their keep. The film also dripped heavily with symbolism - I imagine the horse representing ideals, dreams and freedom, though what the rabbit meant was unclear to me. For those who love astounding visuals, this movie would not disappoint. The breaking in of the steed was a stunning scene though some might find it uncomfortable. The Turkish landscape is presented in a poetic and artistic portrayal with many breathtaking sights. One could not but be mesmerized by the snow-capped mountains and the mist veiling the ridges and the valleys. The picturesque quaint old buildings and the majestic ancient architecture made this movie almost an unofficial tourism bureau advertisement. In the end, the chief protagonist appeared to have found a new meaning in life - at least he did begin to write his book. His beautiful pretentious wife learnt a lesson (hopefully) and where do we find ourselves? Exactly where we began? An interesting end to a supposedly insightful introspective journey. It was worth mentioning that in Hong Kong, the movie was translated into "winter awakening", which might be a more apt title. Last but not least, good acting on the part of most actors and actresses who managed to carry the story across (in spite of the script and the dialogue at times) convincingly and realistically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nuri Bilge's best "kilim"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting but not captivating movie, at least not if you're a Turk for whom Nuri Bilge's stories are a tad too mundane and his settings a tad too touristic. On the other hand what's not to like about a Palme d'Or film when Turks have so little to be proud of these days? Still, Nuri Bilge never fails to irritate me with his settings out of Turkey travel brochures and this is no exception. That's the main reason why I call this film a "kilim." A kilim is a poor man's Turkish carpet that tourists love but Turks look down on. When a filmmaker fills his work with tourist-trap "local color" we say in Turkey that he has made a kilim, not a film. However Nuri Bilge has made far tackier kilims; this is certainly his best one.The setting is the more obvious kilim feature, whereas the tiny figures barely moving on its chilly whiteness are what is supposed to be the mystery that binds the viewer. These weird Chekovian characters on the fringes of life, hibernating in that ancient land of outcasts and refugees that is Cappadocia, are no doubt intriguing for foreigners but for Turks they are the people next door. If not for all Turks, at least for the circle of urban pseudointellectuals among whom Nuri Bilge used to cruise before he started jet-setting big time.The menagerie of characters that he displays in this tourist-trap landscape are what make this kilim's patterns more subtle than the usual Nuri Bilge wares. But like any kilim, they are far more interesting for foreigners than to Turks. That's why for a Turk, watching this kilim is like sitting in front of the window. If you do that for 2.5 hours, you can't be blamed for dozing off every now and then, as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intellectual feast on a literary scale paired with stunning poetic cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cannes seem to have a theme as of late for selecting 3 hour films for their coveted Palm d'or with Nuri Bilge Ceylan's latest and Blue Is The Warmest Colour. However, Winter Sleep's mammoth 196-minute length should not be solely be considered a challenge. In fact, it was perhaps the most leisurely viewing I had while at the festival outside of Whiplash. It's a warm character study, one that takes its time to burrow deeply into its topics. That's the notable personality of Winter Sleep for how it feels novelistic in its approach. It doesn't necessarily have more scenes than the average film, nor does it cover more time, instead it's full of extended dialogue driven scenes that stir gently and dig thoroughly to make their points. It's an intellectual feast on a literary scale.The film details the winter of a middle-aged hotel owner Alydin, played by Haluk Bilginer, and his relationships with his recently divorced sister, his young wife, acquainted guests, his friends and employees, and the tenants of houses he owns. He's a former thespian of the theater and a minor celebrity, though he's currently working on a book about the history of Turkish theater while he runs the Anatolian village. He's both generous and egotistical, considered the king of his small kingdom, having ownership rights to most of the houses and shops in the town. Through ordeals with his wife's charity, his sister's misery and a family struggling to pay rent, he wrestles with the morality of his altruism, despite lack of activism, as those dependent on him only resent him in returnWritten by Ceylan and his wife Ebru Ceylan, Winter Sleep does feature familiar archetypes of those with power and how they choose to use it. However, it spends time peeling back their layers and making them more human and conflicted characters. Scenes often take ten minutes to get their points, but it holds us with every articulate word. As a result, it has a very natural delivery of exposition, one delightfully deliberately crafted moreso than a taunt film. Plot threads are neither forced open nor closed. It's sprinkled with lyrical visual metaphors between the conversations that whilst obvious, they are very powerful, feeding into the character development. All the cast from top to bottom live in their character's skin in vivid detail, particularly from Bilginer and Melisa Sozen, who's vulnerable performance leaves the lasting impression of the supporting cast.Like with his previous film Once Upon A Time In Anatolia, one of the best films of its year, it's visually stunning. It may not have the same bravura as the former with ambitious camera movements, but it's just as sharp and striking, though with a kinder and more intimate approach to its network of characters. Ceylan has a careful and poetic use of space, light and movement in the simple interior scenes and every frame expresses so much. But it's also grand from the wide expanses of the snowy Anatolian mountains and from the harshness of the cold outdoors to the warmth of the rooms, the atmosphere feels palpable and immersive. It definitely makes the length and pace easier, along with its endearing sense of humour.However, it is hard to ignore that it feels like it panders to critics a little bit. There are too many unnecessary mentions of the craft and criticism of acting and writing. It feels extraneous to its main focuses. Unlike Once Upon A Time In Anatolia, which had fascinating ideas about the nature of truth and how we'll never know it, even if we witness events firsthand, Winter Sleep doesn't overtly have a universal point to make outside of its specificity to its characters and country, illustrating the divide between the powerful and powerless, but that's satisfying enough. It's a thoroughly engrossing, thoughtful and beautiful film and if the length doesn't intimate Academy voters too much, this is an easy frontrunner for the Foreign Language Film Oscar.8/10Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I have had high hopes for this one. I have like some of the stories of the Ceylan family. And I have appreciated the technical side of all their movies.This one is slow. Much slower than the others. And, pretty much like the other successful European teams, the Ceylans have bigger and bigger budgets. Which have to be explained. This way you get a lot of outdoor scenes that have no value, including the first frames, and quite a few of driving scenes also with no value.About an hour into the movie and I was wondering what am I doing in the room? I thought about asking my money back. But the power of "what if" was stronger. At the two hour mark my butt was hurting. And the story was getting worse.In the end the best part of this movie is getting outside and being able to move.So far, this is the worst Ceylans script. Almost every scene is explained after the action. You could guess some of the explanations, which makes the continuation of those particular scenes redundant. Other scenes remain cryptic, probably some Turkish custom badly explained.All I am left after wasting three hours is a shapeless mash. Is it about religion? Religion pops into the story in a pointless way that might mean meaningful message. But there is no religion in the end. Is it about the Turkish folk? But the folk are badly represented. Is it about Turkish intelligentsia? But they are also badly represented. Is it about education in Turkey? About a brother and a sister? About a wife and her much older husband? At the three hour mark the film or hard drive runs out. You get a regular cast and crew list on screen. But is it really over? This is a movie about everything. It ends up about nothing. But that is enough to seduce some juries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the same vein of Stray Dogs and A Separation, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter Sleep is a slow burner thought-provoking study of the human nature, fully exploring every single character's flaws, regrets and aspirations. I liked that in each piece of conversation, we really get to learn more about them and their conflicts. While there are plenty of interesting reflections on moral values, I felt some of these discussions were quite long at times, making them exhausting to watch. Still, Winter Sleep is a fascinating work that not only contains beautiful landscapes of the Anatolian Steppes, it also has some incredibly rich character development where we can all identify with these people's actions and arguments to some extent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie. But not for every palate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is important to know what kind of movies you like before you venture to the cinema to watch Winter Sleep. If you like romantic comedies, action packed movies, or musicals then you should stay as far away from this as possible. The movie is extremely slow paced, and lasts 3.5 hours which is a lot if you are not into it that much. I did not mind (in fact the last hour is the one that felt the shortest) but I really sensed that the director could have conveyed the same message in a two hours movie. I suppose he preferred to add extra time in every scene to make it feel more like a real life situation. And he succeeded. He also mastered the visual side of cinema with some impressive photography. Some shots were absolute eye candy!On a more personal note, I would say this doesn't fit entirely in the "My favourite movies" category, but rather in the "movies I can enjoy". And while I liked it, I could easily see people falling asleep or leaving the cinema half way through, so it's a hard movie to recommend to anyone, no matter the IMDb rating. If you are thinking about watching it, I suggest you do your homework and learn as much as you can before you pay your ticket. Better be safe than sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had ending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did it really manage to end? I thought that this film was never going to end. Yes, I think this film has many qualities. It portrays family relationships so well during peace and quite of winter somewhere in Anatolia. I am sure that these days it is not so peaceful and calm in Anatolia with all these refugees streaming from Sirya and Iraq into Turkey. Turkey does not have such a calmness in it, it is more hectic and wild place then portrayed in this film. After all Istanbul alone has 12 million people.I really do not think that this film is for a wider audiences. It is more an art film, and way way too long. It is for a narrow audiences who like these types of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life lessons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the many life lessons this film contains, I remembered this one best: generosity can be an act of compassion, but also one of selfishness. It is the message of the most powerful scene in the movie. It hits home because of the strong emotions shown by the protagonists, and the totally unexpected turn of events. There are a few such scenes in this movie, but not many. These masterful scenes, full of understated power, are examples of superior film making. There are also many scenes, filled with nothing but long dialogues about philosophical questions. They were much less appealing to me. Slowly but meticulously, the film unravels the character of Aydin, an intellectual who lives in a small village in the Turkish mountains. An inheritance has made him wealthy, he is married to a young and pretty wife, he runs a small hotel and seems to enjoy his simple and quiet life. He is happiest behind his Apple notebook, writing articles about current affairs for a small local newspaper. But in reality Aydin is an unhappy man. He is full of contempt for people with different moral values than his own. He thinks he is superior, 'a king in his own little kingdom', as he puts it. His rigid approach to what is wrong and what is right, leads to a conflict with one of his tenants, who is behind with the rent. Despite Aydin's moral superiority, there are limits to his leniency in this matter. At the same time, he disapproves of the philanthropic activities organized by his wife, which leads to a growing distance between them. The film raises many moral issues. Is justice compatible with compassion? How to deal with financial wealth? Are moral values absolute or relative? Should we resist evil? I could go on. Each viewer will have something to think about after having seen this film. This is no small accomplishment. In fact, one of the most powerful characteristics of good film making is to raise questions, without necessarily providing the answers. It is not hard to see why this film appeals to so many people. Everyone can find something in it from his or her own life. The questions raised are universal, they concern life itself. But a film raising universal questions is not necessarily a masterpiece. It doesn't mean there can be no weak points. I think the overall praise this film has received, is a bit overdone. In my opinion, 'Winter Sleep' tries too hard to be an intellectual challenge. Too many scenes are long, extended conversations. Moreover, they are not contributing to the plot (yes, there is one), but obscuring it. The best films don't spell everything out, but let the images speak for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatness of this film lies in the things, it didn't said. Sometimes though I wish they were spelled out.It is about the ability of mankind to withdraw from life, in order to survive the cold winter. There is a central scene between brother and sister, in which they dispute on the surface, but in fact they reveal layer for layer the excuses, they made for living their lives.However, and thats the main critic point, the movie moved me intellectually but not emotionally. The difference between a good movie and a great movie is: the good movie shows the problem, it requires intelligence, the great movie shows a way out, it requires courage. This one is "only" a good movie.The final scene remains a mystery to me: Is it meant as a happy or bad ending? Does it mean he begins, what he didn't dare to begin earlier, or does it mean he remains in his winter sleep. The closing pictures suggest the latter. It would make a great movie out of "Winter sleep".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some pictures and paintings which you would look for hours and you wouldn't give any meaning or get from it. This film is exactly like that. I don't believe in such thing as an 'art-film' because (in my opinion) cinema is not an art. And if you try to make a film forcibly artistic like this you get nothing. Because there is nothing. There are no dialogs in this film, just questions. Actors just ask questions which leads the story nowhere, it begins and it ends. There are so ridiculous philosophy theories which they will make you laugh. I'm a good movie watcher and believe me, when you see the characters start asking stupid philosophical questions each other for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON you will understand what I mean. There isn't any purpose, no emotion, no drama, no reason in anything in this film. Yet it can win palme d'or... Unbelievable. I adore Haluk Bilginer and Demet Akba&#x11f;, I think they're most successful and talented actors in Turkey. But this film is an unbearable nothingness. If your time is valuable, don't watch this. Just don't. I give 1 because there is no 0.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film marked the Turkish cinema to the world of Turkish cinema that provides a voice and, in addition to the excellence of construction, which is also the name of this mükelliyet until Nuri Bilge Ceylan, thank you. Turkey Turkish film, cinema attracts rare winter sleep because I can not find a word needed to describe the movie in the history of the Turkish nation, what a movie like this to see what was such a success. I think the Turks under the leadership of Nuri Bilge Ceylan to industrial aspect of foreign cinema, this film will carry the love and the happiness a difficult movie to watch. Winter sleep until all my gratitude to the staff and Nuri Bilge Ceylan and monitoring are not the Turks say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frustrating film that doesn't uplift</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film, no doubt about it. Depressing, yes, and the weather doesn't help. But I came away feeling disappointed. In a week in which the Turkish PM can tell the world "Equality between men and women is against nature", you hope that this film will go some ways towards disproving this stupid statement. It doesn't, though I think it could and should have.Some films are made to elucidate ideas, others to put ideas out there and let the viewer decide what to make of them. I left the cinema unsure which of these two kinds of thoughtful film the director was trying to make. Are we supposed to deplore the actions of the landlord getting to grips with a tenant who is way behind in the rent? If so, why? I felt I was being deceived by an attempt to pretend the viewer could come up with his/her own ideas about the supposed iniquity of the rich lording it over the poor, while in fact the film was busy pounding away telling me what to think.There is much to admire in this beautifully shot and acted film. I didn't mind the length of it, but it will test some. What's not to admire is all too obvious:a) many very lengthy and wordy existential conversations - even art films work best if this is kept to a minimumb) animal cruelty - there is simply no excuse for it these days c) the ending.There will be those who think this ending is deliberately left open and thus up to our imagination. I disagree. We are being deceptively fed the possibility of the wife's freedom from the past when in fact it's quite apparent what will happen given the way the plot line evolves concerning the money and what happens to women who leave their husbands (the sister says it all - a magnificent performance by the way). I don't see how this shows women to be anything less than commodities and beings to be protected in this culture. Of course, you might say. That's the point. Well, if that's the point, the filmmaker is doing very little to alter this situation. Men's bastardry is one thing, but when the plot itself conspires with the husband to condemn the wife, it's another. That is unforgivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie in slow motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie, but not good as 9.1 appeared as in this movie rating. Most of movie scenes happened inside village houses, a lot of talking between character. It tells a story, with an old actor turned into hotel owner, his young wife, other villager who are his tenants, different people have their own social character. However I expect above 9 rating movie should have grand scene and a lot of beautiful scenery or actions. I cannot find these elements in this movie. I will rate it as 7. It meets some audiences' appetite who like to see long talking with social content. Most of young people would prefer grand scene movie or more actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie today, based on ratings it received. Usually movies above 8 on IMDb are worth watching in cinema, but not this one. The characters were OK and there were some interesting word dialogs, but that is about it.It is way too long, over 3 hours. Way too little action (almost non-existent) for the movie of this length. Useless long scenes and talking about nothing could be skipped so this movie could be shortened for at least 1 hour. Watching this movie makes you feel you are waiting for the "main event" or "turning point", but it just doesn't happen. I am disappointed, and movie made me really tired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cant say I enjoyed the movie because my ass hurt, and "it" is my best critic. It looked more like a French film, with all that bla-bla-bla. But as critics say when they do not like the movie, the picture is very beautiful. I think that curiosity about how people lives in Capadocia counted a lot for the final note of this picture, not to mention a Palm D'or. The plot doesn't tell us why such a great actor took a young and beautiful wife and went to live in such a place. Well, i suppose he was a great actor, but when he questioned his sister about a play he worked and she said she didn't watch it, lead us to believe that she never went to a theater to watch a play performed by his brother. I really love to watch movies "not English spoken", when they come to theater usually are very good, this one was just boring. All in all I didn't sleep, so i hope the other critics can forgive me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because this film use the annoying and wrong philosophy opinions. People talk talk talk and what ? For nothing. A few couple actor, actress says lots of stolen adage of the writer ( example : Chekhov ) and stole a lot of scene from Andrei Tarkovsky .NBC trying to prove myself the other seems like wise but not wise just read some books, watch some movie and see few Europe country. This is the wrong cultural side of this piece of land ( turkey ). And NBC prize talking : says to this movie dedicate for young die people. This is bullshit NBC i'm not believe you and your artists.Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's seventh feature film which he wrote with Turkish screenwriter and photographer Ebru Ceylan and co-edited with film editor Bora Göksingöl, is based on three short stories by Russian author Anton Chekhov (1860-1904) which also inspired some of the dialog's. It premiered In competition at the 67th Cannes International Film Festival in 2014, was screened in the Masters section at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival in 2014, was shot on locations in Cappadocia, Anatolia in Turkey and is a Turkey-France-Germany co- production which was produced by producer Zeynep Ozbatur Atakan. It tells the story about a writer named Aydin who lives in a village within reach of Istanbul, Turkey with his wife named Nihal and his sister named Necla. One day after meeting a man with his assistant regarding the acquirement of a horse, Aydin becomes involved in a situation initiated by a local adolescent student named Ilyas.</fullReview>
