		<shortDescription>Ingenious film reflects Miles Music and Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely stunning! Attended the world premiere at the NewYork film festival this past weekend. As the film ended, my mind felt entranced. The film's rapid clip style and dramatic ending made me film as if I had viewed one of Mile's mind blowing paintings. Somehow, it all seemed to come together as one mental image at the end. An ingenious portrayal of both Miles music and painting style. Along with the fabulous music throughout, the movie even included a clip of miles working on one of his paintings, as if the cue us in on the films approach.The music of Miles Davis provides the background for many of the scenes and it is performed in many scenes. As Miles was also an accomplished abstract painter, he is also featured creating some of his artwork. His challenges, triumphs and failures in love, the music industry, music composition, health, etc. compose a collage that comes together like one of his abstract paintings. At the end, a stunning scene brings it all together and emphasizes the phenomenal impact of the Miles music through today, for all time, and across many genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a trippy trip of cool Miles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. What would rate as the bigger challenge: defining jazz or describing the life of Miles Davis? In true "passion project" mode, Don Cheadle not only portrays the iconic trumpeter, but also directs, co-writes and co-produces. Cheadle's tribute to The Prince of Darkness is as open to interpretation as the hundreds of songs from Davis' recordings over thirty plus years.Having stated in numerous interviews that he had no interest in the usual "cradle-to-grave" biopic, Cheadle's odd blend of fact, fiction and hallucination are meant to capture the essence of Miles Davis, rather than the life and times of the man. Guns, drugs, music, girls, and art are all present throughout this trippy trip of a movie that plays like an impressionistic painting, and not a portrait.The bulk of the film is spent on Miles Davis during his self-imposed six year drug-fueled hiatus in the 1970's when he secluded himself in Howard Hughes fashion. There is an odd and ill-fitting plot involving the "secret" master tapes that Davis has recorded while waiting for his manager (Michael Stuhlbarg as Harper Hamilton) to pay him the money he is owed. Mixed in is a "Rolling Stone" writer named Dave Brill (Ewan McGregor) desperately trying to get an interview with Miles and listen to the tapes. This mad caper-ish core benefits greatly from the quick cuts to the past ? especially those featuring Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi) as Miles' beautiful, talented and supportive wife.Of course, we shouldn't expect linear story-telling from a man whose life was anything but linear. After all, we are focused on the man who claimed his music was not "jazz", but rather "Social Music" ? and that "it takes a long time to play like yourself". The car chases and gunfights might seem out of place, but do capture the essence of a man fueled by drugs and a possible (temporary) loss of his creative genius. Perhaps, as the movie suggests, Miles was remorseful for how he treated Frances. Or maybe it was simply the pressure of being Miles Davis ?. The coolest of Cool Jazz.Mr. Cheadle does a nice job in portraying Davis, and is spot on in the trademark raspy whisper which Miles was known for (the after-effects of a larynx operation in the 1950's). Ms. Corinealdi (to appear in the new "Roots" project later this year) is outstanding as Frances Taylor, and is the one character we latch on to in hopes of maintaining our bearings throughout.Taking its title from a 1957 Miles Davis album, the movie offers a glimpse into the mind of a musical genius who didn't always fit into "proper" society, and would be the perfect pairing for a head-scratching trumpeter double-bill with the recent "Born to be Blue", a look at Chet Baker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles Below</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Cheadle plays a good part as the young and older Miles Davis, Ewan McGregor as usual in my opinion is poor and an expert at dumbing down all of his roles. How does he get the work I ask myself ? I, My friend and I are keen Miles Davis fans, his wife is not, to quote her " I know less about Miles Davis than before I saw the film " The storyline is poor, only showing a a brief chapter of Mile's life when he retired for five years, and the record company " stole " his new tape. An episode of the Keystone cops ensues with car chases and gun toting ....... Very uncool, very unMiles. I don't believe a word of it. OK,be different,but to only mention one of his 3 wives ( and imply he only had one wife) is downright ridiculous, and not one word about any of his many children and grandchildren I mean ...... Really ! I was really looking forward to this film but we all left the movie " Kinda Blue "</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheadle Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life and music of Miles Dewey Davis, better known as Miles Davis, is on display in the new bio-pic, Miles Ahead. Don Cheadle wears as many hats as afforded to him playing the title character as well as appearing in the credits as producer and director in a film that showcases Cheadle's talent and offers a strong case in ensuring the Oscar's have some color on the stage at next year's telecast.The film opens in the later years of Miles' life. He has already reached fame and fortune. But his drug addiction has turned him into a Howard Hughes recluse. And he has temporarily turned his back on music. The story opens with Miles alone in his home when he is aggressively approached by Rolling Stone magazine writer Dave Brill (Ewan McGreggor) who is interested in writing about Miles' new project. The opportunistic Brill gets swept into a fantastical series of events that include following Miles as he confronts his record label, procures cocaine and is chased through the streets in a hail of gunfire by unscrupulous folk looking to advance their worldly standing through the theft of Miles' still-in-progress demo tape.The events that unfold are not based on historical fact. But it doesn't matter. Miles Ahead is more a movie about the attitude and persona of legend Miles Davis than it is a straight up account of a fraction of the musician's life.By way of flashbacks, we get a glimpse into the more serene life of Miles Davis before drugs off-tracked his career. A clean cut Davis is seen rising in ranks through the Jazz clubs of America and eventually falling for Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi) who would eventually become his wife of 10-years.The film doesn't dive too deeply into the domestic violence between the two lovers that became headlines back in the early 60's nor does it touch too intensively the racial tensions in America at the time. There is a scene where Davis is unprovokingly harassed by police officers and taken to jail for simply showing kindness to a woman of white skin, but the film has no message to present in terms of Miles' involvement with racial divides at the time. Instead, Cheadle keeps the camera focused on a single day in the broken down icon's history. This works largely to the films advantage but sacrifices giving us a glimpse into the life of the historic character.Don Cheadle is a revelation as Miles. The raspy voice, the trumpet playing, the belligerence. All are played exactly on key. The supporting cast does amply in tow but there is little to look at outside of Cheadle's performance.For this particularly story, things do work out well in the end. Relatively. We had hoped for end credit title cards that would have told us more about the man. Those unfamiliar with Miles Davis might have wanted to know if he was still alive or what became of Frances Taylor after their split. Even a short blurb unveiling Miles' nine Grammy Awards would have been refreshingly educational at film's end.Miles Ahead is not the be-all of musician movies. But I would categorize Cheadle's performance of the late trumpet player as one of the better performances of a real-life musician on screen. It's good enough to recommend the film to anyone. Jazz fan or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music great, disappointing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had wonderful music, but I thought it incoherent and self-indulgent. If someone who doesn't know a lot about jazz, and thinks this film would be a good place to start, they will probably be put off, and worse, will deduce that many jazz musicians are druggies and nasty people. It isn't a biopic. It is a sketch of a very small part of Miles' life. Even though I know he was a difficult person, this film emphasized the negatives in his personality rather than the positives.It is a wasted opportunity to make a memorable film about this great musician.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumbled and Alienating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miles Ahead" is chaotically put together, difficult to follow, and difficult to care about. Miles Davis (Don Cheadle), the main character, is depicted as a repugnant human being. The film plays shopworn musician biopic tricks in nasty ways to manipulate the audience. In interviews, Don Cheadle has said that he needed to get a big white star to appear in the film, and thus he built the film around the MacGuffin of Davis being interviewed by Ewan McGregor, allegedly the big white star. My guess is that Cheadle's funding didn't come through not because he is a black actor playing a black musician. My guess is that the funding was hard to find because the script was not a commercial script, no matter the color of the main character. The film opens with a confusing mishmash of images. Miles Davis is being interviewed. We don't see the interviewer. There is film in the background of the Jack Johnson fight. This confused me. I know the fight took place over a hundred years ago and I did not know that anyone filmed it ? meaning I was losing focus on the movie I was watching, and drawn into thinking about the movie in the movie. Not a good thing. The scene is shot in extreme close-up. We see Don Cheadle's mouth and fingers as he smokes a cigarette; we also see an ashtray. This extreme close-up gives the film a claustrophobic feeling. As the film went on I began to wonder if the tight close-ups were used because there wasn't enough of a budget to create a set that reflected the time periods of the film: the 1970s and the 1950s. The unseen interviewer asks Davis about jazz. Davis interrupts the interviewer and commands, "Don't call my music jazz." He insists that calling his music "jazz" stereotypes it. That's one of the dumbest and most petulant things I've ever heard a character say. Of course Miles Davis was a jazz musician. Ordering someone not to call jazz jazz is the demand of a petty dictator who wants control of language. The film was just beginning and I already hated the main character. And I was really sick of all that focus on his cigarette and his ashtray. Ewan McGregor, the big white star meant to offer his magical powers to get purportedly rich whites to underwrite the movie and buy tickets to see it, shows up as Dave, a Rolling Stone reporter. He knocks on Miles Davis' door. Davis opens the door and immediately sucker punches Dave, a visitor he has never met. At this point, the film has offered me no reason to like Miles Davis, and lots of reasons to dislike him. There's more. He has a receding hairline and he wears his hair long ? an older man's unsuccessful attempt to look young. And he dresses like a blind pimp. He's wearing a hip-length, turquoise and black jacket made of fabric best reserved for upholstery in houses of ill repute. Davis has already proved he's cool by sucker punching a white man. He also proves he's cool in other cheap, manipulative ways. The film consists of a jumble of scenes shot in the 1970s and flashbacks to the 1950s. In the 1950s scene, Davis is in a car with a young white woman. The young white woman behaves foolishly. The young black woman in the front scene rolls her eyes at this white girl's buffoonery. So, Davis is cool because he can get a white girl. The car pulls up to a house. A very beautiful young black woman is on the street. This is Frances Taylor, whom Davis will marry. He asks his white date for a twenty dollar bill. She gives him one. He writes his phone number on the bill and hands it to the black girl. Again, Davis is cool because he can mistreat white people, in this case a woman. In more jumbled together, plot-less scenes, we see Frances dancing. She is exquisitely beautiful and the camera adores her. We see Frances and Davis making love. We don't see Miles Davis beating his wife. He did. He also made her quit her dancing career. What a guy. More jumbled, plot-less scenes whose only point is to show what a boss Miles Davis really was, because he could mistreat white people. Miles Davis marches in to the offices of Columbia records. There is a man there who is obviously meant to be Jewish. He is smarmy and oily and condescending and power trips Davis. Davis pulls out a gun and shoots at him. He takes the man's money and uses that money, in a subsequent scene, to purchase cocaine, from yet another worshipful, star-struck white man he mistreats, while a white girl, partially undressed, sits on a bed. Davis, of course, must tell her to move over so he can sit next to her. You get the idea. What the movie does not show you is that Miles Davis grew up comfortable and privileged. Davis' father was a dentist who owned a couple of homes and a ranch. His mother was a musician. Davis received music lessons as a teenager, on daddy's dime. Davis was no gangster. He was a brat and a creep and an abuser of himself and others. I learned nothing about his appeal or his talent from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles deserves better, just O.K.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miles Ahead (2016) 1hr. 40 min.Miles Davis is one of the best jazz musicians of all time. Davis was one of those musicians that really conveyed great talented passion and emotion in his trumpet playing. Miles made a great album in particular his 1959 masterpiece" Kind of Blue". Which Rolling Stone magazine voted it as one of the best albums of all time, regardless of genre of music. His life should've been made ages ago, unfortunately it took 2016 for a Davis film to be made, with Don Cheadle playing the great musician and also making his directorial debut.The film takes place in 1980, where Davis hasn't made an album in five years and has recorded on but does not want the album released without his permission. He would prefer to snort his new drug of choice, cocaine than work on any releasable music. He is also hates to do interviews but a persistent one from Rolling Stone writer Dave (Ewan McGregor) who wants desperately to interview the legend and follows him to his record company at Columbia records and talks to a the President of Columbia, Harper (Michael Stahlberg) whose ethics are not honorable and demands Dave to coax Davis to send his most recent work to work with a talented musician (Keith Stansfield), who is also a junkie heroin addict. The one drug that Davis was once addicted to. Miles has no desire to give his boss anything and threatens his boss with a gun to leave him the hell alone. Dave decides to take matters into his own hands with questionable ethics, to get his dream of an interview with a legend and says he know someone who can give him good coke. On the basis of drug use they become good friends. The first part of the movie is about a cat and mouse game of Davis music recording becomes of tug of war of who has the upper hand in who will eventually get Davis most recent recording. Another main subplot is more interesting is the relationship between Davis and his greatest love and muse Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corlneaidi) which takes place in the 1950's. The film deals with their courtship, marriage and Davis wanting Frances to give up her career as a dancer when they marry. To all of the predictable, nonetheless interesting because it is well acted are the relationships of Davis girlfriends and his infidelity and his addiction to a drug that makes him paranoid. The film contends that the relationship with Frances gave him the greatest creative musical prowess and his music was at its great peak when Davis dated and married Frances.The film other subplot is also not very original but the car chase sequences back and forth between Davis and Dave vs. Harper and is crooked associate's is not very interesting and lacking in energy. Miles Davis deserved a better treatment in a subplot that is right out of the many car chases we have seen in the movies since the standard of car chases in the great 1971 action cop movie The French Connection. A car chase still can be entertaining if those scenes can offer something thrilling, this film action scenes are rather dull and pointless. The other love story is predictable but well-acted with Corlnealdi a standout as Davis's greatest love. Don Cheadle is very good as the great trumpeter, I just wish it was in a movie that dealt with a more interesting story of Davis life, maybe coming to terms with his coke addiction and his marriage to the great actress Cicely Tyson. Cheadle does a very good job of directing his first feature, but as it stands, more should have been made of his personal struggles with addiction and more of the great jazz that people love with great intensity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Misses The Mark By A Million Miles !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really was looking foreword to this film, i love classic jazz and Miles Davis stands with Charlie Parker as the best of the best, but oh dear this film is just dreadful and on so many levels it is a disaster from first to last. Where to begin, well the films scrip and plot revolves round his Howard Hughes like recluse years when he withdrew from performing and casts what i believe to be a purely fictitious chase all over town after a stolen session tape, with a writer looking for a story hugging his heels.cue loads of bad language as Don Cheadle who has a passing resemblance to the jazz genius profanes crudely and engages in crazy gun fights and threatens all and sundry with a gun to there face. Now we know Miles Davis had a dark side but where is the evidence for this nonsense that seems straight out of a "blackspoiltation" B movie of the seventies complete with stilted dialogue glibly uttered. Clint Eastwood gave us "Bird" a masterful film on Charlie Parker, Miles Davis deserves a film of equal stature not this all together embarrassingly wooden fiction that is all together empty. At last over the end titles we get to listen to some Miles Davis jazz, i at least i enjoyed these moments as the small audience silently walked out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Social Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the reviews of Miles Ahead amass on the Internet I'll be interested to read all the different ways people will have to describe Don Cheadle's electrifying performance as jazz great Miles Davis. Or should I say "social music" great, a term Mr. Davis preferred to jazz, according to this biopic. I'd never heard this term before, looked it up online after the movie ended, but couldn't find any definition that fit what I thought Mr. Davis might have meant. What it meant to me though, after being treated to a sumptuous sampling of Miles Davis music in the film, is that there's no better musical expression of the human soul than jazz if done right. In Miles Ahead, Don Cheadle seems to be able to relate to that. As for his portrayal of Miles Davis in general, he plays a man who lays everything on the line in everything he does. Total honesty. Total this feels right so I'm going to do it. No-bs, no-putting-up-with-bs attitude. From violence and crudeness to stunning beauty - this is humanity unadulterated. The movie's high points, to me, are the stunning beauty scenes - when Mr. Davis plays the horn. That is the culmination of everything.Still, it's ironic that while Don Cheadle seems to get not only jazz, but the concept of creativity - starting off the movie with the Miles Davis quote "When you're creating your own sh**, man, even the sky ain't the limit" - Miles Ahead is limited by being formulaic. In other words, the movie itself is not jazz, though at times it tries to be and wants you to think it is. For example, there is too much clichéd man/woman relationship drama in the film, and while I get that Miles' love of women is necessary to portray for the all-important character development, Miles Ahead gets a little schmaltzy at times, if only because I'd seen the same kind of drama scenes more or less so many times before in so many Hollywood movies. Overall, Miles Ahead is a passionate tribute, beautifully done, and the love that Don Cheadle had for the project and for Miles Davis really shines through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a film about Miles but a film straight from the heart of Miles -- Bravo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MILES AHEAD --. World Premiere at Berlin 2016. Non competition special reviewed By Alex DeleonAn Incandescent reincarnation of legendary American Jazz Musician Miles Davis by Don Cheadle, directing, producing, playing trumpet, and playing Miles himself in bushy Afro hairdo in a multi-faceted one man tour de force. This very special biopic took the Paying non-professional German audience in the cavernous Friedrichstadt Palast by storm, arousing enthusiastic ten minute ovations (two of them! -- once at end of the film itself and again after the end credits finish rolling).On stage after the screening Mr. Cheadle, a little guy (but a giant on screen, like Japanese samurai star Toshiro Mifune) was evidently taken aback by such an unexpectedly thunderous reception from a foreign audience which he acknowledged with extreme modesty. This is not exactly a full biopic in the ordinary sense of the word as it concentrates on a mere couple of days in the life of the black American jazz legend, but these are explosive enough to convey a full picture of the angry arrogant wound-up artist who lived behind the trumpet. Don Cheadle has come a light year in the movie business since his screen debut as a G.I. in the Viet Nam war film, Hamburger Hill, 1987, or Boogie Nights as a porn star opposite Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore in 1997. In the press conference which preceded the screening Cheadle said that this film which he worked on for six years, learning to play the trumpet in the process, is practically a lifelong dream come true. He grew up on the music of Davis and ever since entering the business has had such a project in mind. However, in the event, he states that he did not want to make a film "about Miles Davis" but rather a film in the skin of Miles Davis, as if the gangsterlike trumpet virtuoso had come back to life to present himself in his own words. Speaking in the role with a typical negro mushy mouthed style identical to the way Miles actually spoke, not cleaned up for a middle class audience and foreign to the perfect "white" elocution that is natural to the black actor in every day life, this is a film that pulls no punches and is loaded to the gills with the F-word and the MF-word, translated into German in the subtitles as the much weaker "Wikser" (habitual masturbator) -- clearly German has no real equivalent for the standard American ebonic Mutha-f****r. No matter. Powerful unexpurgated trashy dialogue all the way and a fiery angry arrogant gun toting performance by Cheadle which accomplishes the artistic task he has set out for himself in this Magnum Opus of his Hollywood career.The story Cheadle chooses to tell focuses on the period in Miles's life when, already a living legend but having been out of action for five years addicted to cocaine as well as booze, he is about to stage a comeback to perform once again live on stage. An extreme sleaseball of a Rolling Stone reporter (Ewan McGregor) comes knocking at his door demanding an interview, and will not take No for an answer even if this puts his own life at stake. Obviously at this point in his fame and notoriety any live interview with Miles Davis would make the career of any obtrusive little known jerk of a journalist. The Rolling Stoner works his way into Miles' marginally "good graces" by supplying him with oodles of Coke and becomes his companion in a wild run around town to recover a private tape of Davis's latest music from a bunch of sleazy music producers who have commandeered it. The background music is largely from the best selling Davis album "Sketches of Spain" and we see Cheadle actually blowing trumpet in flashbacks. Along The way we learn that Miles did not like the term Jazz for his music -- "I make "Social Music" he says pointedly in the picture -- and we also see that he can play the piano and is very familiar with modern classic composers such as Stravinsky and Eric Satie. No musical slouch, Mr. Miles Davis! But when confronting the A-holes who have stolen his music he waves a menacing gun at them and we have little doubt that he will use it if necessary. In this compact segment from a desperately lived life Cheadle even finds time for a little romance in the person of a beautiful black actress with the tongue twister name, Emayatzy Corninealdi, who accompanied Don to Berlin.Over All the film is very violent with a few tender moments between Cheadle and Corinealdi, and a jittery hand held camera may throw some viewers off in spots but reflect the hectic pace of the chase. Pic ends up with Cheadle/Davis back on stage blowing his axe in patented inimitable Milesian style. Miles Davis died in 1991 at age 65 universally recognized as one of the most influential and innovative American musicians of the XXth century, jazz or-nojazz. Unquestionable Oscars in 2017 when the pic will become eligible for consideration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is really good but the real reason to watch is for Don Cheadle. He gives a career defining performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't call me music jazz, it's social music." Health complications has forced Miles Davis (Cheadle) into a type of forced retirement. When Rolling Stone reporter Dave Braden (McGregor) shows up to interview Miles Dave is met with resistance. He begins to see just how crazy Miles really is, and then when one of Miles' private recordings goes missing he really gets a taste of the mad genius that is one of the greatest musical minds of all time. This is a different type of bio-pic. Like the special features say this is not a cradle to the grave movie, its a heist movie involving Miles Davis. As weird as that sounds it really works and breathes new life into this genre. That said Cheadle really inhabits this person. He co-wrote, directed and starred in this and really hits it out of the park on all three. The movie flows like Miles' music. It is very loose and not structured like a normal film is but it works and you wonder why everyone can't do things like this. The movie is really good but the real reason to watch is for Don Cheadle. He gives a career defining performance and I would not be surprised to see him nominated for many awards for this movie. Overall, a movie much like Miles' music, at first you are trying to catch up to what is going on but when you finally settle in you just sit back and enjoy watching the madness unfold. I recommend this. I give this a high B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miles Ahead: the Film's Ending Saves DavisMiles Ahead is an interesting take on the life of the jazz master. It's not a standard biopic telling a tale of the rise, then fall, then rebirth of an artist. Miles Ahead starts toward the end of his career when he is 'taking a break' from performing and recording. We learn that Davis has a deal with Colombia Records to start recording again, but he has yet to follow up when the film starts. Several plot lines run throughout the film. However, the only one that is fully explored is his marriage. It runs the standard arc of plots with an introduction, conflict, plot points and resolution. The other stories within this film are not so successfully explored. We have an idea why Davis took time off, but we don't get the full picture of his talents and his method for writing. More time spent on his work and less time with his interactions with the record label and the Rolling Stone magazine writer would have made this film more profound and enjoyable. Don Cheadle is excellent at embodying the conflicts of the artist. It is not a salute to an idol, it is a full exposé, the talent, his influence, his trouble working with others, his addictions, and his struggle with fame. Davis at once hates his fame and desires to focus on the music while also uses it to get what he wants and to manipulate others. It's his love-hate relationship with his stardom that is the crux of the film in like of his past. However, the film doesn't go deep enough to satisfy your regular audience member that knows little about the man. A major problem with the film is that while is does well in presenting the marriage and his conflicts with his fame, it also stupidly tries to be an action film. The relationship with the Rolling Stone writer just distracts from the heart of the story and plays out like a Three Stooges bit. Ewan McGregor is out of place as writer Dave Brill and can't bring enough charisma to the screen to make it work. The plot line with the writer is an annoying distraction from the acting of Cheadle and the struggles of an artist. Thus, for all its good, and it has a lot of good, I only recommend two-thirds of the film. Fortunately, the ending is so well done that it salvages the good in the film. Rating: MatinéeCheadle is excellent at playing Davis, but his poor writing and directing decisions detract from what is an otherwise interesting film about a master musician.

		<shortDescription>A fine directorial debut for Don Cheadle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miles AheadThe film focuses on the five year period that jazz great, Miles Davis had disappeared from public view, when he had stopped touring, recording and playing the trumpet. It is known that during that period of time, he had engaged in painting, and subsequently some of this work has been exhibited and even become collectable. There is much speculation as to the reasons for Miles Davis' withdrawal from playing and performing. It has been suggested from various sources that this can be attributed to health problems, partly due his lifestyle and then leading eventually to artistic burn-out. Pressures of touring and producing work, were to take their toll. Before this break in playing, his last recorded material was on the Agharta and Pangaea albums, which are recordings of the same concert in Japan in 1975, which includes contributions from musicians; Sonny Fortune and James Mtume. These recordings are long, trumpet-led, intuitive jams, which display Miles Davis' vast experience, and mastery of the jazz improvisation art-form. He has a unique trumpet voice, and musical direction. One would say a natural leader. The film takes up, the story from this period. The film touches on the issue of Miles Davis' problems, during this period, maintaining creative control of his previously recorded music (discography) in a changing relationship with the record company. His output had stopped and questions were being asked, re- issued recordings were being planned by his old record company, to exploit his back-catalogue and artistic legacy and for commercial gain. Naturally, Miles was not happy. Also there was the emergence of young star trumpeter, at the time, whose name is fictionalised in the film. In fact the youthful emergent trumpeter in the movie does have a strong resemblance to a young Freddie Hubbard.Miles Davis' disputes with his old record company, and record company CEO's were the subject of articles in the music press at the time.There were combative interviews with The Face (magazine) and US TV current affairs programme, 60 Minutes. Those are widely seen as hostile interviews, or "ambush interviews". Depending on your perspective, the film could be said to have trivialised these serious issues, but there was a decision to make some of the issues lighter and even comedic. The film can work on different levels.There are lots of sources elsewhere for those who would like to know more, and also the Miles Davis' autobiography, edited by Quincy Troupe. The film also has the contemporary Miles Davis reflecting on a past love, in Emayatzy Corinealdi (as Frances), and looking back on this relationship, and his earlier success as a jazz artist, with the great quintets that he formed. There are suggestions of a hedonistic lifestyle that spiralled out of control, and was destructive to personal relationships, but that should not detract from the enormity of his contribution to jazz as an art form. Ewan McGregor, plays a reporter, whose character could be based on, several real life characters. He is is depicted as having inveigled his way into Miles Davis' home, in order the get "the comeback story".The film is in the genre of, creative non-fiction i.e. The director takes artistic licence, in a very creative way. Within the scope of what was intended it is a great achievement.By the end of the film, Miles had started his comeback, which we know is the year 1981. He has his "chops" back and will go on to be active, recording and playing for another decade all over the world with successful new material. This film, Miles Ahead, will perhaps urge those who don't know much about Miles Davis, to look into his music and his wide-reaching legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never was a statement so true from the mouth of Don Cheadle as Miles Davis in this masterpiece, Miles Ahead.It's a movie that is a visual persona of what Miles Davis was accomplishing with his music. Miles Ahead lives up to it's name.For the first few minutes I was a little disappointed because I was expecting more of a biopic about the Jazz legend. Instead it focuses on Miles Davis attempts to protect his music form those who can't wait to see what he has produced after a five year hiatus and exploit it. It also flashbacks to a time of Davis' relationship with his wife. I loved Cheadle's interpretation of Davis, it was everything I expected the icon to be and I love Ewan McGregor's supporting role as a journalist trying to do a story on Miles only to get caught up in his troubles. Miles Ahead is not very straight forward, but it is a great music biopic, that goes more over the art he creates rather than the man's life. It captures Davis at a time when he seem burned out and was looking for another creative spark to bring him back. As great as the movie was from a visual standpoint, looking like it came straight from the seventies in both cinematography and art direction, the music was really good (as it should be). Don Cheadle did a lot of the composing himself which was really cool.It was not was I was looking for but turned out to be everything I wanted. Thank you Don Cheadle for being, Miles Ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Den Cheadle shines in Miles Davis movie (don't call it a bio-pic)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miles Ahead" (2015 release; 100 min.) is a movie about the jazz legend Miles Davis. As the movie opens, we are in 1980, and Miles is being interviewed, and comments to the reporter: "Don't call my music jazz, it's social music!". It's not long before another reporter, Rolling Stone's Dave Braden, chases down Miles, to write a "come-back story in Miles' own words". We then go back to the 1950s, as Miles is breaking big. One day he meets Francis, and he is immediately smitten with her. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a labor of love AND a tour-de-force by Don Cheadle, who stars in the title role and directs, and he also co-wrote the script and co-produced. His performance as Miles Davis is spot-on, and towers above everyone else. Sorry Ewan McGregor (as the Rolling Stone reporter), and sorry also Emayatzy Corinealdi (as Frances). Cheadle's brilliant performance covers up the somewhat confusing back-and-forth between the "present" (i.e. late 70s) and the flashbacks in the 50s. Please note that "Miles Ahead" is not a bio-pic, nor is it intended as one. Cheadle (whose vision for the film was fully supported by the Miles family) simply picked two periods of Miles' life and attempts to give us a flavor of what Miles Davis the man was like. At that, I think Cheadle succeeds. If you don't care for the music of Miles Davis (?), by all means avoid this film, as it is chock-full of outstanding music (check out the excellent soundtrack, available here on Amazon). The very last scene of the movie is a live performance with participating in the band none other that Herbie Hancock, Gary Clark Jr. and Esperanza Spalding, just to name those. Just fantastic. Last but not least, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that 95% of the movie was shot on location here in Cincinnati. Yes indeed, just like Todd Haynes' film "Carol" a few months ago, there are certain sections of Cincinnati that apparently easily stand in for New York back in the day."Miles Ahead" finally opened this weekend on two screens at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I doubt that this movie is going score huge at the box office, but hopefully it'll find some legs at the art-house theater circuit. If you are curious to find out more about Miles Davis, or simply want to admire the stellar performance of Don Cheadle, you cannot go wrong with "Miles Ahead", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Cheadle's Miles Davis biography is a fictionalized look at the jazz great's drugged-out period in the 1970s. "Miles Ahead" depicts the man (whom Cheadle also plays) as a damaged genius. Watching Ewan McGregor's reporter try to interview Davis, I got the feeling that Davis didn't want to be viewed as a celebrity, resulting in his reclusive phase. Moreover, he insisted that people call his music not jazz, but social music.The movie is worth seeing. I guess that the limited focus and fictionalized story weaken it. The only look at race relations is when a cop turns aggressive after watching Davis escort a white woman to a car. But for the most part, this is a fine piece of work. It looks as though Davis was truly a complex character, even if he did have a not-so-nice side. I'll have to listen to his music to see what I think. After all, when you create your own s**t, not even the sky's the limit.Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, Miles Ahead.....Just finished watching it.Now, as a professional musician, the influence and inspiration I have gained from Miles Davis cannot even be measured, so, to say I was eagerly awaiting this film is, to say the least, an understatement.That being said, I may be the victim of my own misplaced expectations, but, while I did avoid any detailed synopsis of the film before I watched it, I saw it referred to in articles and promotional materials as a "biopic" repeatedly in the preceding months.If that was a biopic about Miles Davis then Yellow Submarine was a biopic about The Beatles.I think I'll just leave it at that. It's an entertaining enough way to spend a couple hours, and Don Cheadle is, as always, excellent, but, in my opinion, any insight into the life and works of Miles Davis in this film is strictly coincidental, and, if it was meant as allegory, I missed it.Anyway, if you have any interest in such subject matter, check it out and judge for yourself. It's at least worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of the few days that a journalist spends with the jazz legend, Miles Davis. He tries to get an interview from Miles Davis, but Davis violently refuses. Somehow they strike a bond with each other, and spend a few days together working towards a common goal.The beginning of the film portrays Miles Davis to be very unlikable, as he is violent under a constantly intoxicated state. It is hard to form a bond with such a character, hence I find the film not so nice to watch. As the story goes on, the common goal becomes interesting as it almost becomes a heist film. Though I still don't quite understand what exactly is so important on the tape that Davis has to use extreme measures to recover it, I still find the film adequately entertaining and engaging.</fullReview>

In terms of the subject at its core though, I feel like it could have gone a lot further than it actually did. It feels like a lot remains to be seen, although perhaps it was for the best that the film didn't feel the need to extend the storyline and try to fit in everything from the man's life into one film because those films rarely work. Don Cheadle does a nice job behind the camera but most importantly, he delivers the best thing about it in his portrayal of Miles. Not amazing, but very good indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Davis Miles on the playful and impressionist manner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Miles Ahead is a 2015 American biographical film directed by Don Cheadle, which Cheadle co-wrote with Steven Baigelman, Stephen J. Rivele, and Christopher Wilkinson, based on the life of jazz musician Miles Davis. The film stars Cheadle, Emayatzy Corinealdi, and Ewan McGregor, and closed the New York Film Festival on October 11, 2015. The film takes its title from Davis' 1957 album.--Reception: -Miles Ahead received generally positive reviews from critics. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating in the 0?100 range based on reviews from top mainstream publications, calculated an average score of 64, based on 21 reviews. Based on 83 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 72% approval rating from reviewers, with an average score of 6.4/10. The site's consensus reads, "Miles Ahead is worth watching for Don Cheadle's strong work on both sides of the camera, even if this unconventional biopic doesn't quite capture its subject's timeless appeal".-In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that while Davis purists may complain about the imagined sequences in the film, but "they'll also miss the pleasure and point of this playfully impressionistic movie." She was particularly impressed by Cheadle's ability to shift between "times, moods and modes effortlessly".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good, but really, really weird film, is less "an exploration of the life and music of Miles Davis", more heist flick, told in flashback, about a reporter, Dave Brill, trying to interview Miles Davis, and subsequently trying to steal a one-of-a- kind, unreleased demo recording. When an A&amp;R man from the record label beats Brill to it, Brill sees his chance with Davis now being to help him get the tape back.Many of the shots are annoyingly filmed in extreme close-up, and I'm not sure if I enjoyed this film in spite of all of its weirdness, or because of it, but either way, it's a fun ride, just leave your mind at the door, and let its exceptional soundtrack, good acting, and almost surreal, hallucinatory vibe carry you along for the ride.</fullReview>

Excellent use of flashback, and you can tell whether it is in the past or present by Cheadle's effective use of lighting. The use of fictional characters moves the story along as it is not a straight bio. It focuses on a part of Davis' life with a look back at certain points, with Frances as past regret. Even if you know nothing about Davis' work, the film is effective in showing the problems any famous musician faces with trying to top oneself, and creative pressures. There is humor and Cheadle has Davis' low rasp of a voice down pat. Very interesting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As the tagline suggests, A story best told with attitude.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you're a fan of 'jazz' music or not, you can't escape or deny knowing what/who Miles Davis was. Unless of course, you're of a certain young generation that hasn't discovered him yet. It'll come, and Don Cheadle will help do exactly that with this semi-fictional biopic of the legendary yet destructive great. You can tell Don Cheadle has put his heart and soul into his project, writing, directing and starring himself as the Prince of Darkness. He tells a tall story of Miles Davis during his hermit years in the mid seventies when he rested for five years whilst ignoring everyone, reporters and his contract obligations with Columbia Records. It's not about how Miles Davis came about, it's not about his climb to fame and fortune or his education and early friendships with greatness. It's not about his death, in any way which is refreshing. But it is about a story with attitude, and attitude is something both Davis and this film has as the tag line suggests. The story gives great opportunity in displaying Davis' darker, nastier side and his self- destructive nature which wasn't a big secret. However you might grow to like his bad attitude and being to understand why. Ewan McGregor's cunning yet fictional reporter seems to be the anchor whilst the story flips between flashbacks and he can almost be mistaken as a figure of Davis' imagination, almost like a fight club. "First rule of jazz club..." McGregor does good, and good in not drawing too much spotlight off our star. It's good they have chosen up and coming actors to co-star like Emayatzy Corinealdi, Michael Stuhlbarg (Steve Jobs) and Keith Stanfield (Selma). All of them playing exceptional parts. They're certainly people to watch out for. It's brilliant and especially for Don Cheadle's Directorial debut, it's well shot, well paced and edited, it's almost trippy, loaded with snippets of Miles' trademark sound which you might come to appreciate if not already doing so. Just remember, it's not just about the music but more about him. Cheadle has done what James Mangold/Joaquín Phoenix did for Johnny Cash. #socialmusic Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 7 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for Don Cheadle, he does good in every aspect. 77% 8/10</fullReview>

When you look beyond the snippets of muted trumpet doodles totally interchangeable for the average U.S. citizen, does the movie watcher REALLY wind up MILES AHEAD here? The drug addict at the center of this story is supposed to be a sympathetic character because he comes out on the short end of a boxing bout with his wife, as she leaves him with a crippling hip injury. Since he habitually shoots up business offices and urban streets with terrible aim (perhaps resulting from his injury and heavy drug use), the authorities need a warrant for Mr. Davis' guns in order to solve some of the cold cases involving by-standers fatally struck down with stray bullets. When heavy drug use, abuse of women, and being a general Menace to Society are considered Role Model Material, you just know that America is Doomed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles Davis as... blaxploitation bad-ass (some of the time(?) Sure, why not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how much of this movie is true. If you asked me in my heart of hearts, I don't really care to know - it'd be nice if it's ALL true, even the parts that are wildly outrageous and show Miles Davis as at times a super bad-ass like out of a Jack Hill movie or a character rising in the ranks of a Rudy Ray Moore vehicle (only a good actor, a really good one, and a good writer/director which helps) - and that's fine. It IS just a movie after all, and Cheadle understands as an actor for many years, and here a director, what an image can project: for most of this storyline Davis is in his 70's crazy-hair mode, all by himself in his massive apartment in New York city, sometimes on coke, sometimes not, and he'll dress sharp while distancing himself (though still projecting his "cool") in giant glasses. It's a similar thing as Elvis in the Elvis/Nixon movie from this month, only here it's not commented on so strongly.I think the question people have going in is that 'this looks a little rougher and rawer, is it a typical biopic?' Yes and no. Yes in that the flashbacks, which show Miles' other obsession with his wife Frances (a very good Emayatzy Corinealdi, she holds her own in a mostly male cast sometimes with just a look like 'seriously?' like when Miles asks her to stop dancing and only be her husband). It's one of those love stories that you know will go south by nature of who Davis was, and in that sense it's not much different than many of the other biopics that involve a love story where things go south - it was other women (many others), and Cheadle maybe knows this and makes it obvious from the start: she sees Francis from across a street in a car while already with another woman and gets a 20 just to write his number down. Peachy!To say Miles Davis was a groundbreaking artist and influential to upteenth thousands (tens of thousands, or more) musicians and other artists all over is something that is distant in the background but, wisely, is never stated. It doesn't have to be, and though Miles Davis liked the spotlight and attention he didn't need it or ever craved it. He played and played with other people (Gil Evans, Coltrane - how he found him and his telling of it is a brief aside in this movie that is perfect - Bill Evans, and so on), and people came to see him, but he didn't need to play for anyone, ever. But when it came to that one reel of tape, in the scope of this story, it becomes more about flexing his bad-assery to anyone around, including Ewan McGregor's journalist (think of End of the Tour if it was directed in the 70's by Jack Hill or something, and you get the idea).So some of this is conventional, but it's mostly the flashbacks and, at the least, they are directed and acted with a go-for-broke fire that makes it watchable. The main storyline, however, is just awesome; Davis took s*** from no one, and yet there's a humbling/vulnerable factor to how Cheadle plays him and how Davis was; he had a hip problem and had to take a lot of pills, which messed with his mind (we see some of this unfold in the flashbacks, but also in the 'present' time it's set in the 70's), and so he walks with a limp. He never plays it too hard though, and Cheadle owning it in Davis makes it all the more compelling: like, 'yeah, I'm Miles Davis, f*** you, give me my (insert more streams of mother-effer) tape! It may turn off those who only see it as a passion project, but I saw a lot more in it - crazy intensity, and a rhythm to the cutting and camera-work that made it more like a thriller than a typical rise-and-fall saga. Though I wish it were even better - it has the potential to be among the great jazz movies, not unlike the recent Born to be Blue, which also featured Davis - it's an entertaining ride through 70's-drenched paranoid, don't-give-a-f*** bravura filmmaking and style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Miles AheadMiles Ahead is not a documentary. Neither would I call this film a biopic. It doesn't describe Bee Bop, nor does it exhibit the thrills of live vintage performances once showcased at one of the world's most famous Jazz venues, The Village Vanguard. It's not about Mile's many addictions and never explores his International acclaim. Miles Ahead is a moment in Jazz History. It details a passionate protest, an objection to or disapproval of something, either formally or publicly. In this case, Don Cheadle's Miles Ahead is about both. Throughout the film, Miles's only mission is to reclaim a master copy of his Music of which Columbia Records subsequently owns. Columbia's mission, on the other hand, is to have complete ownership of Mile's music and that included 'Someday My Prince will Come', the album which features a picture of Frances, the love of his life (or so we think) on the cover. Knowing this, Davis quickly demonstrates his objection by reminding Columbia's executives that 'HIS MUSIC' was truly his and for this reason, Don Cheadle as Miles Davis stops at nothing in order to take back and control what he believed was rightfully his own.If you come out of the theater knowing one thing about Miles Davis, Let it be that Mile's music was sacred to him, more important than his marriage, his reputation or his many addictions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles Ahead is an Unconventional Music Biopic That Shows Don Cheadle's Skills as an Actor and a Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I understand this was a passion project for Don Cheadle. He pounded the pavement, got financing from numerous sources and finally got the movie made. I read a little bit about Miles Ahead after I saw it and Don was very insistent on making this a different kind of story about Miles Davis. I'll go into it in more detail later in the review but I would say he succeeded completely, he delivers a fresh perspective on the genre and one that has stylistic touches you would expect from a much more experienced director. *Minor Spoilers Ahead* Sometime in the late 1970s Miles Davis (Don Cheadle) is trying to get by and work on a new album. The studio (Columbia Records) is tired of waiting and has cut off the allowance they have been sending him. This irritates him and that doesn't help as he's been reminiscing about his past love Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi). All of a sudden there's a knock at the door and a reporter from Rolling Stone named Dave Braden (Ewan McGregor) forces his way in. He wants to do the Miles Davis comeback story and he won't take no for an answer. This leads to Davis punching him in the face. After a while, Davis gets tired of this and decides to go see Columbia who Braden claims set the interview up. On the way there, Davis is less than forthcoming about his life, irritating the crap out of Braden. They get there and the studio tells him that they will not release anymore money until they get the session tapes from the recording sessions at his house. Davis refuses still and after he leaves, one of the executives named Harper (Michael Stuhlbarg) offers money for whoever can steal the recordings from Davis' house. Miles is infuriated and is ready to get rid of Dave until Dave promises to score him some coke.While most of the reviews of Miles Ahead have been positive, most of the praise has gone to Don Cheadle for his performance as Miles Davis. I would agree that he does such a great job. You forget that it's Don playing Miles Davis. I'm not familiar with Davis' work or his life for that matter but for a guy that had a lot of awful aspects to his personality, you still want to follow him and see what's going to happen to him next. This is due to the excellent performance from Don. Emayatzy Corinealdi was also good, she has a strength as Frances and it's hard to watch her give up her dream and deal with Miles Davis because of the confidence in her performance. Ewan McGregor paired with Don Cheadle really well, it's fun to watch them together and even though his character is fictional, he's necessary as the audience avatar to witness Davis' increasingly erratic behaviour. The only downside when it comes to the acting was Michael Stuhlbarg as Harper the music executive. Stuhlbarg is a good actor but his character isn't terrible subtle, he may as well have had BAD GUY written on his forehead.What makes this movie different from the conventional music biopic is that they deal with the time line in a different way. Instead of focusing on Miles Davis' entire career, it's just the two periods of it. Some people have complained that it takes liberties with the truth and I'm not going to disagree. Certain parts of the movie feel like they stretched the truth and dramatized things but it didn't bother me really. This genre has become very formulaic, to the point where it's being parodied and joked about. I was just so happy to see something with a different take on a musician's career. The movie was actually exciting and the gangster style the story took made it interesting.Despite it being only somewhat rooted in reality, there's a lot of little things that make Miles Ahead better than the standard biopic. The way the movie transitions between scene to scene is actually like a lot of Miles' music, it's full of style and unpredictable. The movie also has a big dose of his music and they use it well. Miles Ahead also has some pretty great dialogue, there's some really good lines that come from Miles Davis and I always appreciate when a movie can find some humour to liven things up.I had a feeling that this movie would be good but I was surprised at how different the movie was. You can tell it was shot on the cheap but the cinematography was decent and the grainy feel even helped get you into the time period. It wasn't groundbreaking and it might not have been a substitute for a documentary but I was willing to enjoy it for what it was. This is a different type of story and it delivered a different kind of experience. If you're not too attached to a 100% accurate retelling of the Miles Davis story, I think you'll enjoy this quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles Davis didn't call his music 'jazz', he preferred 'social music.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this at home on DVD from my local public library. My wife chose to not see it, not her kind of movie.I was a trumpet player through high school, college, and about 20 years of my adult life. I of course knew of Miles Davis but his music is not what I enjoyed hearing. For old style Jazz give me Louis Armstrong, or more currently Wynton Marsalis. Still, recognizing how popular Davis was in certain circles I was anxious to see this movie. He had a number of medical issues and addictions and he died in 1991 at the age of 65.The movie is not at all what I expected. As they discuss and explain in the DVD extra they never wanted to make a "cradle to grave" documentary of Miles Davis, that would be dull and not at all in line with how Davis created his music. So they made a film that has a sort of haphazard structure, not linear at all, and instead of focusing on his playing the story is a fictional heist caper.The main story is set in the late 1970s when Davis was in a several year hiatus, he said he just wasn't inspired and he never created new music just to satisfy Columbia, the studio that had him under contract. But when a reporter from Rolling Stone looks him up, and discovers a "session tape" Davis made, everyone was anxious to hear his new music. The tape is stolen, there is a chase scene, and that turns out to be the core of the story. Many flashbacks are used and it isn't always clear how they relate to the 1970s present.Miles Davis is played by Don Cheadle who also wrote and directed. He is very good in the role, he makes a very believable Davis. And Ewan McGregor is the reporter, Dave Braden.I enjoyed the movie, it was good to get a glimpse of who Miles Davis the person might have been. Viewers expecting to see a documentary may be disappointed.SPOILERS: When it is all done, the tape is recovered, and we hear some of the music, Braden asks Miles, "All I hear is organ, when do I hear you?" (Meaning the trumpet.) Davis answers "That is me." His new session tape was of him playing organ. In real life Davis actually began playing piano before he took up trumpet, and he spent some time studying at Julliard after high school before striking out on his own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miles away from a Bio-Pic. Don Cheadle's Labor of Love is a Hallucinatory and Jazzy Film Entertainment that is Extraordinary.Instead of Attempting Another Artistic and Flawed Genius Artist Run-Through, Cheadle Avoids the Usual Narrative, Creator Clichés that Inhabit the Personalities of such Artists in the Majority. Some are Seen here, but that's not the Point.First-Time Director Cheadle decides to make an Improvisational Send-Up of a Short, Fallow Period in the Trumpeter's Life and the Chaotic, Bizarre, Forces that Invaded at the Time. Ewan McGregor is OK as a Fictional Writer/Companion.Flashbacks are Used to Show a more Easygoing and Cool Flow through Creative and Prolific Eras. Cheadle is Innovative with His Editing and Shows Signs of Command and Imagination of His Own. The Movie is Best Viewed with Certain Givens. No Superstar of Miles Davis Stature, Longevity, Influence, and Artistry can Ever be Fully Understood or Comprehensive in a Two-Hour Entertainment. That can be done with Multi-Chapter Documentaries running many Hours. This is not that and Never Pretends to be anything more than a Riff on Reality.The Music is here in Snippets and the Feel for the Man's Chops Wash Over and Under the Film. The Result is a Unique take on the Genre, a Hazy Look at the Man, and Punctuated with a Sampling of what made Miles Davis so Revered and Special...His Music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much of Miles Was Left Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Miles Ahead and the acting was superb by Cheadle. However there were key things about Miles that were left out. There was no mention of his marriage to Cicely Tyson. There was no inference to Miles Tutu project which was one of the avante garde "Miles Ahead" projects. I was disturbed that Cheadle had to add a fictional character to get this movie out front and to the public with funding. Miles was a very complex man, and he let his music talk for his journey through life. The overplay on drugs and violence all feeds into a negative stereotype that is seen played out in the media propaganda tool. Almost everyone was aware of Miles drug problem. I was really disappointed and expected more. Cheadle captured the "chemical side" of Miles but never that true duality and desire to create while also disconnecting from the world to create a masterpiece influenced by the actions of the world. The young lady that played his wife Frances Taylor was mesmerizing and helped to make this movie palatable. Miles was Miles, but this was not Miles who regrouped and did great music after a five year hiatus up until his death. I have always loved Don Cheadle's work. I have listened to Miles since a child, and remember how much I loved Sketches of Spain. Also You're Under Arrest. Too much was left out of this complex man's life. Cheadle did a good job of depicting the conflict that is raging within creative geniuses such as Miles Davis. He could have gone a little deeper. Miles was not your typical "jazz" musician. A lot was missed. It would have been a lot better if it would have been from 1980 until 1991 when he died. He created a lot of great music and had many transitions that should have been included. This would have made Miles Ahead a step ahead of this production. I give it three stars due to the fact that I have been a musician all my life and an avid listener of the innovative styles of Miles Davis and have seen all of the contextual contours of the changes in his music as he went through various life changes. I applaud Cheadle for this effort. I look forward to a production that gives a much more thorough examination of Miles Davis. I applaud Cheadle. I know what he was up against to try to make this movie. Maybe Cheadle can reboot and do a much more comprehensive cinematic examination of Miles Davis. This movie only captured the year that Miles came back and the series of flashbacks. Emayatzy Corinealdi was stunning. I liked her energy. Her resemblance to Lela Rochon is uncanny. I see her going to many great places in the near future. Miles Ahead fell a little flat for me. Good effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our local cinema showed a preview of Miles Ahead this afternoon, with Q&amp;A and live jazz at the Vortex afterwards. I only stayed for the movie. Not because I wasn't interested in the rest of the entertainment (because we were) but I wanted to watch the football and I wanted to process some of what I'd seen This is a truly magnificently insular vision of a man who made some of the most beautiful music that I've ever heard. And I think Don Cheadle has pulled off a masterstroke of genius to capture that sense of adventure and inspiration that so clearly drives Miles to make music. Or not.I loved the way that the story unfolded in a Pulp Fiction kind of cut-up, I loved the mixture of past and present day and the way that the story was told in such an intelligent way, I loved the music (of course), and I loved Don Cheadle and didn't even mind Euan McGregor too much. Emayatzy Corinealdi is a strong female lead and shines through as a muse of most harmonious power.It's funny and furious and outrageous and silly and serious and bonkers. Just like the man himself. Long live Miles, he's made my life happier with his music already, this movie explains some of what that might be? Social music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For real...Here we have a very artful, insightful handling of the complex life of the black artist, through the telling of a curious, scandalous period of Miles' life. There's a running line/melody in this flick. Then voices come in and out along the way, riffing on and adding exposition to his story. It even gets slow in a coupla places, but ultimately all comes together, manifesting a jazz principle that Miles himself once articulated: "When you hit a 'wrong' note, it's the *next* note that makes it good or bad"... Well done ? performances, structure, flow. Not to mention that Don's horn 'playing' and fingering are even decent. See this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this movie really missed the mark. It seemed from the credits that there was an opportunity to use archive footage of Miles' life which was only used sparsely.The actors did a great job, but the movie launched right into all of Miles' life challenges, his down fall points and never showed how her started, no context of his life and the many years that led up to his addictions. And, then, only five minutes or so at the end showing his "come back." It left me in disbelief that he died of the conditions cited--curious if he actually died of a drug over dose, or if conditions were related to his life style choices.The man was a genius and I wouldn't want to see a sugar coated version of it, but surely there was something positive to share and an integration of actual footage of his life--would have made it all more believable.I'm really sorry that I went. I almost walked out several times and did not because I didn't want to offend anyone else in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tour de force for Don Cheadle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this movie if you love Miles Davis. See this movie is you're a Don Cheadle fan. See this movie if you want to find out how JIMI: ALL IS BY MY SIDE should have been done. See this movie if you are a jazz fan. See this movie if you a movie fan. Right now, the Oscars are a two man race between Don Cheadle and Michael Keaton (for THE FOUNDER) Don Cheadle wisely used a screenplay and editing structure that was both like jazz and Mile Davis' life. I watched the movie Friday night. NOBODY left when the credits rolled. You'll have to see the film to find out why. Stayed in my seat talking with people about the film. Stayed so long the audience for the next showing came in... and we were still talking. That never happened before. Great movie. I predict Oscar noms for Cheadle,(acting, writing, directing) Emayatzy Corinealdi, editing, film score and possibly best picture nom. Cheadle has got some career decisions to make: To act or to direct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really learn a lot about Miles Davis from this movie, apart from the fact that he was a drug taking musician who was not particularly nice to the people close to him. Don Cheadle plays the part very well, the same cannot be said for Ewan McGregor, who is miscast as the Rolling Stone reported who wants Davis's comeback story. Emayatzy Corinealdi plays Frances, Miles's suffering wife, a talented dancer who is forced to quit her profession by Davis so she can 'be with him'. I was quite enjoying the movie but it all turned a bit slapstick and stupid when the tape went missing. It's not really a biopic and you are not even treated to that much music, so all in all it's just an average watch for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Miles Ahead" is just that when you compare it against most recent biopics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the timing of a motion picture's release is sadly ironic. It was the day after Prince died that the Miles Davis biopic "Miles Ahead" (R, 1:40) expanded to more theaters and arrived in my area. The irony is clear if you know that music experts list Miles Davis as one of the main influences on Prince. Going further, Wikipedia.com says "Prince has been compared with jazz great Miles Davis in regard to the artistic changes throughout his career." That, however, is just one example of Davis' wide-reaching and enduring influence. According to Wikipedia, "The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia" sums up Davis' importance this way: "Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style?in attitude and fashion?as well as music". Just don't call it "jazz" in front of Davis.The movie opens with an interviewer referring to Davis' music as jazz, and Davis takes exception. He calls jazz a made-up word and labels his work "social music", then directs the unseen interviewer to do the same. Davis then criticizes the interviewer's recorded intro to his article as "cheesy", and uses some other words that we won't mention. The interviewer then asks Davis how he would tell his own story. Without saying a word, Davis picks up the trumpet that he had been cradling and begins to play. (Scene.) It's the perfect sequence to represent both the man and this movie, even though it's one of the relatively few times that we see Davis (as portrayed by Don Cheadle) play the music. There are some scenes of Davis/Cheadle playing and there's plenty of Davis' music (and Davis-inspired music) on the soundtrack, but this film is more about the man than his music. After all, Cheadle (who also wrote and directed) set his movie mostly when Davis was on a much-needed 5-year break from performing.Similar to the Brian Wilson biopic "Love &amp; Mercy" in 2015, "Miles Ahead" focuses on two distinct periods in the musician's life, with the latter period representing a more troubled time in his life. The early scenes shows us bits of Davis' story mostly in the late 1950s and 1960s, when he was courting and married to Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi) and making some of his best music (including the 1957 album which lends its name to this film). In the "present day" scenes, it's 1980 and Davis is preparing to emerge from his self-imposed musical exile. This period is depicted through a fictional story in which a "Rolling Stone" interviewer named Dave Brill (Ewan McGregor) manages to spend two days with Davis.The flashback scenes show us Davis' process for making music and chronicle his relationship with Frances (whom the interviewer calls Davis' "muse"), but the real meat on this film's bones is during that couple of days in 1980. We get to know a Miles Davis who swears at everyone, would just as soon punch a reporter than talk to him, was very much into the drug scene (especially cocaine) and would put a bullet in someone's television ? and threaten the same to anyone who crossed him. It's the focus that Cheadle wanted ? Davis' "gangster" side, which clearly influenced (and was influenced by) his music.But the 1980 portion of the film isn't just about public displays of bad behavior. The story underlying all of that is Davis' struggle with whether he should (or would or could) make a comeback ? and his obsession with protecting a two-year-old session tape that he had stashed in his house and which attracts the attention of at least three different interested parties who want to get a hold of that tape nearly as much as Davis wants to hold onto it himself. One of those parties is Columbia Records. Another is Harper Hamilton (Michael Stuhlbarg), a weasley agent who is promoting a talented young trumpet player (Keith Stanfield), along with his own selfish interests, by any and all means he deems necessary."Miles Ahead" is a creative and highly satisfying biopic. Fictionalizing an entire episode in Davis' life, but setting that period against a background of real issues turns out to be a handy and effective technique for getting to know Davis as a person, warts and all. Dual time lines and flashbacks are not new, but the way Cheadle arranges them and how he manages transitions between them is boldly innovative. Directing his first feature, Cheadle also gives it a stronger narrative thread than in most modern biopics.Even more impressive is Cheadle's performance. He first impressed me in 1997's "Boogie Nights", then in films such as the "Ocean's" movies, "Crash", "Hotel Rwanda", "Traitor" and his more recent superhero movies. His work in "Hotel Rwanda" impressed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences enough that they nominated him for a Best Actor Oscar (in addition to Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations)? but he's really outdone himself this time. While pulling triple duty on this film, he loses himself in this role, enabling us to find Miles Davis. The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Stuhlbarg who has been quietly doing outstanding chameleon-like character work over the past decade, including the 2015 films "Pawn Sacrifice", "Steve Jobs" and "Trumbo". This is another actor who deserves some serious recognition. Between its gutsy, creative and effective story-telling and its spectacular performances, this film is miles ahead of most recent big-screen biopics and is award-worthy on many levels, especially when it comes to the performances.

		<shortDescription>Furlongs Ahead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone interested in a film about a real, hugely gifted, but seriously flawed jazz musician and directed by an actor should check out 'Bird', a more or less straightforward account of Charlie Parker directed by Clint Eastwood and one that is light years rather than miles ahead of this ego trip by Don Cheadle. It's difficult to see exactly who Cheadle is targeting here. Most people who like jazz and many with only a nodding acquaintance with the art form identify Davis as 1) a slightly eccentric performer (I saw him in concert once and he played for something like two hours without speaking a word, with his back to the audience the whole time and without acknowledging applause or identifying any of the dozen or so numbers he played) or, 2) an innovator with an 'introspective' trumpet style, widely identified with 'the birth of the cool' largely via an iconic album 'Kinda Blue'. Not much, if indeed any of this comes through in Cheadle's ego trip. Instead he gives us a Davis in a fallow period long after his early success and when he has been away from jazz for several years and is devoting his time to the pursuit and ingestion of cocaine. For good measure Cheadle introduces an entirely fictitious reporter for Rolling Stone who is looking for an 'angle' on Davis. Ewan McGregor is about as convincing as a reporter as Elton John would be as Ghandi and it is by far the worst performance of McGregor's career. Trumpet Blues indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles Ahead and so far behind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended the Cincinnati premier on March 26, 2016. I found the film to be dark and discombobulated. Cheadle's acting was impressive, but trying to follow the story between modern day and the flashbacks was confusing. Not knowing where the time line was going left me confused. Did all the craziness in Davis' life really happen? or was it Hollywood license.The sound of the film made me feel as though it was recorded on "Mute" I couldn't hear much of the whispering voice of the main character. It also didn't bode well that when I saw Don Cheadle and tried to shake his hand, he ignored me as though I was a ghost. Not good when you are promoting a film.</fullReview>
