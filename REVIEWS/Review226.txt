		<shortDescription>Remarkable work of auteur cinema -- realism at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones has a wry, dry character -- rich and deep as unwatered open plains of the Americas. He's transferred his particular personality power to the story of The Homesman. He's successfully created a fine work of "auteur cinema" (much as I personally think this form rarely exists).The Homesman is an emotionally and powerful, idea-rich, almost humorless story -- with an immense amount of humor. It has very tight, economic tale telling with no fat on the bone; in which much is implied, historical accuracy hits its target by nuance, and the story itself is deeply respectful of an intelligent audience.The Homesman is not "entertainment" in the haha, shoot-'em-up Western sense. It's realism committed to a moral cause -- criticism of the disenfranchised, the homeless, the people who cannot make it no matter how hard they try. It has a brilliant sense of time and place that tells the life stories of dozens of hard-enduring, long-suffering "forgotten men" -- the women no less than the men.The key heartbreaker is Hilary Swank's character of Miss Mary Bee Cuddy. She's born into a Western frontier world where she and everyone else believes and practices that "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." Hard workers and decent people. But tragically that is not enough. Why? The Homesman leaves that question deliciously unanswered. Life is not fair. God is not just.Beautifully The Homesman does -- kind of -- answer life's problems with the value of sheer vitality and gutsiness itself. Thus that key visual motif in the movie that comes from: George Caleb Bingham, "The Jolly Flatboatmen". We must dance the dance of life, however mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones stars, writes, directs, produces &amp; astounds in this journey through trust &amp; the Wild West. Splendid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to get something off my chest: I'm not a fan of Tommy Lee Jones. I find him limited in range, much the same in most roles and, worst of all, he inexplicably won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fugitive, thus depriving Pete Postlethwaite for In the Name of the Father, Leonardo Di Caprio for What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Ralph Fiennes for his performance of pure evil as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. In modern parlance, WTF? But periodically, just occasionally, once in a while, he inhabits the screen in a manner that forces one to reconsider one's judgment. And so it is with The Homesman.The Homesman is something of a surprise, and not just because Tommy Lee Jones is on remarkable form in it. Beyond a fine performance, the man writes, directs and co-produces it. Hell's bells, when did he become so damn good at everything? In the bad old days of the pioneers in the Wild West, Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) steps in when three women drift into various states of madness and need to be transported across the country to be cared for properly. Shunned by their husbands, denied help from the town's menfolk and at a time where rape and murder hides behind every outcrop of rock and every gnarled cactus, Cuddy sets off alone on her hazardous journey. She stumbles across George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones), a drifter seated atop his horse, with a noose around his neck, waiting for his steed to grow bored and leave him hanging. Literally. Cuddy offers to save him on the condition that he accompanies her and so begins a particular kind of journey.The Homesman is probably described by many as a western, but that's lazy. This is a road movie on horseback, a saunter across the plains, a journey through mistrust and emotions where a mistake or misplaced trust will result in death. It is a story of hope and love, not the romantic kind, but real love for one's fellow human being, regardless of whether they can, or will, reciprocate.Shot beautifully with sprawling, dusty vistas that warm the heart and prickle the nape, the backdrop is a vast canvas of character and mystery upon which splashes of colour are smeared in the shape of wandering, human dangers.Though they say little, the trio of women (Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto and Sonja Richter) are far more than peripheral characters or the MacGuffin; they are the substance that binds The Homesman and the reason for the drama, gentle though it is. As we saw in Mr. Turner, such characters can so easily become pantomime animals with over performance that slaps the viewer in the face and detracts from the whole, of which they are but a small part. Not so here. Grace Gummer, particularly, as the mostly mute but vacantly animated Arabella is terrific and we want to reach into the screen and gently push her back towards sanity. It is a beautiful, understated performance that remains in mind long after the event.Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank make a surprising double act but the chemistry is there in abundance. Both Cuddy and Briggs carry their own needs and daemons with them; neither would give the other a second glance ordinarily but circumstance prompts odd, emotional couplings and theirs is fraught with suspicion and obligation. It is fantastic to see Swank back to the form that brought her gongs and made us sit up and watch in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby. This is a far less demonstrative performance, but no less steely or impactful because of it.Tommy Lee Jones's performance is the most compelling, engrossing that I can recall. Beyond that, his direction is worth celebrating loudly. The Homesman is only his second feature as director (after 2006's wonderful but little seen The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) but there are hints that he may step into Clint Eastwood's shoes alongside Ben Affleck and Sean Penn. Just when we think we have the measure of this tale, he belts us sharply around the jowls, proving he has the mettle to surprise and shock us out of our complacency.Maybe, after years and years of apparently coasting, broodily on film and staring into space, it will transpire he was merely absorbing, waiting for the moment to own both sides of the screen and captivate us.You know what, maybe he's always been this good but I just didn't see it.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Homesman, written and directed and starring Tommy Lee Jones tells the story of Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) a spinster who takes on the responsibility of bringing three insane women to Iowa where they can be taken care of.She saves or spares the life of George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) and enlists him on her arduous five week journey.When you see Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones, you know the acting is going to be stellar. The parts of the insane women, Arabella Sours (Grace Gummer), Theoline Belknapp (Miranda Otto), Gro Svendsen (Sonja Richter) because of the great directing remained the focus while being secondary characters. The movie had a Shakespearean feel to it and that is a great compliment. These ladies portrayed insanity, believably and that takes serious dedication and acting ability."The Homesman" was a tragedy and because of it, some people might not be able to pallet the story; there were some shocking attention grabbing scenes that the average viewer might not be prepared for. Those scenes, to me, were great examples of a different time, a time when life was hard and people died.The Homesman is a story that sits with you and makes you thankful for many things, even if it just the shoes on your feet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story behind this movie is so engaging that it is a perfect platform for good performances and none of the players disappoints. Hilary Swank has never been better: tough but kind-hearted, determined but vulnerable. Tommy Lee Jones is at his salty, rough-edged, believable best. Since Mr. Jones also directed the film it is not just his rugged pioneer character that creates the authenticity of this portrait the Plains sod-busters in pre-statehood Nebraska. From the opening scene your senses are immersed in the grit, hunger, muscle-ache and the incessant wind of this stark place that always seems to be on the edge of disaster. The casting was impeccable, down to the smallest role and especially for the non-speaking parts (that will make more sense once you've seen the film.) I don't think the movie is without flaws. There is one scene that I felt was unnecessary and presented the male lead (Jones) out of character. If not for that I would have rated this beautiful, riveting movie a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE HOMESMAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Tommy Lee Jones directed, co-wrote and stars in this western/drama film (set in the 1850s midwest) about a 'spinster' and a 'drifter' transporting three women, driven mad by the hardships of the time, across the country. It costars Hilary Swank, Miranda Otto, Grace Gummer and Sonja Richter. It also features cameos by Meryl Streep, John Lithgow, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, William Fichtner and Hailee Steinfeld. The film was written by Jones, Kieran Fitzgerald and Wesley Oliver and it's based on the 1988 novel, of the same name, by Glendon Swarthout. French filmmaker Luc Besson served as a producer of the movie and it also features a breathtaking music score by Marco Beltrami. It's surprisingly dark, and extremely disturbing, but I enjoyed it due to it's strong character development, outstanding performances and odd beauty.Swank plays Mary Bee Cuddy, a strong and independent 31-year-old woman from New York. She desperately wants to find a husband but can't, due to men finding her too plain looking (I don't think Swank looks bad at all in this movie, considering the film's time and setting). When the local reverend (Lithgow) asks for someone to transport three women across the country, to a church in Hebron Iowa, Cuddy volunteers. The women (Otto, Gummer and Richter) are all mentally ill and the church will provide the special help they need. Cuddy comes across a drifter named George Briggs (Jones), who's about to be lynched for 'claim jumping', and asks him for his help (in return for saving his life). The two make the long journey together and form an odd bond.The movie has been called a 'feminist western', by many, and I'd definitely agree it's a strong female character study, about the hardships women faced at the time. Swank is outstanding in the co- lead and Jones is just as classic and tough as ever; he does (unintentionally I think) steal some of the female cast's thunder. Jones also proves he's an equally talented director (once again) and the movie is full of beautiful visuals, as well as haunting imagery. For me the highlight of the film is the beautiful music and the touching relationships formed by the movie's central characters (it also has a shocking and unexpected twist, at the end of the second act). It's a hard film to watch, at times, but definitely worth it; if you're a fan of the genre or even if you're not.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/1_bZp5ejQ4I</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie which in its offbeat dramaturgy depicts the unpredictability, pointlessness and hardships of life. And it does so with an underlying sense of humor which is almost Kafkaesque and absurd. Don't let the settings fool you ?this is not a western flick, it is timeless, and it serves as a tasty, simple snack for the already thinking viewer. All "plotholes" pointed out by other reviewers actually makes sense when thinking about them, and once again kudos to the unpredictable, non-conformant, "non-template-A" storyline and character arcs which should be seen more in film and television.A little too much use of "fade-in fade-out" in the cutting, a little unrealistic portrayal of mental disease, and a little uninspiring photography IMO actually, but otherwise a great flick for the thinking person. With guns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't want it to be over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that three women in the Nebraska Territory all went raving mad at the same time (maybe it was the Danish rye bread), this tale grabs us immediately with its starkness, bitterness and coldness, not to mention lack of compassion. Tommy Lee Jones as a drunken old reject is right on the mark. Hillary Swank is no longer a sexy young gal, rather a bitter lonely hard-working single woman trying to eke out a living in the unforgiving wilderness. Every scene, every moment is captivating. You may not even like what you're seeing, but you can't stop watching. Somehow, even though I thought three mad women at one time seemed contrived, I had to accept that it was just that way. Shortly after getting organized, the film turns into a road picture, but what a road, or lack thereof. Jones, Swank and the three locas have to traverse empty countryside, facing drought, Indians, hunger, privation of every kind, for at least five weeks to get to a place where a kindly preacher's wife (Meryl Streep, as usually so immersed in this small part that you just know she's really a long-suffering preacher's wife) has promised to care for them. Developer James Spader too has only a few brief moments to do his thing, but it's unforgettable. When my granddaughter was small, we used to watch films together. Sometimes when we watched a film she really really liked, (think Zoot Suit), she'd burst out crying at the end. I'd ask, "Why are you crying, Baby Girl?" and she'd say, "Because I didn't want it to be over." I felt this way about The Homesman. I didn't want it to be over. I had lots more questions and things I'd like to see resolved. What happened to the hotel and town development? What happened to the man (William Fichtner, always a pleasure) and his two little girls? What happened to the crazy women and whatever happened to Briggs (Jones)? A sad cold story, but one you just can't walk away from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak But Bountiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>December 19, 2014A homesman is someone tasked to bring people back to their homes. In this film, the people that needed safe transport are three mentally- disturbed women. Mary Bee McCuddy, a plain but hardy spinster, volunteered to be their homesman. Along the way, she rescues a old man Thomas Briggs from being hung by vigilantes and conscripts him to help her with her mission in exchange for saving his life. Together, they gather the three ladies and escort them from Nebraska homes across the dangerous Midwest prairie to a safe haven in Iowa.Hilary Swank is an actress who had already won a couple of Oscars for playing strong women who had taken on masculine roles in life -- Brandon Teena in "Boys Don't Cry" and Maggie Fitzgerald in "Million Dollar Baby". As Mary Bee McCuddy, a pioneer lady who bravely accepts a task only men are expected to do, Swank again goes on the same award-baiting path. The movie worked so well when Swank was on screen. She was absolutely compelling in this offbeat role as if this was written with her in mind. The movie was not the same when her character was not there.Tommy Lee Jones is one actor who, as of late, had seemingly been confined to playing curmudgeonly and cantankerous old men, and his Briggs here is not any different. This film is only Jones' second directorial effort since his critically-acclaimed debut in "Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" back in 2005. As director, he was very generous to his lead female star Swank, and always gave way to let her shine. As actor, he does consistently as he is expected but this role of a grumpy old outlaw seems too familiar for him already. He wisely played Briggs with some self-deprecating humor to break the tendency of the story to become monotonously bleak.There were some remarkable cameos from other award-winning or nominated stars in much smaller roles. John Lithgow is his usual capable self playing the Reverend Dowd who reluctantly sends McCuddy off on her task. Hailee Steinfeld plays 16-year old Tabitha Hutchinson to whom Briggs offers a surprising proposal. James Spader, in his usual over-the-top style, plays condescending hotel owner Aloysius Duffy. And last, but definitely not the least, none other than THE Meryl Streep plays perfectly kind and hospitable Altha Carter, who runs the institution in Iowa the women are headed for. These actors appear on screen for only ten minutes or so, but they leave a lasting impression.The narrative may have been slow and desolate . However, the unusual situations, disturbing imagery, startling story developments and committed performances by the cast all keep our attention riveted. The cinematography with the muted colors worked well with the windswept landscape of its setting, as much a character in itself. The costumes and production design rang true to its mid-19th century time period. The haunting and unsettling musical score create an atmosphere of bitter emptiness. The insufferably miserable topic is clearly not for everyone. But for those who decide to give it a chance, the rewards will be satisfying. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I learned something today. Luc Besson - the Producer - may give us tremendous movies when he dares to, when he is in "the mood" for. This one is the perfect example, at a billion miles away from the usual garbage Junk stuff Besson usually gives us. Crap factory from Europa Corp. This film is a masterpiece, so was another Europacorp film directed by the same Tommy Lee Jones, back in 2005, THREE BURIALS that no one can forget. Such as this one. An unusual and surprising western. Hillary Swank is here at her best ever, probably better than in MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Clint Eastwood could have made this one, and not only as a director...A poignant, gripping story that glues you to your seat from the start to the end. The odyssey, the melancholic journey of a man and a woman, so different from one to the other, who are in charge of three lunatic females. An offbeat and also outstanding tale, adapted from a Glendon Swarthout's novel, the author of THE SHOOTIST, from which Don Siegel made the last John Wayne's film, back in 1976.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dark bleak, grimy Western with soul and strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Homesman, about a 31 year old (un-married/childless) woman (Hilary Swank) who takes up the challenge of bringing three crazed women across the Nebraska plains over five weeks with the help of a deserter-drifter left for dead (Jones), is in some ways meant to be a real Feminist Western (with a capital 'F'), and not in the way that a silly work like The Quick and the Dead was with Sharon Stone. Here, it's much more about depicting a time and place that was quite bleak and desolate and, in some spaces, without much hope. Ultimately Tommy Lee Jones, through the novel it's based on, sees a little more light at the end of the tunnel for his protagonist than, say, Eastwood did in Unforgiven. But it's a combination of things it's about, and emotionally the film does work quite well, in particular in the relationship that unfolds between the two leads.If you're curious to see a western that has the love of the plains of the West visually speaking ala Ford, but has the dark contours of someone like Mann - and added to that those super dirty production designs and character realizations from Spaghetti Westerns - this might be it, at least up to a point. It's so unrelentingly dark in how it looks on at the deteriorating mental states of these women, and the desperation in the journey for Jones and Swanks' characters, that the few moments of humor are rather surprising - and welcome - especially when Jones first appears to Swank on the noose and the horse. It's the kind of scene that shows this actor, well into his 60's and pushing 70, trying something new in a performance (if only for a scene or two).It's got a cast that is practically distracting for the who's who that shows up, mostly for one scene a piece: James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, John Lithgow, William Fichtner, Meryl Streep (!) and Hailee Steinfeld (who appears almost to have wandered from the True Grit set to this one). There's so much going for the Homesman that it's a shame the script is uneven, and there's a plot twist two thirds of the way through that is sort of explained but not at all at the same time, and it leaves the film with a gaping tragedy that can never quite be filled. Interestingly, if you watch the behind the scenes on the blu-ray one of the screenwriters mentions the book left things unexplained as well. That might be fine in the book - or perhaps more was explained in other ways - but it still doesn't work, and what Jones goes for in awe-inspiring shots he leaves behind with some muddled story beats.Nevertheless, The Homesman is a good Western, a solid western digging into the roots of the genre and mixing the unsavory and horrifying (not like a horror movie, just some repellant images at times, but for a point), though whether one will want to return to it like other, better Westerns is another story. It's the kind of picture I can't put down for its artistry, even if things can be looked at more critically, which may explain why it didn't find its way through the End-of-Awards-time (albeit it was accepted at Cannes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the western "The Homesman", but I strongly suspect that it won't be to everyone's taste. And I will admit that even this die hard fan of westerns didn't find it a perfect movie. The opening thirty minutes of the movie, for one thing, are somewhat confusing with some details, though eventually everything comes together and the audience knows what's been going on. And after that first thirty minutes, the movie continues to test the patience of viewers by being quite slow moving and long (the movie is over two hours long.) But I stuck with the movie despite all those things, and I feel I was rewarded in the end. The atmosphere of the movie feels extremely authentic, showing many of the hardships life in the wild west gave many people. Though the story is slow-moving, there are a number of interesting vignettes along the way. And you probably won't predict what eventually happens - the major plot turn around the two-thirds mark really took me by surprise. The last scene is a little unclear as to where one of the characters is headed, but it is memorable all the same. As I said, the movie is not for all tastes, but western fans who are in a patient mood will likely embrace it despite its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Homesman left me with some mixed feelings. I really liked the idea and theme of this movie, but certain aspects of the storytelling are just ridiculous.The story takes place in 1850s Nebraska where a small community of homesteaders decides to send three mad women to a home in Iowa. Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank), a seemingly strong and independent spinster, volunteers for the task of transporting these women. Along the way she meets George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones), a scruffy-looking drifter and claim jumper, whom she rescues from certain death and subsequently recruits to help her complete the journey.Homesman presents the viewer with rather depressing yet captivating tale of pioneering existence and hardships with particular focus on women. It's obviously something that you don't see very often in an average western.The main issue with the film is that it suddenly loses momentum by switching its focus from Mary Bee Cuddy onto George Briggs. It's strange because Briggs is inherently far less interesting character than Cuddy; and by essentially promoting him from support role to the lead role, the film undermines its own feminist vibe. As a result the final 30 or so minutes feel like rather lengthy and pointless epilogue. It should be noted that this happens in the novel as well, so in that regard the film stays true to it. Yet it still doesn't make much sense to me.Another minor issue with the movie can be attributed to the character of Mary Bee. The reason for her personal drama is extremely implausible. The idea that a successful, hard-working woman -- a woman capable of childbearing -- had trouble finding husband due to being "plain" looking, is quite frankly silly. This is almost the exact opposite of what was really going on in that specific period. The fact that many people lost their minds due to harsh conditions is true, but ironically, that is the same reason why someone like Mary Bee could've never been single for long.In short, Homesman is a movie that gets period ambiance right, but produces a rather disjointed story with bizarre twist. It is still something that is worth watching, in my opinion. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank deliver very impressive performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riveting film about a spinster , a drifter and a peculiar promise , being slickly developed by actor-director Tommy Lee Jones . Starring Hilary Swank returns to the heights of a career that saw her win two Best Actress Oscars by the age of 30 . This is her most recent film , The Homesman in which she starred opposite Tommy Lee Jones , John Lithgow , Meryl Streep , James Spader , among others . Here Tommy Lee Jones's acting and direction are magnificent and remaining cast is pretty well , giving terrific performances . This above average film concerns about a pious , independent-minded woman called Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is assigned by the village priest (John Lightow) to carry three women (Miranda Otto , Sonja Richter , and Grace Gummer , Meryl's Streep daughter) who have been driven mad by pioneer life . They have to be transported across the country by a covered wagon . The two-fisted woman obstinately carries out the dangerous assignment and in turn employs low-life drifter George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) to assist her . She forces the drifter for to a journey across the plains to locate the risked destination . Both of whom are determined to find the paths , through the prairies plagued by savage Indians , until the easy civilization . This journey will bring forward the stark contrast between the values of two ways of life and the landscape transversed is both geographical and emotional .This enjoyable film is a touching and violent Western drama with elevated cinematographic values . The movie realizes an awesome actors reunion , showing the different characters and explores their apprehension , ambitions , fears and circumstances . The two protagonists result to be a pair ¨Quixotes¨ who obstinately undertake a trip whose objective looks to fulfill a pledge by whatever means . The main character George Briggs , superbly played by Tommy Lee Jones, seems to be living resolutely in the past and while the brave spinster wishes to marry him and create a family . Support cast is frankly excellent such as Barry Corbin , William Fichtner , Evan Jones , Jesse Plemons , Grace Gummer , Miranda Otto , and Tim Blake Nelson-James Spader, this duo previously appeared in ¨Lincoln¨ along with Tommy Lee and Hailee Steinfeld's second western after her Oscar-nominated , breakout role in ¨True Grit¨ . And , of course , the great Meryl Streep in her third collaboration with Tommy Lee Jones following "A Prairie Home Companion" and "Hope Springs . Intelligent and thoughtful screenplay by Kieran Fitzgerald , Wesley Oliver and the same Tommy Lee Jones , based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout that was published in 1988 ; in fact , Paul Newman owned the rights for a time, and wanted to direct the film himself , after a number of scripts, he gave up . Sensitive and evocative musical score by Marco Beltrani (Red eye , The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) . Special mention for glimmer and fascinating cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto he splendidly reflects the impressive outdoors from the filming locations : Lumpkin , Georgia , San Miguel County , Santa Fe , Oikay Owinger Pueblo , New Mexico . Much of the movie was shot on Tommy Lee Jones's own ranch .The film is a nice co-production , being produced , among others , by the great producer and director , the French Luc Besson . The picture was compellingly directed by Tommy Lee Jones , being his theatrical directing debut ¨The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada¨ that won a deserved prize in Cannes , this film bears a remarkable resemblance to ¨The Homesman¨ , dealing equally with a dangerous journey plenty of contrasts , attacks and many other things . His only other directing credits were the TV movies ¨Good old boys¨ (1995) and ¨The Sunset Limited¨ (2011) with Samuel L Jackson and all of them starred by Tommy Lee Jones . ¨Homesman¨ rating : Better than average , though overlong and slow-moving . Well worth watching , it's a must see for Tommy Lee Jones enthusiasts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. We have come to expect our Westerns to be filled with stoic heroes and nasty villains, but this film delivers a pious, yappy leading lady paired with a selfish, no frills drifter. Based on the 1988 novel from Glendon Swarthout, it's also the second directorial outing from Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, 2005).Hilary Swank play Mary Bee Cuddy, a name repeated so many times that it will surely stick with you ... even if the movie doesn't. Thirty-one years old and unmarried, Ms. Cuddy is not without talent. She works the plough horses, cooks up fried chicken, and plays a mean fake piano. As is pointed out to her a couple of times, she is also "bossy" and "plain" looking ... neither trait especially appealing to men in the wild west.Ms. Cuddy volunteers to take three local women to Iowa. The three women (Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto, Sonja Richter) have each gone insane, and somehow Iowa is the most civilized place within a wagon ride's distance. She teams up with a low-life drifter played by Tommy Lee Jones, after they strike a deal that allows him to escape certain death. The verbal clash of cultures and personality between the two main characters provides most of the action on screen, as the three women being escorted are mostly muted and either locked in the back of the wagon or tied to a wagon wheel during riding breaks.The film is at its best when focusing on the harsh realities of frontier life. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (Brokeback Mountain) does a nice job of capturing the wide expanse and stark vastness of the landscape, while also tossing in some artsy silhouettes and abruptness of this life. Director Jones utilizes some haphazardly timed flashbacks to help us better understand the plight of the three women, but this could have been done much more effectively. Courage, inner-strength, and morality all play a role here and the contrast between frontier and civilization was most distinct.Much of the film plays like an oddball buddy picture - think Nolte and Murphy in 48 Hours, or Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen. If you find the interaction between Swank and Jones to be realistic, then you will probably buy into the whole film. If not, the lack of flow and choppiness of scenes will jump out. There seems to be a never ending stream of little more than cameos from a tremendous line-up of actors: Barry Corbin, William Fichtner, Jesse Plemons, David Dencik, Evan Jones, John Lithgow, Tim Blake Nelson, James Spader, and Hailee Steinfeld. There are even a couple of scenes near the end featuring Meryl Streep (her daughter Grace Gummer plays one of the 3 insane women). The slew of familiar faces actually detracted from the story for me, because the Swank and Jones characters just couldn't hold my attention.The ending seems quite odd and a bit out of place for what we have just watched, and I'm still confused by the line of dialogue addressing the difficult "winter" they must have had on the wagon trip ... it's clearly stated that the trip began in May and would take a few weeks. Even in Nebraska, May and June can't be considered winter. If you enjoy Hilary Swank on a soapbox or Tommy Lee Jones dancing a jig, then perhaps the pieces will fit better for you than they did for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three crazy women for five weeks is a lot more than I bargained for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Homesman is directed by Tommy Lee Jones, who also co-adapts the screenplay from Glendon Swarthout's novel with Kieran Fitzgerald and Wesley A. Oliver. It stars Jones, Hilary Swank, Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto and Sonja Richter. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.Three women who have been driven mad by pioneer life are to be transported East across the country to Iowa. When the men of the town refuse to stand up and be counted, single, pious and independent-minded Mary Bee Cuddy (Swank), enrols for the task. Recruiting scallywag drifter George Briggs (Jones) to aid the journey, it becomes an arduous journey that will make or break both of them. The Homesman is a tricky Western, revisionist of heart and blood, and grim in nature, it's got a narrative that has (and will continue to do so) invited criticism from different quarters. It has been called misogynistic on one side of the fence, and feminist on the other! While there is a humongous narrative jump that has been lauded as great from some, and a film killer by others. The truth is that only each viewer can judge from their own personal perspectives. Personally I think that Jones has blended both the former angles to perfection, whilst the latter issue is to me an outstanding and brave piece of film.The life of the pioneer women is shatteringly brought into sharp focus, right from the off there's brutality blended with utter sadness as Jones the director cuts no corners in setting up the film. Big question then hits us in the face - just how did the Old West deal with those suffering mental disturbance? In this instance it's to pack them off to the East where they will be tended by a minister and his wife (the latter of which played by Meryl Streep in little more than a cameo). The three women are vividly portrayed by Otto, Gummer and Richter, but this aspect of the film is only a side-bar to the crux of the story.This is of course about Mary Cuddy and George Briggs, a man and woman at total different ends of the spectrum. She's sad at being alone without a man, he's more than happy to be without a woman. Everything suggests that this is going to be "one of those films" where opposites find a soul mate, but Jones and his backers may not be reverting to type? I mean for a start how interesting to find this journey going from West to East, that says much about the film right there, a pioneer journey in reverse. While the prominent ladies here may be mad, abused or needy, you will be searching far and wide for a decent man in this here tale.The landscapes are deftly photographed by Prieto, eye opening but never to the detriment of the narrative thrust of pioneer hardship. Betrami lays ethereal piano and string arrangements all over the piece, while joining Streep in short bursts of cameo characterisations are James Spader, John Lithgow, William Fitchner, Hailee Steinfeld and Tim Blake Nelson, that's quite an armoury of performers. Even if you can't help but want more from them all.But it's Swank and Jones, a superb pairing, who give the grade "A" performances. Jones lifts his old cantankerous ruffian character to greater heights, making Briggs the anti-hero to the anti-hero. While Swank hasn't been this great for a long time, making Mary Cuddy strong and inspiring, yet also evidently suffering inner turmoil. Swank's turn epitomises The Homesman, shrewd and insightful, humane and heartfelt. Top stuff all round, it's great to see modern directors confident enough to make biting moody Westerns. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It will crush you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his portrayal of Glendon Swarthout's novel, Tommy Lee Jones presents us one of the most impressive pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Story, screen writing, acting and photography are top notch. But there is no way to enjoy it. You can only be crushed and survive. The Homesman tells us story about a low life caught between two worlds, both he can't relate to. Circumstances take him on a journey that will test him to his limits. It's a story about human spirit, moments of glory and the point of break. A story of human civilization, religion, morality, life and death. Yes, it is that deep. It is purely philosophical drama, please don't expect to get any western action. Movie is slow, hard and painful as all biggest lessons of life are. PS I assume low film rating is a result of pepsi generation voting. PPS And thanks to everyone who made this film despite it being obvious commercial suicide and cinematic challenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is as close as you can to history without being there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother was born in a sod house on the prairie of North Dakota and my grandmother was the town mid-wife and abortionist. Homesteading was hard and demanding and Tommy Lee Jones has captured the the gut-level struggle that came with 160 acres and the nearest neighbor five or ten miles away. It drove those without an iron will to insanity. If you are looking for a shoot-um-up western, this is NOT it, but if you love the history of the frontier, and want to get a feel for its tragedy and day to day fight for survival, this is a great movie. Beautifully filmed, expertly acted, wonderfully scripted, I could not have asked for more. I have never liked Hillary Swank, but this was an incredible performance. Tommy Lee Jones was his beautifully curmudgeoned self. I especially liked the accurate use of period firearms and I will not quibble over the availability of 1851 36 caliber paper cartridges in end of the earth Nebraska Territory nor Ms Swank having a wardrobe of new dresses through out the film. The film accurately captured the ethos of the western prairie and gave me a look and a feel into my own grandparents. Thank you Tommy Lee Jones for a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swank &amp; Jones Are Terrific But Be Prepared For Some Incredibly Bleak Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones give terrific performances here, but be prepared to witness some incredibly bleak scenes. Do we really need to see in graphic detail a mother throwing her baby down an outhouse hole (a scene I'm still thinking about a day after viewing), a man forcing himself upon his wife in bed while her mother lies next to them in revulsion, or one scene, about 2/3rds of the through the film, which is just horribly shocking and disturbing.Swank portrays Mary Bee Cuddy, a highly independent unmarried religious woman, who's toiling hard on a farm by herself in the small town of Loup, in the Nebraska Territory in the mid 1800's. She has volunteered to become a homesman, who will transport 3 women back East who have gone "mad" from the extremely harsh and horrible conditions on the plains.Mary Bee comes upon the scoundrel George Briggs (Jones), whom she finds with a rope around his neck, tied to a tree, and upon his horse. She sees an opportunity here, and makes a bargain with him to save his life in return for his assistance in the arduous 5 week journey to Iowa that she's facing. Of course, once underway, they'll face all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, and, as mentioned, it can all get very grim at times.In small roles, other screen notables that will pop up along the way include Meryl Streep, John Lithgow, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, Hailee Steinfeld, and William Fichtner.The movie was also directed by Tommy Lee Jones who co-wrote the script with Kieran Fitzgerald and Wesley A. Oliver, based on the novel of the same name by Glendon Swarthout.All in all, I felt the heart of this film is in the portrayals of Swank and Jones, and the way they play off of each other on screen. However, you'll need a very strong constitution to stomach the intensely graphic and bleak scenes that appear on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave your vanity at home for this western journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy a good western but it would not be fair to this Tommy Lee Jones production to classify it as such without emphasizing the film is more than just a wagon trail journey of two unlikely characters across the rough and unforgiving western terrain. No, it is the story of two unlikely characters, a single and strong willed farmer named Mary Bee Cuddy played by Hilary Swank and a thieving drifter named George Briggs played by Tommy Lee Jones who agree to transport three women by wagon with real psychiatric (madness) problems from Nebraska to Idaho.There have been hundreds of relatively good westerns produced in the past half century where the hero and heroine remain strong and stoic whilst riding through the barren lands their suits and dresses remain pressed and in pristine condition while their hair is coiffed perfectly, and miraculously the heroine's makeup never dries, cracks or runs. Well such is not the case in the Homesman.Hilary Swank has never been afraid to shed the glamor of Hollywood and for her role as the stubborn, single, and capable farmer Mary Bee Cuddy the potential suitors that she asks to marry her turn her down and explain that she is far too plain looking, sexless, and too controlling in nature. So Mary Bee Cuddy agrees to make the arduous journey across the western plains maybe in the hope of finding a suitor in Idaho as she has run out of potential suitors in Nebraska and seems to be losing hope in raising a family on her own farm in Nebraska.As Mary Bee Cuddy commences her journey she comes across someone even more homely and desperate than herself in the name of aging drifter George Briggs who is within minutes of losing his life at the end of a rope for illegally claiming mining rights to another persons staked property. The terms set forth by Mary Bee Cuddy before she will agree to free George Briggs from his futile situation and imminent death by hanging are simple. He must first agree to travel across the western plains of Nebraska to assist Mary Bee Cuddy in the transportation of three insane women to a church in Idaho where they will receive the care and attention they will require to survive.And so the two hardened caretakers and their three insane passengers set out on their journey which I found to be not like any other western I had previously seen. This is not a humorous and light hearted western but a tough, grueling, and sad journey with what I was surprised provided unexpected results. Some people may not be happy with the last 30 minutes of this feature film, but this is actually where writer/actor/director Tommy Lee Jones hooked me with what I felt was a good feature film that ended strongly.There are numerous cameos throughout the film including standout performances by Tim Blake Nelson as a lonesome cowboy, John Lithgow as Reverend Dowd, and Jesse Plemons as a derelict husband to one of the insane women. Look for mother Meryl Streep in Idaho as the Reverends wife Altha Carter who enjoys sharing the screen with her real life daughter Grace Gummer who plays one of the three insane women Arabella Sours.I give the film a good 7 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Writing this review because I read another that was so outrageously vapid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a review that said one of the main characters kills herself because either A: she had sex and didn't enjoy it . Or B: she had sex and enjoyed it so much she couldn't handle it. I stopped reading mid way through that sentence. Can people really be that blind and stupid? She killed herself because she had humiliated herself to a point she couldn't return from.. She killed herself because of her desperation , she let someone really, really see that. She killed herself because her belief systems , based on the bible , were so polarized from some need in her, the two couldn't fit together.. She killed herself because she found out in a really hard way, that being a good person, ( stopping to re bury the dead ) having the heart that she did , it meant nothing in this world. And that's all she had was heart. No one cares about that. They all just want what they want. They want things that don't matter. They want to feed themselves. The grave scene , was the crucible here. I loved it when the horse went right back to the grave. " see what you did?" " was it worth it" and that is the question this film asks. Is having heart worth anything? Can you function here, in this world with one? The deal is you can't. Unless you are very rich. Unfortunately most rich people get rich by not having a heart, as so aptly demonstrated in this film also. At some point in your life , if you've got that heart, you're either going to have to really get comfortable with humility, because pride will kill you. Every hero ends up a Villain here if they don't die young. Or you are going to have to get tough. Or you simply won't last, or you will lose your mind. It's not really a good thing if you have assimilated successfully to this society. That means, your ambitious, greedy, selfish and a liar. But you also, probably don't even know that. I hated the scenes of lunacy. I had to fast forward through them. I saw a naked baby coming out in the snow- goodbye. Fast forward is my friend. I have my own little babies sleeping next to me. There was no way I was going to watch babies or children get hurt. But the reason why these scenes are in the movie, is because it's making you make that choice. It's saying , get tough . Of course, the polar opposite of that's spectrum is the insane women. They went insane because they had heart and they were stuck. They couldn't leave. They obviously weren't as brave as Miss Cuddy. She did what a lot of people do that have too much pride , too much heart and courage. She killed herself. Overall, I didn't enjoy this movie. It was very hard to watch, and that's not why I watch movies. I can watch hard movies, but what can I say, I like for there to be some soft spots.. Some place where I get to keep my hope. There is no space for hope in this movie. My favorite scene was him burning down the house. Because , that's why he is the only one who lives in this movie and isn't crazy. He has zero pride. He let's out his demons. Which , like I said. Every hero is a villain. Just gotta live long enough. If you haven't been a villain yet, you were never a hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Dark" Came Out of the Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pity you dull giants of royalty. You're really spoiling your authoritarianism. The Homesman is a beautiful movie. Tommy Lee Jones is what everybody expects him to be (especially when it's a western). He can be better but not less, no, not a chance. Hilary Swank? I've always loved her acting; I mean who doesn't, especially after watching Million Dollar Baby? With that said, I have this uneasiness and queasiness inside me due to her weirdly mature look, wide platypus-lips, and so I never really like her (but that's my personal flaw).The script had that captivating flavor, it was so smooth and touchy, and through a story of despair and misery, it swelled my heart with cognitive vulnerability. I was so "down" after watching it. This feeling might have happened to me after a long time. The two names, out of many others, , that did this to me were The English Patient and Requiem for a Dream.The score is brilliant; it particularly suits perfectly when Cuddy's estranged. The main track inflicts western-horror that is unprecedented.The makers of this movie worked off on a tough terrain, not just the literal one, to produce such an exquisite work of art; they had no idea big-bump-freaks dwelling at the hierarchical apex would rather die than being rational.Bottom-line: Cuddy and Briggs have seamlessly made it through (at least on my watch).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a dark and bleak movie, but I also generally like a little bit of sunlight, a speck of redemption. Alas, there is almost nothing here. The cast list is the most impressive part of this film.Women driven mad, the hardship of frontier life, Hillary Swank saves crusty old Tommy Lee Jones. The best part is the James Spader character and portion of the film. (Which I will not give away, but it is the best part of the film.)This film is just one sadness piled up on top of another. I know there is a tiny bit of redemption in that Tommy Lee doesn't give up but I still found this film heartbreaking in it's unrelenting tragedy and lack of comic relief. Hillary Swank is Amazing and also so sad, a spinster at age 30 trying to marry herself off to any man who would have her.The three crazy women -- not believable enough. Mostly quiet and passive.Here is the one thing I am grateful for with The Homesman -- there are no dogs that die in this movie! Yay! Other than that, I was disappointed after a long, dark film that kind of went nowhere. A complete waste of Meryl Streep's time and talent as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, Strange Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three married women will be transported to a hospital in Iowa for treatment for their loss of mental capacity. Their husbands agree with this as they are helpless to help their wives as Pioneer life has taken its toll on them and they can no longer cope in this stark, and desolate country consisting of mostly barren plains. Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) a very independent woman agrees to transport the women to that hospital. Along the way Mary Bee hires George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) as a Homesman to help her in the journey. In all the Westerns I have watched, I have never heard the term Homesman and even after watching this movie am still not sure what a Homesman is or does, but I suppose he is a Caretaker of sorts and will leave it at that. Also I never heard the name of the state of Iowa in any Western. Usually Westerns go West not East.The wagon the women are in could be used to haul prisoners as it is made with heavy wood and set up with bars on the windows and can be locked. The women inside could be considered dangerous to others and not just to themselves. You will see some madness you normally wouldn't see in any Western. Remember, the women have lost their minds and have no idea what they are doing when they do crazy things. They need to be watched. James Spader makes a memorable appearance as Mr. Duffy, an entrepreneur, looking for investors. John Lithgow as Rev Dowd helps start Mary Bee on her journey. William Fichtner and Jesse Plemmons husbands of two of the wives make brief appearances. When Meryl Streep - as great as she is - and as Mrs. Carter, who receives the women in Iowa, talks to Mr. Briggs, I got the impression with her halting dialogue that she was really telling us, "what am I doing here?" Okay, maybe that's just me.The chemistry between Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones was good, but could have had more grit. And one big downside: Mr. Briggs' singing and dancing scenes were totally out of character and were annoying. Over all this is a good, but strange Western most of us have never seen the likes of. It has it's moments because we never know what will happen next. Yes, I am setting you up. There is a twist you won't see coming and it shocked me too. What struck me from beginning to end was the photography. I am not sure what kind of film was used, but it was sensational with crisp, clear and I mean ultra-clear images of everything throughout. We didn't see any dust anywhere. It was like the West was a Clean Room with Pastel skies. Simply awesome. The cinematography was unbelievably good. I was totally impressed. (obviously) (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, 3-times, nothing erotic. Nudity: Yes, but nothing erotic. Language: No. Rating: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Movie - good acting but story is a complete bummer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the cast, the music and the cinematography. I could have liked the story but I felt that the writer opted for shock-drama rather than continued character development . We all understand that life is not always wonderful, people are not always good and bad things do happen. I am aware of that every morning when I watch the news. I don't want a movie to be more depressing than the news and this movie was.A simple story ? three mentally unstable women need to be transported to a place of care. It's a long trip ? several weeks by horseback. The compassionate and caring Mary Bee Cuddy takes on this responsibility even though she knows it's a dangerous undertaking. We really don't know much about Mary Bee. We learn that she is on her own. She has a farm, some money but she is alone and she is concerned about getting "too old" to start a family. She is looking for a husband and she is not very choosy ? pickings are slim in the wild west. Apparently even the burnt out losers think she is "plain" to the point of being unworthy of wedlock. Swank is an unusual looking woman but she is attractive and although the makeup department does their best to "drab her up", she still looks fine ? so when the unshaven, dirty and relatively stupid men turn her down, it doesn't ring true.So, back to the long trek east - Mary Bee enlists the help of George Briggs (Tommy Lee) as a result of a promise he makes after she saves him from a hanging. Briggs is not a particularly likable character and he is motivated by the promise of a cash payment at the end of the journey. The dialog reveals a bit about his past ? a stint with the dragoons, he's a deserter and a loner. He looks like a completely fried old man that hasn't had a woman or a bath in twenty years. And yet, with that in mind, he still seems to feel he is too good for Mary Bee.So the five embark on their journey. There are a few situations that arise that are dangerous (a potential Indian attack, a lunatic steals one of the women, food shortages) but nothing really unusual happens. It's all mildly interesting but I kept waiting for the "big problem" .Up to this point (maybe the two thirds through the movie) I enjoyed the movie. And then, the big surprise. The shocker. The reason I was turned off.The rest of the movie is an attempt and showing how Briggs has started to "come around" and find some compassion of his own. Too little, too late. The ending scene is a total bring-down.Didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know that Tommy Lee Jones directed this film, but directing was one of the things I liked the most about it. In the whole movie there's always a dark/sad scene followed by a light/happy one, and it goes on and on like this until the end. And that's what made this movie bearable to watch. I'm a mother and the scenes with the dead babies, or the mother who throws her baby to the toilet was just too much for me... But the little happy moments following made me keep watching this. I think that this is actually a good directing technique and fitting to movies that want to talk about reality/real life etc.Also the movie achieved to get me to that western atmosphere very well. It made me feel the sun, the cold wind, the silence and loneliness of the scenery, the attitude and way of living of the people of that time.I also liked the ending in which I think that Tommy Lee Jones wants to say that incidents in life may change us temporally but in the end we never change and we're always the same.Very good movie in general, quite cruel but realistic and honest.</fullReview>

She KILLS herself for no dam' reason whatsoever except that she was 31, unmarried, and a couple men had said she was too 'plain looking' to marry. However, she had been working her own farm for years, had money in the bank, had a solid, God-fearing spirit and no way in HECK would she have hung herself. The crazy women she is ferrying back east may or may not have existed, but what the story does not tell is the prairie lands of the western North America were settled not so much by MEN as by WOMEN. It was mainly MEN who got murdered by Indians, rustlers, ne-er-do-wells, it was MEN who died by mishap while slaughtering buffalo, hunting bears, etc. and then who was left to save the family homestead?? WOMEN and their children. Women who plowed the fields, chopped down the trees for firewood and log cabins, women who gave birth to children in the fields and cabins, WOMEN who taught their children about God and LIFE and the UNIMPORTANCE of sexual 'love' in the grand scheme of life. WOMEN. Not men. WOMEN. Mary B. Cutty would NOT have hung herself. She was the definitive Prairie Woman. FOR SHAME, Hollywood, PERPETUATING THE LIE THAT WOMEN ARE THE WEAKER SEX.

The movie is a joke, although the subject is worthy of serious consideration. I haven't read the story this movie is based on but I'm familiar with the literature and history and Tommy Lee Jones does a poor job bringing it to film. He gives up on Hilary Swank's character giving her a completely unexpected and out-of-character ending when there were still other options. Apparently, a successful woman farmer who has endured the hard life on the plains in the 1800s cannot survive the disappointment of a night in the sack with Tommy Lee Jones. The depiction of the three women driven mad by their experiences on the plains in Nebraska was shallow and cheap; showing a woman repeatedly stabbing herself with a sewing needle does not tell the story of that woman's pain. You need a good filmmaker for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Driven Insane by the American Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not at all surprised that "The Homesman" slipped through the cracks, as it defies categorization and may just be one of the least commercially bankable films I've ever seen. But it's a surprisingly good little movie and one that deserves an audience.Tommy Lee Jones directed and stars in this film about a drunken roustabout (Jones) who teams up with a prim spinster (Hilary Swank) to transport back to their families three insane women who've been undone by brutal life on the American prairie. It's a film about the weakness of men to do what is right, and the fortitude of a woman whose faith and sense of goodness gives her the strength to do what others can't or won't....Until it's not, and it instead becomes about the difference between those who want to do the right thing but can't get it done and those who do the right things for the wrong reasons but are actually successful at it. It's about the practicality of goodness, and about how sometimes the world exposes things that are generally considered to be valuable human traits -- empathy, devotion, religious conviction -- as weaknesses when they interfere with the ability to actually do the right thing rather than simply talk about it.Swank and Jones are sensational, as are the production values that bring alive the American nowhere of the mid-1800s. The film is completely unpredictable in the best way. I had no idea where it was going from one moment to the next and enjoyed every minute of not knowing.I found this one streaming on Netflix and it's well worth checking out.Grade: A</fullReview>

Oliver) lead actor/director Tommy Lee Jones latest Western,which led to me getting ready to meet the Homesman.The plot-The Mid 1800's in the Mid-West:After suffering a long winter, Arabella Sours, Theoline Belknapp and Gro Svendsen each start showing signs of suffering from mental breakdowns.Meeting in the local church,the handful of locals decide that the women should be taken eastward to a church which cares for the mentally ill.Due to the church being 5-6 weeks of travelling away,all of the men find excuses to not be given the task of delivering the women to the church.Standing out from the crowd,Mary Bee Cuddy tells the men that she will take the lead in taking the women to their new home.Stealing a cowboys land, George Briggs is left to hang.Looking for a helper,Cuddy finds Briggs and cuts him down to safety.Desperate for help,Cuddy asks Briggs if he can join her on the journey,but he stubbornly refuses.Suspecting that he has a weakness for cash,Cuddy offers Briggs $300 in return for getting them to the location safely.Accepting the deal,Cuddy and Briggs soon find themselves on a journey to the harshest parts of the Wild West.View on the film:Opening the film by restraining Marco Beltrami's spidery score to show child killing in a chilling matter of fact manner,director Tommy Lee Jones &amp; cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto crack the vast landscapes with frosty yellows and blues,which stylishly clouds the film,as insanity freezes over the village.Rolling out endless miles of beautifully rugged land with nothing else in sight,Jones and Prieto puncture the wilderness with outbreaks of violence and gallows humour,which cast an engulfing shadow over Cuddy and Briggs road journey.For their lush adaptation of Glendon Swarthout's novel,the screenplay by Fitzgerald/Oliver &amp; Jones masterfully cross the wild Western with the eerie atmosphere of a road movie and the delicacy of the "Women's Picture." Sending Cuddy and Briggs out on their own with the 3 women in a carriage,the writers give Cuddy a head- strong appearance which has doubts and brittle desperation bubbling underneath ,whilst Briggs is a rebellious cowboy not willing to take any responsibility.Reaching the half-way point of their travels,the writer's strike Briggs and Cuddy's relationship with an excellent,harrowing twist,which gets Briggs to accept responsibility for the first time,and leads to a dark,richly melancholy full circle. Directing all the pretty horses of the Western for the third time,Tommy Lee Jones gives a splendid performance as Briggs,with Jones grinding a world-weary atmosphere within Briggs,which fans the flames of his rebellious outlaw streak.Holding her head high among all the male cowboys, Hilary Swank gives an exquisite performance as Cuddy,thanks to Swank perfectly balancing a strong,independent mind set with a fragile loneliness of the Western,as the Homesman heads home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, relentless, ruthless and beautiful anti-western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones did it again. He showed us that he is a great director, actor and filmmaker in general. I would call the Homesman an anti-western. It is not your typical gunslinger action western, it has a lot more to say about the human condition. The world these characters live in is brutal. There is not much hope in it but sometimes hope always shines somehow through. Overall this movie shows the worst of mankind but also the best. It will punch you in the guts with some disturbing and unusual scenes that will make you feel uncomfortable. Its one of those movies that challenges you and will reward you with the journey and experience. There is a lot of room for interpretation. Its without a doubt beautifully shot and well acted, the music is haunting too. I would recommend the Homesman but you have to be in the right mood to watch it, its not a feel-good movie even though it accomplishes to put some comedic elements in this otherwise ruthless and relentless world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only have I been a fan of Tommy Lee Jones since he stuck his head out in "Love Story" and then secured me in "Rolling Thunder", I'm also from San Antonio and appreciate 'real' Texas people in the entertainment industry.A film like this will never be big at the box office these days - but if you're a serious movie lover that respects and enjoys an intelligent, non-CG, all-around-amazingly-well-done story, then THE HOMESMAN is a must-see. It also has Hilary Swank, Grace Gummer and Meryl Streep (a little) which obviously keeps things at a high-quality level.I actually just want to thank the entire and great cast &amp; crew, and especially Tommy Lee Jones for making this picture. Nice work folks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Inconsistencies in the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had so much potential, but I believe they tried too hard to make the film morose and tragic. Hilary Swank's character is supposed to be "plain"? Please! Look at the photo on the movie cover, that's plain? Trying to make Swank plain is a comical as the 100 movies where the boy cannot tell how beautiful his best-friend living next door is until the end when he see's her all dressed-up. Men are NOT fools like all these guys are in the film. I mean which woman were they looking at? If the woman being plain is critical to the role, as it appeared to be, then this character was extremely mis-cast, end of story.Then all of the overly-tragic scenes are clearly added to provide marks to make the movie appear "more real", but what it does is make the movie incredibly inhuman and not believable. Every character in the film seemed to be sub-human without a bit of decency, with the exception of course of Swank, whom was plain and undesirable (see above). The movie does have excellent cinematography, and I believe the story moves like a movie about the West should move, however the film lacks a single character that is either believable, likable or understandable. So much promise, so little rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones Wrote the screen play and directed it. He also acts in it ala Climt Eastwood. He gets some good shots and produces some touching moments. I was surprised at times when I thought it predictable. I also found at some points I laughed out loud when I could not determine what the joke was. Little character development around the crazy ladies made me wonder how they all went crazy at the same time. Also why does Hillary Swank take this on and throw money at it as well? Nonetheless Hillary Swank does her finest work here by at times ... Saying nothing. In it's awesome portrayal of the deafening silence of the plains this movie fits the niche of a western turned reality flick. While it drags at times I recommend it for free when you can find it,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director/Star/Screenwriter Tommy Lee Jones Takes a Major Chance with this Unusual Western Tale About Desperation and Insanity on the Harsh Nebraskan Plains in Americas Formative Years. It Seems, by the Movie's Bomb at the Box Office it was a Chance Not Worth Taking.Too Bad. It is One of Those Gritty, Artistic, Brutally Honest Renditions of a Reality that is Conveniently Forgotten Most of the Time in the Western Genre, and Perhaps for Good Reason. it is Relentlessly Depressing Watching these Fortuitous Folks Fighting the Forces of Nature and Humanity's Horrific Unbridled Behavior.Hilary Swank is Superb as the Strongest (Or is She?) Person in this Depressing Display of Oddball Odorous Types. Jones and the Rest of the Cast Also do Strong Work and the Framing is Fantastic. The Story of Transporting Three Insane Women Across the Vast Vistas of a Cold and Unforgiving Landscape is Rough Going, for the Participants and the Audience.If Your Constitution will Allow Such Nastiness to Invade the Sensibilities of Entertainment, there Can Be Found Something of Value in this Decidedly Downbeat Adventure. But Deep Empathetic Viewers May Want to Pass, Although Those with the Guts to Carry On can Find a Goodly Amount of Artistry in this Offbeat and Very Unconventional Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperation, Depression and The Human Condition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me how pathetic and stupid the human male animal can be and still is. And worse, it once again begged of me the question, "has anything changed, really?" The cynical part of me says no. Men's hatred and oppression of women is just more hidden now, more institutionalized and more passive aggressive. We still treat women like trash and refuse to learn from the mistakes we've made. Raping, Killing, subjugating, dehumanizing. It's just another day in the sick failed experiment of the human race, and this movie drives it home with impetuous abandon, in the most intense way possible. Tommy Lee Jones is our anti-hero, and he isn't even instilled with the masculine hopefulness and common decency of the Sergio Leon era Clint Eastwood character, who at least had some semblance of values. At first glance he is a chaotic and psychopathic man, conditioned by the violence and survival ethic of the time period. And then, there is hope that some form of internalized morality is with him, despite his abandoning his family, despite his selfishness, his self centeredness and cowardice. Was something inside of him ignited, especially after the extremity Swank's character's existential choice? Does he authentically care for the women, or does he just wants to have the best of both worlds, to see it through due to his own egocentricity and collect the money in the end? Then he encounters a worse evil--the utter lack of compassion and empathy--and so decides to destroy these men for their cruel transgressions. But then, in the end, alcohol, gambling, class rejection and manic compensation take him over, and he becomes a failed human being--a failed man--once again. The movie tries hard and succeeds in building Swank's desperate character, her loneliness, her isolation and circumstances as a woman trying to psychologically survive in the pioneering days of rural America. But be forewarned, if you think humans are unworthy (and are susceptible to depression because of this", skip this movie. By the way, Swank once again gives an Oscar worthy performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admiration for This Movie, Plus Questions About Plot Asked and Answered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many Potential Spoilers! First, this movie was very good for its torrents of highly exciting stories, for keeping a consistent, distant perspective on events, and for the dramatic performances of the lead performers.Second, here I just address some technical questions about plot, questions that do not much affect the value of the stories. Somewhat difficult to understand and challenging to credulity were the following: A. Cuddy's suicide following the first night of sexual relations in her life implies either that the sex was very rough being the first time and coming from a crude man or, the opposite, that it was overwhelming and the woman was filled with regrets for not having had sexual relations all along or, most likely,that she could not handle pleasure without even an iota of emotional affection from the man.B. The assumption of the highly experienced George Briggs that money from a small bank on the frontier would have to be sound implies either that he had to believe the reward the good Mary Bee Cuddy offered him was destined to be genuine or we're just supposed to believe that in all his years on 19th century western frontiers, George Briggs rarely encountered banks going bust.C. Brigg's failure at the end to consider going back to the minister's wife, explaining that his money proved irredeemable, and asking for some value for his horses and wagons implies that either he feared that news about his past could soon catch up with him if he remained too long in town or that he felt somehow responsible for Cuddy's suicide and really sought redemption by gifting those possessions to the church.Third, I address other customer reviewer's questions: A. Someone wonders why the hotel keeper refused to allow Briggs and his women to stay at the hotel. The reasons were matters of common sense. Briggs appeared to be a man traveling alone with women on the frontier and failing to offer any description of his relations to them. Was he a Mormon and the women his wives? Was he kidnapping them? Were they his prostitutes? In all of these possible scenarios, the hotel keeper had good reason to believe that his property would not be very safe and secure if he allowed them to remain overnight. However, he demonstrated an inability to accept the possibility that the visitor was not good at explaining himself and an inability to forge any sort of compromise?for instance, at least sell some food. Any relations with a weird human were seen by the hotel keeper as a threat somehow. He just wanted the man to get going. This is not unusual for hotel keepers in our day either?very conventionalized sort.B. Also asked was why women in the town went insane and, too, why the men did not. But the old west was a few years before women achieved social equality and were able to secure work in various professional fields. Typically, they were kept to home and hearth and kept emotionally weak and dependent. The movie then shows that the town recently experienced weather conditions that created crop failures. One of the women expressly expounds upon the theme. The bleak surroundings, the social isolation of life on the prairie, and then, on top of that, the inability to get food for themselves and their young children became too much hardship for them to endure. But, anyway, I would not say that the husbands appeared to be models of rationality either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some plot spoilers below, be warned!)I have to rate this one star, because I felt totally exploited having sat through this. It presents itself (falsely) as the story of a charming, tough and pragmatic woman (a spinster, in that era) who has her own farm and is very independent and competent. She volunteers to take 3 insane women back from the Nebraska wilderness to "civilization" in Iowa, and along the way, picks up a drifter who is about to be hung. She saves him, and after a variety of typical "journey through the old west stuff" (Indians, rustlers, etc.), she abruptly kills herself. He tries to abandon the crazy women, but then has a change of heart and delivers them to Iowa.Hilary Swank is very fine in her role as Mary Bee Cuddy, but god what a waste of her talent. She is presented as a strong character, and then kills herself because she is rejected (for the 2nd time in the film) by a man she throws herself at (the drifter, played gruffly by Tommy Lee Jones). This is incongruous and inconsistent with everything we've been shown up to this point. It would have made more sense if aliens had landed in a space ship.There is no way a tough pioneer woman like Mary Bee would have killed herself over a romantic rejection. It makes no sense. It is also beyond ridiculous that anyone would consider her "ugly" back then -- check out some photographs from the 1850s. The most gorgeous celebrities of the day were not what we modern folks would have considered "hot" -- no makeup, greasy hair, etc. Mary Bee would have been a STONE FOX in 1850. Even if she'd been crippled, lame, pockmarked and blind in one eye -- her money and land would have attracted SOMEONE. There was a shortage of women in the Old West. This is a FACT. Men could not be choosy the way they are today, in a large modern city.On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones is a grizzled man in his late 60s. He really was repulsed by the attention from a 31 year old woman? even if she was fat and covered in pimples, he would have probably been so grateful to have sex, he would have fallen on his knees in gratitude. There is something mentally wrong not with the 3 insane ladies here (whose back stories are very choppy and vague -- and it is not plausible that 3 of 6 women in the same town would have the same mental breakdown at the same time), but with the AUTHOR and SCREENWRITER for putting this hateful rubbish on the screen. It has to be the most anti-feminist, female-hating movie I have seen in my life, positing that a woman who is "plain" (which Swank very obviously is NOT, making it idiotic) has to kill herself, because not having sex or failing to marry is such an absolute disaster. Never mind the many thousands of spinsters of this era (some of them very famous: Jane Austen and Emily Dickinson, among others). It was not all that uncommon to remain single in the 19th century (for men or women).Also it cannot be that surprising that Mary Bee couldn't find a husband in a tiny prairie settlement with approximately 10 people in the entire TOWN (6 of won are other women, 3 of which are insane). Didn't any of the husbands of the insane women want a new wife? a mother for their children? Yeesh.Near the end, as if to rub it in, 70 year old Tommy Lee Jones proposes to a comely 16 year old waitress (Hailie Seinfeld, utterly wasted) as if to prove that "men only want extremely young hotties...see?"If this was not a DVD borrowed from the library, I'd burn it. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well plotted, and very well made trip into the old west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(87%) A significantly better film than many others have already claimed, but then again I enjoyed it far more with my sights set pretty low before the first reel went round making for an even more enjoyable experience. This is the best new western I've seen since Django unchained, and really should have been awarded with a much wider release; although "Nativity 3" is clearly far worthier. Hilary Swank is very well cast as a straight-laced lonely old west singleton taking on a worthy, yet difficult and dangerous mission. But it's Jones who adds a needed additional layer to the story with a different, more self interested viewpoint of the journey, coupled with a number of really quite funny lines and outbursts bringing a lighter note to an at times deadly serious production. The revelation point that hampered the movie for many actually worked better than I feared as it fit into the harshness of the story and made the final few scenes one of the more wonderfully poignant I've seen this year This is a tough, interesting, and very well assembled picture that tells its worthy story very well.</fullReview>

Tommy Lee Jones writes and directs himself which becomes too noticeable in the last scene.Some big stars make tea bag appearances.

		<fullReview>This is only the second time I've seen Hilary Swank, each time she has played an unconventional character and each time she has done so magnificently. The first time I saw her was in Million Dollar Baby and immediately I told all my friends it was an Oscar-worthy performance (which is not, of course, the same as saying an Oscar will be awarded) and I was correct. I have no hesitation making the same assertion after watching her in this role which, in common with Million Dollar Baby, is a magnificent performance in a magnificent film. Triple-threat Tommy LeeJones, with only a flat, featureless prairie to work with contrives to create some wonderful images against which to set a story that is surreal personified. Every performance is top-drawer including the cameo by Meryl Streep which in truth any actress could have phoned in. In sum this is a haunting and fine movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Distinct Western That's Both Quirky and Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones' latest directorial effort brings the long-missed HilarySwank back to the big screen with a powerfully melancholic performance?a vulnerable single woman by the name of Mary Bee Cuddy (a type of name that's very familiar in the Western genre) who simply can't bear the boredom and desolation of her current life. She seeks purpose and ultimately a future, which is why she's the first town resident willing to actually transport three insane mothers to a church in Iowa for (implied) healing. Just the sheer horrific and frightening acts we witness these individual women commit are unexpectedly startling. The fact of the matter is that The Homesman is definitely not the kind of film it appears to be, initially judging by its trailers and even by its deceivingly bright (brownish-hued) appearance. Beneath the surface level, a whole lot of darkness and tragedy is boiling. With the ceaselessly eerie score and disturbing imagery on display, The Homesman plays a lot like a Western with transparent horror undertones, as strange as that sounds.Whereas Mary Bee Cuddy desperately longs for a companion?for a romantic partner?to accompany her through the remainder of life, Tommy Lee Jones' George Briggs is very much an individual's individual, one who left the US Regiment of Dragoons once upon a time and since then has been doing just fine on his own without any desire for the responsibility and limitation that comes with tying yourself down to other people. It's this sense of company that a lot of the film's major characters yearn for or patently need in their present circumstances. The idea of marriage and "settling down" for a potentially prosperous future plays as a significant motif here?the societal concept's relevance in this specific time period heavily emphasized. Even though the picture's general tone is quite dreary, there are enough comical moments throughout to give this film an even more unique spin in its respective genre. Bizarre character actions/interactions and awkward line deliveries make for considerable amusement with co- lead Jones, in particular, portraying a sillier character than usual. Most of all, it's the peculiarly evolving dynamic between Cuddy and Briggs on this journey (the crazy women now taking a backseat in the story) that takes up much of the screen-time and consequently, we see several tonal shifts throughout the plot, for good or ill. On that note, the film?at the end of the day?feels largely uneven and muddy. The various subplots, especially including the mentally deranged women's arc, don't really lead anywhere?that is, anywhere satisfying and particularly climactic. See, while The Homesman does certainly present a distinct Western narrative that's void of all the usual caricatures and stereotypes constantly found in the genre, the end product still comes out unfortunately anti-climactic and unspectacular. The film's odd mixture of utter quirkiness/humor with total creepiness undoubtedly keeps you entertained through the entire story, but the more you look back at it, the more forgettable the whole package ends up being. The story focuses on one fascinating aspect (like the strange mentally unhinged illness that has taken the women of the town, or the unnerving, gradually building desperation for a husband?for sex?inside Swank). Suddenly, however, it abandons those increasingly intriguing subplots for something else, and the narrative continues changing its goals and tone to the point where you're not sure how exactly cohesive and consistent this picture turns out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical western (and I am glad for it)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am thirty years old and most people my age just look up the latest movie and download it. When I watch a older movie or a "unfamous" one most just shake their heads and show no interest.I personally still buy movies. I buy new, famous, less famous and classics. When you sort of "take a chance" you can end up all sorts of movies.. But this movie is a reason why I take my chances.The general rank on IMDb is now 6,6 and while that is a decent grade I definitely felt that this movie deserves better.The movie is a slow one.. And I guess many think of Tommy Lee Jones mainly as a action characther. This however is not a regular western-movie. It takes a long while before I got a real sense of the movie or what it was about.. But it rounded up things nicely. The acting is strong and while the movie is slow it's hard to know what is coming next. It is as far from a action movie with "as many scenes as possible" you can get these days. And I am glad for it. The scenery is beautiful and fresh. It feels somewhat like a classic western but with a modern touch (in a positive way). While I love a good Clint Eastwood or John Wayne western this is almost the opposite. It's not about catchy one-liners or someone saving the town from crooks. The story is very original and quite odd. It revels it self with time.I remember when I was about fifteen and saw "Million Dollar Baby" with Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood. I expected it to be a "Rocky"-movie with catchy soundtrack and a sweet but unrealistic story. As you might know.. That's not the case. It's the same with this one. I later on rewatched that movie and enjoyed it very much but as a young kid just wanting a thrill. That movie and this wasn't what I had in mind then. Today it is!Buying movies on chance I have ended up with quite many bad or mediocre movies.If I had just downloaded it I might have turned it off after the first half but when I did buy it I sat through it and I am very glad I did. This is a new favorite in my collection. Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Strange, Haunting, Harsh, Brutal and Beautiful This Movie Gem Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Homesman" (2014) is a western like you probably haven't seen it yet, because i surely didn't before. It is not a traditional western by any means. There isn't much (almost none actually) of a traditional western genre action in this movie, but lot of things happen through this kinda slow moving and very simple, but hardly forgettable journey. Basicaly this is a road movie, set in a wild west, with some unusual company. If you think that between two very different people (5 VERY different people in total) along the way some predictable bonding will happen, you will be right and at the same time absolutely wrong, because there isn't anything predictable it this great, haunting little movie gem. And i tell you, there is a shocking plot move in the third half of the movie, that even i couldn't see coming and it literally left me speechless.Overall, "The Homesman" is a great little movie gem, but it is not for everyone. Filled with amazing extended cameos, great acting by two main and 3 side characters, great and not traditional writing, superb cinematography and very solid and confident directing - this sometimes weird movie will definitely win over you, if you are tired from all superhero and predictable action movies. This is one heck of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally honest portrayal of US Western/pioneer history, very short on laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The winning of the American West was always an enigmatic thing, given that a person out in the Territories at regular risk of attack from a Kiowa raiding party really could send out East for mail-order goods imported from Europe, and have them delivered to a shack in the middle of nowhere. Queen Victoria was on the throne across the Atlantic, many New England cities had already been established for centuries, yet wilderness was still to be found, and quite often out there to be settled, not by people from Philadelphia or Boston, but by the freshly arrived from Europe, where even the most countrified person had at least a vague idea of what civilised, ordered life looked like. Unsurprisingly, the abrupt change of scene and lifestyle - and the sheer toughness of everything - proved too much for many, and doubtless those who descended into mental illness manifested many of the same symptoms as a fashion-conscious 21st-century blogger on the Upper East Side. And so to the story related in "The Homesman", and the decision that "something has to be done" with 3 pioneer women in Nebraska who have sunk deep into mental illness and have to be brought back East for the care that only civilisation can offer. The task of making a weeks-long journey to convey the women back to safety in that more-genteel world falls to an unlikely duo of characters played by Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones (who also produced and directed). One or two things happen on the way, including very possibly the most extreme plot twist in the history of movie-making (!), as well as a couple of moments that seem to have Jones's George Briggs character acting, well, out-of character. It's serious (occasionally unpleasant) stuff in which the greatest star of all is actually the prairie and badland landscape, though Swank is splendid as ever, her gutsy and determined character of Mary Bee Cuddy conceding again and again in the course of the dialogue that she is plain... when she is really anything but. There is a "mission to accomplish" storyline, of course, but more than that there is just what one feels is a highly accurate and authentic history of very unique and quite strange times (the kind of times in which a new hotel might really be put up on the untamed prairie - by Irish and Scots, on the basis that custom might soon be attracted once the building work was done). A very great deal is also achieved using the metaphor of an elegant cameo brooch - it's that kind of film, and there are interesting parallels with our times, and also examples of aspects that are as different as can be from what we know! Those interested in "Westerns" in the broadest sense of the term should certainly give this a go - if only to "compare and contrast". For everybody else, the advice would be to put it on the biggest screen you've got and let it somehow flow by. Those patient enough - and of a thoughtful frame of mind - will doubtless find the experience rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Homesman is directed by Tommy Lee Jones, is based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout, has a screenplay by Tommy Lee Jones, Kieran Fitzgerald and Wesley A. Oliver, has music by Marco Beltrami and stars Tommy Lee Jones, Hilary Swank, John Lithgow, Sonja Richter, Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto, James Spader and Meryl Streep.In Nebraska in the 1800's Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank)is an independent farming woman who lives alone, she is unloved except by her friend the local preacher (John Lithgow). Mary would like to be married because as good as she is at her work and as capable and strong she is, this just isn't the life she wants forever. Three women in her town go mad(they are played by Sonja Richter, Grace Gummer and Miranda Otto) and their husbands cannot cope with their care any longer. They are to be transported to Ohio where a ministers wife(Meryl Streep)will take them in and look after them in comfort far removed from the drabness and danger of frontier life.Mary says she will take them and a special wagon is made to restrain the women during the dangerous journey. Along the way Mary saves the life of a foul mouthed drifter called George Briggs(Tommy Lee Jones), in return for his life he agrees to help her on the trip and the two who are complete opposites form an unlikely bond. Tragedy and violence awaits these travellers on their journey. Despite how dark and depressing this film is there are some very funny moments courtesy of Tommy Lee's deadpan comic dialogue.This is not a Western in the sense of cowboys and Indians and nameless heroes riding into town to save the day. This film is about what it was like to live in the West and looks at the hardships and emotional stress the men and women of the time faced. Tommy Lee's film is superb and he captures the look and feel of the period so well. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is stunning showing us the sparseness of frontier life and how vast the landscape was. The film has the look of some of the Spaghetti Westerns really showing the grit and grime.The entire cast are superb but the greatest praise has to go to Sonja Richter as one of the mad women, she is terrifying looking utterly deranged and tired. One of the best films in recent years this is well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Feminist Western......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar winner, Tommy Lee Jones, will direct a movie about every ten years or so, and I just got around to seeing his latest directorial effort over the weekend. In "The Homesman", two-time Academy Award winner, Hilary Swank, stars as a frontier "old maid" who decides to escort three bats**t crazy females across the plains back to the East with the help of an old outlaw (Jones). This is a great role for Swank. Her character is aware of her advancing years- even makes wedding proposals to other men out of desperation. So unusual for a leading lady to take on such a character- good for her. And Jones is great in one of his classic old cantankerous roles- someone you know is up to no good, yet you just know deep down inside, he wants to do the right thing. And watch for some great little supporting roles from James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson and the great Meryl Streep. You know, I was trying to think- the two have been around for about the same amount of time in the film business- probably since the late '60s, early '70s-??- yet I can't think of anything both Jones and Streep have been in together-??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like a Western , I particularly like a good Western , The Homesman is a very good Western in fact the best one I've seen since True Grit [ Coen Bros ] which is one of my all time favourite films . The Homesman is uplifting while still being quite realistic and while recent Westerns have struggled to find an original storyline the same cannot be said about this one - the acting is superb and intelligent , each one of the ' Crazy Women ' is played differently while Swank and Jones achieve warm chemistry . I enjoyed The Homesman from start to finish , it's beautifully photographed and will stay in your mind long after it's finished . One for my collection .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back when I was a kid I'd listen to stories about the West and the people who settled it and I remember thinking the people I know would not have been without their flaws. What I imagined was something like what is depicted in this unforgettable film though I doubt I would have been so generous with those who considered themselves men of the cloth.This movie is difficult to watch in places but it appears to be making the case that the prairie made some women mad. Hilary Swank does not play one of them. Rather she plays a woman willing to transport three who are back East where they will be taken care of. Nowadays I wouldn't be surprised if such women were abandoned onto the street but this is played completely straight as if someone had documentation for such an act of charity.Ms Swank is essentially flawless in her performance. I might have had some misgivings about her talents over the years, but there's no doubting them now; she is wonderfully convincing and affecting. If it were up to me her performance would have been showered with awards. I can believe that women like her Mary Bee Cuddy would have had a strong effect on the community and the men around them but that they often died with barely a footnote.Tommy Lee Jones is always a pleasure to see, but this movie which he directed is a special privilege for us moviegoers. He seems to be giving us a window into his personality as never before, and I for one felt grateful to be allowed in for a glimpse. After all these years I felt vindicated in my own dreams of what it must have been like.I can imagine many won't like this film for its realism and unwillingness to soften the blow, but if you're capable of enduring a hard boiled and less common point of view, this film may be as unforgettable for you as it was for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mission from Hell for the Damned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Homesman tells the story of three women driven mad by the harsh pioneer life in the American Frontier in the 1850's. With no one to care for them the husbands decide to send them back east to a asylum that will take care of them. However no one wants to take on the duty of actually riding them there so Mary Bee Cuddy a local spinster and farmer volunteers to take the three mad women home.The entire trip is expected to take them no more then 5 weeks. Cuddy needs a Homesman a man who can scout track and hunt while driving the wagon containing the madwomen. While she takes her turn driving the wagon and tending the women's needs. She meets a man left to hang named George Briggs. Briggs is a victim of vigilante justice accused of claim jumping he is left to die by a mob. After Mary makes him swear to do anything she asks Briggs is set free only to find out the horrible job ahead of him. Together Briggs and Cuddy will endure the weather. The Madness of the women and Indians . As well as their own demons on the long dangerous journey. A original story told with great acting skills by all involved. Tommy Lee Jones shows once again he is as good behind the camera as he is in front of the camera. His Briggs is not a hero but rather a survivor who is caught in a harsh situation and forced to care for three madwomen as best as he is able to. Hillary Swank does a incredible job here that actually surpasses her role in million dollar baby.. The movie carries you from every emotion a movie can from depression to hope anger to sadness and finally happiness. The changes happen so subtle but you feel them . Like you were there. The movie draws you in and you can't help but watch wondering how will it end ? That itself is the mark of a great film. so far the Homesman is a undiscovered gem waiting to be found. And for those who do find it. It will be worth it .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If we pull together we are bound to prosper."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assuming this was a theatrical release, I'm at a loss to explain how I would have missed it, it's only a few months since it's release as I write this. There's obviously some irony in my summary quote as the principal characters did pull together once they started their journey, but it abruptly ended when the seemingly principled Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) suddenly took her life. That moment added yet another austere sense of desperation to the story, a trait that the Cuddy character exhibited throughout with her futile attempts to convince Giffen (Evan Jones) and Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) to marry her. One might presume that the sense of loneliness and futility Mary Bee felt was a result of frontier life, but it seemed to me her initial courage in undertaking the trek East with the crazy women revealed a remarkable resiliency of character. So her suicide by hanging made a grim story even more so in a way very few pictures manage to convey. Earlier references to situations that drove the three women insane offer an unimaginable picture of what it must have been like during the early days of wilderness life out West. I would caution potential viewers who might not be equipped to handle the shock of particular scenes that deal with callous disregard for propriety and human life, as the film explores behaviors that one is not generally accustomed to seeing. Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank offer up sterling performances in a story that's bound to shake up your senses and leave you a bit more thoughtful when the picture ends. It's not necessarily a good feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique and moving Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a genre that now sadly remains idle a majority of the time, it's a great joy to see grizzled industry veteran and virtual real life cowboy Tommy Lee Jones tackle Glendon Swarthout's source novel and create one of the most fully formed and interesting Westerns of the modern age, in what is a brutally raw, violently unapologetic and hauntingly beautiful modern day tale of the Wild West unlike any other before it and with a cast of uniformly great acting turns, The Homesman is one of the year's best films regardless of genre.Reigniting an oft far to dormant genre, Tommy Lee Jones has here gone on with the strength he showed as director in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada and created a world set in the west that seemingly takes its cues from the novels of Cormac McCarthy and the visuals of a Coen Brothers journey and moulds it into a story that is an original and intriguing take of life in the harsh confines of the west. Jones's direction is quite faultless in the film, with wonderful help from DOP Rodrigo Prieto and composer Marco Beltrami, he truly creates some of the year's most memorable and at times most haunting imagery. Whether it be the solemn sight of washing clothes in the open plains of the frontier, a particularly large homestead fire or a raft of wince inducing moments involving the 3 tormented women at the centre of this journey, The Homesman is filled to the brim with outstanding movie making moments that are highlighted even more so due to a surrounding of multilayered characters and fine acting turns.Once more proving to the industry and we the audience members that she is one of the best actresses in the business, Hilary Swank delivers another award worthy turn as hardened city girl turned farmer Mary Bee Buddy who is the heart and soul of this tale. Mary Bee is a character both to be encouraged by and also saddened by and it's easily one of the year's most unpredictable character arcs. As good as Swank is, she is equally matched by Jones himself as lost soul ex-army man George Briggs. It's a joy to behold Jones in what was clearly a role he relished, from dark humour, moments of stark reflection or instances of unbridled dancing happiness, Jones delivers a turn that is easily his best in years and arguable of his career. These two leads are fantastically supported by all who appear throughout The Homesman's journey, from all three actresses locked away in the back of the wagon, brief appearances from the likes of Tim Blake Nelson, Jesse Plemons or James Spader, the ensemble of the picture are all universally great.Not a flawless film by any stretch of the imagination, The Homesman is however without doubt an affecting and moving motion picture that tells a story of heartbreak, love, loss and all things in between in the now underused setting of the Wild West that proves to be one of the year's most hauntingly realistic tales. The story here will take you places you never thought it would and come the touching final scene, an understanding of the great filmmaking you have just witnessed will wash over you and that is a feeling to be mightily thankful for.4 and a half roasted pigs out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange and elegiac Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones is (in my opinion) one of America's greatest living actors, and brings a certain gravitas and humor to whatever he does. Aside from his acting he has also directed a few films as well, and THE HOMESMAN is his latest directorial effort (he also stars). I suppose you could classify this film as a Western, but it really doesn't cover the material you would expect from the genre. Instead you have a woman, Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank), who volunteers to take three mentally broken women back East where they can be given better care. Along the way she frees a claim jumper, George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones), who she enlists to help her on her journey. What follows is quite possibly one of the weirdest, but strangely compelling, Westerns I've had the pleasure of seeing. The first thing that should be noted is the unconventional plot structure. Yes there is a clear beginning and an endgame, but instead of relying on the usual devices or story beats, the film takes a number of twists and turns which propel the story along. What this film seems to be primarily interested in is the toll that life in the West took on people, particularly women. Not only do you have three women who couldn't handle life in the frontier territories, but you also have the central female character who has a problem because no one will marry her. Described by others as "plain" and "bossy," this journey is able to give her a purpose since life seems to have passed her by in every other regard. And, given the time period, being an old maid wasn't exactly the best thing to be. Other than that, the main draw of the film is the strange journey they embark upon. I also quite liked the painterly images that were captured, and that showed off the natural beauty of the Western landscape. Tommy Lee Jones, like Clint Eastwood, certainly has a great eye for visuals and it shows in the beautiful cinematography. One thing I didn't expect, but was a pleasant surprise, was how funny some parts actually would be. Tommy Lee Jones also delivers in this area as he provides some comic relief to contrast with Hilary Swank's rather serious character. The only fault I can really find with the film, and this might be a deal-breaker for some, is how slow the film is at times. That's not to say it's boring, but there are some moments that seem to drag a little, and it isn't helped when there are long stretches with little to no dialogue. That being said, the workings of the plot are of little concern here because it is the journey, the characters and the overall mood of the picture that really count. It's not a film I'd necessarily watch again, but I did enjoy the strange experience for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones Directs a Great Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life in Nebraska in the mid-nineteenth century was harsh. Scratching a living from unforgiving soil was difficult enough but hard winters, bitter winds and deep snows took a toll. Women were a step above chattel, but sometimes livestock were better treated. In that harsh world, some women went crazy. The Homesman is the story of a five-month long journey from Nebraska to Iowa transporting three insane women, driven mad by their lives in the West. Hilary Swank plays a plain woman who is tough, direct and eager to find a husband. She owns land and works it hard. The local men agree that she is the equal in skill to frontier men, and none of them wants to marry her. She is too "bossy." She is selected to handle the task of transporting the women by wagon because she shoots straight, cooks and can handle the horses. Before she begins her journey, she wins Tommy Lee Jones' services. Jones is a local scoundrel, who is better off traveling to Iowa because everyone in Nebraska wants to kill him.There are a series of very disgusting scenes that illustrate how insane the women are, and there are some vile scenes not for the faint of heart. These we mark up to the hardness of people who are surviving a cruel world. Tommy Lee Jones, the actor, is like comfortable old shoes. He is not pretty. The camera explores his worn features, his sagging eyes and his deep fissures. He appears to be a man without vanity. We have seen this character in recent films, films like "No Country for Old Men," "The Missing," "In the Valley of Elah," and "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada." We welcome him back like a favorite relative. Hilary Swank is the focus of most of the film. This is a new character for her, and she is convincing as the tough, compassionate, devout spinster who is the film's moral compass.Jones' directing is first-rate also. The western is Jones' territory, and, in this film, he gets writing credit as well.One of the best film of 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances by Jones and Swank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good Western, Jones' follow-up to the also excellent The Three Burials of Melquiadas Estrada. I think I liked that one slightly better, but this is very solid, despite some bits of poor editing and some bits of unwelcome weirdness. It's very episodic, as well, though I kind of liked how it was structured. Hilary Swank stars as a single woman in her early 30s out West. When three women in the small settlement of Loup go insane, she volunteers to take them back to civilization so they can get care. Knowing she's not going to be able to cut it alone, she picks up crazy old coot Tommy Lee Jones and brings him along. Swank and Jones are both very good in the film. Plenty of other fine, little performances in the film abound from the likes of William Fichtner, Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, James Spader (actually not sure if I'd call his uber-Irish performance good or not, but he was amusing), Tim Blake Nelson and Meryl Streep. I kind of hated the depiction of the three crazy women. One of them is Grace Gummer. I think she went insane because she knows she'll never be as good as her mom, and they basically end up returning her butt right to her mother (Streep, if you didn't know).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of Jones' and Swank's best. Nuances flowed.The film centers on the three obviously disturbed women and the complex mission to get them to a sane place to recover, but much more was at stake.The fact is many women DID go insane on the open plains, and the movie beautifully captures the setting that drove them crazy. It's not important for the film, but what actually tormented women in particular was the west wind as it ceaselessly whined and moaned through cracks in the sod -- every single day.But beyond this lies the greater truth: many people -- both men and women alike -- living in extreme or relatively uncivilized conditions like those in the sod-busters' West also became neurotic or desperate. It was simply too hard to create normalcy.Thus for me (not to give anything away) the film may be about a great unwinding of control of peoples' lives. There was desperation aplenty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprising Western with Excellent Acting and a Brilliant Score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A noble outing from writer/director/star Tommy Lee Jones, but one that is plagued with a debilitating third act that turns the story on its head in a most unwelcome fashion. The story is about Mary Bee Cuddy, a 'plain and bossy' woman who has made a fine, respectable life for herself, yet feels the need for a husband. After being rejected by a male acquaintance, Cuddy volunteers for the task of delivering three mentally ill women in her area to a church in Iowa where they will be sent back to their homes in the east. Along the way, she saves the life of George Briggs who in turn helps her on the long journey. For the first 60-90 mins, I found The Homesman to be an engrossing and uniquely told Western. Cuddy's strong female presence was a breath of fresh air and the shocking depictions of the three women's insanity immediately set this tale apart from other, more traditional Westerns. That's not to say the film isn't entirely cemented in the genre's fundamentalism, however. The character of Briggs is a pretty standard Western anti-hero, one who's harsh and set in his own ways but ultimately kind and caring. And in time, his presence completely overtakes the film, that is after the uncharacteristic and disappointing suicide of Mary Bee. Yes, she was sad after Briggs shot down her marriage proposal, and indeed she probably felt that she would never be accepted by a man, but to take her own life is to go against her undeniably strong will shown throughout the whole film up to that point. After that point, the film is still compelling, and even has some truly excellent scenes (the burning of the hotel), but missing is the heart that Mary Bee brought to the table. I commend Tommy Lee Jones for taking a chance with a somewhat against-the-grain story and directing it with class and an artistic sensibility. The combination of gorgeous scenery, polished cinematography, and occasionally bold editing makes The Homesman a treat for the eyes. Marco Beltrami delivers one of my favorite scores of the year, one that has its traditional western themes but isn't afraid to stray into tense, desolate, experimental, and even frightening territory.The acting on all accounts is truly brilliant. Jones is still his haggard, blunt self, yet he brings a raw energy to Briggs that we usually don't see from him. Hilary Swank allows the audience to feel for her character almost instantly, despite Mary Bee's rough edges. Her absence from the third act is a crying shame. Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto, and Sonja Richter are all great as the 'disturbed women,' while John Lithgow, James Spader, William Fichtner, Jesse Plemons, Hailee Steinfeld, and Meryl Streep all give fine supporting performances. Though The Homesman is a respectable display of Tommy Lee Jones' many talents, it suffers from serious story issues that undercut what could have been a minor modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the authentic looking scenery and the journey theme I couldn't buy into this. In retrospect I felt manipulated. Too many scenes were just there for effect. It all starts off well ? with our main heroine (Hilary Swank) recruiting Tommy Lee to accompany her in taking 3 crazy women to a shelter out East. The journey beginsThe crazy women being transported are sequestered in a wagon for a whole month ? that didn't make much sense. They were taken out for a daily walk ? and didn't say or do much of anything. Seems questionable. They are stalked by an Indian tribe ? who are then given a horse. Wouldn't they have come for more?Hilary gets lost on the forlorn prairie (a common enough theme), but eventually, after much emotional turmoil, finds her way back to Tommy Lee and the crazy ladies. And then Hilary dies (won't reveal the totality of this) for very dubious reasons ? and then we enter a very downward spiral. The story becomes vacant.Tommy Lee burns a hotel down ? what does this contribute to the story? And then he leaves the three crazies at the shelter run by Meryl Streep ? and spends a lot of money, does a dance, and our story ends. Anti-climatic to say the least ? a kind of WDF.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances are good, but Hilary Swank's is extraordinary. I was rapt by her character from the start. I think the portrayal of the mentally ill women was adequate. Tommy Lee Jones was fine - but the character was not developed enough to allow his arch to be believed thoroughly. Nevertheless, Jones makes good work of weak material. Make no mistake, Jones is in a supporting role here - Swank steals the show.It is something of a take on the Rooster Cogburn movies, but with really good acting. You may see some other actors of some name in the cast, but they are window dressing to Swank and - to a lesser extent - Jones. Of the minor role big names, Lithgow comes off best. Spader was the worst - and Streep completely phoned in her few minutes.Just a little bit of an editorial process during the writing and production could have really made this movie great - and saved it some unnecessary acting baggage - particularly by James Spader and Tim Blake Nelson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in Arizona with Western influences all around makes me a fan of Western movies. I hid the lower star rating from my wife who wanted to see another movie which had more stars. I like Tommy Lee Jones, Hilary Swank and what could be bad with the star studded ensemble including Meryl Streep? Tommy Lee Jones and Hillary did a good job but the plot was not believable. The unknown actors who played the three women were not convincing at playing mentally disturbed people. It starts out with Ms Cuddy finding out she is not marriage material despite her considerable worldly assets. She is plain and bossy so this is what she is saddled with for the rest of the movie. She runs into TLJ on a horse with a noose and frees him provided he will help her deliver 3 mental women to a care facility. I can't answer why the people who put the noose around his neck did not just hang him and take the horse he was sitting on? There is a value having a horse which is mentioned later in the movie. On the journey they run into several Indians whose threat is appeased by the gift of one horse. There we go with the value of horses again. Why would the Indians not take the four women, the wagon, two mules and another horse along with weapons and stuff that could help the tribe? Bossy one gets lost and wanders for two days which is a waste of time. One of the mental women escapes and is found on a horse behind a scary dude needing acne cream and professional dental care. TLJ and the dude duke it out and just when TLJ is about to croak by choke, the mental woman shoots him in the head...is she feeling better? Then in the middle of nowhere there is a large Victorian hotel which is so new you can smell the fresh paint in the theater. There is no place at the inn for our travelers and the kitchen will not feed them because TLJ is acting cranky and the concierge has a group of VIP's checking in later. Wanting to feed his hungry charges and angry his gold card is not accepted that night he steals a roasted pig with a apple in the mouth and sets fire to the place making sure everyone is roasted alive. Feeling good after downing the porker Ms Cuddy bares it all and has her first experience with pioneer sex and TLJ. The audience let out a collective gasp when in the morning Ms Cuddy expresses her displeasure with the previous evening around the fire. There are more symbolic gestures at the end but it is not a story that needed to be told nor will anyone remember it. Take a walk with your spouse instead of going to this movie. You will thank me when it is on TV.</fullReview>

Hillary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones captures a lot of the suffering that folks endured back in those days. The Prairie wasn't for a weak woman or man. You worked hard, built you a homestead, raised some stock. There were times when the weak just couldn't make and it drove them crazy. Especially with the rough abuse men would give their women. Disease and drought would get the best of them. If not that then someone wanting to take your property. It was dog eat dog type lifestyle. Every man a woman had to do their share or fail. These two actors did the script very good along with the help of the three ladies that had the job of playing crazy. A little nudity and some cursing, but it was in good taste to show real life drama and I understand that point. A lot of folks won't, but it was a fine movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People, they break.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Homesman" is a drama that surprised me. It's a western too and quite loyal to some of its roots, but it's not a drama that just happens to be a western. Because it is a western, it finds ways to emphasize the story in a way that makes it so much stronger than it would be otherwise.How should I describe this one? It's a story about hardship and broken people. Almost every character that has any focus, is somehow broken. Some are visibly broken beyond the capacity to function, and this is indeed the main storyline: Mary Bee Cuddy is determined to help three broken, mentally ill women to get to a church far away, where they would receive better care. Some of these women are reluctant to go, some of them want to go, but none of them speak and all of them seem beyond help. Mary Bee Cuddy gets a lowlife who calls himself George Briggs to help her transport these women. The journey is long, dangerous and ultimately tells us more about these characters than any destination ever would.Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) drives this movie forward. She is a good, hard-working, God-fearing and strong-willed woman. Not a ball-busting superficial Mary Sue, or a portrayal of what an "independent woman" means to many modern mainstream feminists, but a real character with depth, needs and weaknesses of her own. This seems to have upset people who only want female characters to validate their checklist politics and/or bitterness, but everyone else can see a layered, driven and a very central character. About Mary Bee Cuddy's character, I do like how simple the symbolism is around her. She has managed to survive by herself in a very hostile and unforgiving world. She prays, she tries her best and she wants to help people. But can she help herself? The irony of the story is this: Mary Bee Cuddy wants to care for these broken people and get them all to a safe place far away, while she needs that destination and care just as much. She's not visibly broken and she can certainly function, but in her own way she is a desperate person. Desperate for love, desperate for anything to validate her struggles, to make them mean something. Most of us can relate to this. In this movie, you will find how people break in different ways. Some people are ill and their minds are broken, some can't get over a personal tragedy, some people are broken by cruelty and constant hardships, some people are broken by their inability to accept the "holes" in their hearts or what they don't have. Some people are broken by their false sense of independence and strength that doesn't allow them to love or care for others. This movie is both nihilistic and hopeful, even though the darkness threatens to swallow the little glimmer of hope left. There is a contrast. We are shown plenty of cruel things and hopeless despair, but I felt it also had a wonderfully naive heart to it, somewhere under the dark layers. This movie demonstrates how we can make a difference when we carry someone else's burdens for them or even with them, although we can't force anyone to do the same for us. If there is a message in this movie, I think it's this: we can never know how far the ripples of our lives and good deeds go, and sometimes - whether we know it or not - we can inspire people, no matter how fruitless and desperate our efforts can seem to us. We see this effect in at least one of the characters."The Homesman" can seem like a movie without a point, a movie where the journey means more than the destination, but there is a point to it. At times it's subtle and other times it hammers things to your head, but it's still tonally intact and everything works in favor of the story. It doesn't end with a bang, and although I would've liked a stronger, more simple ending, it's still quite fitting in its own way.Hilary Swank is absolutely great in this, and she is the beating heart of the story. Tommy Lee Jones is great too, both in very different ways. The three crazy ladies are played by Miranda Otto, Grace Gummer and Sonja Richter. They are all good, and although their craziness can be seen as "movie craziness" instead of something absolutely real and subtle, their performances work nonetheless. Supporting cast is very good as well, featuring good performances from William Fichtner, Caroline Lagerfelt and more.This film is well shot, although you won't get many majestic scenery shots or anything else that's visually outstanding in itself. In fact, you don't even notice the camera most of the time. I like this approach in a character-driven story. Marco Beltrami composed a good score. At first it seems a little out of place (I'd blame the editing department for this), but it finds its place soon enough. It's nothing too grand, which again is fitting.Tommy Lee Jones directed and co-wrote this little gem. Thumbs up for the other writers too, and I might just check out the novel this movie is based on. "The Homesman" hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn't feel it at first, but it just refused to go away. Its narrative isn't as tight or obvious as in most crowd-pleasing movies, and it's certainly not an exciting action movie (like westerns often tend to be), but it cuts deep if you allow it. It's not a bad cut, even though it may feel bad at first. When it scars, you feel better about it.Recommended for lovers of character-driven drama, even those who don't normally like westerns. But most of all, recommended for broken hearts and minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from 'Home'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Homesman is an odd movie that probably most accurately conveys the stress and fatigue of frontier life. Swank's character is charged with the care of three insane women and enlists the help of a ne'er-do-well to help her herd them back east. She adeptly conveys the outward strength of her character with the inward draining loneliness and insecurities that women faced out there alone. Jones's character contrasted that with the spitfire of life and his surviving all of the hell that the West puts anyone through with a mocking smile. The two make a well matched, albeit unlikely pair. They seem to compliment each other even as they fail to understand just what makes the other one tick. Swank is righteous and God fearing; a hard working and extremely likable woman who battles her loneliness as best she can. Trying desperately to see the bright side of things. Jones is surly and apathetic. Not caring a wit about anyone but himself and forcing himself to look the other way rather than view the demons this woman has on her shoulders.It has its high points and its low points but it keeps you intrigued for its slow duration. Swank looks at home in this costume piece and Jones knows how to handle the story, even if the ending leaves you feeling slightly bereft and more than a little bewildered. 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual western road trip drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A novel based film starred and directed by the 70 years old Tommy Lee Jones. An unusual realistic western drama with a fantastic cast. It sets around the time 1850 and the story of three mentally ill wives who were transported to a safe facility by a man and a woman who hired him in exchange of saving his life. During this both way road trip, what they go through is what finely told.Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank were excellent in their parts. She was the best, you would definitely feel her role's eagerness to get a normal life with a husband and children. Which is very important for the personal and the social life of that time. And at this old age, Tommy Lee did a great job in all the fields he had undertaken for this project. His vision was the most appreciable.Felt like I saw a wonderful western film after a long time. But some of the events were needed a good explanation like one of the deaths in the film. Since it was a tale of the cowboy culture era, few things were understandable, but not everyone going to get those parts. So the details were missing yet not a bad film.The characters were not introduced in a usual way, it only goes forward by developing the story and by the end you would feel you know them enough. And at the final act, there was a couple of guest appearances and steals the show. It is not your regular western, totally worth a watch and that's my suggestion.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Startlingly Original Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actors with chops and a thoroughly engaging situation. Hillary Swank is without peer in today's cinematic world. She is worth the price of admission every time. Here she plays a tough young pioneer woman who has carved out her place in a desolate part of Nebraska. She is extremely forward when it comes to men and she suffers for it. The pickings are pretty bad. Because she likes to test herself, she agrees to transport three mentally ill women to a place in Iowa. Along the way, she save a guy named Briggs, played by Tommy Lee Jones, from hanging. He is a claim jumper and has overstepped his bounds. Her pound of flesh is for him to assist her in her venture. She agrees to pay him upon reaching their destination. Of course, there are incredible pitfalls when dealing with their unhappy cargo. None of them speak. We have no idea about how much thought is going on in those vacuous visages. All three have faced some kind of abuse or heartache and have lost their beings. A bond develops between Swank's Cully and Jones's Briggs as he does his best to face the realities of the venture. The one scene that bothered me is not the death of Cully, but rather the burning of the hotel after Briggs and the women are refused service, even though they can pay. They pay a horrible price for their actions, but one can only imagine that innocent people were killed. This is an allegory, and the conclusion is realistic. One could make a case for people being awfully insensitive. I have not problem with that these days. A good many of us have regressed to that level. I just have to say that this movie really spoke to me. It was a wonderful surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A near miss. A lot of first rate actors whose talents are wasted here. It was, to be fair, an entertaining film, but it did not reach its potential. There are too many unanswered questions in the plot, and the motivation of the various characters is either not clear, or totally ambiguous. It fails to achieve the kind of reality found in westerns like Lonesome Dove, which I expect Tommy Lee must surely have had in mind. Hillary Swank, as is often the case, gave the most compelling performance, especially in one campfire scene with Jones. She is such a capable actress that she can bring any character to life, although I'm not sure she was the best fit for this role. Meryl Streep is underused, and one of our best young actresses, so memorable in True Grit, is entirely wasted. Given only a few lines, she nevertheless makes an impression. The film strives mightily to achieve its ends, although it is never entirely clear what they are. Still, because Jones and Swank are so watchable, I would recommend the film. Not a bad western, just not a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This slow-paced western is moving but not really gripping if not for the good actors. It evolves around the figure of a very demanding, fussy and religious woman, that is also really sweet, pragmatic and able, and of a "living the day" man who, after all, is unable to completely redeem himself.The movie is a little too slow despite it go straight to the point in many parts, and some interactions between the two main stakeholders, should have been deeper to my taste, because that is its major focal point; their contrasting character it is not as developed as it should have been, maybe also by making it also a little more fun or "adventurous" at times, with a more lively script although it is essentially a really hard, depressing and crude drama.Seen the caliber of the actors and the very touching parts in its second half (that in my opinion saves the whole movie), I consider it not a unmissable one, but watchable for a mature audience.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this good a Western in years, and to me, it certainly stands as one of the best Westerns out there. It is a Western with a difference - not about quest for wealth, business or territory, but about a seemingly simple (but grandly humanitarian) task of delivering three crazy women across the uninhabitable territory of the West. With only a backdrop of the West, the movie has a lot to say about universal and eternal facts of life - personal hardships and struggles, unkindness of greed-driven individuals, history's tendency of obscuring truly credit-deserving individuals , etc. As always, Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones deliver excellent performances.I would recommend the movie to anyone who wants to watch a Western or a period film with more sense than senseless, firing guns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad I watched this. Good, solid performances by every character large and small. Well written script and absorbing storyline. Some people are born heroic and no one rewards them. Others dabble in it reluctantly, but only long enough to follow their new sense of honor, then it's back to business as usual.This isn't about a man becoming a hero. It's about the cold hard reality of life in the Midwest and West farming lands. It was a hard, gritty world for everyone, and more so for many women who lost their youth, children, love and lives to the sweaty dust of summers, the bitter winds of long winters, husbands who were often just their masters and disease hiding around every corner. And two people who find themselves in charge of saving 3 victims of this endless cycle of fragile life and early death in the American 1800's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones steals the show with his authentic, three dimensional interpretation of what I would say is the main character of the story. Nicely done in the direction of the visual convey as well. The story line keeps you interested as it turns out some surprising twist along the way. Solid B picture, I would say a good western drama overall.One complain is that it could have had a little more action, and perhaps more engagement in the part of the "mad" women coming along for the ride. However Tommy does a good job both directing and portraying his character. It has that authentic feel that Clint Eastwood's Unforgiving picture laid out. Like I said all in all a good film, and definitely one of Tommy's best performance; you can tell he put some time in his character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie combines terrific cinematography and acting with a plot that doesn't twist or develop to the liking of what most movie goers will like, as in losing the main character long before the story's over.I can easily see what was trying to be accomplished, but it left me flat.On the plus side, The Homesman delivers exactly how tough frontier life must have been like. Near starvation, vigilante justice, disease, and throw in a rapist but pious husband or two to boot. Not to mention a frontier wife who disposes of her children in a most cold blooded fashion. On the downside, The Homesman had many opportunities to become far more uplifting than what it is, and purposefully misses out on having any real kind of a happy ending. The movie is also littered with big-shot cameos that are only good for a scene or two, only to disappear for good.This production was clearly a brave attempt at something different and unique, and I get it. I even mostly liked it.But most people won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "homesman" is the one who brings crazy women from the frontier back to their original homes for treatment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is hard to describe and even harder to explain. I found two stories here, interwoven.The first is the hard life in the 1850s western frontier. In this story it is the plains of Nebraska. Often residents are very young, e.g. a man of 21 with a wife of 19. It is much harder than they ever expected, with disease and drought, and with little to look forward to, many women go crazy. Or maybe they are just very depressed. When they get into that state, they quit talking, or make no sense, or kill their newborn, it is a signal to sent them back home, maybe to a place like Iowa, for care.The second is the journey. None of the men really want to volunteer for being the homesman, it is a dangerous journey of about five weeks. So a single woman, Hilary Swank as Mary Bee Cuddy, says she will do the job. As she explains she can ride as well and is as rugged as any man. Plus she is still single, it seems she is so plain and bossy that men refuse her marriage proposals.She is given a wagon, one with bars on the windows and a locking door, to transport three crazy women. On the way she encounters a man, Tommy Lee Jones as George Briggs, on a horse and with a noose around his neck, the end of the rope tied to a tree above. If the horse decides to go he is dead. Mary Bee frees him only after he promises to accompany her to deliver the women. They will pass through Indian country, she can use his help. So the main of the story is this unlikely band of five making the trek. Mary Bee is an honorable woman, Briggs has no honor. He does what he believes will best serve his interests. As an example, on the way everyone is hungry, he comes upon a hotel, he wants rooms and food but is turned away. So he returns at night, steals the food, and burns down the hotel, likely those in the hotel perishing also.Since the title of the movie refers to the Briggs character I will assume the story is about him, and how he affects those he encounters. Will Briggs ever change? Not likely.This in not a pleasant movie to watch, but it has some entertaining moments. Written and directed by the star, Jones, it is his project and it is very effective. I could not stop watching. It also was nice to see Barry Corbin in a brief role as Buster Shaver. I became a fan of his as Maurice Minnifield of the old TV series "Northern Exposure" and one year when I was an extra in a movie he was in had the chance to sit at a table and have a short conversation with him. A nice guy and what a career!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mary Bee and Woodrow go camping.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They found the right actress to play Mary Bee. I see that Swank was born in Nebraska and I am informed from her biography that many of her people live in Iowa. I am always interested in where people come from and I'm always studying places my people have been, where they were looking for trouble and the perfect place to be at the end of their rope. And why did my Great Grandpa need to take his family all tucked in a wagon pulled by his horses way up to the central plains of Alberta? Maybe he did that because Nebraska wasn't as plain as it should be. But when Great Grandma couldn't take it anymore, they came back to the states to the Pacific Northwest where you could hug too many trees and pick all the flowers you need for the grave. And Bellingham was a nice place when I was a child growing up. But you'd have to ask Hilary what it was like at that sea home when she was there. I love Hilary though she is rather plain looking in a sun bonnet or furry cap. But I don't understand why nobody will marry Mary Bee. Mary Bee is so good and Woodrow can never give her the kind of robe she really needs. And Sweet Jesus will understand that only he can give her a beautiful robe of velvet and keys. And I'm sure he must have been there to marry Marry Bee when she needed just the right company. And if I wasn't there and don't know what really happened, I can pretend I was there watching in the shadows in the trees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid western, but could have been so much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Homesman" is only the second film that has Academy-Award winner Tommy Lee Jones credited as writer and director. The first is already almost 20 years ago. Admittedly, he did not write it on his own, but got some help from his longtime assistant and also from the director/writer of "The Ballad of Esequiel Hernández", a film TLJ did the narration for. It runs for roughly two hours, but the female lead Hilary Swank is only in it for the first 90 minutes. The film does not offer us a happy ending of any kind with Swank's and Jones' characters becoming a couple, but goes for more realism instead. Still the ending was slightly unusual for me. It's just life that happens I guess. It could even hint at a possible sequel about what is waiting for Jones' character when he steps off the boat. So one may wonder, why does she kill herself? I thought it was quite a surprising development, but given her strong faith in God it makes sort of sense that she could not live on with the shame of having slept with a man before marriage. Nonetheless, I was surprised to see her go for suicide, which is often criticized by the Church and also she did not seem the type to me to let these three women go instead of making sure they arrive at their destination. Anyway, the act of suicide came surprising to me, but I found her asking Jones' character to sleep with her even more surprising at that point. Mary Bee Cuddy may turn out as the most tragic film character from 2014.At the end, she is gone and Jones' character (we never know if Briggs is his real name) is basically what he was at the beginning of the film: angry, drunk, lawless, restless and without money. What I found interesting though was the way he reacted towards the hotel owners and towards the guys playing cards. Only the former meant a case of injustice towards him, so he burnt the whole place down. When they refuse to let him play cards with them, he accepted their decision as he really could not pay his way into the game. Or maybe the reactions differed so strongly because the latter was only about him and not about the three women. That would mean that he actually felt some kind of obligation to these women. Also, the way he fought for the one woman who ran away and risked his life would make you think that the mission meant something to him. Or maybe he was just an old roughneck who had to defend his honor.The cast is truly great. Meryl Streep (third common project already with Tommy Lee Jones), Hailee Steinfeld, James Spader ("Lincoln" reunion with TLJ), John Lithgow, William Fichtner are all among actors I liked/love and same goes for the two protagonists. Jesse Plemons will be a treat for fans of the TV show "Breaking Bad". On a random side-not, the film "Argo" had Bryan Cranston in it and both these movies use the famous melody "Hace Tuto Guagua". Love the tune. I heard it in the trailer for "The Homesman" and I have to say I was quite disappointed that id was not used in the film. Anyway, back to the cast. Unfortunately, almost all of the supporting cast were wasted for very minor characters where they could not show their true talent, especially Hailee Steinfeld. It seems she is cast for her role here only because she was so great in "True Grit". There is absolutely nothing to her character here sadly that no unknown actress could have portrayed equally well. In terms of the plot I wondered isn't it a bit unlikely that 3 women in nearby places go mad at the same time? This is actually a good basis for a mystery film. What was the reason behind this craziness? Maybe malnutrition. I mean the personal tragedies they were facing I would have more expected to result in suicide than insanity.As a whole, I was slightly disappointed with "The Homesman". It is not a bad film at all (obviously not, it has a Palme d'Or nomination), but something is missing for greatness and looking at the cast, it certainly could have been reached. It is mostly a drama, but the roughness of Jones' character also bring a funny quote here and there, like when Cuddy says she can't sleep and he responds he can. Or how he says that he does not want to be hung right away again when the group reaches a new city and you'd wonder what did the old bastard did now? However, for best western of the year, I still have to give the edge to "The Salvation" from Denmark starring Mads Mikkelsen in a great tale of revenge including all the elements from classic westerns decades ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pioneer journey from west to east</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Homesman (2014) was directed by Tommy Lee Jones, who also stars in the movie. Hilary Swank co-stars. Homesman is basically a pioneer-era road movie, although, in a very creative decision, the rode being traveled is from west to east, not east to west.Homesteaders in Nebraska had a hard life at best, but the premise of this movie is that the previous winter was so hard that three local women became psychotic. No one could care for these three unfortunate women, so someone has to get them back across the Mississippi River to Iowa.That someone turns out to be Mary Bee Cuddy (Swank), along with George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones). As expected, they face obstacle after obstacle as they travel slowly across the state. However, both Cuddy and Briggs are tough and capable, and they manage to keep going.However, about two-thirds through the movie, Director Jones makes the decision that Actor Jones is the most interesting character in the film, and he concentrates the plot on him. Granted, the film is called "Homesman," not "Homeswoman," but I still believe that the decision was a mistake. Even so, it's an interesting movie, and I think it's definitely worth seeking out and seeing.Incidentally, much is made in the movie of Mary Bee Cuddy being "plain." Her "plainness" is a central aspect of the plot. Now, Hilary Swank isn't impossibly beautiful like Emily Blunt, but she isn't "plain." My thought is that if you want a "plain" female actor, cast a "plain" female actor. Otherwise, we, as viewers, are forced to watch the entire film having to suspend disbelief.We saw this movie in the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well enough on DVD, although the amazing expanse of empty land won't be as dramatic as it was on the large screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Homesman" Should Have Found Larger Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last time Tommy Lee Jones directed a film was his 2007 flick, "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada," (which actually premiered at the Cannes Film Festival two years prior). He won Best Actor at Cannes that year, essentially playing his usual crusty, irritable self, with the added augmentation that his character was perhaps just a little crazy and unpredictable. Now he's done it again. In "The Homesman," he directs himself as a crusty, irritable old claim jumper and all-around good-for-nothing, who borders on crazy and unpredictable, especially when he drinks.But unlike in "Melquiades Estrada," Jones' George Briggs is not the most interesting character in "The Homesman." That honor belongs to the great Hilary Swank ? at 40 years of age, already the recipient of two Best Actress Oscars. Here, Swank plays a hard-working, unmarried farmer in the rough pre-Civil War Nebraska Territory. The fact that her Mary Bee Cuddy is still single seems to bother no one but herself. But none of the single townsmen are interested, professing Cuddy to be both "plain" and "bossy." When the local pastor requests a volunteer to transport three unstable women to a church in Iowa that cares for the mentally ill, Cuddy raises her proverbial hand. Ironically, all the townsmen seem to agree she'd be the best choice. But Cuddy, wisely, doesn't want to endure the journey alone. Enter Tommy Lee Jones' George Briggs. Why this loser? The script says it's because she saves him from hanging by making him promise to help her. I believe she chooses Briggs because (a) he's unattached ? no family, no farm, and (b) he knows how to handle the inevitable obstacles of the journey ? Indians, outlaws, severe winter weather. The two make an odd pair. He, the cantankerous old gunslinger, and she, the strong, upright, deeply religious, independent spinster.As you might expect, the two don't get along. Fortunately as "The Homesman" progresses, they don't magically become best buddies. In a more realistic fashion, they simply learn to tolerate one another. Each of the lead characters changes a little, but not unbelievably so. Briggs begins to respect Cuddy, as well as gaining at least a modicum of concern for the three "crazy" women in their care. Cuddy learns how to at least communicate with Briggs in a such a way that he'll do what she wants. It's a bit unrealistic that such a liberated woman would entertain the idea of settling down with a chiseled old curmudgeon, but she does. And she's a little upset he's not interested. And this is essentially my only complaint with the screenplay, which Jones adapted from Glendon Swarthout's 1988 novel. I do want to mention Rodrigo Prieto's first class cinematography. He gives us wide panoramic views of the desolate plains countryside, while also focusing on Jones' lined and roughhewn face. Each wrinkle seems to represent a hidden and unspoken backstory of army desertion, cattle rusting, and God only knows what. His life, essentially unexamined by the script, must feature a variety of episodic twists and turns similar to the present quest. Nor are we treated to any real backstory of Swank's character. And this is probably a smart move. The camera and the somewhat sparse dialogue tell us all we need to know about these two. Along the way there are adventures, to be sure. And at the end, Jones' character connects with a young girl who reminds him of Swank's. But this tender moment is then superseded by another episode of crazy, drunken behavior. The bottom line is that while Briggs may not have truly changed during the course of this film, he's at least able to see the good in some people.Is that enough to earn "The Homesman" Oscar recognition? Probably not. Swank won't win a third Oscar, and Jones' direction probably won't either. But my fear is that this picture will be buried amongst the heavy-hitters of the season. It probably would have found an audience had it been released in the summer ? the token adult film surrounded by the usual bevy of superheroes. It's good enough I'd like to see it again. It's not the best, but it's certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm, in the tough times out west, how many Christian type women, desperate to get married, walked up naked to some guy 20 years older and wanted sleep with them, then go hang themselves immediately after having sex with the guy? Tell me. I'd like to know. My guess? Near zero.This is one of those movies where the writer forces the action by simply writing scenes that make no common sense. The writer wanted the female hero out of the movie, so the character just hung herself.Another example was when the woman stayed behind to rebury the dead baby. If she is as tough as the movie said she was, why show a scene in which she travels in a huge circle and comes back to the grave site (one in a million), then, as dumb as she had just proved herself to be contrary to her character up to that point, is able to ride her horse in the dark and then find the wagon? If you ride in circles when there is light, why can you find the wagon in the dark? Way too many senseless scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, where is it? Some might think it is in an "abandoned" house, some others feel the church is their home and so on. This movie might not feel like home for those who expect a Western with a lot of action. If that's what you're expecting, don't even bother watching this. This is closer to a road movie than to an action movie.That being said, it is very well made, with magnificent turns from our two lead actors. There's things happening along the way that you might not expect (at least I didn't expect them to happen), but it's the journey and the "task" at hand, which will either fascinate you or annoy you. One thing is for sure: Tommy Lee can dance ... Make of it/this whatever you think or want to ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The storyline could have done with a bit more work! 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I must admit, I did expect a bit more from this movie, as it was made by Tommy Lee Jones, but I was quite disappointed with the pace and some of the content. Its about a lonely lady who decides to help her church by taking 3 insane women to Ohio to get cured. She then sees a man hanged to a tree who will die if his horse moves, so they strike a deal that she will save his life, only if he helps her in the task to save the 3 ladies. After he cleans himself up, they set of for there dangerous journey, which has a few bumps on the way and the two main characters, played by Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones, are bonded together in such a difficult situation. The whole pace of the film is quite slow but the banter between Swank &amp; Jones made it interesting. The acting was brilliant from the whole cast, especially Jones, and there are a few unexpected moments which were a weird choice by the director. I didn't really like the ending because the story of the 3 girls wasn't explained that well and it came to a abrupt end. There wasn't any conclusion with Jones character either, so the script was a bit sketchy from my point of view. With all that aside, it is an entertaining film which covers a lot of elements and it has many twists and turns which keeps it interesting. Watchable!Round-Up: With all of the work that was put into this film, especially from Jones, it's a shame to see it make such a heavy lose at the box office. Personally, I'm not that surprised because it's not the type of film that you can get excited about in the cinema, but I do appreciate the unique look of the film which reminded me a lot of Clint Eastwoods work. Swank, who craves a husband through the film, was a great choice alongside Jones because there chemistry really did work. I loved the dancing from Jones because it showed a different side to his persona, which is usually cool and humble. Anyway, it's a decent movie with a witty script but the storyline could have done with a bit more work.Budget: $16million Worldwide Gross: $3million (Terrible!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/westerns about a lady who takes on a man to transport 3 insane women to Ohio. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard movie to decide on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off with some positives from this movie. This had the look and feel of what the old west must have been like. It was very authentic in this regard. The characters we're believable in their roles as we didn't see the glamor girls or the pretty boys or the pearly whites as we often do in westerns that un-authenticate. This film had it's moments. Some of the negatives were actually the bases of the entire movie. Transporting 3 crazy women cross country. I didn't understand first how they even got crazy and why did they all act the same... staring into the void. Also, why didn't the husbands object to them killing their newborns,,, just because they were girls? I didn't understand or find it relevant to the story. One scene in particular was simply unnecessary. If you watch the film you'll know which one i'm talking about. Also regarding the trip why couldn't he stay and help rebury the poor girl... it would have taken 10 minutes. The scene where he goes back for food was odd as well. Why didn't anybody jump one floor down to their survival? Didn't make sense. Was disappointed also when one of the main characters left the film with 45 minutes left. Seemed again unnecessary. The ending was disappointing as well. Overall this wasn't a bad movie it just didn't really go anywhere and was kinda slow and boring. Lastly, Meryl Streep as a nun or whatever she was suppose to be just weirds me out a bit. Not sure why. So, I don't "not" recommend this film as it had it's moments and was quite believable to the old west. It was just slow and unmoving for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mary Bee, Plain and Tall . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . is a story a lot like Edwin Arlington Robinson's 1897 poem, "Richard Cory." The poet's title character could be a soul mate to "Mary Bee Cuddy" of THE HOMESMAN, played by "tomboy" specialist Hilary Swank. The self-centered Ms. Cuddy has one goal in life: she's desperate to walk down the aisle as wedding bells ring out for her. It does not matter to her that she's reached the advanced age of 31 (the old 62, in 21st Century years). The instant any single male sits or beds down within earshot of her, Mary Bee's bound to start prattling on and on about her horsemanship, shooting, and AgriBusiness skills, throwing in a few asides about having kids, and capping off these initial meetings with her blunt marriage proposals. She totally ignores whatever rules there were for Nineteeth Century Courtship. No matter how many well-meaning guys advise her that this brash approach is way too bossy and brassy to work, she persists in an effort that to everyone else obviously is doomed to failure. Watching THE HOMESMAN is a lot like reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 1981 novella, CHRONICLE OF A DEATH FORETOLD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still not an (anti-)Western fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First a warning or disclaimer: I'm _not_ a good audience for this movie. My tendency is to not appreciate Westerns, so I don't see very many of them, and as a result I'm relatively unfamiliar with their conventions (and unwilling to accept most of the bits I do understand). Thus even when a movie like this one plays with -even plays against- those conventions, I often don't "get it". I was intrigued by the story line and the possibility of character development. And I really liked one of Tommy Lee Jones previous directorial efforts: "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada". So despite my reservations I went to see this. Unfortunately it didn't work _for_me_ (your mileage may vary:-). Here are some specifics:What first put me off was the wildly unrealistic portrayal of mentally ill people. Suddenly turned violent? Mute (and more generally uncommunicative)? Unable to maintain even their own bodily functioning? It felt like I was eavesdropping on the residents of Bedlam "acting crazy" in order to get bigger donations from their slumming visitors. Seeing some Indians portrayed as silly and even stupid felt like nothing more than the second punch from the same pattern. There were too many shocking and sexual scenes for no particularly good reason. It felt as though the director had been given a list of required scenes (an uncompleted hanging, a completed hanging, an unromantic sex scene, a rape, a supporting actress fully nude, the starring actress fully nude, etc.) and "checked off" each one. Some were so disconnected from events I couldn't even decide whether they were flashbacks or hallucinations. The mores felt muddled. Was this a "feminist" film or an "anti-feminist" film? Was the character Mary Bee Cuddy a stand-in for today's sensibilities, or a historical person living in a time that thought quite differently?Many characters and scenes seemed so exaggerated they were "cartoonish". The dinner visitor felt more like a stereotype than a man: falling asleep only a couple minutes into the music after his dinner ...and moreover audibly snoring? The drifter who tries to make off on horseback with one of the women was so smarmy I wanted to punch his lights out right there. The card sharps seemed overly concerned with respect/manners/propriety for where they were. And the hotel was ridiculous. In the middle of nowhere and with no obvious clients at all, yet expecting "investors"? With a table groaning under a load of pastries and other delicacies that weren't even available around there? An owner and his posse with such poor attitudes I looked for their "bad guy" badges?Character development was largely absent. In particular Mary Bee Cuddy's actions near the end seemed to come out of nowhere and be quite inconsistent with the character she previously displayed. I'm told it actually made a lot more sense in the book, as she herself changed quite a bit over the course of the journey, so that by the end things that would have seemed inexplicable initially flowed from her new character. Sure George Briggs had some second thoughts, a "what the heck, be a nice guy" and even an "I actually care" moment, but they were so predictable and stereotypical I couldn't take them seriously. I wished the production values were a bit higher. Several scenes in various open wooded places supposedly hundreds of miles apart all looked too much like they were shot in the very same small patch of woods. The "day for night" scene of Mary Bee Cuddy lost by herself on horseback was a little too obvious. And most of the costumes didn't have the expected "worn" look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Tommy Lee Jones CAN direct...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was suspicious of this movie. It didn't sound very exciting and Hillary Swank usually plays characters I do not very much enjoy. Yet she acts so well, at times it can be very difficult to not like her. Also haven't seen a lot of good movies by or with Tommy Lee Jones these past few years. Only reason I saw the movie was because I felt like watching a new Western Movie. You don't get the Clint Eastwood standoff coolness but you get to see all the bad, ugly and horrible of the frontier life, which makes a great setting for a beautiful story centered around a god fearing woman doing what she believes to be right no matter the resistance she encounters and how that kind of lifestyle doesn't go well with most of the frontier's inhabitants. It's a western roadmovie centering a lot less on the insane women than one might think. And it's good, very good. Yet ugly. I gotto agree with one other reviewer, stating that The Homesman has quite a few surprises he did not anticipate. True, very true. I didn't catch any cliché except for maybe one scene, where Tommy Lee Jones shows you shouldn't turn down a hungry frontiersman and his crazy women ;) The Homesman is no Action Movie. It's a sad story set in a pretty sad time period. If you're lucky enough, like myself, you'll find it touching at the end and feel like it wasn't just some piece of entertainment that passed the time.</fullReview>

Totally unnecessary! He just needed to get the food and go! Why the character of Hilary Swank hanged herself after begging and humble to have sex? I even thought the two could be together at the end. That would make some sense. Besides finalizing the story with dignity to people who had already suffered so much. I regretted having watched this movie.

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee takes an ego trip.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the world of Hillary Swank and can't imagine why she would have accepted a part like this. Tommy Lee just used her and the other stars appearing in cameos to enhance this immature ego trip of his. The part of Mary Bee is played beautifully by Hillary Swank and one can only wonder why any of the male characters wouldn't be knocking her door down, instead TLJ tries to convince us that these dirt poor farmers would prefer to send back East for a younger more attractive mate - they can't all be that stupid Tommy Lee. Well you probably know the premise of the film so I won't go into that but I will say that there were far too many unnecessary violent and cruel things to witness in order to establish that Tommy Lee was tougher and smarter than just about anyone else around and that everyone he faced was a two-dimensional cartoon like character with the exception of Mary Bee. How on earth do you expect an audience to believe that this amazingly wise,competent and talented rancher/farmer/homemaker/religious/moral woman would commit suicide before completing a mission she committed to? What an utter disappointment this movie was. By the way - I have never been so moved to write a review as with this dog of a movie and I feel it's because Tommy Lee Jones is one of those Hollywood stars who is so narcissistic that he's mesmerized by his own reflection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Anti-Western than Western and NOT a feel-good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two-thirds of this movie seem like a Hallmark made-for-TV movie with extremely high production values and excellent acting. We have a plain frontier woman Mary Bee Cuddy (two-time Oscar winner Hillary Swank , lonely but with enough grit and determination for 3 men, set off on a mission to take 3 demented women back east for a mission woman (three-time Oscar Winner (Meryl Streep) to reunite them with their families. This mission has been requested by the local Minister (John Lithgow) Being practical and recognizing she needs help to complete the arduous journey successfully. Through flashbacks which are repeated throughout the journey to an annoying point, we find that she had to endure insanity issues with her own mother that resulted in the mother's death and her anger at her callous father. She encounters hard-edged drifter George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) who vigilantes attempted to hang for claim jumping. She hires him and they meet various challenges along the way, each with a touch of historic reality not found in mythic westerns and each interesting. The last of these challenges comes when they encounter an unearthed corpse of a young boy exhumed by native Americans for the buffalo hide in which he was buried and left on the ground. Mary Bee, in keeping with her religious commitment that made her volunteer for the task, undertakes burying the child, then catching up with Tommy Lee Jones and the women after nightfall. She does so after awhile but at the cost of her aplomb. She returns a crying and dehydrated mess. In the course of trying to restore her, George grows close to Mary Bee and despite every trepidation involved in doing so, reluctantly but lovingly (as well as that word can be ascribed to his character) has intercourse with her. That is where this ceases to be the movie I thought I was watching. It may well be logical, realistic, and might even be based some real-life situations. But, for me, the film transformed from a crusty buddy movie /romance under hardship to something even much darker. And this is the spoiler: Mary Bee hangs herself out of grief and remorse. From hereon, it is episodic including a violent scene when George ruthlessly destroys all for a callous fop (James Spader) who denied his group water and food. This "visceral satisfaction" scene took much too long and the self-righteousness seemed out of character for George. Finally, we get to the town. Having completed his mission in a nice scene, George tries to mend his ways but is unable to be accepted, and so, he returns to his live-for-the-day roots. All in all, fascinatingly directed with some great camera work and use of locale, and unforgettably acted especially by the two leads. But I was numb and put off watching the last third of the film, hence the mixed vote of 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western drama is quite slow, but has some interesting ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones makes his directorial debut in this western drama set in the 1850s starring Hilary Swank as Mary Bee Cudy, a lonely woman in a rural Nebraska who is tasked to extort three women (played by Grace Gummer, Mirando Otto, and Sonja Richter) who have gone mentally insane, across the country on her wagon. Upon embarking on her journey, she encounters an old man named George Briggs (played by Tommy Lee Jones) battered and tied to a tree with an intent being hung. When Briggs makes a deal with Mary, she frees him and assists her along her journey across the country.There is honestly no easy to describe this film. While this film is supposed to be a drama set in the west, there are several scenes that tend to provoke laughter such as the knife fight scene between Tommy Lee Jones' character and William Fictner's character. Then there are the several comedic lines that would easily make you laugh. For a western drama, there is quite a bit of humor in this. So its a little hard to tell whether the movie is supposed to be a dark comedy, comedy-drama, or just a frequently hilarious drama. Where Tommy Lee Jones was going with the humor is way beyond me. Other than that, the characters here are deeply engrossing. Hilary Swank's character Mary Bee Cudy is a woman who is living on her own and wants a man to be with her. We learn this in the opening scene when she invites a young man over for dinner and she asks him to marry her. Later, she asks the same thing to George Briggs. The truth is that she is not really in love, but she just wants a man so she won't be alone, which is thought was quite interesting. About halfway through the film however, she does something shocking that will make you have second thoughts about her. The main problem with this film is the super slow pacing. While it manages to carry on a captivating story line, its very mono-toned and can easily lose attention of those who do not have the most patience. This movie does run for 122 minutes, but it feels much longer. On top of this, the performances were not bad. Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones both displayed some good performances. Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto, and Sonja Richter who play the three mentally insane women are very impressive in this. The actresses do a decent portrayal of women who are mentally crazy and just out-of-whack, like the women who is very aggressive and tries to bite anyone who grows near her, and the woman who is impregnated after a farmer rapes her. When she gives birth to the baby, she wants nothing to do with it and chooses an unsettling method to get rid of him/her.The Homesman may have been a better movie if it carried a more captivating atmosphere. Overall, this movie is fine, it manages to work and the performances are satisfactory, but it certainly isn't a film for everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is a spinster with good financial holdings. The plain pious woman is too "bossy" to get a husband. Arabella Sours (Grace Gummer), Theoline Belknapp (Miranda Otto) and Gro Svendsen (Sonja Richter) are wives struggling under the hardships. All have mental breakdowns. Reverend Dowd (John Lithgow) reluctantly accepts her offer to take the three women to a church in Hebron, Iowa which treats the mentally ill. George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) is a claim jumper. Cuddy saves him from a hanging as he promises to do anything for her. She takes him along on the trip.It's a bit slow and I don't really feel for the characters. Swank's character is too inexpressive and I can't root for Briggs. The movie could have the three women interact more. Theoline burying Arabella's doll is the only memorable moment for the women. I just want more to be done with all five characters interacting. After the turn/twist, the movie does get to a big climax but the movie keeps going and going. It really needs to end after the delivery. It's too long by 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally do like a good western so when I saw the cast I thought that this one would be one of the better ones but I was wrong. It's not that it is a bad movie, it's just to bland and the plot is not very believable. I mean a woman like Hilary Swank (playing Mary Bee Cuddy) that lives in the middle of nowhere, that has money on the bank, a big piece of land, animals, can cook and all other chores, she seems not to be able to marry because she's too bossy and too plain. Now if those cowboys she asked looked like Adonis then I might get it but when it's or an ugly guy or a 30 year older guy, i say please get real. In those times in the middle of nowhere with only like three women to chose from you just marry her and that's it. And when I watch a western most of the time it's to see nice scenery but in this one there isn't. If that's really Nebraska then I already know where I don't want to live because there is absolutely nothing there. But like I said, it's not that bad of a movie, just good enough to watch one time and then to forget about it.</fullReview>

The "screen writer" if there was one needs to contact me and explain. Where did she come from? How did she end up in Nebraska? Where did she get her money? What happened in her first 31 years because seriously did she awaken from coma? These people should be ashamed. Can a state sue for defamation? Who tended to her animals while she was gone? What was the ratio of men to women on the frontier? How much was $300 and why did Mary squander it? Why couldn't she get a hired hand? Sorry I digress. It's Hollywood arrogance run amuck.

A well-suited performance, for the character played by the director &amp; male lead Tommy Lee Jones - who develops a surprising change of heart over his direction in life. There are fine representations by the minor character actors especially Hailee Steinfield; but the final third of the film loses its way and appeal when the focus of the story is diverted to Tommy Lee Jones' character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jones's Directing Doesn't Stand Tall Around the Sweeping Landscapes and Hilary Swank's Feminist Lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones directs, writes, and stars in "The Homesman". His acting is spotless, but his directing and writing both struggle to stand tall around the sweeping landscapes of the west and Hilary Swank's tragic heroine. On the exterior, "The Homesman" appears to be a run-of- the-mill, formulaic western but what lies deeper in the story are unexpected twists, bizarre flares in subplots, and an unusual path the film takes during its final third.Mary Bee Cuddy is a great character, and a big, complicated one at that. Seeing a female like this on the big screen is encouraging, even if the intricate role is in such a flawed film as "The Homesman", and even if the Cuddy is not perfectly adapted by Swank, the character itself is something of a marvel.Swank's investment in the character is undeniable, she's steadfast and emotional, but something goes wrong in her expression. It's a very good performance, but an element of awkwardness is detected in the undercurrent of her work that prevents the performance from completely fulfilling the character. Though in her her final scene, Swank concludes the character with a scene of acting transcendence and leaves the project on a high note.From the images projected over the opening credits, "The Homesman" establishes its western roots as a first task on the agenda, but what is special about the film is its feminist sensibility. Cuddy's character growth is one of simplicity to confusion, the character becomes bigger and bigger as the story continues. The writing of our heroine never feels slacked, and she feels tightly placed in the screenplay.She's the boss. She rescues George Briggs from his death bed. She takes the place of a man's efforts. She risks her life for the safety of others. She's in control of the traveling group. She's able to read. She's able to create a home and life for herself without a man or a family, even though society insists its the "correct" way of living, which is the ultimate downfall of the character's depression, anxiety, and loneliness.The best aspects of "The Homesman" are found in the creative art department, in particular the musical score and set design. The rustic interior sets create the atmosphere extensively and elegantly. Marco Beltrami has always been underrated as a composer; he tries to purposefully incorporate the story into the notes, just as he does with wind in the score for "The Homesman" surrounding the characters, like Cuddy's psychological pressures at the core of the film.Most of the time, the script and directing work well enough for the film to stay afloat. The script is not easy to direct to begin with, but much of the material is so tricky that leads to the conclusion that Jones was not the most proper choice to direct this story. As a director, Jones has an eye for the framing of a shot. Many of the shots are broad and fanatical, but where he fails is setting the tone within those shots. In "The Homesman", an image appears on the screen and the mise-en-scene takes your breath away. Then action takes place, the dialogue is spoken, or the score is heard and the conception is caked with a gross feeling of corniness.Grade: B-</fullReview>

But I was so wrong, this movie is great - filled with lots of plots twists. Movies made from books are not always great, you expect one thing but get another - this movie brought the book to life - sure their are a few variances but the feeling you have while reading and the same feelings you have as you watch - Tommy Lee Jones did a great job directing this! There were a couple leading men who could have played Briggs, his roll is important but generic, but Hilary Swank was the best option for Cuddy I could not see any other woman pulling it off - she played the part as if she walked off the pages of Swarthout's novel and on to the screen. Even though I knew what was going to happen I wanted it not to, it would have been OK if they had played it out differently for me, but they stayed true and that was good too. Why a 9 and not a 10 because clearly I enjoyed this movie (and the book) - I felt as good as Jones directed it, at times he lacked the right emotion - when he buried Cuddy there should have been 'more' emotion - not love, no he did not love her, but he should have had guilt, maybe remorse that their union had caused such devastation... when he remarked about her with the young girl at the end there should have been more depth... he directed everyone well but himself... and the best part was after they denied him at the hotel and he goes back - we all cheered! They got what they had coming! I tried not to spoil it too much for anyone - you still need to watch it - then read the book by Glendon Swarthout and see how close they compare : )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that this movie was not going to be an historical document and tried to view it for it's entertainment values. I was more than disappointed, people are still people wherever they live and from whichever quarter of the world they hail from and these were just not human reactions to any of the situations that they were placed in. I won't put in any spoilers but I kept finding myself asking how everyone was so clean and their clothes neatly ironed. I'm from the UK and I know that it was tough for settlers but - hey - times were tough everywhere however people are still people and most react in a human way. I think the movie lost direction early on and really didn't know where it was going. Sorry for the bad review as I am an avid moviegoer and enjoy most things that I watch but this is just too silly for words</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>548th Review: Sparse and Terse with Plenty to Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Homesman is a terrific film. It captures that very meaning of mean winter and is sparse and terse. The story of three woman driven mad who must be taken back across the Ohio is told in a straightforward manner, and Tommy Lee Jones does an excellent job as director and co-star. This is very much a women's film - and a Western that focuses on their story is welcome - especially as it sees life as anything but rosy.This strong, unique treatment of the Western owes much to Eastwood's style, but has a voice of its own.This for this reviewer is one of the major films of 2014 - it has real lingering power and powerful performances, coupled to a real sense of film (the sound is superbly empty). All in all one of the better films of 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous visuals, unfocused story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!I was so exited about going to see The Homesman, expecting a moving movie, depicting the old west in a way that hasn't quite been done before: mixing the beauty of the scenery with the true horrors of the time, all with such brilliant craftsmanship that it leaves you with a sense of wonder about humanity and a deep bond with the characters. That was not the film I saw.The Homesman does indeed have gorgeous visuals throughout, however, story wise something was definitely missing. To tell the truth, I'm unsure what the film was about.Was Tommy Lee Jones painting the story of Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank), an independent woman, a Nebraskan pioneer living "uncommonly alone" in search for her rightful place in this Men's world? Or of George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) the marginal soldier of fortune, neither a good or a bad man but simply a human being living with his tormenting inner conflicts? Or the story of three mistreated women driven to insanity by the loss of their children and the repetitive physical and sexual abuse of their husbands?All of these are very interesting intrigues yet the movie fails to develop any of them. We are constantly held at a distance from the characters, they never seem to truly connect to one another or with the audience.Like my review? More like this at http://www.rebekahfieschi.com/movie-reviews/At the peak of her character's curve, we lose Miss Cuddy which leaves us with a lingering feeling of un-fulfillment, but also strangely allows George Briggs to let us breach in, the audience gets to feel connected to him for a short while but only on the surface since the movie quickly comes to an end. As for the three insane woman, they are only used as a medium in this odd story. We sit through shocking images explaining why they have lost their minds, it is implicit that their suffering is caused mainly by men so nobody will care to look for the reason of it in this society ruled by them, but they don't evolve, they stay stuck in the movie as luggage, the same way the camera stays stuck on the shore for the last shot, and George Briggs drifts away dancing. Maybe that's what it was about, the inability of women in the old west to choose their own paths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but undermined by a major flaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to admire about The Homesman: the Mid-West setting; the historical accuracy regarding a period seldom touched on (i.e. just before most westerns are set); Hilary Swank's performance; and the questions raised about frontier society etc. But there is one massive flaw that undermines all the good stuff. Swank's character, Cuddy, is carefully constructed. She is resourceful, courageous, independent, tough, humane and strong. So how come she commits suicide, with no build-up or hint in her character that she is capable of doing such a thing, especially with her mission still incomplete? It's just a glaring inconsistency. The film never recovers from it, dissolving into a mess of Tommy Lee Jones capers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of good actors and what could have be an uplifting movie. I if seeing how hard, tough and pointless life is, get on a plane to some third world country and pull up a chair. Hillary Swanks character would have seen it through . Did she kill herself because sex wasn't as good as she thought or because she felt ashamed to have gone so low as to give herself to an old sot . If the sex part was her wanting to die not a virgin as she had made up her mind to commit suicide it just doesn't ring true. The suicide bit I mean. Tommy Lee Jones certainly couldn't be accused of overacting, was he actually alive! I'm so disappointed I like to watch movies to be entertained, intrigued, laugh, get inspired, get me thinking, cry or be in suspense. Not watch a very talented bunch of Actors try not to show any animation while speaking in monotones. Reminds me of that terrific movie Million dollar Baby a very inspiring story with a terrible ending Hillary Swank dies in that one too for what reason ? both films would have been better if the character lived and we the viewer had some closure. I think these Directors do this sort of thing because they want to be seen as different. I came away from this film with no feelings whatever about the story or the people in it except it was as entertaining as watching paint dry or looking at the inside of my eyelids</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Miss Cuddy. I appreciate the offer, the supper, the concert and all. But I cannot marry you, will not, won't. I ain't perfect but you are too bossy and too damn plain." Bob Giffin (Evan Jones) That piece of dialogue spoken to a decidedly attractive Hilary Swank as Mary Bee Cuddy (she can try to be plain, but that's not possible), from the intense and interesting The Homesman, captures the plight of women who moved West in the 19th century: If they can survive, prosperity will be minimal or elusive; if they are plain and independent, then they will be alone as her Mary Bee Cuddy is.The overall theme of the difficulties moving west is movingly depicted in writer/director Tommy Lee Jones's film, which depicts Cuddy and seedy George Briggs (Jones) transporting three women who have lost their minds from the Nebraska Territory back East to a parsonage that can help them. In a way, it's reverse Westward Ho and feminism, a testimony to the challenges women have always encountered, from infant deaths to abusive husbands and dim-witted single men (see the introductory quote).As if to emphasize the thematic frustrations, Cuddy asks two men to marry her, both unworthy, and they both refuse (see quote). Heck, the same accomplished woman would have similar problems with men today who still see female ambition a danger. Jones has made that bridge to today a convincingly difficult journey?two steps forward, one step back.Jones as actor is still hypnotically gruff and tough, a role he does better than any other actor I can think of. He played a younger rebellious ruffian in an adaptation of a Faulkner short story, Barn Burning, decades ago, and he is just as convincingly recalcitrant as an old man. When he and Swank face off, there is no doubt we are watching Oscar winners.The Homesman is as slow sometimes as the wagon transporting the women. The dialogue is spare because Jones lets the barren Nebraska Territory do the talking about hardship. Although Briggs comes alive and likable when he encounters some sybarites (including an unlikable James Spader) in a hotel east of nowhere, he is as always gruff on the outside with a warm interior well hidden until it is needed later on.The set design is curiously antiseptic with authentic Victorian houses and primitive dirt homes, yet all clean as if kept by Shakers. However, it is a film about the passage of women, so their civilizing influence will be present but not as much as you might expect. It's still rough out there whether the women are competent or crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a 31 year old single woman who dislikes her life in the countryside as a pioneer. She takes the job to escort three mentally ill women to go to another state to seek help from a pastor."The Homesman" gets to the point right in the beginning of the film, and we are shown with key plot ideas. As Hilary Swank's strong willed character starts her journey to the east, she faces many different challenges - yet this travel across the inhospitable wilderness does not appear terribly exciting.The ending is a surprise. I would not have guessed it, but in retrospect it all makes sense. I do sympathise with her, as her experience is probably a very common problem both back in those days and in modern times. It provokes much thoughts in both George and in me. I enjoyed watching "The Homesman", mainly because of the very good ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS. The absolute worst representation of women possible!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My blood boiled at the complete misrepresentation of women throughout this film. We saw a woman, portrayed by Swank, who is rejected by men for being too bossy and too plain take on a 'man's' job of transporting three mad women home and I thought; 'okay this film might be okay', BUT then she desperately needs the help of some man. Further, she continues to flail around without the help of said man, proceeds to throw herself at him and he has sex with her presumably out of pity and then she commits suicide. This nicely shifts from the heroic role which we falsely were lead to believe might actually be Swank to none other than Jones himself. And we get the typical character development where he transitions from being a self absorbed criminal to a NICE GUY, who is the of course the ONLY man not to take advantage of these poor poor women. This film shows that according to Jones any women who under goes any hardships whether it be her children dying, rape or rejection will start to have suicidal tendencies or go mad. In conclusion, the director who puts himself in the heroic role kills the almost heroic female character because she can't handle rejection should be UTTERLY ASHAMED. This is by far the worst representation of women in a film which is 'all about women' that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film last night with two friends. I was the only one who watched to the end. How anyone could read this script and even consider the content as " entertainment" is beyond me and to make it into a film beggars belief. I don't do reviews of films but I felt this one was so bad I had to register a warning. I was totally surprised that it has a rating of 6.6 and I read a review from some ejit who thought the characters and performances were first class. The story line is feeble and preposterous, the script is stilted,clumsy and awkward. I have to say the photography and scenery was convincing that Nebraska in the 1850's was a hellish place to be. This film certainly wasn't produced to promote tourism. Meryl Streep gets five minutes but will forget this part instantly. Some films you stick with thinking it must get better, these actors have made some decent films but in my opinion this film deteriorates with time and finishes with an absolutely ludicrous ending. This film has been compared favourably by some reviewers with Clint Eastwood's film, Unforgiven. NEVER in a million years. I am always wary when and an "actor" feels he can star, direct and help out the author at the same time. Sometimes it works; this was just embarrassing. 2/10 I am not sure it deserves 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Female version of a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You are a poor specimen of a man, Vester Belknap!"I want to begin with a few positive critiques of Tommy Lee Jones's latest film, which happens to be his fourth behind the director's chair (he also stars in all these films as well). The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada was his only film released in theaters prior to this one since his other two films were made for TV. In The Homesman he returns to the Western genre, although it is very different. Instead of focusing on the macho cowboys we've seen perfectly represented by Clint Eastwood and John Ford, in this film we get the female's point of view. The lead character is a singe woman who has battled the harsh conditions of the western wastelands on her own. This isn't one of those macho western films, it is slow and tedious, focusing on the tension the women had to face in this period. In that sense, The Homesman is a fresh and original film. It also captures the harsh conditions of the wasteland extremely well. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous and perhaps the main reason why I kept engaged with the film despite the tedious script. There are also plenty of surprises along the way and interesting twists that I didn't see coming. The film definitely breaks several genre conventions and delivers something fresh, but it was just too bleak and grim for my liking. I had a difficult time staying awake and found myself dozing off in several occasions, but there are some great scenes along the way that brought me back in to the story. This is more of a western drama, but there are a couple action scenes that worked extremely well. Ultimately, there is a lot of interesting things that Tommy Lee Jones is doing here, but I just felt the tonal shifts and the melancholic setting were a bit too depressing for me. The screenplay for The Homesman was adapted by Tommy Lee Jones, Kieran Fitzgerald, and Wesley A. Oliver from Glendon Swarthout's 1988 novel. The story isn't actually as interesting as the scenery and performances in this film. There are several tonal shifts and at times the film felt unbalanced. There were some funny scenes that worked well along with the action scenes, but other narrative elements didn't resonate with me. This isn't one of those films you will enjoy, but fans of the Western genre might appreciate this unique film. The Homesman is also elevated by the strong performances from Hillary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones. The two have an interesting chemistry and they deliver solid roles. Their characters are as sombre and grim as the scenery, but they still manage to feel authentic and believable. They take us to this period and remind us it wasn't all about cowboys and indians. The emotional element is also present and they are perfectly captured by Jones's low life drifter and Swank's hard working independent and honest character. The supporting cast is also exceptional, including Meryl Streep, Hailee Steinfeld, John Lithgow, and James Spader, but none of their characters were given much screen time. Overall I had a difficult time staying awake because the narrative is tedious, but there are some positive elements about The Homesman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The talent is there, Jones, Swank, Spader, Streep, but the movie turns on Swank's character (Cuddy) decision to do something so startling that you simply can't believe it actually happened. As an actress, she brings such depth to this character, such compassion and faith. So seeing her character choose a path that suggests she is more a woman of the flesh, than a woman of God, breaks credibility. As a director, Jones, in no way prepares his audience for this, and we are as lost as his character, Briggs. The movie, which was Cuddy's story until then, pretty much stops, and with no where to go, the last hour is a poor set up for a clichéd ending. Any talk of this film being just a sad, non-redeeming, noir expose, is just trying to put some lipstick on this pig.And, no, even Clint Eastwood couldn't save this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So uncomfortable to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-The Homesman is a period piece set during American Western-Expansion. It follows a woman who is tasked with taking three other women, who went literally crazy, to a care-house in the east that offered to care for them. Along the way she meets Tommy-Lee Jones, currently hanging for some crime, who she frees in exchange for his services as their protector, or homesman.-I was hoping this would be a decent film held back by its setting and story, like The Immigrant, but even though that was true, I still really did not like this film. I'm going to try something new with this and list some things that I did like first though! -The Positives: -I liked the music.-It had some very good acting in it all throughout.-It has some authentic visual appeal in its costumes, makeup, and art direction.-Now some negatives: -It features some pretty unlikable characters who all have equally unlikable character changes at one point.-Its story feels real, but it not compelling.-It is pretty slow.-It has a bunch of scenes that are uncomfortable to watch. I don't want to spoil anything, but some of them were just completely unnecessary.-The editing was a mess. Some of the most confusing editing since 47 Ronin.-Content: It is rated-R. It has a PG-13 amount of language and violence. It has some non-explicit sexual content. (also PG-13 level) It also has a scene of partial nudity (thus the R) which was A. Unnecessary but also B. only because it's a crazy lady.-So The Homesman is well made and has some good acting! Which does not make up for its unlikable and changing characters, slow pace, and hard-to-watch scenes. Yeah it's not worth seeing. I am going to give it a 6/10 because it was not terrible, but I really did NOT enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The atmosphere of the Homesman is similar in stark realism to Unforgiven with beautiful cinematography that catches the eye and transports you to the 19th Century Great Plains.Hillary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones, who also helped write the script, turn in their usual standout high caliber performances. Perhaps writing as well as acting was too much for Jones.The problem with the story is it betrays itself leaving you mired in depression. Swank, the stalwart old maid heroine is too tough and too dedicated to throw the towel in before she gets her holy job done as a sacred trust.The final downer comes at the very end of the film when Jones loses the grave stone he was taking back to mark a burial place he seemed honor bound to do. So both protagonists fail in something they feel they must do. I just couldn't buy it. But it was an interesting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!Started off well, then the central focus of the film shifted and it lost me. If, in telling an authentic western, the director has to make the story meander a little? OK. But to lose it's way and end up making an egotistical, self satisfying, self indulgent eulogy to himself? If this is what it takes? then, this director has made a classic of the western genre. ( If Mr.Eastwood can do it? then why can't Mr.Jones? )The films 'hanging the protagonist' at the half way point, and continuing the film? essentially and implicitly 'for and about' Mr.Jones - leaves you perplexed and disappointed in Mr.Jones decision making. Possibly it worked in the novel. But the way it's portrayed on film, it just seems odd?Was Mr.Jones relishing the movie goers tears, at the sudden loss of Ms.Swanks character? Was her death, supposed to be the sound of Oscar's clinking in his ears?To centre so strongly on her, before killing her off. It just didn't fit the tale being spun. Made the rest of the movie uneven and strangely off kilter from then onwards. The sudden focus on Mr.Jones ( near characterless up to that moment ) felt ill fitting and credulous.Suddenly on his own, we are shown the 'redemption' scene? where Mr.Jones and his chaperon's aren't allowed food and rest. How he deals with that... is indicative of the movie's problems. Why was that scene there? ?and why did the heroine hang herself? Where did that come from? Why did three women in such a small town all lose their sanity - at the same time? Everything within the story, felt fabricated and fanciful. The script should probably have been about her, her journey and completing it. Without her, the film seems misogynistic. All the female characters that we see for ninety percent of the movie? irrevocably lose their sanity? The outward signs of the 'madness' of each of the women? was cinematically vivid and startlingly detailed. But what was the point to it? That the 'old west' was harsh on women? ?but fine for men, as long as they're unfeeling simpletons?Leaving the story chopped in two, killing off the heroine and making Mr.Jones? a little cinematic swan song. Didn't work for me and ruined? what was potentially an interesting production up to that point. No wonder Hollywood wouldn't back this films making? and Luc Bessons ( ill-advised ) French company stepped in to fund it. It's not all bad, but as a whole? it falls apart and should never have been made. Possibly a more experienced director, and not so egotistical... would have known this?</fullReview>

The Homesman doesn't feel that it's quite enough to tell you how it tough it was for women, it instead beats you over the head with the message for two long hours.When Hilary Swank isn't proving that women are as good as men by taking matters into her own hands, the viewer is subjected to mentally ill women screaming, biting and kicking each other in the face after their respective breakdowns.Since this has been lauded as 'progressive' by the critics, and that word seems to hold more sway than whether the film is actually any good or not, I expect more miserable feminist revisionist Westerns to come.

I think this is her fourth or fifth film where she perishes. Let's put her in a nice comedy? Anyway, the film is quite bleak about people who are 'out of it'.

I had similar complaints with this film as Jones' directorial debut The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, in that both stories did not seem to come together well as a unified whole and felt like I was watching a bunch of scenes patched together. Also, the characters actions were sometimes confusing, especially Cuddy's suicide, which was not inconsistent with her character but was still a head scratcher.

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It's honest and different. It closely follows the book too, so kudos to that Mr. Jones.Swank gives a great performance, she is perfect in her role.Jones steals the show, I couldn't get enough of his character. Briggs is very real and believable character, unlike most western leading men who are glorified and over the top manly. He is hardened from life out west but still set in reality, and very FUNNY.It isn't just a regular old western, it takes bold turns and the dialogue was great. Spoilers!It paints a dark picture of life on the frontier, some people didn't like the shots of the baby being thrown down the outhouse but I thought it was great, served a good purpose of showing how hard life was for them and gives insight into why the mother lost her mind. I see a lot of people hating on Cuddy hanging her self a little more than halfway into the movie and I can see why you may think it's a bad move but it was necessary and did great things for the story, here is why;1. It's following the book! 2. It is needed to give Briggs the chance to arc in his character, which he doesIf you have bones to pick with the story you can take it up with the author of the book not Jones. That being said the only problems I had with the story are the wasted opportunities in the crazy women, they could have been explored much better and utilized more, I didn't much care for any of their acting performances either, but that's not the actress's faults I don't think. They were given flat nothing characters who can't talk and just stare into space the whole movie. This would have been the only thing I changed about the film.Aside from the crazy women being under utilized and under performed the only other thing I would do is ask what the tombstone getting tossed over board was supposed to mean/do for the audience. To me it was just to get an "ohhhh nooo!" out of the reader/viewer right at the end, maybe to avoid a cliché happy ending because the old west frontier didn't have many of themOverall it was a GREAT movie, Thank you Tommy Lee Jones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good movie. I liked it very much. But I gave it a very medium rate for 2 reasons: 1 - Only Clint Eastwood made me sit for two hours to watch Hillary Swank die - and he's still not forgiven for it; 2 - That ending didn't make sense to me - maybe they were trying to portray how insane the West was there and then, and how it affected people, but it didn't really show, and for me, the ending is just very awkward. It was a nice flick. Intense. I fell for the characters, even though I wish the crazy women had more to do on screen. They had powerful stories to be explored. I wish Gro would tell, or someone would notice what happened. I wish Arabelle would start speaking at the doll, and Theoline would just snap out of it. The glimpses we had at their lives made me feel the ordeals they were put through and understand that the so-called madness was something else entirely. The movie made me shiver when it showed that shadow upon Mary Bee (and then she died). But along came the ending, and that awkwardness spoiled everything.It's like they didn't quite know what to do with the story once Briggs' mission was over, and... That happened. I actually recommend stopping the movie once Meryl Streep says goodbye. From this point on, things get weird to the point of almost changing your opinions on what you just saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilly classical western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen Tommy Lee Jones previous directorial effort, The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada, and seen many notices from the films run at Cannes labelling it "weird", I really didn't know what to expect from The Homesman. The film is a slow burning tale of Hilary Swank's frontierswoman and Jones' claim jumper as they escort 3 insane women across country. The story telling is in no rush, and often dawdles along very long scenes. The music, and the beautiful photography, elegant in composition and rich in colour, do a lot to build an authentic sense of atmosphere. Unfortunately, they also lend the film a chilly, slightly detached feel. I never felt empathetic enough with the characters to be as swept up in their journey as I should, they are frequently annoying and I found my patience wearing thin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exceptional Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drawing a pistol in twinkling of an eye, a hole in the center of forehead or a bullet made ventilation system through the chest of enemy, lots of gunfire or gunman show. Yes, I'm talking about an western movie. This one is an western too but not the ordinary one.Story is very simple. During the period of colonial settlement of US in 17th century, the effect of harsh settlement in unknown rude lands and unhealthy lifestyle made people mentally disordered. Responsibility of transporting of such mad three ladies from Nebraska to far east Iowa for treatment has imposed on Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) by incidents, who's bachelor but pious, open-minded but bossy. For this, Mary has to travel long rude prairie in winter where she may be attacked by bandits or Indians. Incidentally, she got a partner George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) who's a low-life drifter. Have they completed their mission successfully? To get the answer, you have to watch the movie till the end.The main appeal of this movie is surely the acting of main two characters Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones. Whether directing the movie by Tommy himself is also remarkable . And another important thing of this movie is its visual appeal. Filming the rude prairie was so stunning and awesome.FYI: One can get any kind of feeling after watching, may be one can enjoy much or so so or may be boring? But I enjoyed it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess! One of the year's biggest disappointments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miss Cuddy. I appreciate the offer, the supper the concert and all. But i cannot marry you, will not, wont. I ain't perfect but you are too bossy and too damn plain" -Bob GiffinThe Cannes film festival lineup is presented and among the pictures that will be running for the big prize, the Palm d'Or, is Tommy Lee Jones new feature in the director's chair and between the cast too. The early buzz was good and talk of potential Oscar power seemed eminent. The fact is that the film premiered without much of a splash, the reviews were mixed and it was taken as a kind of disappointing second effort. Still, I was hopeful and interested on checking this one out, had low expectations, was just hoping it would be worth the watch.The Homesman is Directed by Tommy Lee Jones and it stars Hilary Swank, Tommy Lee Jones, Grace Gummer, Meryl Streep, Miranda Otto, Tim Blake Nelson, Hailee Steinfeld, Sonja Richter, William Fichtner and James Spader. "When three women living on the edge of the American frontier are driven mad by harsh pioneer life, the task of saving them falls to the pious, independent-minded Mary Bee Cuddy. Transporting the women by covered wagon to Iowa, she soon realizes just how daunting the journey will be, and employs a low-life drifter, George Briggs to join her. The unlikely pair and the three women head east, where a waiting minister and his wife have offered to take the women in. But the group first must traverse the harsh Nebraska Territories marked by stark beauty, psychological peril and constant threat."One such as myself looks at the intriguing premise, looks at the amazingly talented cast and looks at an already proved to be talented director and thinks: "How much can it really go wrong, when you have all the pieces?". The answer to that question is: "A lot". Cannes had already put my expectations down, since at first the picture ranked among the most anticipated of the year. But nothing could really prepare me to such a low figure. This isn't just disappointing, this plain simply ranks among the worst films I have seen all year. A total misfire if I may say so. This is really sad, since there are tons of a talented people in the picture.The picture never ignites. It never launches. Even though we are supposed to follow a really exciting, tricky journey through the dangerous west, we never really get to see any of that excitement. Instead we are locked up with five crazy people through a painfully long and dull ride through the old west.It's hard to like a film where the characters are so unsympathetic and unrelatable. First of all we don't care for the purpose of the mission. Jones gives the three woman some generic flashbacks, that show a glimpse of the difficulties of what they've been through and that is it. So the first mistake is already been made since we never care for the purpose of this "mission". The lead characters don't get much more depth asides from the one note background. We know little about them, the dialogue between them is almost non-existent and when it's there, it's boring and their actions are more stupid than the ones the mental woman do. Bottom line: We end up being bored with a journey that either lacks the excitement and thrills it promises, and the interesting characters that are switched with empty vexatious ones.It's sure is a long ride too. This felt like The Lord of the Rings both in length and in the fact that it has several endings. After Swan's character is gone the film was over for me. Even though I cared little for her, it was her character with whom I felt more close to. The film tries to explore her a bit, without much effect but we do get a sense of her struggle with loneliness and lack of love which made her a cold woman. After her disappearance from the screen, things get excruciatingly dull as we now follow for more half an hour, Jones' character through a journey I had already jumped off a long time ago.It's a real shame to see that so many great actors are simply thrown away. What a talented cast this is and yet most of it is wasted on small cardboard characters. It's hard to believe that from such an enormous cast, not one performance would stand out and yet that is what happens. Jones' and Swank are the best of the bunch, they are the only ones who have enough material to make a performance out of it.The Homesman is a true mess. And I got to say that much of the fault has to be put in Jones' shoulder. He both directed and wrote the screenplay. The screenplay is very weak and the direction feels misguided. Boredom installs soon as I found hard to care for any of the character, plus the fact that it never becomes engaging or even comes close to being intriguing and entertaining. Just a bad movie that could not be saved by arresting visuals and two average but well intentioned lead performances.Rating: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's not altogether fun. i think most who have seen it would agree...but i think it's a masterful piece of storytelling. and kudos to tommy lee jones for not giving in an inch to clichés...there was so much that surprised me in this film...the reactions that i always try to guess before they happen...the lines that come out of the actors mouths... sure i guessed SOME of the times in this film...but i'm not usually as surprised by dialogue/character choices as i was here... it made it all so much more realistic for me, rather than watching characters who are mouthing lines of people who've seen too many bad movies and not met or done enough interesting people or things, respectively... there was one major turn in the plot towards the end that was unexpected. but in a way that i felt was also, given what we'd seen of this character already, not really in line with who they seemed to be... i know it was based on a book. and all that's in a book can rarely be shown in a two hour film...so i'm thinking that whatever changes this character had to go through to get from 'point A to point B' might have been left out. Otherwise it didn't really make much sense/needed to make MORE sense than it did...at least for me...i, of course, don't want to be more specific b/c then it would surely be a spoiler. i don't know what reviewer could ever think that i would want to know an important piece of information before i've seen a film... the film was beautiful to look at...the acting was extremely good. i expect Oscar nominations for swank and jones. maybe also director AND , depending on the field, maybe best picture. let's call it a dark horse... ;-)since i know a lot of people who read these might not get around to reading a lot of the comments made by, let's say, the director, i'd like to leave you all with these words from tommy lee jones: (on how he learned to direct) I've worked with more than 50 directors and I've paid attention since day one. That's pretty much been my education, apart from studying art history and shooting with my own cameras. I've seen 50 different sets of mistakes and 50 different ways of achieving. You just leave the bad part out.i wasn't crazy about another of jones's movies--the three burials-- but this one does what he says above to the frame...if i did just one thing in my life of this quality i'd feel it was a life worth having lived... you DO know what's happenin...DON'T you, mr jones?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I have always disliked about certain movies are the ones with no ending that just fade to black. I guess you could say I'm a traditionalist in that I like a beginning, a middle and a decent ending that gives some insight into what my spending 2 hours with the flick was all about. The Homesman was essentially a throwback to old time westerns but lacked a coherent reason for the movie being made in the first place. It was more like a documentary rather than an entertaining movie in that it accurately portrayed the hardships of the old West but didn't have any uplifting message within it to make it seem worthwhile. First of all there were quite a few holes in the plot, one of which was the fact that a pioneer woman was willing to leave her farm without having anyone to look after it when she left. Considering that her entire world was her homestead it didn't make any sense that Hillary Swank's character would just up and leave without making more preparations for the stock to be fed and the place to be watched. Secondly, there was never any valid reason given for Swank's character to hang herself a little over half way into the movie. Additionally, the end of the movie was a complete letdown. Don't let the list of A-list actors fool you, this turkey stinks. StocktonRob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced? maybe,.. but worth your time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This cast speaks for itself, but a great cast doesn't guarantee a great film, we know this. For me, the pace of the film was just right due to the nature of the plot and the distance they had to travel and the transport they had. The film needed to be slow paced to give the viewer an idea of the enormity of what laid ahead of them. Swank and Jones were chalk and cheese which is not an uncommon trait with the protagonists, as this adds to the character building and the relationship you, as the viewer, has when watching their relationship develop and blossom. Some scenes may of been a little vulgar or unnecessary, but it all added to the realism of living in that particular time and again, added to the feel of the film which was at times, dark and moody, but also had aspects of endearment, passion and showing the good in humankind. The twist you have two thirds of the way through the film was excellent and left you wondering why?? Although their were small snippets of the film i didn't care for and didn't think were necessary, it was 2 hours of my life well spent and compelled me enough to write a review, so it must of worth it!!</fullReview>

Mary Bee&nbsp; is a beautiful person which is made so beautiful by the outstanding performance of Hillary Swank. The cinematography and the music are excellent. It is not a film that will please everyone, specially because it has a lot of sadness.

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones is the best thing on screen, especially after the end of the 2nd act, however before that the film is seriously lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest issue with this film is that it came out after the remake of "True Grit" which was a more fulfilling story overall. The performance by Hilary Swank was quite good, generic Swank performance really, I do not think she will receive many award nominations from this film. Tommy Lee Jones does not provide a powerhouse performance when he first comes into the film, he's more a subtle version of Jeff Bridges from "True Grit" until a certain event near the end of the 2nd act. After the event aforementioned, Tommy Lee Jones truly gives a Powerhouse performance worthy of an Oscar, the only issue is the other actors seemingly let down the director in making this a solidified meaningful movie. There are some cameos which fit in perfect, actors giving believable performances, mainly James Spader. Meryl Streep felt like an unnecessary addition to a stacked cast, overall the ending felt unsatisfying.This movie truly seems to try and be a companion piece to "True Grit" to the point of having Hailee Steinfeld whose character might as well have been called Mattie Ross.</fullReview>

Oh sure, he's basically sleepwalking through it because he can do this sort of role in his sleep, but he's still quite effective. Hilary Swank borders on terrible, not finding the right balance between comedy and drama, often over-the-top and very hammy. It's sort of a funny performance and an insufferable character, and if that was the intention, maybe she succeeded? Yeah, I don't really recommend this, everyone off set seemed to have been phoning it in. Certainly not as good as it could, or should, have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a surprising film. Reading the synopsis i thought it would be a snoozer. Watched the movie regardless. No CGI, at least that i could tell. Not a romanticized or politically corrected life of the pioneers. No little house to be seen in this prairie. Mores of the times and the juxtaposition of women kind during this time in history. The helpless married women develop mental health issues, where the men cannot take care of them. The strong willed, intelligent woman, fiercely independent not because she choose to be, but because she cannot find a husband. If Ms Cuddy was here in the 2000's, would she have a difficult time finding a suitable groom or she wouldn't give a care or would she be sad . By all means she is in fact a woman of the modern era, except she was way before her time. Unfortunately, her voice would not be heard holding a placard, parading down a empty mud road. Basically this film is about the will to live and the will to not live. People worked not to eat but to survive. Same scenario should we find ourselves without electricity. Lining up for hours for a fashion statement, like riding lost in a circle almost starving to death. One is a narcissistic passion, the other is plain hunger. People who criticize the point of making this film haven't really read literature or watch movies from the 30 to the 50's. Most of those movie and literature during that period is about the human condition. Dorian Grey, Vertigo, lord jim, citizen kane, the grapes of wrath, the godfather all ....told stories, not of plots, professions and geography but of the lives of the characters. I was also surprised by The Two faces of January much in the same line. Good story, acting and direction make a movie into a film that surpasses the obvious. Tommy Lee and the actors in this film did just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a great deal of difficulty in starring and directing a film simultaneously, and its mostly taken for granted when watching masters like Clint Eastwood do it (a man who can go home with Oscar nominations for both). Jones has found a fairly good talent for directing, but his acting performance here is absolutely pathetic. George Briggs has no depth, no motivation and he goes from snivelling and pathetic to bluntly stand-offish to emotionally invested with nothing to explain it. Jones' performance steers even more attention to the gaping holes in the plot, the countless unnecessary scenes and the dryness that the overall film portrays. However, The Homesman is not all bad. The film looks beautiful - reminiscent of other (far superior) films like There Will Be Blood. Hilary Swank gives another sensational performance in a role that no other actress could pull off. There are some wonderfully colourful acting performances and the film's score fits the story perfectly. There are half a dozen scenes that equate to some of the best film I've ever seen, every one thanks to Swank. But for every delightful scene, there are two that are barely adequate.</fullReview>
