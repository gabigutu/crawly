		<shortDescription>Hearing a harsh critique of SeaWorld only seems right coming from the people it meant the most to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt Blackfish is one of the most horrific theatre experiences you'll have this year. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite presents a very carefully constructed case on the effects of inhumane treatment of Orcas in captivity. The one-sided argument is that the untimely human deaths caused by captive Orcas were not their fault but rather the fault of their captors; SeaWorld, and the evidence proving this point is so disturbing and so shockingly obvious that it's no wonder SeaWorld refused to be interviewed.The story centers on Tilikum, a 12,000 lbs. Orca that is directly responsible for the death of 3 people, including Dawn Brancheau the former senior trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando. The film explores the reasoning behind the likely "psychosis" Tilikum has experienced in captivity, and the disgusting cover up executives have tried to make.While SeaWorld naturally refused to be interviewed, the films perspective mostly derives from former trainers/employees of SeaWorld and other various experts. Their experience working with Orcas - most having dedicated their lives to it - is truly heart breaking. Presenting the theory, the evidence and finally a solution to the topic at hand, Blackfish is a marvellous story that will have you as tearful as the trainers that sincerely care for the well being of the creatures.Blackfish doesn't just show a bunch of disgruntled former employees bashing SeaWorld either. The greatest technique employed in this film is its use of footage from shows featuring these trainers when they were younger. There's something so mesmerizing about watching the smiling young trainers play with their best friend while hearing their older self reminisce in voice over. Hearing a harsh critique of SeaWorld only seems right coming from the people it meant the most to.While we've always known Orca's are intelligent creatures Cowperthwaite dedicates a lot of the film to demonstrating their capacity for emotions as well; watching them over time build connections with their trainers and each other. So by the time they show us their capture and captivity and witness the pain felt the whales, Tilikum especially, we know that their violent behavior is a direct result of SeaWorld. Killer Whales having never harmed a human in the wild.I want to go through every point made by the movie but I won't. You need to see this for yourselves. The facts aren't what drive this film, the emotion behind them do. This is one of those movies you just won't stop talking about, and for the subject matter that's the best compliment it can receive. In the end sharing this information is what's going to help these Orcas.Between the gripping footage and the distressing stories Blackfish effectively proves its point. There are very few movies like this; a must-see. There is no way after seeing this movie that you'll ever want to go to SeaWorld again, and for the sake of the animals that's the only thing we can do for them. Since it's made quite clear; the only thing affecting their decision-making is: how many Shamu dolls and tickets they've sold.Our Rating:10/10Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of Blackfish!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The human inhumanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's go to the theme park to see the Orcas. Playful, interacting with their trainers who swim with them carefree it is a guaranteed spectacle and fun time.Do we ever consider, that these intelligent creatures spent a lifetime enclosed in a large bathtub so that we can be entertained? Imagine going to see a show of children ballerinas knowing that those children spent their entire lives locked up in a room when not performing. Would anyone stand for this? Surely not, I would hope.This riveting and didactic documentary explores the owner's attitudes when occasionally those animals flip out and act in an aggressive way. It is always the trainers fault, or the bad manners of the animals. In fact, it appears that those who run those theme parks have gone out of their way to hide the truth which is those who work with killer whales are in great risk.The death of a long-time and renowned trainer brought the issue to the surface where enquiries had to be made.We might be better informed about the risks involved but the rather lax legislature regarding animal rights allows these companies to still operate and oppress animals in an inhuman way.Well made and runs high on emotion, it will make the viewer contemplate on the scale of human tyrannism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this documentary at the Sundance film festival London. I travelled down from Manchester as i could not wait for the Uk cinema release. After Seeing The Cove in 2009 after swimming with Captive Dolphins myself in 2006 to get over a family bereavement x 2. I never knew what dolphins did in captivity - just that it was one of the things i wanted to do before i die. After seeing them entertain people again &amp; again, eat dead fish &amp; float in a small tank all day i needed to see the pain Orcas go through. I'm glad Blackfish has been made. YOU need to see this film if you love mammals &amp; any other intelligent animal in captivity...My eyes were opened at The Cove....if this doesn't then you are very selfish....Money is defo the Rule of all Evil. I will be taking all my friends &amp; family to see this. After 5 days I am still thinking about it &amp; can't believe these parks are still open :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Moves With Fluidity of Wild Orca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary "Blackfish" just premiered at Sundance to much deserved rave reviews. It's a compelling story of a 12,000 pound orca who has been in captivity since 1983 when he was captured at the age of two. New footage and interviews with trainers who worked at SeaWorld (and left disillusioned) add dynamic interest to the overall question of whether or not these wild intelligent sentient animals should be kept in captivity. This is a story that will have you questioning what you thought you knew. See "Blackfish" if you're interested in orcas; see it if you're interested in the truth; see it for no other reason than to find out why SeaWorld doesn't want you to see it. This film moves with the fluidity of a wild orca in the ocean. Don't miss out on seeing "Blackfish" because it's going to change the way you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thought-provoking documentary on Tilikum, an Orca that has been at Sea World since 1983 and who is responsible for the death of 3 people (2 of his trainers, and 1 man who snuck into his tank). This is a film about the horrors that these animals go through being kept in captivity for our pleasure and the latest film to showcase how horrible Sea World can be for the very animals it claims to protect, oh the irony.If you thought watching 'The Cove' was difficult, I suggest you take tissues if you plan on seeing this. 2 days later and I still can't stop thinking about this movie or get rid of some of the images and sounds shown.I highly recommend this doc. Go see it with an open mind, I guarantee that you will never see captivity the same way again."If you were in a bathtub for 25 years, don't you think you'd get a little psychotic?!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Dogs, cats, fish, birds, hamsters, ferrets, snakes, and even pigs. We love our pets. We also love our zoos, city aquariums and SeaWorld parks. For many years, we have chosen to believe that the research and educational advances that come from these outlets outweigh any of the negatives involved with keeping wild animals in captivity. Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite shows us (by focusing on SeaWorld) that it's way past time for us to open our eyes to the cruelty involved with the capture and training of wild animals for entertainment purpose.The points made here are not speculation. We witness numerous interviews with "former" SeaWorld trainers. It's clear these people thought they had a bond with their co-performers. Most never even mention the term "killer whale" ... the common moniker for the majestic creatures better known as Orcas. The interviews have great impact, and when combined with startling TV news clips and footage from audience members, it becomes obvious that the huge profits and entertainment offered to families, are quite frankly generated by an immoral and inexcusable business model.Most of the story is tied together by the 2010 death of super-trainer Dawn Brancheau by Tilikum, the largest Orca in the SeaWorld group. What we soon learn is that Tilikum was captured in Iceland waters at the age of three, and has since had many incidents resulting in injuries and even three deaths. It's also stated that Tilikum is the head of the family tree for the majority of SeaWorld's performing Orcas.Of course, no one can or should blame these incredibly intelligent and emotional and family-oriented creatures. Everything about their existence goes against their natural habitat and way of life. The real issue is ... just because we CAN capture and train these animals, does that mean we SHOULD? If the focus is profits, then the answer is apparently yes. If instead, the focus is respecting nature and valuing other species, then the answer is much different.The Cove and Project Nim are two other documentaries that come to mind when thinking about filmmakers attempting to expose the danger in training wild animals. Watching this story had me hanging my head like the fisherman from the 1970's as he helped capture a young whale, as the family members swam nearby crying and screeching. Let's hope director Cowperthwaite's screams are heard. See this movie before deciding to visit another SeaWorld (who couldn't be bothered to comment on camera). There are better ways to teach your kids about nature and there are certainly less cruel forms of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice orca; let's torture it. Murder mystery with SeaWorld as villain and you as willing accomplice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In February 2010, reports of the accidental death of a killer whale trainer, Dawn Brancheau, at SeaWorld, Orlando featured in newspapers and TV bulletins across the globe. How could such a tragedy occur? What on earth was Brancheau thinking? How could she make such a silly mistake? Then the story changed and it appeared this very experienced trainer was attacked by the orca, Tilikum. Shockwaves rippled. What? A gentle giant killed a human that cared for it? Suddenly killer whales lived up to their fearsome moniker and became the villains of the moment.Then the story changed again and the truth began to emerge? Blackfish is a startling documentary from Gabriela Cowperthwaite that investigates the reality behind the sparkling waters and bright lights of the SeaWorld parks, not that they are alone in their mistreatment of these startling, intelligent, beautiful creatures. She trawls through the archives to reveal that Brancheau's death was neither a freak accident nor an isolated attack from a vicious animal, but just one of many examples since humans decided it was acceptable to kidnap young orcas for the pleasure and pockets of humans. Kidnap? Is such a strong word appropriate? Watch Blackfish, listen to the mother make "sounds we've never heard an orca make before" in a harrowing display of grief and then decide.Watching Blackfish and still choosing to visit SeaWorld or another such aquatic zoo is surely on the same level as taking your kids to McDonalds even though you know you're poisoning them. If I were reviewing the subject of Blackfish, like 2009's powerfully distressing The Cove, it would surely warrant a perfect score. Upon the evidence here, even if you've chosen not to see the truth of our actions in the past, there's no contest. It's wrong, it's unacceptable, it's a despicable thing we do when we steal these creatures from their oceans and trap them in tiny prisons. But the review is not for the subject matter but for the manner in which it is presented to us.Blackfish isn't perfect. It doesn't have quite the same profound, lasting impact as The Cove. Perhaps that is, in part, down to the lack of shocking imagery. The footage of orcas bleeding copiously into their pools, having been attacked by other killer whales, is sickening but because it is on a smaller scale than the mass slaughter of dolphins that dyed the cove scarlet there is a risk the impact will be reduced. It shouldn't be, it mustn't be, but? We shouldn't need to see it to believe it, but we've become a far more visually inspired breed in recent years.More than that, Blackfish doesn't give a lot of time to the other side of the story. I'm intrigued to know quite how SeaWorld could possibly defend its actions but, as they declined to be interviewed, this is a very one-sided documentary. I can't help thinking this imperative cause would be even more compelling if we could hear the excuses.Another unexplained mystery is how Cowperthwaite obtained the footage she has of SeaWorld. Presumably they didn't give it to her willingly. But these are minor quibbles with a documentary that is as sickening as it is compelling. Interviews with apologetic, horrified former SeaWorld trainers and tear-streaked 'kidnappers' impart the information we need to educate, inform, convince or perhaps even convert us.First, Cowperthwaite teaches us about the orcas: Their brains are superior to ours in certain aspects; their emotional attachment far exceeds ours, with offspring remaining with their mother long into adulthood; each family group (or pod) has it's own culture and 'language' for communication.She then counters that with the lies perpetuated by the SeaWorld staff that we choose to believe: Orcas live longer, up to 35 years, in captivity due to the care available ? actually, in the wild, it's up to 50 for males and can be closer to a hundred for the females.Male dorsal fin collapse is normal ? absolutely, it's 100% in captivity. However, in their natural environment it occurs approximately 1% of the time.Killer whales enjoy performing the tricks in tiny pools for us ? um? As more and more evidence of orca psychosis brought on by cruelty and captivity unfolds, Blackfish becomes increasingly difficult to watch. The sight of peeling paint in a tiny, floating warehouse into which the orcas are herded every night is saddening. Hearing that they are punished for not performing perfectly is horrifying. Watching them bleed, observing them rock in grief or cry out to their stolen offspring is heartbreaking.The message throughout Blackfish is that faceless managers steal killer whales (along with dolphins and countless other creatures) from their natural habitats, subject them to abuse and solitary confinement in woefully cramped enclosures so that we can pay to watch them perform unnatural tricks for our cameras, and so the owners can watch their bank accounts swell. The message is, it isn't about entertainment or protection of a species, it's about money.But what stamps the reality more indelibly than anything that comes before it, is the comment from one of the former trainers in the final scene. As they sail through the ocean, watching a pod of killer whales free and at peace in their natural environment, he comments, "We saw orcas swimming in straight lines with straight dorsal fins... it was an honour."

		<shortDescription>On how humans should (and should not) encounter orca whales</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, that's a great documentary: it beautifully combines Herzog's "Grizzly Man" thrilling, escalating tension of how things go wrong when humans misinterpret their relation with nature with Achbar &amp; Abbott's "The Corporation" sharp examination of modern-day companies.Second, it is aesthetically captivating and pleasant to follow. Cowperthwaite's reconstructs the narrative leading to the final, and fatal, encounter of Tilikum and Dawn Brancheau, alternating footage, both in the wild and in aquariums, with interviews and contextual data. Finally, it is a work that, without ever abandoning neutrality, serves a mostly noble cause: that against the confinement of animals that are intelligent, social, and set to crisscross oceans, not to be kept in tanks.My hope is that, by being such a fine piece of art, it also helps change the industry of marine-life entertainment theme parks.So "Blackfish" is a big splash in more than one way! Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gut-wrenching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year is already shaping up to be a great one for documentaries and Blackfish is quickly earning the reputation of being the most essential. And it absolutely deserves it. Although its an emotionally charged argument, there's a rational logic behind it. Every time there's found footage of killer whale incidents it's utterly gut-wrenching and you can't help but dread the moments that inevitably shook the world when they could've been prevented. Fortunately, the filmmakers find a different way to present the footage each time and it keeps it from feeling repetitive and builds to feeling more heart breaking at every turn. In its use of talking head interviews with former trainers, it ends up genuinely dramatic without feeling melodramatic as many documentaries can. It oozes with passion for the creatures which helps enforce its argument against their treatment, not just for better protection for trainers, but for corporations like SeaWorld to not turn a blind eye at the clear injustice they've cased. What's the moral cost of the business and entertainment? I certainly won't ever be able to be entertained by animal acts without thinking about Blackfish. Thisis an extremely powerful documentary that's brilliantly structured, tragic and cinematic. More than worth your time.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So excited to stumble on this promo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so happy the cruelty behind captive whales is being exposed. I was so excited to see this promo on IMDb. Seeing the 20 seconds of the whales being taken from the ocean and then where they kept them after made me want to cry. I doubt I'll be able to watch the movie without crying. What Sea World and other theme parks like them are doing is wrong and cruel and I'm so glad more people are going to see this. Every parent who takes their kid to Sea World should be required to watch this first. I went to Sea World twice for school functions in high school and I didn't think anything of it. When I look back on it, I am mad that I was put in the position to have to go. I hope this film also changes schools views on field trips (or band trips or drill team trips) to Sea World. I have been fighting and protesting Sea World (and the circus)for years now. The more people who know about what really happens the better for these poor animals. THANK YOU to the person who made this documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking and tragic documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched this extremely thought-provoking documentary I was reminded of the recent film Project Nim. In the latter we were shown the tragic consequences of people deciding to bring a chimpanzee up as a human. The basic message of this incredible documentary was that if you bring a wild and dangerous animal into an artificial world populated by people, be prepared for some repercussions. Blackfish, likewise, has a very similar message. Except in this example the outcome is far worse. Not only do we see animals mistreated but some of the very people who love them most end up dead. There aren't many winners in this one.The story is underpinned by the death of a trainer. In 2010 Dawn Brancheau was killed in SeaWorld in Orlando by a killer whale called Tilikum. This in and of itself is a pretty horrible event but it's what was discovered with a little research that takes the horror up to a new level. It turned out that the same whale had in fact killed another trainer back in 1991 in very similar circumstances and had shown aggressive behaviour to trainers on other occasions. There were a few other near misses with orcas dragging trainers underwater in this water park but, worse still, there was a further killing in a park in Spain that obtained its whales from SeaWorld; whales that were the offspring of Tilikum. As if this was not appalling enough, to rub salt in the wounds, SeaWorld attempted to put the blame on the trainers, as if they were in some way responsible for their deaths. Eye witnesses were never asked for evidence in the '91 death despite their account of the tragedy conflicting with the SeaWorld version of events (incredibly, 'drowning'), while the eye witnesses in the 2010 case countered the official line from SeaWorld leading to a court case. What comes out of all of this loud and clear is that when it comes to SeaWorld, money is prioritised over the welfare of the animals and the safety of the trainers. It makes you angry and makes you wonder how these parks have not been shut down. Needless to say, SeaWorld refused to be interviewed for this documentary.These killings are terrible events but no one is blaming the orcas. These animals, who are used to roaming the oceans in large family groups which they never leave, are stuck in small pools performing tricks. It would be unusual if creatures with such highly developed brains with emotional capabilities did not develop forms of psychosis in this environment. In one very upsetting part of the film one of the female whales has her calf removed from her permanently on the basis that it was interfering with the performances for the paying public. The mother whale remained in a corner of the pool for a very long time crying out with a sound no one had ever heard before. The animal was clearly in extreme grief. Is it acceptable that people are allowed to do this to such an emotionally developed creature? We take them from the seas away from their families; surely there should be a moral responsibility? But there isn't. There is even one unpleasant moment from 1970 captured on film where a calf is captured and removed from its family. The other orcas did not flee, they hung around and cried. It was pretty awful and even one of the hunters was traumatised by this event.This is a film that really should be seen. Particularly if you are thinking of taking a trip to see the performing killer whales and those dedicated folks who work with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of zoos. Watching caged animals pace back and forth neurotically has always bothered me. I must confess we took our kids to Seaworld when they were young. One time was immediately after one orca had killed another in the tank so there was basically no show, the orcas just swam around in the tank because the trainers couldn't get in the water with them. Watching this movie is deeply disturbing. It is cruel to see what these highly intelligent animals are forced to endure. The scene where the mother and baby are separated is heart-wrenching. First, watch this movie. Then, don't ever go to a zoo or sea aquarium again and this will cease to exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking yet necessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having spent the majority of my Summer holidays as a small child bouncing from theme parks to zoos all over America and the UK, I never really thought about animals in captivity being cruel until I was older.I already had a solid opinion on this subject before I watched Blackfish so my world view didn't really shift, it was merely justified. I can guarantee though that if you have a positive opinion on wildlife in captivity (specifically large mammals like Orca's) or never really thought about it, this documentary will open your eyes.Blackfish really hits hard early on showing exactly what Seaworld, and other large corporations with animals, have done in the past to gain their animals. Blackfish is full of heartbreak and I think a large part of the efficiency of this documentary is the expert editing and decisions taken by production of where to place the clips and when. The interviews were fantastic and having a slightly contradictory interviewee made the documentary even better.I highly recommend this to everyone although be aware that this is definitely a 15 and it includes some shocking video clips of trainers getting hurt, animals bleeding and high tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see heavy-hitting indictment of the reality of Sea World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blackfish" is one of the greatest films to come along in a decade. The details and research of the never before seen reporting of what goes into making a massive intelligent whale perform tricks in a pool will forever change you. The film calls into question the very moral and ethical considerations of stripping away every normal and natural behavior to Orcas for our entertainment, and the devastating consequences of doing so for both people and the animals. Every person who is considering visiting Sea World or any Marine Park must see this film first. The shiny and fun show your kids might enjoy has a very dark and disturbing reality behind it. This movie marks the beginning of the end of keeping Orcas captive. It would be insanity to continue the confinement of Orcas for human entertainment now that the dirty secrets of Sea World have been made public. The animals do not matter to Sea World, only the profits. This movie causes great emotional pain as it exposes the worst traits of man. Blackfish is a must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is one of the best docs I've ever seen. Tilikum, the Orca who is the film's focus, is not the only tragic victim in this movie. We feel the loss of Dawn Brancheau &amp; the other trainers killed in this movie acutely.There are scenes of wild orcas that are rapturous &amp; conversely there are scenes with them that are filled with tension &amp; dread. The filmmakers aren't out to shock you with graphic imagery (if any exist). The spoken &amp; written descriptions are horrifying enough. (It is not for children!) I wish I could un-hear the plaintive cries of a mother orca after being separated from her child. That scene had to be in the film, but it is almost --it is-- too much.To call this film one-sided is like calling a film about the horrors of meth addiction, child abuse or the dangers of cigarette smoking biased. How could it be any other way?It is an absolutely unforgettable film.Update 2015: This film is even more powerful if you see it after you had read John Hargrove's book "Beneath The Surface" which explores the film's subject in greater detail. I can't think of a film + book that complement each other so perfectly except maybe "Eight Men Out" &amp; "Into The Wild" (maybe Cheryl Strayed's "Wild" which I haven't read that was adapted into an excellent film).</fullReview>

They were ripped from their families and some were killed during the process. It also shares a lot of details about their lifespan, former trainers experiences, and more.

		<shortDescription>A Necessary Exposé</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish as a documentary is a clear and comprehensive introduction to the world of captive orcas, their trainers, and the human tragedies that have made businesses like SeaWorld increasingly controversial. The film makes good use of interviews and archival footage, though without the participation of SeaWorld, it is understandably one-sided. However, it's SeaWorld's refusal to participate that says it all: there is not much a SeaWorld representative can say that doesn't make a bigger fool of the corporation than it has already made of itself.The film succeeds in covering all bases--it begins with the naive perspectives of the trainers but spends equal time on the life stories of the orcas, who were captured at young ages and stolen from their families. It's hard not to be affected by the intelligence and depth of orcas and orca communities; many of the scenes, especially where mother orcas grieve their babies' capture, are heartbreaking. All along, it documents several "accidents" where orcas in captivity have injured or killed humans. While upsetting, the filmmakers make it clear that this is a consequence of humans keeping these intelligent, strong animals in captivity.Without a doubt, SeaWorld comes off as the villain here. It repeatedly covers up whale attacks and usually finds ways to blame them on the trainers. It also continues to use Tilikum, the whale who was involved in the deaths of three humans, in its shows. The whole time, it prizes money over the safety of the human trainers or the whales. Anyone who has fond memories of SeaWorld will probably not think of it in the same way after watching this documentary.That is the main importance of this film: to open up the naive public's eyes to what is undoubtedly animal cruelty. For this viewer, who paid a lot of attention to the media at the time of Dawn Brancheau's death and read up quite a bit on the subject of captive orcas, none of this was new or surprising. Few things are covered particularly in-depth. It is definitely a primer to the issue, and will probably leave people wanting to know more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People have accused the film of being one sided. Well, considering that Sea World declined to be interviewed for the film, it is kind of hard for the filmmakers to be balanced. And the main character is unable to speak for himself. A previous reviewer stated that this film will not win any Oscars but it is eligible for the best documentary Oscar and CNN which aired it on it's network is increasing it's visibility. Tilikum, a 12,000 pound orca who is responsible for 3 deaths over 20 years is the main focus of the film. I had the pleasure 20 years ago while whale watching off the coast of Orange County, California of encountering 2 wild orcas. This was pure happenstance, we were looking for the Grey whale. Seeing these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat with the erect dorsal fin standing as tall as a man was a humbling experience. But in captivity you are stifling the animals natural instincts, You can't deny 65 million years of evolution. If the film does win the Oscar and I predict it will, hopefully it will change peoples views and be a force for change. This is one of the best films of the year documentary or otherwise.Update 2015-Sea World saw a drop on attendance at all of it's parks after the release of the film. A number of Rock and Roll artists cancelled performance at the parks in protest. In November of 2015 Sea World announce plans to end Orca shows at it's San Diego park. So the film has had a substantial impact. It is probably one of the most influential documentaries in history. It is more relevant now in light of these recent event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard-hitting and extremely disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my children were young, we went to the killer whale (orca) shows at the Vancouver Aquarium. It was fun to see the 8,000+ pound whales doing tricks for the trainer while the audience was being splashed. We gave little thought, however, to how the whales felt about it. Today, millions who attend SeaWorld shows watching the killer whales perform in San Diego, Orlando, and San Antonio also pay little heed to either the danger to the trainers or the frustration of the animals that have been confined to an area the size of a swimming pool for up to twenty or thirty years. These conditions are depicted in Gabriela Cowperthwaite's hard-hitting and extremely disturbing documentary Blackfish, the name given to orcas by the First Nations.While the film provides no new information, putting it all together makes a powerful case against the whales' confinement. Interviewed are former Sea World trainers who do not hesitate to talk about the misinformation they were told to tell audiences about orcas' lifespan and fins (which routinely collapse in captivity) and the great benefit whales experience at SeaWorld. According to the former trainers, the killer whales are social creatures that live with their families all of their life. When they are forced to separate in order to "introduce new breeding options to other SeaWorld parks and by fulfilling entertainment and other husbandry needs," their heartbreaking cry simulated in the film will stay with you.Trainers and whale experts talk about the intelligence and beauty of these animals and how they can live many years longer in the wild. According to Biologist Debbie Giles, in the wild, their estimated maximum life span is 60-70 years for males and 80-90 years for females. In captivity, most orcas die in their teens and 20s and only a handful have made it past 35. The former SeaWorld trainers also talk about the whales' aggressive behavior directed against each other when they are subjected to overcrowding. The film centers on a particular whale, the 12,000 pound Tilikum, who has been involved with the deaths of three SeaWorld trainers since 1991, events captured on amateur home video.Beginning in 1983 as a two-year-old, Tilikum performed at the Sealand of the Pacific Park in Victoria, B.C., where he was jammed into a holding area along with two other female whales each night when the park closed. This abuse continued until the inevitable occurred when a trainer was killed in 1991 with Tilikum's participation, though he did not instigate the attack. After the incident, the owner mercifully closed the park and Tilikum was shipped to SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Although SeaWorld said that the whale would only be used for breeding purposes, he continued to be part of the show and continues to this day.This in spite of the fact that another death occurred in 1999 when a man evaded security to enter the park at night, and in 2010 when a highly-skilled senior trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was mauled to death by a whale she had a long-term relationship with, an incident SeaWorld attributed to "trainer error." In discussing these attacks, the film asserts that no attacks against humans have been documented when the orcas are in their natural habitat, swimming hundreds of miles each day in the open seas (though some sources claim there have been two). In 2006, however, ABC reported that there had been nearly two dozen attacks in captivity worldwide. Recently a judge, recognizing the potential danger to trainers, ordered SeaWorld to place a barrier between the trainers and the whales. SeaWorld is appealing.Though Blackfish is one-sided and aggressive in its advocacy, SeaWorld was given an opportunity to present its case but declined, calling Blackfish "inaccurate and misleading." Cowperthwaite said that she approached her documentary as a journalist with an open mind and that her point in making the film was not to shut down SeaWorld but to provide the context for humane treatment for the whales and to prevent additional deaths at marine theme parks. "The film is a truthful document," she says, and SeaWorld is "an industry based on fairy tales." Since the documentary's release, entertainer Willie Nelson, and rock groups Heart and Barenaked Ladies have cancelled shows at SeaWorld in protest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps a little preachy, but essentially right-on expose' of one of the nastier roadside zoo type companies around. Sea World was shown the door in Washington because of the numbers of whales they killed trying to capture a few for their parks.As against elephants or ostriches or other exotics, killer whales are fairly easy to see in their natural environment. All you have to do is come to where they like to hang out and go out on a whale watch boat.Sea World, if it were responsibly run, might have a case for what it's doing now as long as it doesn't trap any more wild animals. But the spin, the bullshit and outright false information, shows that their chief interest is in the almighty buck, not taking care of wildlife or even their own staff. Sea World seems to be continuing a vestige of old-fashioned zoo attitudes that once gave us bears in chains dancing at county fairs, especially when they confine these animals to such small enclosures. It may be true that animals born in captivity know nothing of life in the wild, but they're still physically equipped for that life, and can and should be returned to the wild.This is not because we can do that, but because we should, just as we should be about cleaning up our act so there's enough fish for these creatures to eat. In the wild.In the beginning and toward the end of the film there are local Washington state shots, even one that shows one well-known bull, "Ruffles," and others of his pod in their natural environment, one I can almost look at directly (but for the trees) from where I sit writing this. So if Se World wants to do this right, assuming it can be done "right," it wouldn't cost any more money (their basic value) to tell the truth and offer good solid scientific information, instead of making it all into one more consumerist game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish is a chilling documentary that can't be always full explained but it is nothing short of amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Founded in 1964 by Milton C. Shedd, Ken Norris and David DeMott, Sea World was the newest theme park attraction in the 60's. It was a theme park attraction that was different for the 60's and even now due to it's marine life theme. From it's popular roller coaster Kraken in Orlando, Florida to the Madagascar Live! Operation:Vacation show in San Diego, California, this points to why Sea World is so successful. That said, Blackfish by CNN is made for the whole world to show us what is underneath the surface of this company and some of their wrongdoings.Blackfish makes it's main points through Tilikum the 12,000 pound killer whale who has had 21 offspring and has helped make Sea World successful but has also been responsible for three deaths. Tilikum is a whale that has put his mark on Sea World and now will always define it. Through the use of nets and hooks, Tilkum was wrongfully captured off the cost of Iceland in 1983. I don't think there is anyway a whale or any other type of marine animal for that matter should be taken away from a place where they grew up or where their family is and taken to a Sea World park. It is like taking a human being out of their house and putting them in far away place without any hope of ever getting back.To learn information about Tilikum, we see interviews with the former trainers of this whale. These are great and informative interviews that show the power, love and intelligence of this whale. They also point to more of Sea World's wrongdoings.The biggest point Blackfish makes is about the deaths caused by Tililkum that we do see through some scary scenes. One involved a 1991 incident with the trainer Keltie Byrne, another is a strange 1999 incident that involved Daniel Dukes and also an incident in 2010 involving the now well- known trainer, Dawn Brancheau. Afterwards, you cannot look at this large mammal the same but also there are many holes in place in these stories. Where was security in the Daniel Dukes incident where he got in the Tilikum's tank? Dawn Brancheau's story has obviously been covered up many times by Sea World. There is a lot interesting information out there that we really still need to learn.Also included in this film, are some fun commercials from Sea World. We see a family from Detroit from the 90's doing a promotion, a first time baby whale shown in 1994 and it's fun to look back at this. We also learn about whales' brain which was unexpected. It's the little things like this shows off some Sea World nostalgia and you can see that director Gabriela Cowperthwaite has done her homework.Blackfish is one-sided but it is a film we need. It is great for what it tells us and it's effect on us. Frankly, nothing in this will want to make you go back to Sea World again. Blackfish is a chilling documentary that can't be always full explained but it is nothing short of amazing. Even though it is a documentary, Blackfish is still no doubt one of the top films of 2013.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many I guess, I've seen and considered myself entertained by the sea creatures at Sea World. I was aware of the death of one of the trainers at one of these shows from some years ago but put it down to being an occupational hazard, a tragic but accidental death. This well-made, provocative documentary takes that sad story as its starting point and digs deeper, painting up a tawdry tale of greed, deception and apparent wilful abandonment of care by the named entertainment company, which significantly declined to comment on any of the major accusations lodged here.From the horrible death of the female trainer in 2010, caught on video, but mercifully cut before she is actually killed, the production traces back the story of the only too well named killer whale and its history of previous attacks on other trainers, caused, allegedly by years of mistreatment of the animal. Sea World's part in a similar European tragedy involving the death of a Spanish trainer only adds to the charge sheet.A host of former trainers now recanting their previously parroted company-speak of how well the animals are treated is a particularly effective device, but there's much good detective work besides. Most of all, the film isn't afraid to point the finger at the multimillion dollar corporation Sea World and while I hesitate to come to a judgement without the accused exercising the right of reply, it's hard not to conclude that this was an accident, if that's the correct word, waiting to happen.The film is happy to confine its aim to Sea World alone, but I'm sure I'm not alone in reconsidering my position on the capture and training of animals for our entertainment not only in water parks, but also of course in circuses and zoos.A sad, sobering, look into an unacceptable mode of entertainment which has surely had its day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While for the public its easy to pick a side, free the animals or keep them captive to show us what they are what they do and so on... As a person who loves animals and has a knowledge base of behavior captivity as well as a dip and degree in Animal care and management I can honestly say its hard claiming whats right or wrong for many of our animals however marine animals should not be captive. I agree to some extent about zoo breeding to make sure genes are crossed and animals kept from going extinct. Orca's however are doing well in the wild, the only thing killing them is our stupidity. The only thing taking them from their homes is out need for entertainment. They are a highly intelligent mammal like dolphins and need to be left alone. It's easy for people to claim they don't see anything wrong but if you have watched this you know whats wrong. These giants live for 100years in the wild or max 30 in captivity.... how can anyone state they are in better care in captivity! 1percent of wild have collapsed dorsal fins while 100% of captive males have it? this is our fault, worse off we continue to breed from animals who have been used and abused and tormented! They even start to fight and kill each other which is sad as they create family pods in the wild but in captivity they are forced into groupings. This film is amazing, it shows how little knowledge the trainers have how they did in fact love the animals and once they understood they where not helping but hindering the animals they do love so much they stepped back. A must see by anyone thinking of ever going to a show that contains an orca (in fact a must see for anyone who think animals are our entertainment).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first of the several times I've watched this I realized that it moved me because as an owner of pit bulls I am disgusted that animals have been mistreated for human entertainment. And there is no doubt that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that there is no such thing as a truly happy killer whale in captivity.I do think I have a couple of spins different from the critical reviews I've read i want to share.First of all I actually love to debate animal rights, especially when it gets to the extreme point of defending eating a salad instead of a burger, because the cow has a soul and therefore rights. This is scientifically indefensible. By definition an animal is a multi-celled (no bacteria) heterotroph (eats something, no plants). So the debate inevitably generates into why people would think insects as animals wouldn't have rights when puppies do. And there are lots of other animals PETA probably doesn't care about, but by definition are animals. My favorite example is the lamprey. Hair-splitting.That being said it may seem strange that I would be motivated to become an advocate of Seaworld being shut down. The real reason not to abuse animals is because it's just plain stupid. My pit bulls have been perfectly loving companions and should be considered "just another dog." I've treated them better than just and decent. Spoiled.Secondly, the fraud and lies. Seaworld's cover up of the reason for Dawn's death. The whale pulled her into the water by her ponytail because he thought it was a toy. During a live show with the security cameras running. When a court case came about and you could have shown your footage to support your side Seaworld's defense was magically absent of any footage supporting their side. Really?Seaworld claims that the animals live longer in captivity? Really? It's like half the life span or less. I think it's easy to postulate that a killer whale living 90 years in the wild with their families is a lot more fun than being put in a too small tank with no stimulation and dying before forty is a lot more fun.This is from the Net - Seaworld has taken out advertising time to claim that the documentary is not accurate and misleading. Really? If you feel that strongly about your side, in this litigious society you didn't slap the makers of this with a lawsuit?Director Gail got her ducks in a row for this. Seaworld has no good answers. Which is why as mentioned a couple of times that it's mentioned Seaworld declined to comment. She didn't have to make an advocacy spin. She didn't have to say, "Go to PETA's site and make a donation." She just needed to present the facts and the overwhelming amount of evidence to support the conclusion that logical and decent people would come to.This is the best documentary I've ever seen. It opened my eyes to something I never knew before.</fullReview>

This film focuses on killer whale named Tilikum, who is performing daily at the Seaworld in Orlando, FL. Even if you are not interested in marine life or any animals for that matter, this film is still extremely educational. You will definitely learn something from it! Animals deserve the same rights as a human being and should not be kept captive for our entertainment.

I thought "they should euthanize him". As I grew older I started to understand that they are wild animals, and a whale as huge as Tilikum couldn't possibly be happy to be confined in a little pool. Watching this film made me understand and learn something I didn't know; killer whales have feelings too. Just knowing this...it really breaks my heart, because they are suffering, and the only thing I can do for them is to boycott Sea World. Thank You</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those who dreamed of one day going to Sea World, this film gives you 2nd thoughts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many people who grew up in the 90s, part of my childhood fantasies were going to Disney World and going to SeaWorld. Of course, neither of which were close, or affordable, so that never happened. But, going to both places, especially Disney World, never leaves your hopes and dreams, and seemingly becomes the type of trip you do with your kids not just as a treat, but because you want to live vicariously through them. But, one night while watching Bill Maher's Real Time, there was an interview about this film and it was quite disparaging. Now, with the movie easily available, I found myself intently watching.To begin, there aren't any characters in the film, per se, but there are repeat faces. Many of them are former SeaWorld trainers and while we watch and listening to their discussions, you realize one thing: None of them really were qualified when they first started their positions as trainers. They will even tell you that themselves, for none of them had advanced degrees in marine biology or veterinarian care, they were simply animal lovers who found a job. And they convey a sense of naivety as we go from talking about their background to meeting a slew of killer whales, with the film giving a spotlight on one in particular: Tilikum.As for the overall "story" of the film. What the documentary looks into is similar to what The East tried to do. Companies like SeaWorld have incidents and accidents yearly, in fact, there supposedly have been at least 70 incidents with killer whales since the 1970s. But, since this was the time before the internet, they quickly wrote most things off as "accidents" and faulted the trainer more so than the animal. However, in this film we see what happens to these animals to make so these events are certainly no accident. It all very much plays out like a Killer Whale version of the triangular trade. We watch as these animals are taken from their cultures, and their families, and forced to work day in and day out for the measliest of meals. Because of this, they become frustrated, are sometimes forced into isolation and sometimes end up having to fend against those they cohabit with for despite being the same species, as we learn, between their cultural differences and gender, this can lead them to attacking, if not killing each other. And the film doesn't just show Tilikum, as if he is a rare example, but various whales since the 70s which really help substantiate their claim.Now to be honest, I am not a huge animal lover. This isn't to say I would kick a dog in the street, but at the same time I wouldn't be the type of pick him or her up and take her to an animal hospital. With that said though, this is the type of film, which I wish The East was. A film that really makes you want to be involved, even if it is just spreading this film around. I say this because, to me, it really does make you upset at companies like SeaWorld when you learn about these intelligent animals and what happens to them in captivity. Also, it makes you feel supremely ignorant like when you learn what is happening in Syria is just a repeat of the past, or how things are going on in the country, state, or even town you live in, and don't know a damn thing about what is going on. So, needless to say, the film is very informative and provides not just testimonies, but also pictures and videos of not just whales attacking humans, but also the environment which turns an intelligent animal into a beast.But, one thing I do wish there was more of, though their argument would have been hard to fight with, was some opposition. Naturally, SeaWorld didn't comment at all in the film, but instead they got one former trainer who seemed so much like a stooge that you just roll your eyes whenever he appears. And really, that would have been the only thing I would have wanted more of. For the film finds other companies which admit guilt, as well as people who made a living capturing Killer Whales, but the lack of any real opposition or serious counter argument makes it so you don't necessarily think they are lying to you, but you really do want to get into the head of the people who support and continue this practice.Overall: Definitely a Go SeeTruth be told, I like documentaries with some type of narrative like this and what Disney produces time to time. But, it should be noted, this is a bit more like an expose than Disney's "look at these cute, but deadly, animals act like live-action versions of what makes us money." With that said, I do recommend seeing this movie if you are curious, an animal lover looking for some facts for a future argument or someone, like me, who has had an interest in places like SeaWorld which thrive on animal entertainment. I can't say though if this is worth a buy or not, but it is at least a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely heartbreaking. Ever since watching "Free Willy" back in the 90's, I've known about the problems with keeping killer whales in captivity. I've followed the stories of accidents, injuries and deaths.I'm torn, however, between wanting to never have another whale put on display, and knowing how much we've learned precisely because of places like Sea World. I'm hoping there's some sort of solution to this.Maybe places like Sea World could find a way to allow these whales a MUCH larger space to roam while they're not performing; a more natural habitat like that mentioned at the end of this documentary. Also, the practices need to be changed, like ripping the young away from their mother ... that needs to stop immediately! No matter what, something needs to change. These animals are beautiful, intelligent creatures, and we can learn a lot from them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this documentary but was never really that interested until a friend of mine told me more about it. And wow, I had no idea that Sea World was that cruel of a business. Look I understand its very biased against them, but honestly at some point you have to look at the facts that were given in this film.I had no idea about the accidents of trainers that had happened in the past. One was very recent actually and I guess I should watch the news more. I can't believe that happened. What got me upset the most about it is that Sea World blamed the trainer for the accident. In fact, they seemed to blame the trainers for every single incident that's ever happened. I believe they said there were about 100 or so incidents with the whales and trainers.As a kid, I enjoyed going to Sea World. In Hawaii we have a Sea Life Park, and I loved going there. Little did I know that these whales were being treated terribly. Having something that big living in such small quarters is bad and no wonder sometimes they act out.Some of the clips that are shown are disturbing but they never show any deaths. I for one won't be attending Sea World ever again. In the end, a judge ruled that trainers aren't allowed to be in the water with the whales anymore, what did Sea World do...they appealed. Are you kidding me? A trainer just got eaten. It's a great documentary that I think people should watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blackfish steers away from the History of so-called aquatic theme parks and centers in on one and only one subject, Killer Whales being taken from our oceans for the amusement of Humans." There is so much talk about this Feature Documentary Film being one-sided but how can it be biased when the filmmaker deals with the facts in the cases and issues at hand? Seaworld and their current publicly owned Blackstone won't talk. So be it.. so lets look at the tragedies that unfolded and how can we the public, many investors ourselves can remedy this horrific situation.The film details with the use of stock footage, location footage as well as police evidence tape a Killer Whale's psychosis caused by living in completely unnatural conditions for 25 years. I suppose Seaworld has made this animal their pet project feeling that they can tame anything into a performance. The truth is they are guilty of negligence leading to the death of their own employee's whom they title as Trainers.X-Trainers within the film testify to the madness and inadequate training and lack of experience they had prior to diving into tanks filled with Killer Whales.The film is heavy on Testimonials, lots of talking heads that make the story completely and utterly believable. There is no deception other on the part of the Company that continues to hold the rights to the captive Killer Whale. Upsetting is the candid documentation of how these precious mammals are taken from the oceans. The fact is that these folks are not marine research biologists, but hired hands to get their prey.This film has the capability of setting new safeguards into place for the protection of Whales and most importantly new Theme Park laws that protect them from long-term abuse. Blackfish I believe has one goal and that is to help educate and reform animal rights global laws. This is a mighty job for a filmmaker to accomplish but with a wider release it will be seen. I wanted the Filmmaker to go after Seaworld and its investment Company. I wanted her to tell the story of other closed down parks such as Marineland in Florida. I wanted the defense to have their day in court. But since nobody from the other-side speaks, the subject never changes keying in on the Killer Whale in question sometimes called in the wild a "Blackfish". CSPS Media 2013</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen 2009's heartbreaking Oscar-winner The Cove will know just how ugly the reality is behind being able to enjoy marine mammals at zoo's or sealife parks. Blackfish could work almost as a sequel, as where The Cove left us with a sea of blood amidst the entrapment and capture of a group of dolphins, Blackfish shows us the life of a group of killer whales in captivity at Sea World, more than likely where most of The Cove's dolphins would have ended up. What the film has in abundance is an archive of disturbing video footage showing unprovoked attacks by orca's on experienced trainers, which is something that Sea World executives have brushed off as trainer errors.Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite went into the film intending of making a documentary on Dawn Brancheau, the former Sea World trainer who was killed in 2010 by Sea World's most notorious orca, Tilikum. Yet what she uncovered with the help of interviews from former Sea World trainers was obviously too difficult to simply ignore. Brancheau's unfortunate death wasn't a one-off, nor was it the first time Tilikum had been responsible for the death of a trainer (it was the third), but it was the latest in a long line of deaths, mutilations and lucky escapes by orca's on both the trainers and on each other. The most unnerving of them all is the attack on Kenneth Peters, where the killer whale Kasatka drags him under water for long periods of time as if issuing a threat.But it's not in the video footage that Blackfish retains it's power, but in the testimonies given by those who experienced it first hand. Each interviewee seems riddled with guilt that they didn't do more for the orca's, and they give tearful recollections of the signs they failed to see. Sea World declined to be interviewed for the film, and it's of no surprise. The images are so damning that there is simply nothing they can say. Trainers would naively sign up being told tales of trainer misconduct being responsible for the near-fatalities or simply hushed up to avoid bad press. It's not an easy watch, especially those with a weak-stomach for real-life moments of horror, but this is a powerful film, exposing cruelty and corporate cover-ups on an appalling scale. It seems money is worth more than basic compassion for a fellow intelligent creature.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish is Biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is a documentary with the sole purpose being to put SeaWorld out of business. In this documentary the filmmakers show many examples of evidence proving SeaWorld's marine life being held captive causes the animals to suffer mentally. The film focuses mainly on Tilikum, one of SeaWorld's most well known orcas. Over the course of his life, Tilikum killed three people, two of whom were killed even before he was brought to SeaWorld and the third being one of SeaWorld's very own trainers, Dawn Brancheau. Many former trainers were brought in and interviewed for the film to give their perspective on their experiences with the way SeaWorld treats their marine life. They also brought in many so called "professionals" to view the footage and give their opinions. The documentary film, Blackfish tries to prove to the viewers that SeaWorld is well overdue of boycotting, and they do a good job showing us that. This film is very biased and the viewer should be aware of that when watching and critiquing it. The whole purpose is to show SeaWorld in a bad light, so of course they would not show the good SeaWorld does for their marine life and the community. In the film they never reveal SeaWorld's side of the stories at all. They show us what a lot of people have to say about the incidents, but they never give us a witness' account. SeaWorld is like a silent killer on trial where he is consistently being put under pressure and not allowed to speak for his cause. We are never told what the actual case report is, we are just told the interviewees' take on the footage they are shown, not even being shown a statement from SeaWorld. This makes this film appear to be very biased because it seems they are afraid to show us any of the actual events in case we may decide on our own who is right. Most, if not all of the former trainers in the film haven't been employed at SeaWorld in over 10 years. This makes them unaware of current conditions at the park as they may have changed in the past decade. These individuals have little to no experience with the orca in question, or the orcas in the park at all for that matter. One of the former trainers, Samantha Berg, mentioned training with Tilikum, but after further research it is found out that she never trained with him and only very briefly worked in the killer whale section of the park. The footage that is meant to be assumed as being Ms. Berg was actually footage shot over 10 years previous to her leaving SeaWorld. Just by viewing the interviews it becomes obvious that the former employees have some sort of resentment towards the park. Animal rights activists masquerading as scientists seems to be yet another way to pull at each viewer and convince us to respect this film. Howard Garret, Lori Marino, and Ken Balcomb are just a few of the activists that were portrayed as being professionals or even scientists specializing in marine life. Each of these people have no experience with orca behavior in captivity. A few of the other "professionals" in the film were also part of a lawsuit against SeaWorld stating that they were going against the 13th amendment, and even calling what SeaWorld is doing an act of slavery. The film also uses statements from David Duffus, who is not a marine life specialist, but instead a professor of geography. An OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) judge even stated "he has no expertise in the training of captive killer whales," referring to David." This film seems to try to hide a lot of truth behind these masks they've created. Overall the documentary Blackfish proves to be very biased in their reasoning. Even just scratching the surface you can see that they use a lot of false testimonies and experiences. They do a very good job making the viewer feel attached and the heartache for the animals through the footage and the stories, but those very stories are twisted to fit their own perception of the reality of the way SeaWorld treats their marine life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>t's the documentary you've heard a lot about, and if you haven't seen it, it really is an educating blast of reality. Blackfish seeks to explore the treatment of killer whales in captivity. They do this by interviewing former trainers, marine experts, and showing you actual footage of these whales in their environments. The orcas are mistreated, definitely. One sea park admitted that they kept their whales in a space that was way too small, and they all feel bad about it now.The film doesn't just go after Sea World, which is an important fact to remember. Sea World just happens to be the biggest sea park, with multiple locations. It explores problems at other parks. Blackfish does spend a great deal of time focusing specifically on Tilikum, the orca that killed its trainer, Dawn, in 2010. You will actually feel bad for Tilikum, even though he killed his trainer. The treatment that Tilikum had was unacceptable. He was bullied constantly by other whales, spent most of his time alone because of that, and clearly had exhibited behavioral issues that should have kept trainers out of Tilikum's reach. The argument is that Sea World was negligent, and knew Tilikum was a risk, and still did nothing.It's not a hard to watch documentary, like The Cove, but it is still an important one. Sea World definitely has done a lot of things wrong, and should be forced to completely reevaluate their trainer situation. The fact that they blamed Dawn for her death is deplorable. Definitely a must watch documentary.</fullReview>

It really frustrates me that while she is telling the story about the tragic accident, she is actually smiling! What is wrong with her! The documentary itself is good and deserves our attention. Whales are huge animals and no matter how much training they receive, they will always be wild animals with an hunting instinct. I went to Victoria BC myself and saw orca's in the wild near the Washington coast, and it was amazing. It makes me feel so blessed to see them in their territory and I feel an intense respect for there beautiful sea creatures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the fine documentary with a fine message. Snubbed from the Oscars and I felt really bad for that. It should have been in there compared to the other nominees, including the winner. This was like another 'The Cove' which spotlights the human torture to the non human species. This documentary is not for entertainment, but which brings the public awareness of the serious issue that still taking place around the world in different venues.The movie was committed to expose on the imprisoned Orca, a killer whale called Tilikum and the company called 'Sea World' it owns. It all began from his capture in 1983 on the coast of Iceland, then brought back to the United States to train. In his 30 years of captivity Tilikum was involved in the deaths of his trainers, but the statement to the press and media was denoted as it was the human error. And also the movie had many heartbreaking incidents in many parts.When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to uncover the crime committed by the large Blackfish. As usual like most of the occasion my guess was wrong and I was totally surprised towards the story that tried to reveal some unexpected and unbearable truths. Everything reversed and finger points towards human just like the tag says: Never capture what you can't control. Looked like this just below 90 minutes movie was lacking in valuable inputs. Only because of the 'Sea World' that holds Tilikum refused to participate in making of the movie which portrayed them in dark shade. But the intention of the movie was explained in very honestly. There it goes my salute to the director whose attempt was so courageous.In my childhood, I had a fish bowl with a couple of goldfish in it and I regret having it after seeing this documentary movie. Truly an eye opener, whoever watch this would feel similar fashion, especially if you are an animal lover. Hoping this movie will change the perspective of the relationship between man and animals. Expecting more and more movies like this until people realise what's going on between dominated and enslaved species on the planet earth. If you are reading my review then you must add it to your watch list because I don't want you to miss this.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a film that should be mandatory viewing for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Blackfish" is shocking, and traumatizing. And it should be mandatory viewing.The documentary opens with former SeaWorld orca trainers describing how they got their job at the park. Apparently, it is not as difficult to become a trainer as one might think. While mesmeric music plays in the background, and orcas swim through sky blue Seaworld waters, the former SeaWorld trainers remember meeting their first orcas. The creatures, they reminisce, were humongous, inspiring, and beautiful. While working at SeaWorld, the trainers formed relationships with the animals (for some of them, this is the reason they stayed as long as they did.) The information that comes after this affectionate introduction is unimaginably horrific.Among the tragic fatalities explored is the death of top SeaWorld orca trainer Dawn Brancheau, who died in 2010 after the orca Tilikum pulled her into the water. Many of the interviewees had known Dawn personally, and had great respect for her.There is one part of the film that I dislike, and that is the reverence toward Dawn Brancheau. Dawn's job, her livelihood, was keeping these animals in unspeakable conditions, causing unfathomable psychological and emotional torture. Dawn proudly and vocally profited from these animals' suffering. She was either ignorant of the horrific agony caused to the captive orcas, or simply ignored it. But Dawn was one of the top trainers at Seaworld... so could she really have been so ignorant? Did she think that kidnapping and imprisoning the orcas was nurturing? When the baby calfs were ripped from their mother's side, and the mother fell into a visible, catatonic depression, emitting screeching cries day and night, trying to communicate with her child... How exactly did Dawn interpret that?The following quote is from the Dawn Brancheau Foundation's website:"In addition to her work as a trainer, Dawn also became the face of SeaWorld. Over the years, she appeared on billboards around the world, a large mural at the Orlando International Airport, on a Budweiser beer bottle, and on many other promotional materials. She also appeared live on House Hunters, Wheel of Fortune, and FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman. Dawn was always willing to share her knowledge and love of the orcas with new audiences." I just wonder why "Blackfish" commends the memory of a woman who was, literally, the face of orca torture. The former SeaWorld trainers interviewed were saddened by Dawn's death; so by the same hand, they're protesting orca imprisonment, while commemorating the warden? "Blackfish" beautifies Dawn Brancheau, just as SeaWorld glamorizes the lives of the captive orcas.I was also bothered by the end shot, which shows four of the former trainers on a boat, watching wild orcas swim in their natural habitat. This is unnecessary, contrived, and redundant. (Perhaps the director was aiming for a sentimental Hollywood-ish ending.)These two things only slightly dampened the otherwise very strong film.Some of the messages in "Blackfish" not only apply to the orcas in captivity, but are more universal; such as how marketing can completely indoctrinate us. And especially the idea that people believe what they want to believe, and that it's always easier to turn your head away, than to take action. The orcas at SeaWorld were and are subjected to heinous physical and emotional torture. The former trainers in the film talk about how on some level, at the time of their SeaWorld employment, they understood what was happening. But externally, consciously, they ignored the warning signs. It is all remindful of the old wisdom, that if one is not part of the solution, than they are part of the problem."Blackfish" is a sensational documentary, magnificently enunciated and skillfully crafted. It is also one of the most horrific films I have ever seen. Within the current rating system, there is no question that "Blackfish" should have an NC-17 rating. And yet (paradoxically), this is a film that should be mandatory viewing in schools. Everyone needs too see this film, especially young people. It is a tough movie to watch, and so perhaps appropriately, it is also an extraordinarily important one.screenplayisles.blogspot</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would agree with some of the negative reviews that this film is biased and does misconstrue some of the facts in the Seaworld story. Seaworld does have a website to present counterarguments to the documentary. I looked at this website and although it points out some flaws in the film it did not change my mind about the films main message which is that keeping these large intelligent mammals in captivity is cruel and potentially dangerous. This film really does make you think twice before planning a trip to an aquarium or zoo and it inspired me to do some research into similar parks in Canada. Overall it is a compelling and enlightening documentary especially for those unfamiliar with this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish is a documentary that is worth watching due to the home videos, interviews, and information it provides.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish, directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, is an interesting, thrilling documentary. This movie is thought provoking and made me walk away wanting a better life for the whales that live in captivity. It was more than I expected it to be and not only told the story of Tilikum, but also showed everything that was wrong with SeaWorld. After watching this movie I will never take my family to SeaWorld. Due to the popularity of the movie, SeaWorld has lost revenue and artists have canceled playing at their annual concert. The movie was a success because the director used real footage to tell the story and is extremely informative in the facts.To begin with, Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) was a successful movie because real life footage was used and former whale trainers were interviewed. This proved the movie's validity and also made the viewer more connected to the storyline because they could give a real face to the character that the story was about. The New York Times talked about the movie by saying, "Seemingly supported by chilling video and the oral testimonies of two witnesses to Tilikum's first attack in 1991, the trainers accuse SeaWorld of cover-ups and misinformation." The scenes of Dawn playing with Tilikum and loving her job made me emotionally tied to the movie and made me feel even worse about her death because she now seemed like someone I knew. However, the whole movie is not only real home video footage, there are also interviews and slight bits of animation. These provide a perfect balance for the viewer so that a story can still be followed. Shots from when a trainer was crushed by a killer whale were shown and although they may be gruesome, they are getting the point across that the whales can and do kill trainers. "Through the rueful voices of former trainers and whale experts, a narrative driven by disillusion and regret unfolds as the trainers point to a gap between SeaWorld's public image and behind-the-scenes reality"(New York Times). There is no other person a viewer would trust more than a former trainer to tell them the facts about how wrong SeaWorld is for treating these animals so badly. This is why the interviews during the movie are incredibly powerful. The interviews of how wrong SeaWorld is are then backed up by scenes of tour guides lying to the guest of the amusement park about facts about the whales lives. Watching the scenes and listening to what the former trainers said made me feel bad for the animals and made me want to do something to help the whales at SeaWorld after I walked away from the movie. Secondly, I would recommend Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) because it is extremely informative. Through the movie I learned many facts not only about killer whales, but also about how SeaWorld runs its business. Chris Sawin, a critic on IMDb.com, says, " While 'Blackfish' is extremely informative it also reveals a little too much at times." Although some of the facts and scenes such as watching Tilikum's sperm get extracted by trainers can be a little to graphic, to me, it is part of the movie and it is better to tell all the facts in order for the viewer to get the full picture. This was an important scene to the movie because it was explaining how Tilikum's sperm is very valuable due to his size and ability to perform. Through Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) I also learned about the process in which SeaWorld goes about capturing the whales and separating them from their families, which they are closely connected to because of an extra region in their brains that focuses on emotional connections. The movie was informative and taught me about the whale's lives while living in captivity. In conclusion, Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) was a well-made movie that provided the viewer with an extreme amount of information and also used video footage along with interviews of former SeaWorld whale trainers. The information was helpful because it gave me a better background of the whales. It also showed the correct facts about whales and how SeaWorld whales are suffering due to living in captivity. The video footage showed proof of how the whales attacked trainers and made me believe what the movie was trying to prove. By using interviews of former trainers I formed a sense of trust that what they were saying was completely true because they had experienced it first hand. I would recommend this movie to everyone that enjoys documentaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Eye-Opener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is a film directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, and centres around Killer Whale (Orca) Tilikum, who was responsible for the death of 3 people. The film explores the idea about how these deaths caused by Tilikum aren't necessarily random events where the Orca loses control and turns aggressive against his trainer, but events in which could have been predicted quite easily. Blackfish certainly reminds me of a recent documentary, The Cove, that covers the Japanese mistreatment, slaughter of innocent dolphins. Both films have, sort of, the same message; these animals we're keeping and hurting, they are intelligent beings and they deserve to roam the wild oceans in peace. Blackfish accomplishes this message, and much more, to create a difficult but very satisfying watch.I should start with the footage. It's incredible what Gabriela Cowperthwaite has managed to gather. Footage that dates back to 1983, that is in great quality, really took my breath away. A lot of this footage is really spectacular, showing both wild Orcas roaming, and the desperate, captive Orcas. Not only do we have montages of these animals performing and swimming, but we also get to witness many of the attacks that took place, by not only Tilikum, but by a range of different Orcas. It really does take you by surprise when you get to witness first hand, the attacks that very well ended people's lives. Blackfish is certainly uncomfortable, and not an average watch. This is something that will open your eyes to the corporate world, and hopefully change your opinion on whether or not wild, large, beautiful animals should be kept in captivity for our entertainment. Some may call this propaganda; I feel that they are mistaken. Blackfish is a really brilliant documentary that should be a must watch for anyone, and everyone.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone should watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I won't get any sleep tonight, this film starts out with a very disturbing story about how Tillikum was captured from the wild. I don't know what kind of heartless monster would be unmoved by his mother's anguished cries as she is separated from her baby, but if it doesn't have any effect on you then I suppose you qualify to work in seaworld's corporate office. If the whale is so safe, maybe seaworld's attorneys should be chucked into his pen and we'll see how many survive.I felt that this eye-opening film was quite balanced, they presented arguments from both sides, but seaworld declined to participate in it. Their decision to blame a girl's ponytail for her death by Tillikum was reprehensible, and when the real story came out, seaworld backpedaled like you wouldn't believe.This film brings up larger implications about wild animals; seaworld claims to be educating the public, but their shows only spread misinformation, which is documented on camera. There is no valid reason to keep an orca in captivity, certainly not for conservation efforts, which otherwise seem appropriate for threatened or endangered animals. This leaves the unsettling conclusion that seaworld is clearly exploiting the whales for financial gain and nothing more.I look forward to the day when seaworld is finally shut down by whatever means brings about its demise: a supreme court decision, a change in local laws, public outrage at the barbaric practice of keeping gigantic animals in tiny enclosures, multiple civil lawsuits lobbed at them, bankruptcy, etc. After viewing this film, does anyone else imagine Tillikum being returned to the wild? His mother might still be alive.</fullReview>

But, after watching this movie, I will never go to any park like that again. It is once again time for the human race to do some growing up and release these creatures that we have in captivity, for are own enjoyment. SeaWorld has done a lot to help animals, but no amount of good deeds could ever wipe out the death of even one person. I implore you, SeaWorld, change your ways.

		<fullReview>I am always skeptical when watching a documentary, always considering whether someone's personal agenda is being unfairly promoted in a one- sided documentary. As you watch this movie and you compare it to the time line of events reported in national news, you realize that this movie really did an amazing job at laying out all of the facts that are publicly available.In a world where emotion and logic do not necessarily align, the interviews in this movie were so incredibly heartfelt and yet so logical. Unlike some documentaries that distort the facts, this movie did not have a deceptive narrator or a comic relief script. This documentary is composed primarily of real interviews with video footage to demonstrate the basis for the interview responses. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves animals or is curious about animals.It covers many interesting facts about killer whales including social structure, family hierarchy, brain function, separation anxiety, maternal grief, wild behaviors, captive behaviors, Pavlovian conditional training, effect of reward and punishment, accidental violent behaviors, deliberate violent behaviors, how killer whales are captured, how killer whales are bred in captivity, and causes of death in captivity. The more we learn about killer whales, the more we begin to realize that we know nothing about these creatures.If violent human behavior cannot be prevented 100% of the time, how can the same be expected from wild carnivores?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was just six years old, I was visiting my relatives in Seattle, Washington when my family took me whale watching for the first time. I didn't know what whales were and didn't know why we were on the boat. When I first saw an orca dive in front of my eyes, I was shocked at the wonder in front of me. Seeing them all swim together in the gray ocean water and the gorgeous mountains in the background, it was a magnificent sight. That was how I saw orcas and I never got use to them being in tanks because that's not how I saw them. When I saw animals, I saw them in the wild. Whales, dolphins, eagles, bobcats, bears, etc. I only wanted to see them in the wild. When I had to go to zoos and aquariums for school field trips or birthday parties, I dreaded them. Since, I have moved to Seattle to be with my family and to see these beautiful animals in the wild. Of all the animals, the orcas were my favorite and "Free Willy" was the movie was watched all the time.When I was seventeen, I went SeaWorld in December of 2009 as part of a "band trip" to Florida. We also went to Disneyworld and Universal Studios. I had no interest in the Shamu show because I was used to seeing orcas and wanted to see the seal show instead. But, my fellow bandmates dragged me to the show and I tried to enjoy it. I honestly thought it was cheesy and could tell it was sugarcoated. When you are whale watching, you often get told how harsh captivity is for the orcas and how being wild is much better for them. Of course, I kept my opinion to myself and let my friends enjoy the show because, this being their first time seeing orcas in person, I wanted them to have that experience. They didn't have family in Seattle who loved orca watching like I did. I filmed the entire show and one of the trainers I filmed was Dawn Brancheau. I wouldn't actually know her name or who she was until February of 2010, a little after a month later when I heard that a trainer at SeaWorld Orlando had been killed. Right away, I knew it wasn't the animal's fault entirely. After learning so much about orcas growing up, I knew something triggered it. Immediately , everyone was blaming Brancheau. Before I made any assumptions, I watched my video from the performance I went to and recognized her. She looked fine and seemed to really love the whale. I couldn't blame her since she wasn't here to defend herself and I was not going to blame the whale.After that, I put the incident out of my head and kind of stopped whale watching all together. During a trip to Hawaii in 2012, I went whale watching to see Humpback whales. This lead me to look at whales again and, a year later, I found this movie. I watched the trailer, and cried just by the trailer alone. When I was done with the film entirely, I just wept and just said "why"? Why do we allow stuff like this happen? How can any money be more important than the well-being of these animals? This film will definitely change the way you look at SeaWorld and animal attractions for good. You will not be the same after watching this. This film goes into the whales' emotions and proves that they are almost more human than we are. The film shows that these animals are in danger from us and each other in captivity. This film made me appreciate the very first time I saw an orca in the wild before I ever saw on in a tank. Please, do the same for your children. Let them see these gorgeous creatures in the natural habitats.Watch this film. Go whale watching and forget the tanks...Also, forgive any spelling or grammar errors;)</fullReview>

It's a masterwork, a harrowing and absolutely outstanding piece of filmmaking that takes the opportunity of exploring many connected areas and raises important questions about the ethics surrounding performing animals.The documentary is a well-paced and engaging combination of talking heads and historical footage of the killer whales performing. As somebody with an interest in wildlife and conservation, I found this to be enthralling stuff that not only educated me about a species but also horrified me in the extreme.

		<shortDescription>A powerful and heartbreaking documentary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is a very effective and heartbreaking documentary from Gabriela Cowperthwaite that portrays the psychological effects captivity has on the killer whale, a creature known for it's exceptional intelligence and a surprisingly wide array of emotions. While a predator, the killer whale also has never been known to harm a human being in the wild yet, Blackfish reveals that the effects of their treatment in captivity may have changed that as a number of injuries and deaths have been attributed to these normally majestic and human friendly animals. The documentary uses the story of Tilikum, a SeaWorld resident and one of the largest killer whales in captivity who has been involved in not one but, three deaths including two trainers and one individual who chose to sneak into the park at night and was found dead draped over the animals back the following morning. While SeaWorld has attributed these deaths to trainer error or in the case of the park intruder, accidental drowning, the condition of the bodies revealed by autopsies indicate otherwise. We are painted a picture that depicts an organization that keeps these large animals in small dark tanks for hours, takes babies away from their mothers at only a few months old and puts the very family oriented animals in with unfamiliar members of it's species resulting in bullying and aggressive behavior. We get interviews with former trainers who describe the sad and sometimes cruel way these majestic beasts are treated and how SeaWorld likes to paint a far different, almost fairy tale like picture of the animals' life there. The footage we see and the trainer testimony is organized in a very effective profile of an intelligent animal that is normally gentle and friendly towards humans whose life in captivity frustrates and twists them till they become violent and aggressive to not only each other but, towards their keepers as well. And to be honest it is not only heartbreaking but, aggravating to watch. Not only for the whales treatment but, at the audacity of SeaWorld to blame the injuries and tragic deaths on the trainers themselves and not the emotional scarring of the animals they work with. The recent death of trainer Dawn Brancheau is especially focused on here and you watched with clenched fists as this woman who obviously loved her job and the animals she worked with was brutally killed by an emotional outburst by Tilikum only to have SeaWorld blame her death solely on her. If this documentary sounds bias, to a degree it has a point to make and in it's defense SeaWorld was offered a chance to appear on camera and tell their side and refused, only now issuing a statement refuting the film now that it has been shown and gotten attention. So, while the film does give a very negative view of theme parks like this and it's effects on the animals that are captive there, it wasn't like the theme parks weren't given an opportunity to have their say. And by letting Cowperthwaite paint her emotional and heartbreaking story with actual footage and testimony unchallenged, we get a powerful and moving indictment of a business that seems to turn a blind eye to it's treatment of animal and trainer alike and the sometimes fatal repercussions it has, as long as those turnstiles keep turning and the money keeps rolling in.

		<shortDescription>How can anyone be surprised?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine you are in your natural habitat and you have done nothing wrong and, all of a sudden, you get followed by people on planes and boats, who relentlessly track you down, separate you from your parents and put you in a prison which has the size of an aquarium, or make that the size of a real prison cell, as you are considerably smaller than orcas. Would you develop severe mental problems as the years go by and you realize you'll never get out into freedom again? Would you start attacking your captors when you have the chance? I know, I would. The real surprise is that these Orcas mostly play along during the shows and incidents only happen once in a couple years. One of the ex-trainers interviewed for the film said that the only surprising thing was that it took so long for another fatality (experienced trainer Dawn Brancheau) and I totally agree.Yep, it says "ex-trainer" as all attempts from the filmmakers to interview current trainers and Sea World officials remained unsuccessful. "Blackfish" is really an impressive documentary. It focuses on the male orca Tilikum and also on a couple other Orcas who lived in captivity in Sealand back in the day and in Seaworld now. The focus of the film is mostly on those moments where something went wrong and people (especially trainers) were pulled underwater by the killer whales. Can you really blame them? They were taken from their world as babies and now they are taking humans from their world deep down into the water. Whenever one of these incidents happened, Sea World was very quick with their response in the form of a statement to the press that it was solely the trainer's fault. In Dawn Brancheau's case, they blamed her ponytail. All for profit and animal abuse, I guess. Just make sure money keeps coming in. The most disgusting thing, however, is that they accused the documentary makers and those who tried to get a deeper insight into her case of them being the ones who have no respect for her family and exploiting her tragedy. I thought this was so shocking and sad.The possibly biggest move away from Seaworld in the film was about an incident on the Canaries. They had a couple orcas as well, but they really weren't prepared or trained to deal with the responsibility of setting up such a show. Consequently, one trainer was killed, according to his friends and colleagues possibly even the most talented trainer they had and this section of the film is a perfect example how it's not only Tilikum, but can always happen. Orcas can not be compared to animals like tigers or sharks as they pose not really much of a danger to men even if you enter their habitat. If you take them and imprison them, it's a whole different story of course. The saddest part of the film was in my opinion when one of the captors (by now, obviously aware of the errors in his ways back then) describes very graphically the way they got the little orcas into captivity and you must be really cold at heart if you don't shed a couple tears there. Later on, there's a similar part where a young orca gets separated from its mother, both already in captivity at this point which is very moving too when we find out about the mother's reaction in the coming days and weeks, especially as scientists have discovered that orcas have a brain very different to those from men that makes them perceive everything much more emotionally and now think of how you would react if somebody took your child from you. The ending, however, was on a much more positive note as we see the former trainers meet and enter wildlife where they encounter orcas that don't live in captivity and don't have that depressingly folded dorsal fin which is so common for Orcas held in captivity and could maybe seen as an equivalent to self-mutilation for humans suffering from depression."Blackfish" is the best documentary I've seen from 2013 so far and one of the five best films as well. It's emotionally investing and it worked so well for me, because I'm always eager about films that tell about animal rights (or the lack thereof). But even, if you're not usually into that as much as I am, you will probably have a "good" time watching "Blackfish", especially if you enjoyed the Academy-Award winning documentary "The Cove". Don't mistake it for a wildlife documentary though, it's frequently very cruel and graphic (just the way it should be with this topic) and I wouldn't recommend taking smaller children to the theater to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The blame on Sea World is just the tip of the iceberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's true that Blackfish is one of the most moving and terrifying documentaries ever done on the issue of animal abuse. You will be moved by it like few times before. That I guarantee.But aside from all the 'don't go to Sea World' feeling, Blackfish is about our relationship with nature, our poor knowledge of animal behavior and the levels of cruelty we exact on other species and even our own just for fun and profit. The footage is absolutely disturbing, with interviews from former Sea World trainers and witnesses to some unfortunate accidents, along with real footage of things gone so horribly wrong you wonder how nobody before dared to challenge Sea World and similar theme parks for their total disrespect towards animals and human beings.But at the same time you get a wider sense of awareness of our own society, and you can't help but think this is the way our corporate world deals with everything, from client service to human and animal lives. You know you've seen animal abuse documentaries before, but this one is about us as a negligent race and it's presented in a way that hits so hard it's immoral not to start caring.There are some scenes here that will crawl deep into your thoughts and dreams and, if you consider yourself a sensitive person, they won't let go for a long time. But other than just feeling this deep sense of rage and humbleness, I think it's time to take some matters at hand and, first of all, stop allowing yourself to 'ignore' these kind of things. Ignorance is a sin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sister recommended I watch this. I didn't know what to expect as I didn't know what it was about. I was completely blown over. As an animal lover it pains me to see any animal treated badly, and I have never thought much beyond the entertainment value of these types of theme park. Blackfish was incredibly emotional. Yes it was edited well, and yes they are very obviously making a point against SeaWorld, but that aside you can't deny the facts... the facts that SeaWorld try to warp to suit their own points/pockets/whatever. After the film I did some researching of my own on the internet, just to make sure I hadn't been suckered in to believing untruths... the bottom line is Orcas, and any other animal or marine mammal, need to live in the wild, and plucking them from their natural habitat is the reason why Tilikum and other poor SeaWorld 'puppets' behave the way they do. I highly recommend this film, if nothing else but to open people's horizons a little more and really make them think about whether they want to be supporting these multi-billion dollar companies, whose main aim at the end of the day is to fill their own pockets, at whatever expense to our precious animal kingdom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More a polemic than documentary at times, but it is effective as such</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film long before I got to seeing it; there are a couple of very liberal media outlets that I use and this film was very much promoted on them ? so I had heard good things but was conscious that it was maybe from an easy audience sector. Anyway, I knew enough about it to be pretty sure that we wouldn't be hearing much from Seaworld in the film itself and indeed at the end it is confirmed that they refused to be interviewed for this film. Many have pointed out that this makes the film rather one-sided, but personally I do not think that having an official Seaworld presence in the film would have made much of a difference to that and to be honest it is probably for the best that they didn't get involved.I say this because, although it is not too unfair or aggressive, the film really is a polemic rather a passive documentary; the case is made in a systematic and effective fashion, building the case and it does it in a way that is really hard to not be affected by. The film is at its best when it is as much of a documentary as it can be ? so informing the viewer of the nature of orca whales in the wild, their community and their connections, because this then informs us about the actions taken to separate families from one another ? and like the massive butch guy who can barely talk about doing it, it is hard not to be really moved by the idea and the reality. Other such contrasts are well done, such as the statements on lifespan etc, however the film doesn't always do it as well.Relating to the older actions (and the illegal ones in particular), the film is a bit unfair to present these next to a silent Seaworld ? I know they are not involved but it would have been nice to hear the film confirm if they had ever admitted wrong doing etc. Just mentioning it and moving on makes it look like it was gotten away with, never addressed looking back etc. The interviews with the ex-trainers are all pretty engaging and emotive but there is a lot of personal statement and issues-driven passion in there; this is fine but it means the film has to do a bit to make sure it remains a documentary ? I think it could have done more in that regard.These are flaws in the film as a documentary but even with these it is hard to really take the subject and conclusions to issue. It builds its case well, presenting the base of cruelty and the impact to trainers and animals of the Seaworld shows. It does push too far to one side and it doesn't really give you food for thought so much as conclusions, but it is an impacting film and it is hard for me to really take issue with what it is saying even if I had reservations over how it says it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is nothing more but a proof of how GREEDY, cruel, heartless, brutal and inhumane we, humans, are. We care so much about our own welfare and our money, that we are perfectly willing to trade absolutely anything for it. Watching this poor creature in documentary, literally broke my heart. What beasts we are. Tolerating such torture. Even supporting this by visiting such shows. Teaching our children that not only there is nothing wrong if we treat animals like that, but this is also our entertainment and we should enjoy in this torture of innocent animals.This documentary deserves the best publicity, so it would reach as many people as possible. Maybe that's how all cruelty parks will close their gates and we will help those beautiful and intelligent creatures to be free again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We have nothing on the Romans for animal cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie makes the case that the commercial captivity of Orcas (AKA Killer Whales) is cruel and has resulted in a number of cases of the whales acting out and killing or injuring their trainers.Some of the film is quite disturbing to watch, including scenes where the whales attack their trainers, but honestly, given how these whales are treated, can you really blame them? Most disturbing scene- trainers engaged in the collection of seed from Tilikim to impregnate other whales in captivity. No, seriously, once you've seen it, you can't unsee it. Also disturbing, dozens of whales across the world in these parts are his descendants.Overall, an effective documentary that makes its points very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cautionary Tale About Killer Whales Showing the Limitations of Human Understanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BLACKFISH tells the story of Tilkum, a killer whale bred in captivity, who ended up taking the lives of several people, most recently trainer Dawn Brancheau. Many reviewers have already commented on the ways in which director Gabriela Cowperthwaite uses the documentary to comment on the ways in which Seaworld exploits the killer whales for financial gain, while claiming to treat them humanely. What perhaps emerges most tangibly from her narrative is the limitations of human understanding surrounding these creatures; they are either perceived as friendly, cuddly creatures or as killer predators. Little attempt has been made to try and construct alternative behavioral models that take into account the fact that killer whales are highly intelligent creatures who think and react in certain ways in the wild. While the documentary includes several interviews with experts in whale behavior, it seems that they are lone voices: many of the former Seaworld trainers - who provide evidence of the ways in which captive whales were treated - come across as well-meaning yet basically ignorant. They were perfectly content to parrot Seaworld's official propaganda to incredulous audiences, but spent little time or energy trying to discover things for themselves. In that sense BLACKFISH comes across as a cautionary tale of how capitalism constructs false dreams that often prove so convincing that no one bothers to try and challenge them. As a result, it is the killer whales that suffer. The fact that such creatures strike back is seldom due to the fact that they are "angry" or "resentful" of their trainers, but rather borne out of frustration with a life in which they absolutely no power of self-determination. BLACKFISH is an angry documentary, but is no less compelling for being so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best documentary I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film explores the hidden (yet obvious) dangers of working with animals that belong in the wild, the context of my use of the word "hidden" is to portray the lengths SeaWorld go to to shield the public eye from what is actually happening to these animals, &amp; when things have gone wrong.When one of their most experienced trainers is killed working with one of the animals an enquiry is held into finding out what happened, a resulting court case follows, whereby SeaWorld always maintain that it is, in someway, the trainers fault.What shocked me the most, other than the conditions these animals are housed in, is the lies - the fabrication of facts about these animals, the fake perception that the animals are happy in their surroundings, how they are housed with their families. All lies.The footage of the incidents will genuinely shock you, you will feel angry &amp; sad that this is happening &amp;, like me, you will struggle to understand how this is still happening.When you see Tilikum floating motionless in his holding tank you will realise just how wrong this is.This film gave me genuine insight into what is going on &amp; to what I would otherwise be ignorant to.

		<shortDescription>Disturbing ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story orca whales in captivity at SeaWorld. There many interviews with former SeaWorld trainers, and footage from SeaWorld shows and training sessions including some whale attacks on humans.The documentary is well made ? maybe not spectacular, but concise, well-edited, and balanced considering the subject matter. I don't doubt that the filmmakers have a particular point of view, but I wouldn't call the film biased or narrow in scope. Even though the interviews reflect general agreement, there is still lot of variety due to different personalities and experiences.The film is filled with anecdotes and detailed information about operations at SeaWorld, with some material about SeaWorld's predecessor "Sealand" and a few other places. All the interviewees are articulate and believable. The interviews and footage relating to the capture of whales - though not a major part of the film - are particularly interesting.I'm sure this film will be labeled one-sided by some. There is no editorializing in the film - all the opinions expressed are those of the people being interviewed. The filmmakers state that SeaWorld repeatedly refused to be interviewed, and I believe them. Experts seem to agree that orca whales don't do well in captivity. It seems a lose-lose situation for the filmmakers - either be accused of bias or be accused of diminishing opposing viewpoints by presenting individuals who are unqualified or ridiculous.I don't think SeaWorld is the devil. Many human activities are harmful to animals. But I think this film is the truth. I believe it shows SeaWorld for what it is ? a somewhat unholy place, and just wrong.Everyone considering a trip to SeaWorld should watch this film first. Maybe it will convince you to try a whale watch instead.</fullReview>

Everyone should see this movie, it is heartbreaking. The story line is build up great, you first see the fun stuff and the cute parts.

Watched it with my whole family and it was like taking a blindfold off. I've never enjoyed whale shows, but I'm now appalled at any animal act. I say get a good dog, love it and train it and be impressed with its willingness to obey and desire to impress you. Leave all the rest of the animals on the planet alone.

		<shortDescription>Black Waters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Recommended) This documentary by Gabriela Cowperthwaite has a specific point of view in dealing with the mistreatment of whales in captivity, specifically at SeaWorld Amusement Park. Using archival footage and interviews with former SeaWorld trainers and animal rights activists, Blackfish effectively explores this controversial issue. (SeaWorld refused to participate in any interviews for the film, but has since taken out many full page ads to combat any negative publicity.) That said, the film is a well-made and powerful indictment against their policy. The film's strongest impact is in its actual news footage of documented attacks by these captive mammals to SeaWorld trainers, resulting in three deaths, and the eloquent words of the interviewees about the human loss and inhumane conditions for the killer whales. Director Cowperthwaite has created a compelling film that not only shows the lack of compassion to these animals, but questions their unethical treatment at the sea park. Also coming into question is the media spin of the SeaWorld organization and its corporate policies. Blackfish appeals to any moviegoers' emotions and the filmmakers could have used some distance in presenting its case.Missing from the film are more interviews with family members and their legal battles with SeaWorld, an important aspect which is only glossed over. Granted, a more objective vision and SeaWorld's own participation would have made the film balanced and more effective. It is a story that needs to be told. Nevertheless, whether you are pro or con, this documentary is making waves as Blackfish presents its convincing, though biased, exposé on animal cruelty for all the world to see and personally judge for themselves.

		<fullReview>This is an advocacy documentary film about the dangers of the orca show at Sea World, and the viability of confining these creatures in such small spaces. It's a strictly one sided film with Sea World not participating. I can certainly see the reason why they didn't participate.I won't say I agree with everything in the documentary. However, the real footage of these dangerous encounters are truly eye opening. If a documentary is suppose to bring something to a wider discussion, this one has done that for me. I could never bring anybody to see the show at Sea World.In many ways, these are like a tiger, lion, or a bear in a circus. It has dangers, but orcas travel much further and they're much bigger. It should be a serious discussion as to whether orcas should be kept captive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish is an overlooked documentary that changes your outlook on killer whale captivity, no matter how preachy it may be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2012, SeaWorld Orlando placed as the tenth most attended amusement park in the United States, garnering over five million visits that year. Since it opened in 1973 (nine years after sister park SeaWorld San Diego opened), SeaWorld has been a wildly popular amusement park for fans of marine animals. Home to a wide variety of sea animals, including killer whales that SeaWorld are known for, SeaWorld has successfully established itself as a household name for amusement park junkies. However, the SeaWorld company has gotten a good deal of flak in recent years over several incidents involving their largest and most famous whale, Tilikum. With three deaths reported by this whale alone, there's certainly something wrong with the situation. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite delves deeper into the story with Blackfish, an overlooked documentary that changes your outlook on killer whale captivity, no matter how preachy it may be.Blackfish primarily tracks the life of aforementioned orca Tilikum, from his capture in Iceland in 1983 to the death of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010. Along the way, director Gabriela Cowperthwaite takes note of the many incidents caused by Tilikum, tying them all back to a recurring theme: animal captivity. Backed up by heartbreaking interviews with former SeaWorld whale trainers, Blackfish points out the SeaWorld company for what it's really doing to these animals.Blackfish is a phenomenal documentary for what it's worth. Managing to be powerful, thought-provoking, and thrilling, Blackfish is a perfect example of an engrossing documentary. It's a little slow to start getting interesting, but once it does, it pulls you in and never lets go (no Tilikum reference intended). Not only is Blackfish about the incidents involving Tilikum; it's about how captivity is the main cause of this aggression, and how SeaWorld is lying to their tourists about this. The film is preachy at times, but only due to the lack of information relayed from SeaWorld themselves.The documentary has it's fair share of problems, but they aren't able to bring down how well-done this documentary really is. The pacing isn't perfect for the first third of the movie and it's overly preachy at times, but Blackfish is masterfully directed by Cowperthwaite, aggressively thrilling, and eye opening towards the subject of orcas in captivity. Blackfish is a must see for anyone, especially those with a history of SeaWorld visits or a large interest in marine animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New reasoning tools</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has already sparked a debate, a good thing. Viewers are split between those who use the case of a killing orca as argument against animal captivity, much less for corporate profit, and those who like to point holes in the emotional or scientific appeal of the argument to avoid having to find a real issue. I side with the first but with some reservations which I'm going to elaborate on.See, a film like this is a great opportunity, starting from the issue at hand, the issue could be anything, to re-examine our whole reasoning tools we use to approach things. So how apt that at the center of the debate is an attempt, on both sides, to surmise how a living thing reasoned about things.We have this whale that killed not once or twice, but three times. Suits tried to shush the whole thing because there's money at stake, it's what they always do. But was it accident or deliberation? Is it in the nature of the animal to kill or did it go 'mad' by conditions? We see a video of another orca who grabs a trainer by the foot and won't let go, eventually breaking both her arm and leg. Moments earlier she was petting the animal by the pool. This one thankfully survived, though it's just as likely that she wouldn't. We see another video of another orca who grabs a trainer by the foot and sinks him down with her, keeps him for a few minutes then comes up for air, repeating two or three times, nearly killing the poor guy. He was an experienced scuba diver so managed his breaths and kept his cool. Eventually the animal let go, though again this was chance. It's all as simple as this. Speaking of 'psychosis' caused by the circumstances confers the illusion of an acquired 'illness'. Speaking about 'violent genes' again makes a muddle of things, though there's a recent study on mice that shows how fearful memories can pass down to a later generation. As groundbreaking as evolution if it's confirmed, but we don't have to go that far. I am never going to be a good painter or banker because I was implanted at birth with some gene of painting or banking.We have these videos of near-death accidents, as well as a very interesting report on the last death of a very experienced and cautious trainer. Apparently the animal could hear that the bucket of fish was nearing its end, made a full round of greeting with its fin for which it was not rewarded, its enthusiasm according to other trainers present waned at that point and in the next number she mangled her trainer. This after a long history of abusive confinement and inter-species aggression.Animals don't think, have no consciousness of self, but they have rich perceptual fields of understanding, often much richer than our own. We do have a cogito and yet give ourselves over to the most irrationally animal behavior, just do your round of pubs on a Saturday night. There is never going to be any precise science of how the interweaving of experience leads to a sudden fight about really nothing. In the video where an orca grabs the trainer's foot, she might as well have been toying with her.It's not easy to say exactly what caused each accident, but moreover it's really beside the point. The thing is, we don't have to base our whole reasoning approach on logical causation, and I don't need to know the precise physics involved in skiing to be able to ski.This shouldn't be an excuse to ignore the absurd confinement of large animals for daily shows, nor should it be a call to abandon any effort to cultivate a world in the name of naturalism. There must be a way that allows us to come into contact with the wonderful creatures that live next to us that doesn't ignore the fact they are soulful beings.The way we think and the way we act on things are linked, transforming one affects the other. What we see reveals enough: animals are neither pets nor things, the relationship can't be built on maximizing profits, our curiosity to learn and co-exist must come to terms with accident.Interesting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eye opening expose of the back story of Tilikum, the Orca that killed at least two people. Tilikum's life story is heartbreaking. Sea World's cynical and dishonest handling of this incident as well as other aggressive behavior against humans is outrageous. There are a number of aggressive incidents by Orcas on their trainers that were covered up even from other trainers who needed to know.Tilikum's attack did not happen in a vacuum.Callous behavior towards Orcas, an intelligent affectionate animal continues because of money and, perhaps, denial on the part of management.To know the horrifying reasons for Tilikum's behavior is reason enough to see the film. As distressing as these killings are your sympathies are likely to be with Tilikum as well as with the hapless, innocent trainers who walked into these situations naive about what had happened in the past."Blackfish" will hold your attention. It is more than just an expose. "Blackfish" is a well crafted and compelling story. You will not be bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll be scraping plans for the family holiday to Sea World after seeing Blackfish, Gabriela Cowperthwaite's eye opening and frankly quite scary documentary focussing on the captivity of Orca whales and in particular Tilikum a male killer whale that has a proved track record of violence towards humans.Blackfish is no doubt a very objectionable documentary where all talking heads involved are against the incarceration of these great beasts but then again the arguments and evidence presented by Cowperthwaite are hard to deny. Cowperthwaite does a fantastic job of offering reasons behind whales acting out and it's clear to see that these animals have more going on emotionally and mentally than many humans would give them credit for. This is particularly evident in the films centrepiece Tilikum.Tilikum as explained in the film was captured at a young age and suffered abuse at the hands of other whales in his various enclosures. This abuse and mistreatment has lead the whale to become angry and unpredictable resulting in the death of 3 human beings. The cover up and misleading of information regarding these deaths is quite astounding and ex-trainers of Sea World talk openly about how stunned they were that the truth behind the deaths is hidden in the public. These startling facts and first-hand accounts by trainers are all major reasons why Blackfish is a must see.Blackfish may not be the most daring or inventive documentary to reach our shores this year and it's one sided documentation of its argument can be seen of somewhat of a downfall but it's never less than compelling viewing and deserves to be seen by as many people as possible as an example of humans being humans ? that is being to stupid to admit they are wrong.3 and a half dorsal fins out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartfelt Documentary That Leaves an Indelible Mark on Your Psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 5/5 starsAnybody who loves animals, or even cares for them moderately, or even those who just have a shred of humanity in them, simply have to watch the documentary film - "Blackfish" - that released a few months ago.You'll be disgusted at the heinous acts perpetrated on the innocent, sentient, and supremely intelligent whales by the most ruthless creature to ever walk this planet - "Man"! It's an emotional, sad journey, which is sure to make a morally conscious person question the sanctity of the human race, and perhaps be appalled at the absolute apathy and callousness with which so many humans lead their lives.One last thing, whatever you do, if you ever visit America, or plan to settle there, or are currently residing in the country; please never buy a ticket to that despicable cesspool masquerading as an aquatic themed marine-entertainment park - "Sea World".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Numerous problems discredit this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish presents many arguments against captivity but no solutions. And it doesn't help that some people involved like Lori Marino, are known extremists. One of the biggest issues with Blackfish is that there are no interviews with family members of the three people whose deaths involved Tilikum. Perhaps they are bound by settlement agreements. I don't know why they are not interviewed. In the case of Dawn Brancheau, it seems that her family is against Blackfish. It seems like the interview with the fiancée and mother of the man killed at Loro Parque in the Canary Islands is meant to shift the viewer's attention off the lack of interviews with family members of other victims. There are also no interviews with other people involved in killer whale attacks that were not fatal. At least one, Ken Peters, does still work for SeaWorld. But are the others who are not still employed bound by agreements or is something else going on? There is no given answer to that question. The film makes sure the viewer knows that SeaWorld refused to comment. But what about the former employees who survived attacks or family members of the people who were killed by Tilikum. Why is there no mention of their refusal? I also didn't like that the viewer is not told when the former trainers interviewed started working at SeaWorld and when they left SeaWorld. Many had not worked there for 12+ years before the death of Dawn. It seems implied that some left because of her death, but many left had left long before. I also have a problem with the director not disclosing that Jett was demoted and that Gomersall and Ventre were both fired. Many of these trainers never worked with Tilikum and some barely worked with the whales at all.Many of these former trainers described incidents that they did not witness but claim knowledge of to analyze. I found the critique of Dawn's final performance to contain a lot of victim blaming. They say that food was running out, but that is false. There are always more buckets of fish handy. There are numerous times when Tilikum and other whales are referring to as psychopathic but that doesn't track with the relationships those whales have with other whales. Tilikum has always done well with his children, Orkid gets along with most whales in San Diego, and Kasatka is a good mom and matriarch.The attack on Ken Peters is presented without context. The film acts like it is not known why it happened, but it is known. Once Peters dove into the water be heard Kalia, a then 2 year old calf of Kasatka's, give out a cry. But Kalia was in a different pool. So it happened because Kasatka wanted to go check on her daughter. It is worth noting that Peters still works with Kasatka, but none of the parks do water works anymore with the killer whales.Kelly F. Clark's testimony during the OSHA hearings is also edited to make her seem evil. But they omit where she acknowledges that the whales at Loro Parque are owned by SeaWorld, and make it seem like she lied. Their also omit her saying that she is not the best person to ask about business related questions because her experience is related to animal care and training.Another issue I had was the omission of Taima, a female whale, Tilikum had numerous calves with, but died during birth in the months following Dawn's death. They also don't mention that he apparently got along with Takara, before she was moved to San Antonio. Given how the concept of whales feeling loss is mentioned in regard to mother and calf separation, it feels odd to not mention that Tilikum would also be lethargic due to loss of companions. At present he spends at least some of his day with Trua, a grandson. You can see videos of them performing together and in the underwater viewing area if you look on YouTube. But he is separated from other children and grandchildren that reside in Orlando. He used to spend time with Malia, a daughter, but they are believed to have not been grouped together in recent years, possibly to prevent inbreeding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That expression about learning something new, everyday, came into play for me today. I have heard a lot of hype regarding this new documentary, and seen that it was on Netflix. As I sat down to eat dinner, I turned it on just to see what it was about. I ended up watching the whole film, despite that originally not being the plan.I live very close to Toronto, where Ripley's Aquarium of Canada has just been put up. I have been wanting to take my girlfriend there for quite sometime now. However, what this documentary points out, is that the underwater creatures who will be living in places such as this aquarium are held in captivity.Taken away from family, and the ocean. Stuck in a jail of sorts. Forced to eat meals, and entertain, instead of living naturally, doing what they wish, when they wish. Blackfish takes a focus on orca's, or killer whales, who work in theme parks. The park used in the documentary is SeaWorld.I never actually put much thought into this before. Or even knew about any of the deaths caused by the killer whales who perform in the parks. Did you know that no killer whale in the wild has ever murdered a human? Only those held captive have.Did you know that killer whales, have the same life span as a human? Unfortunately, the whales held captive only live around thirty to fifty years at most.The main focus of this film is to fight against whales being held in captivity, and illustrate the consequences of it. Some of the testimonies by former SeaWorld trainers use worlds like barbaric or cruel, and claim that it will be something that will be frowned upon in future generations, to describe the whales captivity.One whale in particular, named Tilikum, gets the spotlight, for his role in the death of three people. The most recent one, in 2010, is the one discussed with the most detail. Fun, but not so fun in reality fact, Tilikum is still breeding, and performing today despite his murderous past.And I am not saying he should be punished for it, nor are the trainers in this film. What I am saying though, is that watching this documentary will open your eyes, and make you think about whether it can be justified or not, that SeaWorld insists on still using this troubled animal to breed and perform?The trainers interviewed in this film seemed to truly love the whales, and had grown close connections to them. It is remarkable to watch how one trainer who is in serious danger handles the situation of being attacked. I am not going to deny how horrible the SeaWorld owners look due the outlook in this documentary.The film makes a point to show how many lies, and possible cover ups are using in order for them to stay in business. How much is true, and how much is false? It seems like SeaWorld are not willing to tell us, as they declined to provide interviews for this documentary. And blamed the latest death by killer whale, on the victim herself.That is perhaps the only thing this film is missing. Hearing two sides of the story is always better than one, but since SeaWorld refuse to talk, we are unable to get it.With that aside, this was a very educational, yet an entertaining viewing, and it gave me a different outlook on how captive animals are treated. I watched it hours ago, yet images and thoughts are still stuck in my mind. If you love animals, or just want to learn something new, look no further. I cannot promise you will not be frustrated, angered, and full of emotion afterwards though.Gabrieila Cowperthwaite made her point clear as water with this well made piece of hard work.Superpower Film Scale: 4/5 On The Verge of greatness1: Villainous Waste2: Careless Bystander3: Hero unaware of powers4.

		<fullReview>'BLACKFISH': Four Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed documentary film about killer whales and the inhumane way they're treated in captivity, as well as the disastrous outcome that it results in (both for the whales and humans). The movie was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. It was produced by Cowperthwaite and Manuel V. Oteyza and written by Cowperthwaite and Eli B. Despres. It centers on a SeaWorld orca, known as Tilikum, who was involved in the death of three people. The movie is depressing and highly disturbing but it's also educational and important for most to see.Cowperthwaite decided to make the film after the death of Tilikum's trainer Dawn Brancheau (who was killed by the orca). The incident caused a lawsuit and a law preventing trainers from performing in the water next to the whales (which SeaWorld is trying to appeal). The documentary traces the history of Tilikum's captivity form his capture near Iceland in 1983. It makes a very good argument for why keeping these enormous mammals locked up (in such small spaces) is inhumane and how this treatment aggravates them and can result in hostile activity (which is what most likely caused the death of Brancheau and two others).I went to the Benton County Fair (near where I live) last summer and saw some touring wild animals, that were locked up in extremely small cages, directly across from a very loud live rock band. They looked miserable and dangerous (pacing back and forth in agitated and upset ways). That was disturbing enough but this film is even more so. It was really informative for me (as I knew little to nothing about the events depicted in the movie) and excruciatingly heart wrenching to watch. It's definitely a very disturbing and horrendous film but it's also a really important one. Hopefully things change for SeaWorld whales in the near future (and the current way of life for most animals in captivity). I think the filmmakers responsible for this documentary did a very good job of trying to make it become a reality.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAydMPYt0Hs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gabriela Cowperthwaite, the director of this shocking documentary, gives the accounts of trainers and whale experts who reflect on the grace and beauty of these magnificent whales, their highly elevated emotional lives, their difficulty in relating to others not from their culture or nation, and the whale-on-whale aggressiveness that comes from being confined in such small areas.We see the cruelty of separating whale calves from their mothers and listening to the howls of the mothers' grief.This film is mostly about the human failings that allow such barbarism to continue unchecked. Informative, impassioned and damningly indicting. We can easily see why so many bands have pulled out of the Seaworld festival next year.They deserve a better life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A whale has eaten one of the trainers." Dispatch Recording The notorious killer whale, Tilikum, has killed 3 trainers but remains alive and incarcerated in Sea World as an object of fan fascination. The absorbing and grim doc Blackfish pretty much deflates any lingering romanticism as it presents a credible case for freeing orcas forever from the confinement of aquariums, which may cause the fish to be psychotic. Case in point: Tilikum.Blackfish doesn't easily walk the thin line between entertainment owners making money on orcas and activists dedicated to eradicating cruelty to animals. Director/writer Gabriela Cowperthwaite keeps a consistently humane point of view with talking heads, mostly former SeaWorld trainers, clearly upset with the methods they once sanctioned and the growing awareness of the lethal danger of playing with the black beauties.Although he filmmakers unsuccessfully tried to contact SeaWorld for comment, the doc seems a bit empty without their corporate spin. Yet they do have in their corner orca expert David Duffus, who strongly claims the killers are non-lethal with "spiritual powers." The doc's raw footage contradicts any benign consistency in the orcas. The most Duffus can say that is true is to defend the SeaWorlds of the world as harboring "natural" killers.The history of capture-to-performance is a stunning case of fish out of water. Herding the lovely behemoths decades ago was a monstrous hunt. Killer whales are frustrated about their confinement and may eventually take it out on trainers, who, until a recent court ruling, embraced and rode the whales without apparently honoring the danger of a wild animal weighing over 6000 lbs.This grim and mesmerizing doc effectively warns all of us about the "crime" of corralling wild animals. After deaths and numerous close calls, orca trainers must now work behind fences. SeaWorld is appealing the decision.</fullReview>

I have overlooked man's (or shall I say corporate's) cruelty to such intelligent and social animal like the "killer whales". I can't imagine how we could snatch the baby whales from their mothers and forced them to live and train in captivity. What give us the right to play god?No wonder the animals behave with brutality toward trainers. I guess this is their only way to express their frustration and misery. It is sad to see $ can blind a corporate world like SeaWorld. I am proud to see trainers speak up on behalf of Tili. Not all of us have lost the human compassion &amp; respect toward wildlife animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is a documentary about orcas at SeaWorld and the treatment of the orcas in captivity. Since this movie was released, SeaWorld has seen a major decline in business, so this documentary has had a big impact. Blackfish is constructed from archive footage and interviews only, so it's a very neutral documentary that never feels like it's been tampered with. As a result, it's a very authentic movie which feels truthful. The film becomes pretty gut-wrenching at times, and conveys its message very well. The interviews are well handled and the information delivered is clear and easy to understand, while the archive footage is well selected. Blackfish doesn't quite manage to avoid being biased despite its neutral approach. By failing to show both sides of the argument and seemingly making the same point repeatedly, this does ultimately feel overly heavy at times, so it's not a flawless documentary, but is a very good one which achieves its objective successfully and gets its point across. The impact it has had on SeaWorld is evidence of the documentary's skill, and while it's not the most lively and heart-pounding documentary out there, in many ways this adds to the experience and makes it more emotionally powerful by just giving the upsetting facts in an objective, authentic manner. You'll probably never look at SeaWorld the same way again, but this is a really good documentary and definitely worth a look.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is a documentary about how Orcas are mistreated and incidents that happen involving the animals are always swept under the rug. The movie discusses how Orcas aren't meant to live in captivity, but Sea World uses them anyway. They also bring up how they shouldn't be put in such small tanks to live out their entire life when wild Orcas have the whole ocean. The film also discusses a certain incident with a certain whale named Tilikum. Tilikum was the best whale Sea World had ever had until he started to become aggressive and he had a few incidents with trainers and such. Sea World never realized the aggressive gene this whale had in it s body until it was too late. They had been using his semen to basically create more Tilikums, and it would bring the aggressive trait with them. The films ultimate purpose was to get the information out to people about how killer whales don't need to live in captivity. They don't belong in such small environments with how big they are, and they also don't deserve to be mistreated and torn away from their families or their natural habitat. The point went across very well with most viewers and by the end, most people were on board. The film has a few strengths and a few weaknesses. There are some good arguments throughout the film, like how they bring up that Sea World employees blatantly tell visitors completely wrong facts about the whales and such, either because they are misinformed or because they've known and do it anyway. At the same time, the film seems to be very one sided and barely ever brings up the other side of the argument. There is one scene where a man is brought in to argue to the side of Sea World, and then never appears again throughout the documentary. This film has plenty of value to it and it discusses a real problem in today's captivity. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in environmental advocacy or anyone that wants to get informed on the issue of Orcas in captivity and the story of Tilikum.</fullReview>

Creates a strong argument on the subject of captivity without appealing in any time to the orderly and explicit explanation of the topic.

		<shortDescription>If you have ever enjoyed a childhood experience at SeaWorld, you do not watch this documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish takes you on an emotional journey through the lives of Dawn Brancheau's fellow trainers and the orcas that they worked with. The largest male orca held in captivity, Tilikum, was responsible for the death of Ms. Brancheau during a SeaWorld performance. This documentary shows footage of the supposed capture of Tilikum, presumably from when he was only 2 years old. One of the first particularly emotional moments came when a seaman recalled his experiences with rounding up and snatching the baby orcas from the rest of their pod. The now elderly man says that it was quite possibly the worst thing that he had ever done in his entire life. With this account, the film takes a wild emotional journey through the orca's life, where unnecessary, tear jerking scores are being played to accompany the already miserable looking orcas. Throughout the film, numerous trainers appear in interviews about their experiences with Tilikum throughout his life. Alongside these trainers were interviews with people that had very vague credentials. One lower third in the film simply read "Neuroscientist", which seems very broad and indirectly related to marine wildlife. Nevertheless, the interviews did present incredibly realistic and genuine information about Orcas and their nature in the wild. The whole objective of this film is to convince you that SeaWorld killed Dawn Brancheau, and the orcas were as innocent as a beaten child. The direction of this documentary will capture the attention of nearly any audience. Every shot in the film flows well from idea to idea and contributes to the smooth transitions from happy to sad that take place throughout. The underwater shots of the various attacks in the water show just how real the danger was for the trainers. Those same underwater shots also conveyed the great level of dexterity coming from both the trainers and the orcas under the surface. The director pieces together various contexts with the use of other media, compared to just relying on the visual aspects of the film. It was easy to go from clutching a box of Kleenex to sitting on the edge of the seat in amazement.Blackfish highly personifies the orcas with every opportunity they have. If you want to watch a documentary about orcas and not feel like its your fault for enjoying their aptitudes, do not watch this one. If you have ever enjoyed a childhood experience at SeaWorld, you do not watch this documentary either. There are scenes that will make you believe that the captive orca is the most depressed animal ever recorded. One particular scene shows Tilikum in his holding tank, which he appears to be resting in. By par of the director, the orchestral strings begin to pull on the strings of your heart, as it sets the scene for gloom and depression. Of course, this scene was shown after he was torn from his family. The reality is, there is no way to know if Tilikum is sleeping or crying, and the director takes advantage of that mystery. When watching this documentary, being wary of a few things can help your mind stay on track. Think about every trainer's story that is told in the beginning of the film, and remember their roots and how "oblivious" they were at the beginning of their SeaWorld careers. Now that they are no longer employed by SeaWorld, they have immaculate recollections of all that took place in the confines of the orca pool. Chances are, they are ex-trainers for a reason, and have every reason to speak out against their former employees. The reality lies in the fact that the orcas could not be predicted, as defined in the court case against SeaWorld. Orcas are very intelligent mammals, but very much not human. You will have to remind yourself that throughout this entire documentary; I know I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SeaWorld: Exposed at Last!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a commercial about SeaWorld this morning. The staff was telling us that they don't collect killer whales from the wild. They also told us that they have the highest standard of animal care in the world, and captive whales live just as long as they do in the wild. I realized that they were lying to us. I told my mother about that commercial and I told her about a film called Blackfish. My mother went to Netflix and a few clicks later, we were able to watch the film. We couldn't believe what we saw in that documentary. We were crying throughout some of the film.When we were finished, my mother told me that she didn't know about it and I was glad that I showed her the truth. First of all, the director needs to applauded for her effort to expose the park. It was not easy for her. SeaWorld has been trying to defend the film since it was released. If Cowperthwaite were to be given a lie detector test, she would pass with flying colors. She is (indeed) telling the truth. Next, the film has accurately explained the horrors of whale captivity at SeaWorld. The tradegy of Tilikum was an unforgettable and poignant story. Tilikum was being bullied by two female whales. He was being picked on, bitten and scraped by the whales. On top of all this, Tilikum had a collapsed dorsal fin, which is a sign of poor health for captive orcas. Overall, I think the film was scientifically accurate and satisfyingly honest. It made me change my opinion about SeaWorld and told the reason why I wouldn't want to go or work at this abusive park. I highly recommend everyone to watch this informational, disturbing, and exposing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is harrowing. In fact, I was unable to watch it in a single viewing. If you wanted any indication of how barbaric and cruel a supposedly civilised species can behave then look no further.This makes no pretence at being an objective documentary but has a very clear message - one that is hammered home ruthlessly with footage and interviews. (Seaworld were invited to participate apparently, and declined). Magnificent, intelligent, wide roaming creatures are being relentlessly exploited for big business. On more occasions than their corporate captors seem to be prepared to admit, this results in attacks upon trainers who had been encouraged to flatter themselves that they had established a cosy relationship with normally proud creatures with entire oceans as their playground.I was soon feeling ashamed that I had taken my daughter to Seaworld, Orlando many years ago - and even more so that we had enjoyed the day and the killer whale 'show'. This soon progressed to anger that I had contributed in some small way to this business.Some reservations came in the interviews with the many 'former trainers' who had been part of the industry for so long and, presumably, made a reasonable wage in doing so. Why had they left ? When had they changed their outlook and what caused them to do so ? One former trainer even suggested that he continued training because he was concerned who would look after the captives if he didn't turn up for work....hmmmm.That aside, the accounts of the attacks and the footage of depressed, angry, possibly psychotic trapped killer whales bleeding profusely from long gashes whilst performing to thousands of paying guests was traumatic. The show must go on.Towards the end, someone in interview expressed the wish that in 50 years time we will look back on these shows in the same way that we look back on old circuses and their cruelty now. I hope that day comes sooner than that.And the reason it should be shown to schools ? Let them watch - and then decide if they want to visit. The only way it will cease is if people stop going - and it hits the corporations in the pocket. The footage of former trainers viewing Orcas in the wild was a little trite - but vividly emphasised that that is the only way they really should be viewed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish Rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish, a documentary on the life of whales inhabited at Sea World, is an eye-opening film that really pulls the audience in through a very emotional sense. Whales are huge creatures that should not be captured and retained to what is seemingly a bathtub to them for the rest of their lives. This documentary is informative and provides the viewers with interviews from past trainers at Sea World and interviews with whale experts, along with footage of whales being taken captive and trainers being hurt by these frustrated mammals. Blackfish is a well developed and interesting documentary that should be viewed by everyone to see all of the harm that Sea World is causing to these creatures by keeping them in large pools just so the public can come and gawk over them. This documentary is mainly made up of interviews with past trainers from Sea World and footage of the whales performing at Sea World. Each of these trainers seem distraught and some even shed a tear speaking on how they were unaware of how harmful captivity was for whales and were lied to and tricks on countless occasions by Sea World. The interviews with the whale experts touch on how harmful it is for these creatures to not only be held in a large pool for their lives, hence the dorsal fins, but also how these creatures live with their families in the ocean and it is purely wrong to take them away from their families just to entertain the public eye. The whale hunters show footage of capturing these beautiful creatures from the wild; this part of the film was heartbreaking since the whales all plotted to try to help the babies get away from the hunters and screamed and cried once they were finally captured. What is interesting is that whales have never once been documented to hurt any humans in the wild, yet there have been countless of documented accidents with the trainers at Sea World caused by these depressed and agitated mammals who are living in captivity. Blackfish is very informative and has many strengths as a documentary as a whole. It shows the viewers how harmful what we are doing to these whales is and really gets the viewer emotional and thinking about how terrible it is that we partake in this. Along with touching the emotional part of the viewer, it also teaches the viewer about whales as a whole especially through the interviews with whale experts. There were also interviews with people who lost their loved ones to these terrible accidents at Sea World which contributed to making the viewer emotionally involved in the documentary. One shortcoming of this film is that Sea World refused to speak on the subject, so that did leave the viewer wondering if everything was completely truthful and in a sense, what Sea World had to say about what they are doing to these mammals. Lastly, there were some very random old commercials for Sea World thrown into the documentary that were not needed and messed up the flow of the documentary at certain points. Overall, this documentary should be watched by everyone, even if you are not an animal lover. It is extremely eyeopening and informative. It keeps the viewer entertained and connects with their emotions. Although Sea World did not speak on the subject, one can still assume that most of the information is correct and get something out of the documentary. If you have Netflix and have not taken the time to watch this, I strongly encourage it; you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

The documentary Blackfish was an emotional and creative film that shows the consequences of keeping an intelligent and sentient animal in captivity. The documentary captivates its audience through emotional testimonies and interviews. Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite this film gives a voice to the inner activists in a part of all of us through the emotional tale of Tilikum, the 12,000 pound bull orca that has spent 31 years in captivity and currently resides at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Interviewing former SeaWorld trainers and an OSHA expert witness, the film tells about the deaths caused by Tilikum and the possible causes that lead to this behavior. Captivating and heart-pounding, Blackfish gives its audience a first-hand account of what happens when you keep intelligent sentient animal in captivity. It also tells about the environments in which these whales are forced into while in captivity and how this environment negatively affects their health and behavior. Blackfish is a documentary packed with emotion and the style of a prosecution case file. I feel that the film accomplished their purpose and got their message across in a unique way. Though the documentary is a completely one-sided and bias film, I feel that it is very moving and greatly affects its audience---especially those that are animal lovers. I strongly agree with the points made in Blackfish and greatly enjoyed the evidence that the director used to help her case. However, I did find the random SeaWorld commercials a little annoying, and I felt like they didn't really belong and just interrupted the flow of the movie. The first-hand accounts provided by former SeaWorld trainers more than made up for this minor annoyance though. I found it very easy to form an attachment with the trainers and whales. I felt that the use of archived footage from prominent news stations was ingenious and provided a more realistic recount of the past accidents and tragedies. Blackfish felt genuine and down-to-earth to me, and it was easy for me to understand and relate to. I also liked how the film did not strictly conform to the genre and while it was not what I expected, I greatly enjoyed it. There was not much that I didn't like about the film and I can see myself watching it over and over again. In conclusion, Blackfish is an addictive, emotional roller coaster of a film that appeals to animal lovers everywhere. The director uses creative ideas to get her point across to the audience, giving the film a prosecution case vibe. The testimonial interviews from former SeaWorld trainers really brought the message home for me and made it so much more relatable for the audience. Using archived footage to back their claims was a unique and attention-grabbing device that kept me interested. I highly recommend this film for everyone and I can see myself watching it again in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Humans have a penchant for pretending that animals do not feel pain. Spurious beliefs like these are essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them, without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret." - Carl Sagan Fascinating, and a little bit sad, "Blackfish" is a documentary by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. It focuses on captive killer whales - also known as 'orcas' - and the deaths and injuries incurred by their trainers at various marine parks around the world.On its most conventional level, "Blackfish" dazzles us with the majesty, intelligence and peculiarities of wild orcas. The film then becomes a sermon about the cruelty of keeping whales captive for entertainment purposes. Along these lines, Cowperthwaite accuses marine parks (most notably SeaWorld) of abusing whales, misleading the public and manipulating their own trainers. The film then becomes a more specific anti-corporate screed, portraying marine parks as ideological bodies which essentially brainwash audiences, trainers, customers and engage in various forms of propaganda and deception. More sinisterly, Cowperthwaite accuses marine parks of covering up the dangers of killer whales, so as to win court cases, avoid settlements and help push down wages."Blackfish" then dips into philosophy. Here we watch as trainers anthropomorphise orcas, imbuing the bulky creatures with human qualities, emotions and behavioural traits. For their trainers, orcas are essentially "human", with identifiable qualities, emotions and emotional attachments. These naive projections are overturned when the orcas begin maiming and devouring trainers. From this point onwards, the whales are deemed "alien", "unknowable", such that their trainers are forced to reconsider their previous assumptions. Do whales really "love" their trainers? Are whales obedient simply because they are subjected to games of reward and torture? Is orca "affection" based on a human misreading of signals? Are these orcas really happy?As Cowperthwaite begins critiquing these anthropomorphic views, she also does the opposite. By its second half, "Blackfish" might as well be a treatise on crime, terrorism and spree-killing. Here Cowperthwaite clashes various world-views. On one hand, the whales are subjected to old fashioned "essentialism" - the notion that their behavioural traits are fixed and that they have a "natural" set of dangerous, murderous attributes. On the other hand, the behaviour of the whales are seen to be a product of external or social forces ? the notion that they kill because of abuse, neglect, the destruction of their families, captivity, violence etc. Cowperthwaite uses both world-views to push the same agenda: get orcas out of marine parks."Blackfish" is alleged to have led to a severe dip in "SeaWorld" attendance. It has also led to the company implementing several reforms, though the company's policies still irk animal rights activists. In the future, when we're all synthetic food-paste eating vegetarians who visit virtual marine parks via the neural implants in our brains, the politics of "Blackfish" might look quaint.8.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it's definitely eye-opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter where you stand on the subject of captivity, you won't be happy with SeaWorld after seeing "Blackfish". I'm not against captivity in general, but there were some serious blunders on behalf of the organization, and the problem still hasn't been resolved. One of the trainers in the film gave the obvious reason as to why Tilikum (the killer whale at the heart of this thing) is still performing: he's a very profitable breeder. But that definitely doesn't hold water (no pun intended) after he killed a trainer and made cable news stardom four years ago. I would've thought the fervor and backlash since this documentary's release would finally make something happen, but apparently that wasn't enough. We're talking about an animal who was abused by the other penned whales in his formative years, and harbors a great deal of aggression as a result. And he's still performing?Some of the material shown here is genuinely sad: a mother orca crying out for her separated young; Tilikum's abuse from other penned orcas; and some of the footage of the incidents (some of which - deeply unsettling - is amateur park visitor footage). The one thing I really wanted to see is an interview with Ken Peters, the trainer who was dragged down into the water by an overzealous whale. He's still alive after the scary incident, and I'd love to know his views on this. As for how "Blackfish" stands on its own, it's a polished, well-produced documentary that remains highly watchable. But it seems wholly absorbed in its "anti-captivity" argument, and that can be somewhat of a turn-off. Regardless, it expertly plays on the emotions of its audience, and it does invite the wary eye towards SeaWorld's animal maintenance procedures.No matter where you stand on this, "Blackfish" is one bummer of a movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguiding Propaganda at its Very Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's happened to all of us. We see a video or read an article that claims to be supporting a good cause, and it grabs our attention and elicits an emotional response out of us, and makes us immediately and passionately support that cause... and then later we discover that it was merely propaganda designed to further one individual or group's well-being. When Kony 2012 came out, people were quick to donate millions of dollars toward the "charity" organization behind the film, due to the emotional response they had upon seeing what they believed was a genuine, well-meaning film. Soon after, however, it was revealed that the disturbing underlying purpose of the film was to solicit money, the overwhelming majority of which would ultimately end up in the pockets of the organization's leaders; the organization quickly lost its credibility with the public. The very next year, however, a new "documentary" is released, titled "Blackfish", which proposes a fun new concept: what if SeaWorld is actually evil, and the behavior of its killer whales is actually evidence that they are being mistreated? The public is immediately hooked, because it is a fresh, almost-convincing idea that reminds them of the paradigm shift which occurred following the release of "An Inconvenient Truth". I suppose this could be considered a spoiler: the movie essentially calls on the public to bring down the evil SeaWorld Entertainment company and save the poor animals that are being tortured and forced to perform to be fed (in fact, this and all other claims and insinuations made by the film have been shown to be either misleading or entirely fabricated), and since the Hollywood-level production quality and the power of emotional thought have far greater power over the human brain's capacity to use logic and reason in making decisions, many people who had no prior knowledge on the subject believe every word of the film and even defend their judgment made from a single source of information. However, what many others have realized is that the organization behind the film, PETA, is eerily similar to the one behind "Kony 2012", and like the latter it also stands to directly profit from the film and the undermining of the SeaWorld company; the well-documented corruption and insidious nature and practices of PETA can be easily found through simple internet searches. While this film may be interesting to watch as a study of human psychology and the effects of manipulation, emotional reasoning, and confirmation bias, the inconvenient truth is that paying money to watch it is supporting an organization which kills roughly 95% of the dogs, cats, rabbits, etc it acquires, allocates almost all of its ~$35 million annual budget to compensation for its leaders and widely-criticized advertisements, advocates the release of animals born in captivity (whose species has always perished quickly upon release under those same circumstances), and tries to take down the company that not only is globally considered the gold standard in its treatment of animals but also operates the world's largest marine rescue, rehab, and research organization. This film's purpose is to stomp out PETA's competition as the recipient of donation money by ironically painting it as the antagonist that must be destroyed, and thus uninformed viewers have been quickly converted into SeaWorld detractors, but the reality is that any investigation into the matter will discredit the entire message the film tries to present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SeaWorld's Nemesis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is an extraordinary film that captures aspects of Orcas both in the wild and in captivity. The film uses research of Orcas in the wild against the conditions they are kept in while in confinement. In doing so it does an impressive job at opening your eyes to the dark side of captivity. Orcas, also referred to as Killer Whales, are often thought to be friendly, loving and intelligent creatures. This is the case in the wild, but not in long-term captivity. Blackfish takes a look at the conditions Killer Whales are kept in at the glorious theme parks, which just happen to turn them into money making slaves. Orcas are meant to be wild animals, and training them to perform tricks against their will to earn food?which they need to survive?is just immoral. The film allows us to see the mind-turning process in multiple video clips of not only the training sessions, but also of the whale's performances. The film's main focus is on a Killer Whale named Tillikum. It follows Tillikum beginning from when he was captured to his current stay at every kid's wonderland, SeaWorld. Tillikum's past is filled with mistreatment, abuse, and underestimation. After being captured Tillikum went to stay at a park called Sea Land. It should have been called Sea Tank, because that's what it was. He was kept in an atrociously small metal pool, nowhere suitable for his size. During his stay at this park, he participated in the killing of a trainer. The film shows an interview of two women who were viewing the show the day this tragedy happened, and revealed that Tillikum may have not just participated, but "initiated" the killing. Right after the killing he was purchased by SeaWorld, who knowingly took him despite the horrific event. SeaWorld claims they did not know of the tragedy. If they didn't know, why did they caution the trainers not to get too close to him? SeaWorld unsuccessfully tried to keep this tragedy from reoccurring. The film covers the 2010 news story of Dawn Brancheau being killed by no other than Tillikum himself. SeaWorld tried to revise the story by saying it was Dawn's error, not Tillikum acting out. After Blackfish was released, SeaWorld fired back saying that they had never blamed Dawn for her death. Although the film clearly contains an interview of a SeaWorld executive saying, "If Dawn was here she would agree with me that it was her error." The film shows how Tillikum has been brutally treated by both his fellow whale companions and by the parks themselves. Neither the film nor I claim that SeaWorld or any other park abuses their animals physically, but they are mentally tortured. The film features a news segment showing Jane Velez-Mitchell making the controversial remark, "If you were kept in a bathtub for 25 years, don't you think you'd get a little psychotic?" The producer's decision to include this segment was an extremely good one; it points out the flaws in captivity. How can you morally take a wild animal--which is supposed to be able to roam freely--and stick them in an enclosed tank with animals not of their family? That's right, the whales at SeaWorld are not a big happy family as SeaWorld has made the public believe in for quite some time. Despite the name "Killer Whales," these creatures are very family oriented animals. In the wild, they stay with their family their whole lives. Whale hunters have ripped these families apart to turn them into show monkeys. The film features actual footage showing hunters capturing these beautiful creatures and splitting them from their family. Not only does this process affect the captured animal, it affects the family who has now lost one of their loved ones. A lot of times the capturing of the whales leads to some of the family members dying as well. Blackfish exposes SeaWorld for the lies it has told. The film provides footage of SeaWorld employees informing customers that Orcas live to be 25-30 in the wild, so they live much longer in captivity. This is an outright, boldfaced lie. Research has shown that in the wild Orcas have a life expectancy equal to humans, if not longer.While this film does effectively uncover the horrific side of captivity, it has its flaws, as does everything. It does not show the positive outcomes of captivity, such as being kept from whale hunters' harm (ironically how they got there in the first place). The only good part of captivity to me would be if they were taken from the wild due to an illness or injury. That would justify captivity, because then it would be "rehabilitation." After being in captivity for a certain period of time they should be released back into the wild.Arguments against the film could be that they did not use the correct footage during some parts of the movie; like the segment showing a trainer jumping onto a whale for a ride. During this part the film shows a former trainer talking about her first ride on a whale when she was in no way experienced for it. She was not the trainer in the video clip. To me this is not a big error because it still shows a trainer boarding a whale for a joy ride. The film was full of bias, but it was set to accomplish a goal and it fulfilled it. This film will either rip your heart out, or have you saying "Liar, Liar." I wasn't the latter. After viewing Blackfish I cannot think of SeaWorld as a safe haven anymore. Blackfish set out to expose SeaWorld and it effectively did so. It is by far my favorite documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It proved its case and provoked change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There is no record of an orca doing any harm to a human in the wild."Despite not being the world's greatest animal lover, I remember being fascinated by the gorgeous killer whale during my childhood. I recall one of the incidents that a trainer had with these animals when I was young, but I thought it was just part of the perks of working with wild animals. Ever since, I believed these were dangerous animals. I also found myself on SeaWorld's side believing that they were offering us an amazing opportunity to see these animals up close, while at the same time domesticating them. I never believed these animals were suffering from captivity or anything of the sort. I was just as blind as the former trainers who are in this wonderful documentary sharing their experiences. Gabriela Cowperthwaite delivers a carefully constructed case in Blackfish by giving evidence that these animals are not only intelligent beings, but highly emotional and social as well. She convinced me with her forensic and detailed evidence that the attacks like the one in SeaWorld weren't simply part of a working hazard, but provoked by the inhumane treatment these orcas receive in captivity. There is no doubt in my mind now that these attacks are a direct result of their captivity. Gabriela sort of ruined my childhood memories, but she accomplishes her purpose and convinced me not to support SeaWorld. Blackfish succeeds in that regard because it accomplished its purpose and was effective in my case. Most of the time documentaries can be interesting although dull, but Blackfish is just as entertaining as it is informative. I was hooked from the very opening scene and I never felt bored during the interviews or the footage. Cowperthwaite's case might be one sided and biased, but it isn't her fault that SeaWorld didn't want to participate in the making of this film. Having these former whale trainers share their experience, while watching their footage with the whales was effective as well. They've all had a change of heart because you can tell they actually love these animals and most of them established an emotional connection with them. I wonder what present day trainers will think of this after watching all the compelling evidence presented here. Not only does Gabriela point out that these animals are highly emotional and social, but she also reminds us that these animals have never attacked anyone in the wild, they live much longer lives in the wild than in captivity, and that it isn't normal that their fins drag to their sides like most of the whales in SeaWorld. The only evidence she introduces which I would debate was when she mentions that Tilikum's (one of Seaworld's biggest whales) offspring could acquire that learned aggression towards humans, but scientists have proved it's not the case. The documentary is very aggressive and it is effective in sending out the message and provoking a reaction in the audience. I will admit that there are also some tearful moments in this documentary as well. Blackfish makes its case and does so effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verdict: An important documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story: Seeing how a young calf killer whale is taken from its pod and put into captivity to perform for people over a 25+ years. We see how he was constantly trapped in small enclosures and how acts of play and frustration led to accidents and deaths. Former trainers give their stories of how they had always been told stories of how it was an accident and always hidden the truth before the latest death changed the laws SeaWorld have to operate under. This is important for people to see as these creatures should be free and not just used for our own entertainment, and keeping them in cages will have consequences that will be blamed on the animal. (9/10)Director Review: Gabriela Cowperthwaite ? Comfortable put together to tell the story that SeaWorld don't want us to know. Filled with interviews from former trainers who didn't understand how bad the treatment was. (8/10)Documentary: Great documentary that really hits hard. (10/10) Suggestion: This is something that needs to be watch and acted on. (Watch) Best Part: Achieve footage shows how the animal changes over time. Worst Part: We didn't need to see the whale getting milked for sperm. Believability: Used achieve footage on real events. (10/10) Chances of Tears: You will feel for the whales. (4/10) Chances of Sequel: No Post Credits Scene: NoAwards: Nominated for BAFTA best documentary. Oscar Chances: No Box Office: $2,073,582 Runtime: 1 Hour 23 Minutes Tagline: Never capture what you can't control.Overall: Brilliant Documentary to show what is really going on at SeaWorldCheck out more reviews on http://moviesreview101.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish: An Evaluation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary "Blackfish" takes a disturbing look into the capture and detainment of killer whales used in the Sea World amusement parks. Although the film lacks many of the artistic aspects found in many of today's documentaries. As a result the film has an in your face approach and does not waste much time getting to the films point; orcas can become aggressive due to the inhumane standards of their captivity. The foundation for this accusation is clearly laid out by the interviews of the former Sea World trainers and the gritty surveillance films leading up to the attacks. I feel this film serves its purpose well, to inform and evoke anger in all of the patrons who unknowingly supported the cruel treatment of these animals. As the visitors to the parks were being told lies about the well being of the animals they were paying to see.It becomes apparent very early on that the film aims to place blame on the Sea World organization for its inhumane treatment of orcas in captivity which led to the aggressive nature of "Tilikum", the main orca the film is based around. Sea World has claimed the orcas used in their shows live a better life in captivity than they would live if in the wild. The film states that in their natural habitat, orcas do not usually attack humans. This is used as evidence for the case that the attacks were a direct consequence of these whales being kept in substandard conditions and prone to training with no scientific backing. One example is comparing the size of the small tanks they are kept in to the vastness of the ocean where they would normally be able to roam freely. Sea World claimed that the attacks were from errors performed by the trainers themselves and the whales were gentle and unaware of their size and strength, proposing that the whales were unaware of what they were actually doing. Although a detailed look into the attacks themselves and the events leading up to them may suggest otherwise. It is easy to find correlation between the orca's treatment and the brutal attacks performed by them.In an attempt to get the viewer to sympathize with the killer whales, the film attempts to educate the viewer of the high level of intelligence and emotion these creatures posses. Which can be seen in their social interactions and the emotions these beautiful creatures exhibit. In one scene horrendous screeches can be heard coming from a mother whale as her calf is being hunted and separated from the pod. As this was also the case for "Tilikum", the main whale the film focuses on. These horrific scenes shows the true nature that we as humans display when dealing with wild animals that are being used to gain profits for their showings. It is clear that these are animals have evolved to have an advanced emotional activity and attachment to other whales in their pod. And to use them the way humans have been is extremely unethical.As Sea World tried to hide information and downplay the brutal nature of the attacks, they continued to use Tilikum as the main male for the breeding of other orcas used in their shows. The decision to use a male for breeding that has repeatedly displayed aggression towards his trainers gives arise to many ethical issues involving the safety of the trainers. Often the parks would release official statements stating that the cause of the attacks were negligence on the trainers behalf. Although in most instances the trainers did nothing out of the ordinary. Now over half of the whales used in Sea Worlds' shows have some direct hereditary link to Tilikum.In terms of arousing emotions in favor of the argument the film present, Blackfish hits it mark. It bluntly lays out the horrific acts performed against these intelligent creatures, and shows in dramatic fashion the consequences first hand. I can remember the nostalgia I felt upon my first Sea World trip as a child, which is now tainted by the anger I feel for contributing to the inhumane treatment of these animals. This film is not for the faint of heart as it does not leave much room for imagination as the footage from the surveillance cameras cuts just before the trainers are fatally attacked by the whales. I feel this film has achieved its goal as outrage from the patrons and lawsuits from many of Sea Worlds investors have caused a decrease in number of people visiting the park per year. And consequently investigations are being led in attempt to reform the standards that are expected when dealing with wild animals that posses the intelligence these whales do.</fullReview>

We don't say killer lions or killer wolves - after watching this movie, I'm thinking of calling other people, "cruel, animal imprisoning humans". The mistreating of these wonderful, and extremely intelligent creatures - ORCAS - makes me sick and embarrassed. But really, what else could I expect from a species that has a history of slavery, genocide and a general waste of the planet on which it lives? I would suggest people get their heads out of their Disneyland asses and start paying attention to what others will do simply to make a buck. I also suggest that we leave nature alone and recognize that just because we are interested in the animals with which we share this Earth, it doesn't give us a right to invade and disrupt their lives. I don't think enough consideration is given to just how "right" zoos and other types of animal displays are to the creatures that really should be WILDlife, not CAPTIVElife!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sea World Orcas, the killers of captivity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this one on Netflix streaming movies. My friend Natalie made me aware of it. She has always been a fan of Orcas in general, and has enjoyed over her 25 years occasionally visiting Sea World. After seeing this she said her whole perspective has changed.It is interesting that Tilikum, the Orca, is listed in the cast as "Himself". We see some of his history in captivity before he came to Sea World. Much of the focus of this film are the deaths of several workers and trainers over the years at water parks, with particular focus on Sea World. Most often the official line was "accident". But this film shows pretty convincing evidence that they weren't accidents at all, instead conscious attacks by the Orcas. The film includes some information on research on Orca brains, showing that they are both highly intelligent and emotional. One of the attacks came after the Orca was denied food during a performance, so he dragged the trainer into the pool and killed her.The whole film questions the morality of separating Orca youngsters from their parents and then keeping Orcas captive for entertainment. Plus the issue of failing to fully inform workers and trainers of the dangers. Naturally Sea World wants no part of the film, their focus remains to keep on entertaining and keep on making money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious killer whale Tilikum is responsible for the deaths of three individuals, including a top killer whale trainer. Blackfish shows the sometimes devastating consequences of keeping such intelligent and sentient creatures in captivity.As a horror fan, I have to say they showed a nice clip from "Orca". But beyond that, it is also an incredible documentary looking at the captivity of killer whales, and also the horrible things that are done to capture the animals. One an easily see why attacks occur.SeaWorld spoke out, saying, "Blackfish is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy. The film paints a distorted picture that withholds key facts about SeaWorld ?- among them that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research." Now, I do not know enough to really respond, other than I doubt anything in the film was made up. Maybe one-sided, but still factually correct.How did this not get an Oscar nomination? It was easily better than "Cutie and the Boxer" and (in my opinion) the winning film, "20 Feet From Stardom". Did they think it was too similar to "The Cove"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish, a documentary directed by Gabriella Cowperthwaite, is an eye-opening look at the killer whale, our history of capturing them from the wild for Sealand and later SeaWorld, and why this is a mistake. I actually watched this film twice in a row yesterday, and I think that what I gleamed most from this message is a lesson on social behavior. The most moving testimonies from interviewees who are mostly former trainers expounded on how they didn't see how they were doing anything wrong. Indeed, if you went to any zoo or SeaWorld while Tilikum was performing it is not easy to see past the way people are behaving socially to see the problem. Looking back, it is common sense that if you believe wild animals have any value whatsoever (I understand some people don't) then there is something wrong with capturing a bunch of them from their natural surroundings and placing them in a pool, keeping a 4,000 pound animal in a 20 by 30 foot box for two thirds of their life, ripping mothers from their young, and watching them get violent with each other and then with trainers...is just stupid and unethical. But all those smiling faces at the amusement park and the indoctrination of trainers telling them they are doing good for the animals obscures what seems so obvious. But I also think it is important to look at the implications of the film for humans as well. The killer whale is incredibly intelligent and studies done by neuroscientists confirm that their brains have an additional segment connected to the part that controls emotion. They have an emotional dimension and capacity that we can't even understand, like a monkey doesn't understand problem solving past simple puzzles for a reward. The film cites footage of mass strandings where the whales refuse to let one of their own die alone, instead they all stay with him....the same for getting caught in hunters' nets. Their communication is so individually varied and unique that you have to call it language, and when a mother is separated from her child, she sits alone, shaking and screaming....I don't know how you can interpret that as a the reaction of a dumb, unaware animal. But we as humans are also social creatures. You distort nature and the natural way of living, as we've done a fabulous job of, then we too start to rip each other apart, (when whales do it it's called "raking") and become frustrated, angry, and sad. But sure enough the government tells us they are doing things "for our good" and with all the smiling faces in the largest amusement park in the world, what may be uncovered with a little research and education is indeed obscured.funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Impressive documentary that shows how cruel and despicable people can be when money and status is involved. I hope this is a wake up call for sea world and other animal parks alike. The documentary is well-made. The real-life footage contributes to the authenticity of the film and is at times shocking. Emotions of the trainers and tourists are well-captured. It seems the interviewer knew what questions to ask.The angle of the documentary is clear from the beginning. Through the talks with experts and trainers and the footage from accidents and the killer whales we get to see why things happened and it makes sense. I'd like to have seen more talk with experts for better verification of the information given, but that is the researcher in me talking.In conclusion, a very impressive and convincing documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The past decades have seventy cases of incidents where trainers were killed in marineparcs, serious injury or narrowly escaped. The marine parks, including Sea World, the U.S. is by far the largest and best known, like the incident swept under the carpet imaginary. An orca is in their view, an innocent and peaceful animal and it is almost always due to the coach that accidents occurred. Many former coaches and scientists agree however that the captivity of animals and complete despair resulting from this is that she gets to this behavior . The male orca Tilikum is a remarkable case. He took in the nineties for a fatal accident in Canada. Despite bought Sea World Florida trainer Dawn Brancheau Tilikum where he gave a horrible death three years ago.Blackfish is a one-sided story. On the one hand Gabriela Cowperthwaite can not do much here because Sea World did not want to cooperate. The only counteract that is given comes from a former trainer . On the other hand she prefers to pepper her message is quite in . Despite the lack of adversarial filmmaker succeeds in a fascinating history of Tilikum sketching and the many wrong decisions that the money hungry man took herein. The images which trainers are at the mercy of the killer whales are shocking and fascinating at the same time . Any appearances there or at, because Blackfish is almost presented as a thriller. Downright shocking is how Sea World accidents in the webs of the trainers try to push. Heartbreaking stories about mother orcas cry when their calves are taken from them .The trial of labor at Sea World is still on appeal . The main conclusion of this impressive documentary is the fact that sensitive animals like killer whales just belong in the wild.(Bron: filmtotaal.nl)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary hands down was the best yet very sad. It shows the side of Sea World that nobody really thinks about. It breaks my heart to hear such tragedy coming from a place that I have always thought was good for animals as a kid, but when seeing this it really puts a different perspective on things and really makes you think. When you visit Sea World you don't think about the damage it does to those animals, you just think how amazing it is to see animals that are normally in the wild so close. It is fascinating to see such creatures close but ultimately they are a hazard to people in close proximity and being in captivity for those animals isn't good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hoodwinked never lie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me several weeks to get up the courage to watch this. I had been in Sea World in the early 1980's and had seen the stupid morality involved in the use of innocent magnificent animals for money. Back then I didn't get it. I was there right after the first live birth in captivity was successful. Shamu or whatever it was.This is one of the most pure documentaries that I have ever seen. Plenty of clear evidence and the confessions of those who had been hoodwinked by the professional psychopaths. Once hoodwinked moral people just cannot lie. Using animals or children to make money is, well, prostitution. Pimps of whales. Watching the trainer's realization about what they had discovered once there and over the years and then just telling the absolute truth about their responsibility in the entire thing was amazing and human. The whale's slavery and then their compassionate mentoring while and after our abuse of them tells all. A perfect presentation and production. Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Free Tilly! Blackfish is a pretty good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, Blackfish focus on the history of Orcas AKA Killer Whales in captivity such as SeaWorld and the back-stage drama interacting with human trainers in entertaining water works stunt shows. The film does make a good persuasive case against keeping these creatures in captivity for the purposes of human entertainment by highlighting many incidents of human trainers getting killed, or attack during these shows over the years. It's seem to happen to other marine life parks in the past as well, as the movie shows with examples such as Sealand of the Pacific in Canada and Loro Parque in Spain. I wish they talk about the attacks on Miami Seaquarium and Marineland. They also show how badly this marine parks are run. Marineland at Canada was one of the worst, as a large number of whale die due to bad treatments of the animals. That park should had been talk in the film. I don't think the documentary is all against having animals in captivity as animal rights activists think the film is showing. In my opinion, the producers is against Seaworld treating these creatures as if a circus act. The movie does paint SeaWorld into a negative light. I really doubt that SeaWorld only care about profit, but I do agree they do need to be reform. SeaWorld does serve a purpose for the public in educating them, and do scientific research about Marine life and do treat their whales better than other marine parks. The film fails to reference that they do help rehabilitating some animals back into the wild, while also keeping the animals that might not be able to survive in the wild, alive. A good example of this is Miracle, a sick, starved orphan whale found in 1977 that found a new life in SeaWorld parks. Plus, not all the whales are used in shows, at all. Most are kept there. I'm not against having animals in zoos, but I don't think this film is one bit saying 'free all the whales'. About the dangers, the trainers knows damn well, that their jobs might be dangerous and they are willing to take all the risk. I do have to agree, that certain whale with aggression shouldn't be in water works shows at all. SeaWorld has a long history of ignoring this. I wish the documentary would talk more about the attacks of Kandu V, Hugo, Orky II, and Kasatka. It would show that many marine parks ignored the safety of their trainers, by having them deal with dangerous whales not only SeaWorld. Even the great Shamu had an accident with a human, but it wasn't mention in the film, just the film footage was shown. The film mostly focus on the history of one Orca, named Tilikum whom been involved in the deaths of three individuals in the past who been bully by other whales, and abuse by his handlers. The film argues that the reasons why the whale tend to more dangerous in captivity, than in the wild is because how the creatures are raise. Whales in captivity tend to live be more stressful because of the training, harassed by fellow captive whales that isn't family to them, left in dark tanks for hours, and the lack of large free range pools. I think the film could had discussion this, with better examples such as the history of Lolita and Kshamenk. Both whales has suffer much due to these reasons. I have to agree with most of the film statements. As of this writing, no killer whale in the wild has cause a human life. What the film falls to mention is that the wild whale that interact with humans are mostly 'resident' whales that tend to live in areas with large fishing areas. They are used to human contract. They tend to be less violent than 'transient' killer whales that tend to travel large distances and mostly live in the open ocean where human contract is less likely. I also didn't like how the movie point that the John Sillick accident was due to whale aggression. John Sillick accident wasn't cause by the whales wanting to hurt him. Another trainer miscue the act, and signal the whale to breach. It was clearly the trainer's fault, not whale aggression there. Some facts in the film are indeed inaccurate and misleading. Was the film exploiting a tragedy? Somewhat, but the issues of whale captivity has been in question, long before Dawn Brancheau's death in 2010 in such films like 2008's Lolita- slave to entertainment. Overall: the interview with former trainer was informative, but they do admit that they are not qualified to understand the traumatized psychosis of these creatures. The film forget to discussion, that the reason why whale die in captivity younger than in the wild is due to diseases, not psychology breakdowns. Still, it's hard to get a clear understanding what go through these creatures mind during a show. The showcase of history of capture of baby whale getting separate from their mother was heart-breaking. I do think that SeaWorld should not take captive-born babies or help promote whale kidnapping in Iceland. The use of attack film footage was well done and intense and not use in bad taste. Still, not worth seeing this movie with little children unless age-appropriate. The film does feel a bit cloyingly attached to appeal to our emotions to side with the whales. I think it made the film more interesting. Yes, it was a bit one-sided journalism documentary, but I came out learning more than I came into the film. I like how it was aired on CNN for free. In my opinion, killer whale are wild animal just like any other. Killer being the keyword. They are not pure evil like 1977's Orca or kid friendly like 1966's Namu or 1993's Free Willy. They can still harm you, like any animal. So be caution if dealing with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a really tough movie to watch. It's a documentary that might put the "Cove" to shame. Though I have only seen parts of the Cove (the Dolphin part to be exact), those movies are really getting to you. It's tough to hear from people who have worked at Sea World or some affiliate organization. It's also very revealing that there is no comment from the guys "responsible" for it all.And while the movie starts off easy, you can feel something looming over it the whole time. I can't imagine someone actually wanting to go to one of the parks, after watching this movie. Not without asking questions that is. Of course it is tough to just criticize a company and not look onto oneself. Still no reason to justify the things going on and being displayed here ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard much about Blackfish before I managed to catch a screening of it. I will certainly never forget watching it though.Blackfish is an utterly terrifying look at the practices of the Seaworld corporation through the eyes of it's former employees. It is at times deeply moving, shocking and altogether unpleasant. I certainly did not know a lot of issues that were raised in the film.It's not a perfect documentary in terms of equal representation for either side. In fact the film does little to represent the good that is spread by Seaworld and it's associated resorts, however if even one tenth of the facts proposed in this film are true, it stands on it's own two feet as a bare exposure of the malpractice of Seaworld.Do not watch if you're easily upset or generally if you ever want to visit Seaworld again. It's a bit of a life changer in respect to the later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Courageous, heartrending and remarkable..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American screenwriter, producer and documentary director Gabriela Cowperthwaite's second documentary feature which she co-wrote with screenwriter, film editor and director Eli Despres and co-produced, was instigated after she learned that a renowned SeaWorld trainer named Dawn Brancheau was killed in the summer of 2010 in Orlando, Florida in USA by an orca. It premiered in the U.S. Documentary Competition section at the 32nd Sundance Film Festival in 2013, was shot on location in USA and Spain and is an American production which was produced by producer Manny V. Oteyza. It tells the story about a 32-year-old male bull orca named Tilikum who was captured in Iceland in the early 1980s, who grew up at a theme park called Sealand of the Pacific in Canada where he was used as a performance animal and who lives in captivity with other killer whales at a mammal park in Orlando, Florida in USA called SeaWorld where he trains with animal trainers, is used for breeding and performs for live audiences. Finely and engagingly directed by North American filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite, this quietly paced documentary which is narrated from multiple viewpoints and from a killer whale's viewpoint, draws an involving and multifaceted portrayal of an amusement park and its main attractions and the relations between humans and animals. While notable for it's fine cinematography by cinematographers Jonathan Ingalls and Christopher Towey, this narrative-driven story where, amongst others, former SeaWorld trainers, whale researchers, a diver who captured orcas in the 1970s, a neuroscientist, Orca researchers, a former director and trainers at Sealand of the Pacific and eyewitnesses talks about their experiences with killer whales, examines the living conditions, minds, languages and abilities of these highly social, emotional and intelligent mammals, the most likely reasons as to why they at any given moment could and would kill human beings, the distinctions between animal rights and human rights and behind all the spectacle regarding this 5,400 kilo heavy and almost seven meter long member of the Dolphin family, how and why it is so in this world that the life of a 40-year-old American woman who truly loved the animals she eventually was mutilated by was turned into a fabricated lie to protect the reputation of SeaWorld and its main attraction, and contains a great instrumental score by composer Jeff Beal. This educational, socio-political and non-activist documentary where questions are raised regarding occupational risks, the use of potential killers for financial gain and as objects of entertainment, the treatment of animals in captivation, a management withholding information from their employees regarding the history of the orcas they were to work with, to what extent an animal of this kind can be trusted, why the preservation of a large company was of greater importance than acquiring justice for those men and women working for them who lost their lives and if marine parks serves a significant purpose in society, is impelled and reinforced by its fragmented narrative structure, majestic scenes of the orcas in their own environment and the unsettling though essential video camera footage which proves how experienced these brave animal trainers are and how defenceless they are when attacked by an orca. A courageous, heartrending and remarkable documentary feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orcas Have Feelings Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To this day there have been no recorded accounts of an orca whale attacking a human outside of captivity." Working as a clear indictment of SeaWorld and their treatment of orca whales (more commonly known as killer whales) this is the major quote which resonates throughout the new documentary "Blackfish", from filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite. "Blackfish" is not a movie solely about naive humans forgetting that killer whales are still wild animals, but an exposé regarding why they shouldn't be kept in captivity in the first place. In saying that, when going into a documentary like this, there is going to be a lot of?well, a lot of what you would expect. Meaning, with its visuals mostly concentrating on the abuse of performance whales in captivity, there is going to be things in "Blackfish" that we've all seen before. It is the fascinating central storyline of Tilikum the whale and a few of the more heart wrenching scenes of abuse, which elevates this from an average doc, to a fairly compelling film. Side Note: While I make mention that some of the footage shown is stuff that we've seen before, most of it is still not for the faint of heart, and may be too upsetting for younger audiences. So viewer, beware. Synopsis: Following the history of killer whale attacks in captivity (mostly at SeaWorld) "Blackfish" turns its focus on the 12,000 pound killer whale Tilikum, whose involvement in three deadly attacks on humans, cements him as the most infamous orca whale still performing today. Sadly this immensely interesting story only makes up about 50% of the movie. The rest of it is filled with actual footage which covers the spectrum of visuals concerning inhumane whale treatment, as well as a myriad of attacks on SeaWorld trainers. And like I said before, much of that video footage is stuff one could easily find on YouTube or some Save the Whales-type website. Final Thought: Gathering a majority of its interviews from former SeaWorld trainers, of course "Blackfish" has an agenda. Of course it is bias. Of course it is manipulative. But nowadays most documentaries are. So, judging solely on how well this film was put together and how compelling the content was, even though "Blackfish" undoubtedly will not be up for any Oscars, it is worth checking out; if only for the Tilikum story alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping Documentary That Will Leave You in Disgust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm writing this review primarily as a vehicle for some ranting- ranting about our society and human nature from the very beginning. Now, this has perhaps been said too many times, but how dramatic was our evolution throughout all these centuries, really? It seems as if our barbarism has become more subtle, but it truly hasn't vanished. When we rely on business/making $$$ above all else, what does that really say about our betterment? To me, it appears to be a failure of an improvement. Blackfish vividly depicts just how cruel humankind is, not only to ourselves but to all other living organisms on this earth. Even when it comes to some of the most adorable animals living today, we do not hesitate to manipulate them in a way for profit as is usual. This film conveys the dispensability both humans and animals are to these corporations and moguls as it casts us into the story that follows killer whale trainers (specifically) working at theme parks like SeaWorld and SeaLand, which no longer exists. I can't only blame the CEO's and other operating officers behind these events as the trainers, themselves, must be overly blinded by the bullshit because even though you clearly have these animals trapped under enclosures with very limited space- they're forced to live the rest of their lives entertaining a bunch of clueless families- the trainers are unashamedly smiling and laughing along with the crowd. They're essentially receiving enjoyment from these activities, of course, while someone else is suffering in the meantime and this so accurately captures human nature in and of itself and likely proves the theory of psychological egoism- that we truly only act for our own self-interests. And of course, when something disastrous transpires and an unfortunate accident occurs right before their eyes, only then do they finally realize what they're actually engaging in. Then, we have these trainers appear on-camera and cry for the viewers, emotionally informing us of the guilt they continue to feel to this day. Apparently, there has to be a tragic death or some other mishap for wicked humans to correct their ways because they're obviously too goddamn lazy to do some research for once (and I've realized this. Nobody cares about doing a little research with the exception of it being for some school project? Pathetic). These happy-go-lucky individuals hadn't even thoroughly studied their field (in fact, numerous deaths and injuries from killer whales within this environment prior to their employment) because they just simply desire fun, right? I'll have to let go of my fury and delve more into a review form from this point on. It's a terrific documentary in the end, and I strongly suggest it to the people who're actually willing to learn (yes, let go of that booze and learn about something. You don't have to go to school in order to gain further knowledge, and the only reason many people even think of acquiring education is to make money, right?). Watch it. It's a wonderfully informative documentary that isn't incredibly relevant at the moment, but it'll expose a whole new perspective that you would've never imagined. Remember visiting SeaWorld when you were a small, excited child? Well, this could very well ruin those memories of your childhood, and it's not particularly a horrible thing. Many people are unaware of the damage these pitiable animals are stricken with. These creatures only wish to live just like the rest of us. "Let's rip them from their families and from their homeland so that we can make some monay!" This narrow-mindedness we still possess to this day where everything that's different from us is immediately inferior and doesn't have the intellectual capability we possess- yes, you clearly have the capability of intelligence. Judging from the majority, yeah, I don't think so?Strangely so, cats and dogs are the exception. "Yeah, if we can raise them and if we receive enjoyment out of it, they shouldn't be manically used like a bunch of toys," again pertaining to that selfishness we still proudly hold onto. I'm not even talking about killing animals for some pleasurable food as a result, but in capturing species only to display them to the mindless crowds (obviously, children are excused because they really have no idea. It's always up to the parents) who're "oh so happy" to see them- in zoos, aquariums, etc. This is a much deeper question, revolving around our selfishness and self-benefits. What should we partake just for the enjoyment of it (because it benefits me in the end)? Do boundaries even exist anymore or have they ever existed in the first place? Since we're so powerful as a species and carry much greater strength than anything else on the planet, we can use it to our advantage, which means we can take anything we want, as well as experience anything we seek. Actually, this could relate to our treatment of each other between races, gender, etc. Whoever's seemingly the superior one feels like they can do whatever the hell s/he wants. Anyways, you can see just how furious one would become after viewing Blackfish. So, for those selfish human beings, look at it this way. If you see this documentary, you'll surely be entertained and will have a great amount of interesting, intense discussion afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More chilling than the scariest film out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film, makes you think, makes you care, makes you want to take a stand and try to do something about some important issue. It might be the one explored in this chilling documentary, based on a series of incidents that have plagued one famous water park, and most importantly, dealing with the atrocities that might have been committed against one of this world's most mysterious species. In addition to that there is the disbelief and suspense, as stories are told about the potential catastrophic consequences of working on this environment.This very educational film moves at a beautiful pace, with excellent editing and smart use of its sources, presentation of perspectives, and the simple delivery of factual documentation, sometimes in the form of visuals, testimonies, and a magnificent "screenplay" or written support to show how Orcas are taken from their natural habitats, experience shocking adjustments in their new environments, and eventually might become unstable to say the least, causing much harm to those work with them. "Blackfish" shows how several people have been injured, and the fact is very clear that there might be reckless actions leading to these events, but what will surprise you is who are the reckless and insensitive parties here.There are several people giving testimony here, and as usual people might offer arguments against these presentations. What impressed me is the brevity and objectivity of the way the observations are related. There is very little room to invalidate what we are listening to, and most importantly, there are a few incidents which we are able to witness, as if we were sitting in the audience, leaving almost no room to misinterpretation. Certainly, these are the moments where you will feel those chills going up and down your spine, and don't be surprised if you go speechless or feel a tear or two coming out of your eyes, as you see or hear some sad laments, or a good person's lifeline threatened or extinguished in front of you.By the end you will have become familiarized with some whales' names, and most likely will never be able to forget your initial reaction to the story of their plight. You will want to go back and research on your own how a couple of trainers, with different levels of experience similar conclusions.Of course, you want to hear all the sides to the story, but it becomes clear over the unfolding of the stories that the chance has been given, and through some transcripts references what one of the parties is saying by keeping quiet. Be ready to spend approximately 90 minutes of your life watching one of the best documentaries ever made, one that hopefully will have enough of an impact to change the way things are now. It interesting to note that humans go through cycles, and we might be able to wake and do something to improve situations like these. The question is whether the solution will have a more definite impact and be more positive and permanent. A few years ago "Star Trek IV" hinted at our lack of vision and mix comedy with Science Fiction to give us hope for our future actions, but it still made it very clear that we will still make horrific mistakes, and the question is: could it be possible?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite presents this heartbreaking one sided story revealing the cruelty mankind force upon yet another helpless animal, the orca. It reveals the only side that matters. The truth. Blackfish proves to me what other animal rights documentaries have countless times; that humans are the worst kind of animal. Take what they will, risk deaths of innocent lives for money and their own pleasure. Corporations and individuals included. Please remember that zoos, eating meat and animal by products, getting touristic photographs etc. are just as bad!!!!! Most people will watch this and still not change one thing in their lives, but please sit down and have a real think about this and have compassion for other living beings! Or if not watch Earthlings or Cowspiracy. It's what many people have needed to see to turn vegetarian/vegan. We can blame lack of education but even once educated with more knowledge, people will still continue to turn a blind eye. More emotional documentaries like Blackfish need to be crafted in such a wife in hope more people will be willing to make a change. to exist. And more people need to</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man's Cruelty Not Limited To His Own Species</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This documentary is definitely not for children; while the violence is described off camera, there are scenes of Tillikum dragging a guy under several times almost drowning him. Though the documentary is about these majestic mammals, the hidden story is about the lies that the public is fed by these agents of disinformation at Sea World. The strongest part of this is where the director pairs statements by a marine biologist: Dorsal fins do not bend naturally in the wild, longer life spans, violence rare between these social animals. This is followed immediately by Sea World's zombies repeating the company's lies: fins bend in the wild, longer life in captivity. Sometimes, when you watch human cruelty, you cannot help but notice that we tend to miss the forest for the trees. The documentary follows the damage Tillikum does to his trainers while explaining the wretched living conditions these poor creatures are subjected to. The worst is the tearing away of the new born calves with the mother's plaintive wails heard for hours in the background. There are shots of the mother moving to the corner of the pool. The whale's violence is understandable when you discover that these whales are being imprisoned every night in metal box containers barely bigger than the whales themselves.This documentary explains how social whales are and that the violence is also a consequence of breaking up their complex social groupings, in the wild, and bringing whales from many different pods and throwing them all together completely half-ass. Yes, the tragedy of Dawn is at the sad center of this story. Along the way, a mother describes the horrific death her son suffered by Tillikum; also, a prankster that saw Star Trek 4 too many times, stripped naked and paid with his life for his naiveté. I think after viewing this you will share with me the point only driven home by the biologist: The very concept of taking ocean traversing creatures and penning them up in tiny pools, where they are trained to perform like monkeys, is cruel in itself. The abuse of these whales, with the many cuts upon their bodies, goes a long way in explaining the attacks on the trainers. The tragic history of Tillikum is relayed to you culminating in his killing of Dawn. The documentary features the cover-up of Dawn's tragedy with the classic blaming the victim which works so well in liability cases. You will have a far different view of Sea World after watching this. Again, even if the story were completely inaccurate, and I am being deceived, the case for stopping the sadistic practice of capturing seagoing whales, removing them from their social group and putting them into ridiculously small pools remains unrefuted by any: he said, she said.Yes, Dawn seemed like a deeply caring human being, but the practice itself is immoral. Sometimes misanthropy follows unavoidably from just a basic observation of humans' callousness to other life around them: human and non-human. As your reviewer, I won't lie to you, this is not a pleasant viewing experience. It has great social value, despite this, in showing you the dark side of Sea World. The price these amazing creatures pay for our amusement is just too absurdly high. As a religious person, dominion does not mean humiliation and unnecessary inflicting of pain. My favorite scene is the calf ripped away from its mother. The cries went on for hours according to one of the trainers. How anyone could witness such suffering and not be aware that it is morally wrong is an utter mystery to me. I do not wish to play: is this narrative true or false about Tillikum? The practice being immoral obtains independently of this whale and the trainers that suffered in its care. The powerful pairing of the 'putting the best face' on the empirical damage to the whales won't make you whistle a happy tune. Visually, they are beautiful creatures meant to swim the world's oceans; the most heartbreaking feature is that their great misfortune was in running into us. If this documentary leads to the ban on their exhibition and torture for monetary gain, it was worth every bit of the effort that went into making it. An Excellent Documentary. Deus Vobiscum Dawn.

		<fullReview>A really difficult subject to write about, let alone make a film about. I've never been to Seaworld or seen an killer whale show. I had no outside knowledge of any of this before going into this movie. My only thought before I started the film was an ignorant one: just put the whales in bigger enclosures. Yet there's so much more than that. It's so blatantly obvious that orcas are incredibly intelligent creatures, maybe even more so then humans to some extent. They are social and they are very emotional and the bonds formed with their trainers are ones of love and companionship. It's beautiful to watch the whales and people get along so well. But, at the end of the day, they're wild animals. And with the conditions these poor creatures are kept in, it's no surprise there is retaliation. Hell, if a human was kept like that for decades, I'm sure they would've done a lot more to their captors. This documentary is one to watch. It's informative and it talks about a seriously relevant subject matter. Even though Seaworld are finally taking action, this is still a problem with many other parks and all other kinds of animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horrid Treatment of Sea Animals Leads to Human Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dawn Brancheau was not only one of the most experienced trainers at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, she was one of the most beloved. According to her colleagues in the documentary "Black Fish", she understood sea animals, particularly killer whales, like few others. For 15 years, she trained killer whales and participated in the killer whale shows at Seaworld, working with one of the most famous and largest killer whales in captivity, Tilikum, a bull orca. At only 39 years old, her career was cut short. (It should be noted that whales are not fish; they are air-breathing mammals who live in the water; their ancestors once lived on land.) In 2010, shortly after a show which became a disaster when Tilikum failed to cooperate because of mishaps neither entirely the trainer's nor the whale's fault, Dawn decided to have some quiet time with Tilikum to calm the whale down and ease their relationship. After only a few minutes, Tilikum grabbed Dawn, pulled her down into the water and mutilated her. Because scientists now know whales are highly intelligent, similar to their dolphin kindred, more than likely this whale knew exactly what he was doing: he purposefully killed his trainer. Tilikum's behavior may have been carefully considered as a message to his human captors that he was frustrated with the circumstances of his captivity. This is the focal story of "Black Fish", a scathing exposé of these entertainment parks, especially in regards to their killer whale shows. Like most kids who grew up in the late 1970's, 1980's and 1990's, I went to SeaWorld a handful of times. Seeing these beautiful creatures in front of your eyes is a magnificent wonder to behold, and in particular the killer whale shows. Most Generation X'ers and Millennials visited SeaWorld and similar amusement parks themed around sea animals. I think we all assumed the whales and the parks had a special relationship in which the animals agreed to be in captivity in exchange for food and shelter. I think I also assumed these parks were created by people who loved sea animals and wanted to create these attractions as a way for the public to interact with these incredibly unique animals. While the trainers and others who are in direct contact with these animals certain love and respect them, corporate interests appear to have very little empathy or sympathy for the animals they own, more interested in profit than humanity."Black Fish" paints a very grim picture of the attitudes of upper management of SeaWorld and other similar parks in the United States and around the world. Although not mentioned in the documentary, SeaWorld Entertainment was originally created by the Anheuser-Busch corporation as part of their Busch Gardens amusement parks which were associated with their brewing companies. While certainly the idea of an amusement park founded for the purposes of exposing the public to sea animals, the parks were created by a beer company, not by animal lovers or experts. Early on the documentary, we see footage from the 1970's of whales being captured for the purposes of eventually becoming part of SeaWorld and related amusement parks. Since there was no regulation at the time, hunters could capture these animals at will without fear of government oversight.The documentary traces incidents of disruptive and violent behavior among the animals which appears to be a direct result of mistreatment. The documentary portrays corporate managements of these parks as having little regard for these animals, and the most at stake in terms of generating large revenue and pleasing stockholders. They would give young trainers misinformation about whales to minimize their responsibility towards the animals. Often in many of the accounts of injury and even death among trainers, the "official" story from the corporation was the incidents were the fault of the trainers, and the animals are generally happy and content, and bad things happen because of error. However, the documentary reveals much mistreatment of the animals, to the extent that sometimes the animals will hurt one another, which happened early on to Tilikum when he was young.The story-line also reveals that when these parks became hugely popular in the 1970's and on-wards, there was little scientific research about whales and similarly high-intelligent sea animals. For many years, it was thought that whales were not highly emotional, and they lived for only about 25 to 30 years. Apparently, much of the data came from whales in captivity, not whales in the wild. It was eventually revealed that whales in captivity tend to live shorter lives, and in the wild, among those who reach adulthood, whales can live about the same life span as humans, from 60 to 75 years. They are not only highly intelligent, but they bond emotionally to members of their families in similar ways as human beings. However, these were unknown to the SeaWorld corporations who seemed to have little interest in understanding the nature of these animals.A sobering look at a cultural phenomenon which became part of modern life in the late 20th century. Sea parks, an outgrowth of the larger complex amusement parks begun by Walt Disney in the 1950's, have become part of American and international culture. Unfortunately, they were established to make money, and they would mislead young trainers with erroneous information. According to the documentary, much of the conclusions of upper management had nothing to do with knowledge about whales. While I am sure upper management individuals would deny any wrong-doing, they are pressured from stockholders and corporate executives to minimize their responsibility. Here, the documentary relies on the testimony of the trainers and not a corporate spokesperson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humans live with a hidden gift to destroy the beauty on this world. Blackfish is a stunning documentary that shows us how we use this super power by changing the nature of Tilikum, an orca, once docile on the oceans, and now, a human that lives on a bathtub.The movie has a nice editing job. The story of Tilikum is told for us by the eyes of former trainers of the SeaWorld, that amazes us with the experience of being in love by the job, as a trainer, and how they fell in love with the position. How was their lifes with Tilikum and Tilikum's sons, training them and "taking care" with their lifes. And it ends with the fatality of one of Tilikum's victims. With nice shots and a pretty linear storyline, the time flew.Orcas are docile animals, that lives with their family the entire life. They have different group communications between the species, just like Indian tribes. Tilikum, just like the other orcas on the industry, was captured as a baby and had to grow up far away from his family. Since different orcas uses different languages, he never fits with other orcas. They beat up on him, because they were getting hungry because of his mistakes on the show. The aggressive behavior of Tilikum is a reflection of his life. Orcas aren't suppose to be alone, and they kept Tili on solitary over and over, because of his behavior. The movie is very informative about the nature of the animal.Orcas are not killer whales. There's an industry gaining a lot of money by changing the nature of this magnificent animals, on movies and at this circus, like SeaWorld. And they're winning with toys, shirts. The animal life has changed into money, and we enslave them, we kill them. Our race is cruel in so many ways, but it's worst in turning the nature into us.The movie is stunning. The editing is a key point on it. It has a pretty good storyline and, forgot to mention, a nice soundtrack. I love orcas, and feel sad for Tilikum, the human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I just wanted to tell the real story. And I trust that once audiences are armed with the truth, they will make the best decisions by themselves and their families", said Gabriela Cowperthwaite, the director, for a CNN interview.This intriguing documentary tells the story of Tilikum, a male "killer whale" that murdered its trainer - Dawn Brancheau, on SeaWorld Park in Orlando, Florida, in 2010. But, what did motivate this animal to that? Is that the Cowperthwaite and her team will explain to us. Furthermore, all the dark secrets about Tilikum's history and the historical of omissions by the business administrators are cleared.Lastly, this exquisite movie is a warning for all those who finance this industry and specially for those who want to control wild animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth Behind the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish follows the logic of a common documentary and shows through the testimonies and reports from ex coaches and their relatives, hunters, experts and others involved, the reality behind the shows of the water park SeaWorld and how this reality experienced by animals can compromise them psychological health, generating considerable influence on their behavior.Since the beginning of the documentary are presented several reports of ex trainers from SeaWorld, where they speak how they met the park and what led them to want to work there. The documentary follows interleaved to testimonials, videos recorded by visitors and workers from the park showing the day-to-day of the animals in the park and images of the hunting of these animals at sea. Over the reports they are taking the opposite direction until all expose what is not shown in the presentations. Accident cases and deaths of ex trainers are discussed. The majority of reported cases are involved with one of the animals of the SeaWorld: Tilikum the "killer whale".Tilikum is one of the main characters of the documentary. Since his hunting and first day in the park to accidents and deaths caused by the killer whale are discussed in the documentary. Experts discuss the animal characteristics in wildlife in contradiction to what is reported by the trainers. This is the objective of the documentary, discuss how the quality of life experienced by wild animals in captivity influence on their behavior.Some questions may be raised by Blackfish: what is the role of the media in the image we have of wild animals and the treatment given to them in parks like SeaWorld? (SeaWorld advertisements) How the relationship we have as human beings with these animals is presented for the children? (Most ex trainers in their testimonies reported that knew the SeaWorld park as they are children and that it influenced them to want to work there.) What is the purpose of the isolation of these animals of their wildlife? (Research, preservation of species, recovery of sick animals, human entertainment) How to see if what we see in these parks is real? (SeaWorld instructed their park guides to lie about the life expectancy of the killer whales in nature to make the visitors think that captive animals live more).At one point of the documentary is presented a video recorded by one of the park visitors while he still had no fixed installations and the animals were exposed in their natural environment. In the video we can hear the audio of a horrified woman to see two killer whales trying to overthrow to the sea and eat what appears to be a sea lion of an ice sheet. Why this woman was so horrified by the scene that happened when was perfectly natural for the place in which the scene happened and for animals in their natural space?The discussion promoted by Blackfish can easily be extended to the isolation promoted by zoos. As much as the animals in the zoo are not trained to presentation, it is not too difficult to find news about the quality of their lives in captivity. A cage, aquarium or jail for bigger than can be, they are what they are - a cage, aquarium, prison. Promote the limitation of wild and natural life of animals for human entertainment as exclusive purpose is crime.An interesting fact is that throughout the documentary "Orcas" are called by "killerwhales", and the goal of the documentary is to show how the conditions the animals lived led them to be killers.Blackfish satisfy its role to bring out the reality experienced by animals when used for human entertainment purposes. Through the accounts given that mostly add very much in favor of the suggested questioning and that lead us to reflect on how much we are blind to the reality behind these freak shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After personally watching killer whales perform at Sea World, I now feel nothing but shame and guilt after watching this documentary. The human performers are reading from a script, and were basically as mislead as the public was concerning the treatment and health of these magnificent creatures, but nothing could be further from the truth. This is an extremely important film, and should be shown to all the children of the world truly concerned with these mistreated animals, their part in the natural ecology of the planet, and perhaps even more importantly, to learn about the corporate criminals who destroyed these wonderful animals strictly for corporate profit.</fullReview>

The Holocaust is the most obvious choice. Probably people would have talked about slavery the same way if the change would have been as quick.Anyway this film makes a good case against keeping animals in captivity.I have seen this on Arte, an European channel who has not much in common with the Arts, but somehow is against science promoting all sort of pseudo-sciences, at least what its reporters can find. And it fit quite well with the spirituality inserts and the suppositions about Orca psychology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Distressed 911 calls saying that a whale has eaten one of the trainers while we see underwater footage of Orcas and trainers opens up for this documentary made by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. These are the calls from the day when Dawn Brancheau was killed in February 24, 2010 in SeaWorld of Florida. How could this happen? What went wrong? What is to blame? The structure of the film is superb, beginning with the recent attack in SeaWorld and then going back 4 decades to see where it all began from the capture of the whales, following how they were treated, investigating attacks from the past, eventually leading to an understanding why this could happen.It is explained to the viewer that Orcas in captivity suffer from psychological and emotional stress. The people in the film contradicting this mean that Orcas have a better life and live longer in captivity, because they get access to medical care and always have food and shelter available. This is obviously false. It is the same old arguments used by people in favor of animal captivity. Apparently killer whales in the wild have double the life span. It is also explained by an expert that after scanning their brains, it shows that Orcas have parts of the brain that humans do not. And especially when it comes to emotions, the Orca's brain seem to be more advanced.The best part of this documentary is how emotionally gripping it is, presented in interviews with former trainers, Orca researchers, killer whale hunters among others and with footage of the Orcas. Scary scenes where trainers are being attacked and emotional ones showing heartbreak both from the whales in form of cries when they are separated from their families and from people that have lost family members in the attacks.This film really moves you. Other than being well-produced and containing animations presented beautifully it is also an important eye-opener to the fact that it might not be OK, morally to keep smart animals (or any beings) in captivity. Both times I was watching this film my eyes were fixed on the screen. This documentary is golden!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review on Blackfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish, a powerful environmental advocacy film, goes deep into the dangers associated with orca captivity, specifically at SeaWorld, detailing the damaging consequences to both the whales and their trainers while exposing corruption at one of the country's most popular theme parks. The film brings animal rights and abuse to center stage in order to raise awareness for the suffering that these majestic whales endure throughout their lives in captivity. At a popular place like SeaWorld, many young families go to view the orcas perform, yet they are naive as to what goes on behind the scenes. Blackfish no longer wants this naivety, setting their true purpose towards advocating for an end to the use of orcas at SeaWorld due to the evidence of its damaging effects. Through the use of powerful interviews from former trainers, scientific research on whale behavior, and shocking archival footage, Blackfish is successful in building an overwhelming case against SeaWorld and for the orcas. The only weakness in the film seems to be the lack of a counterargument from current SeaWorld executives, but Blackfish uses SeaWorld's refusal to cooperate to their advantage, spinning it as evidence that SeaWorld knows they are backed into a corner. The greatest strength Blackfish has is its ability to build such strong evidence against orca captivity, primarily through former trainers recounting traumas they saw the whales face and archival footage to connect the viewer to those traumas visually. This film is especially valuable for any past or present SeaWorld attendees, because for those people, the spectacular show they saw didn't explain what it took for the whales to do such tricks. In the end, I recommend this film as important for everyone to watch, especially those who believe strongly in animal rights and are sympathetic to animal suffering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People claim that Blackfish is a biased documentary, and whether it is or not, it still shows one thing: Killer whale captivity is cruel. The movie talk about how families are ripped apart, it talks about how emotionally damaged the whales become, and it talks about how the whales become physically damaged in captivity. Kasatka and Takara are just one example of an mother and daughter couple that became separated. They took Takara to another park because she was "becoming too rowdy and interrupting the shows" when really, there isn't any excuse in the world to justify separating a child from its parent. According to John Hargrove, "then the company would make these decisions to strip calves away from their mothers" (This Is). When they separated Takara from Kasatka, Kasatka went into depression. She stayed in the corner of the tank, hardly moving, and would chase the other whales off when they came near her. Kasatka would just sit in the corner, making noises that were later discovered to be her attempts at contacting Takara. When watching the movie, I heard the quote, "all whales in captivity have a bad life. They're emotionally destroyed. They're all psychologically traumatized. So they're ticking time bombs" (Blackfish). The first part of becoming captive is being taken from your family and being put into a small cage, a world so different from one that you were born in. As the movie says, "can you imagine being in a small concrete enclosure for your life when you're used to swimming 100 miles a day?" (Blackfish). Doing something that you've been doing since you've been born becomes a habit. You get used to it. And then with no preparation you're taken and put into a small box. It causes the whales to get aggressive. The movie states that there has never been an aggressive attack from a killer whale in the wild, where there are countless accounts of trainers being attacked by an Orca in an enclosed space. The movie tells us that killer whales are very socially sensitive animals, they are like people, they need to be with whales that they like, and if you put them with one that they don't get along with it causes problems. Tillikum, their main male whale, in an enclosure with two females that had attacked him and made him bleed. The whales can also get hurt during the shows with their trainers. John Hargrove said, "I was the one treating sunburns because their skins were drying out because they were lying motionless on the surface of the water with no shade for hours, on and on" (This Is). In the wild, the orcas can get away from the sun, and they can take care of themselves, but in captivity they have to rely on the trainers to help them and obviously they weren't doing a good job. As you can see, Orcas shouldn't be kept in captivity. They were born in the wild, and they deserve to be in the wild, they deserve to be free. Blackfish mentions all the reasons why orcas shouldn't be kept in captivity, not just for the sake of the animal but also for the sake of the trainers. It points out how dangerous it can be for both parties, premature deaths on both ends. "'This Is Not Right': Former SeaWorld Trainer Recalls Killer Whale Treatment." Web. 30 Nov. 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behind the scene at Sea World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabriella Cowperthwaite's unsettling yet compelling documentary, Blackfish, is not about your average visit to Sea World. This breathtaking, jaw dropping film gives disturbing "behind the scene" knowledge about the most famous Sea World we would've never known about. "This is a multi-billion- dollar corporation that makes its money through the exploitation of orcas" says Dr. Jeffrey Ventre. The dispute of Sea World was that it was never the fault of the whales but more so the fault of the trainer because of timing or "trainer errors". Knowing their wrongfulness proves why they denied to be interviewed throughout the documentary. Tilikum, a killer whale, weighing well over 12,000 pounds is the star of this documentary. Research shows that dolphins and whales have a profound instinct, awareness, intelligence and are amazingly friendly. Disturbing videos and accident reports from previous performances show a different side of Tilikum. Research also shows whales taken out of their natural habitat and placed in captivity are "ticking time-bombs". Originally Tilikum was only supposed to be used for breeding purposes but they found it in their need to use him for more. "Rule number one is you certainly would not breed an animal that has showed a history of aggression towards human" says Sam Berg, a former trainer from Sea World. Numerous incidents occurred when trainers were attacked or killed by Tilikum, but Sea World continued to require him to be trained and perform. Sea World's visitors look forward to seeing the performances unaware of the danger the trainers go through daily and the inhumane treatments towards the whales. Inhumane treatment consisted of no stimulation in the man-made box where the orcas lived for years, being deprived of food and skin raked when not following commands. This inhumane treatment is why whales lash out, become agitated, and trigger psychosis. Psychosis is what led Tilikum to lash out on one of his trainers who died during a performance which caused Sea Land to close. "I been expecting somebody to be killed by Tilikum, I'm surprised it took as long as it did." Former trainers were interviewed and talked about not being informed of past incidents. These trainers stated that showing videos and educating new trainers of the past incidents would be helpful as opposed to keeping quiet. There are many disturbing scenes in the documentary that bring the film together as a whole. One of the scenes forces the viewers to acknowledge the oppression of the orca and how being in captivity emotionally effects them. The scene portrays a major death which ties to the instability of the orcas. It's essential to the overall theme of the film. An employee of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that swimming with orcas is dangerous and unpredictable. They recommended physical barriers that separated the trainer and the orcas due to the dangers of being in close proximity. An OSHA expert witness recognized the deaths were not the trainer fault, as Sea World's public relations reported, but due to the agitation of the orcas. Sea World administration blamed the incidents on trainer errors and timing issues. Black Fish is a very informational and entertaining film that captures the core identities of killer whales in captivation. From the emotional capture of the whales to the disturbing attacks they perform out of the daily irritation of inhumane treatments. "There's no record of any orca doing any harm to humans IN THE WILD" says another former trainer. The tone that this documentary is trying to portray is somewhat sympathetic and sorrowful but seems to enlighten the world on the affects of taking the orcas out of their natural habitat in the ocean where they swam freely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of the daunting documentary Blackfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stomaching the unbelievable documentary, Blackfish, will be challenging. Objectively, Blackfish is a horrendous, eye-opening documentary following the capture and placement of orcas into captivity. Following fatal the tragic events, of three individuals, the documentary Blackfish ultimately questions is it best to leave killer whales in captivity at Sea World. This heart-rending and incredibly stunning film gives insight to the industry of monetization of the apex predator at Sea World. The documentary centers on the famous orca whale, Tillikum, who inevitably undergoes a state of psychosis. Blackfish was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, an avid filmmaker, who boldly makes a case for the orcas. In the end, the documentary will leave you speechless. Full of captivating interviews and graphically unsettling footage, this documentary relies heavily on emotional appeal to attract its viewers. Blackfish evokes strong emotion. The documentary unites the audience by putting together film and evidence of the negligence and harsh treatment of the orcas. The film draws pity from the audience, not only for the orcas, but also for the trainers. Focusing on the one of the most famous marine parks, Sea World, Blackfish broadens the view of what orca life is like in captivity. A view most daunting. Blackfish is not suitable for all ages. It is rated PG-13, due graphic material. The meaning of the documentary is to bring awareness to the so called brutality that goes on within marine parks. Blackfish targets an array of all people. If you are a Sea World fan, you will be bewildered by the film. That said, if you have been before, I urge you to watch Blackfish. Advocates of animal cruelty and generally, animal lovers, will hear of the movie and flock to it. This is a documentary everyone advocating animal rights should see. It is truly astonishing. Personally, I do not like this documentary. The film is incredibly bias and ambiguous. Between the testimonies and the trainer responses, I find Blackfish overwhelmingly contradictory. I have a few problems with the presentation of the testimonies within the documentary. The chosen previous Sea World workers that spoke out in the Blackfish made the documentary confusing. They were unclear about the length of the time that they worked there. Also, if the conditions of Sea World were that shattering, why are they only speaking out now?After watching the documentary, I found the material boastfully one-sided. Though there is a lot of truth to this documentary, there is also a lot of contradiction. Taking a look here, the family of Dawn Brancheau, which is the films featured victim, makes an astonishing statement. "Dawn would not have remained a trainer at SeaWorld for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for." This raised many questions for me. Is the documentary Blackfish completely true? Sea World declined any statements involving the creation of Blackfish. I found this fishy, however, it seems Sea World has provided a very well informed defense. Sea World takes into account many are now weary of their water park. Rebutting the lot of claims of Blackfish provides, Sea World released "69 Reasons You Shouldn't Believe Blackfish". The following link is an analysis of the misleading or inaccurate content inside the documentary. Overall, Blackfish is an eye opening documentary. Though I did not like it, you may. It gives a lot of insight into the world of orcas in captivity. Be wary, there is graphic content. I do not recommend it to the faint of heart. The documentary is quite contradictive. Though this may be, I believe there is some truth in the matter. Stirring controversy at its finest, Cowperthwaite incites reductio ab absurdum to enforce credence into this shocking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misused and abused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me Blackfish was a cruel and horrifying film. This film was basically explaining how they abused, and mistreated whales to the fact they turned violent. One incident of abuse was towards Tilikum, one of the famous killer whales, he was punished for disregarding orders only with the other whales. One form of punishment they used was that they would rake the whale's skin, leaving holes, scratches, and other wounds on the body of the whales. Another one was they wouldn't feed them leaving the whales hungry. This lead to the other whales to gang up on Tilikum scaring his bodies, and also leaving an emotional distress. What else would you think would happen if something or someone was pushed to the edge? They not only had to deal with physical abuse and torment of the trainer they was also put through mental abuse. When the whales were young they was taken out of their nature habitat, and forced to do tricks at a dropping of a nail for the trainers. Not only being taken out of their nature habitats they was taken to an off shore amusement park like place, and forced to live in an 20ft * 30ft steel boxed pool over night in the dark. As early discovery states that, "whales have an extra part of the brain that humans don't have called Para limbic Cleft." The Para limbic cleft in whales' processes their emotions to the next layer dealing with a sense of self and social bonding to become stronger. This makes their lives more emotional. So say that why push a whale known as killer whale to the point of it living in distress. I think whales are not to be taken out of their nature habitat, and forced to do tricks that they wasn't familiar with then punished for disregarding orders. This film wasn't made for people to be on the side of Sea World or Sea Land; it was meant to be in favor of the whales. It was meant to show why the whales shouldn't be taken out of their nature habitat to be placed in an amusement park like environment, and forced to perform tricks at the dropping of a pen. After all the research they did on these whales they still haven't figured out that one taking young whales from their family screws with the mental process of the their brains, and second they are using the semen of the whale that have been reported dangerous. Tilikum was reported to turn on trainers, but these people are just in it for the money. It's plain as day that it's in the genes of Tilikum's offspring well the whales that was born with his semen that they will act the same way he did. Then as that the young whale are being taking care of by the mother until able to living on its on the people of Sea World and Sea Land will take them from their mothers leaving the parents in distress. To me these people need more researchers on these whales because the data that lead them to the conclusion they made is complete inaccurate due to the number of deceased trainers. Either they stop to better study these whales, or they need to be shut down alone with putting a stop to attempting to train whales. It will take people who are concerned about the population of whales and the lives and love ones of these trainers to put a stop to this torment. How many more deaths of trainers do there need to be until these kinds of things to stop.</fullReview>

Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite pieces together a strong case directed toward SeaWorld for their treatment of killer whales in captivity. What troubles me is that the film was released in 2013 and I have now gotten an opportunity to witness behind the scenes at such a "fun" or a "great family venue".Blackfish follows the life of a male killer whale named Tilikum. After being captured at two years old, Tilikum has been in captivity since. Originally at SeaLand, his experiences were quite troubling. The main pool where the shows took place were very small in proportion to the killer whales as the metal boxed that held them at night were even smaller. SeaLand practiced food deprivation if the Orcas weren't cooperating or acting in the right manner. As any living animal, including the human species that would cause a lot of frustration which tended to end in violence. Eventually, the Orcas acted out and killed a trainer. Once the alleged death, SeaLand shut down and Tilikum was sent to SeaWorld. SeaWorld was overjoyed to have Tilikum for breeding purposes, but they were aware of his violent history as it was stated in his portfolio upon arrival. SeaWorld disregarded his violent history and allowed trainers to be one-on-one with him.Troubling facts from the interviews with the former trainers in the film was that they weren't aware of Tilikum's previous outbursts of violence. Cowperthwaite does a good job on interviewing the former trainers and then showing actual footage of them at SeaWorld. The former trainers aren't just angry former employees trying to take stabs at a bad employer but are expressing the fact that they were just doing what they were told as any good employee would do. Samantha Berg, a female Orca trainer stated that she didn't know much about the killer whale species, she only knew how to train them. It's startling that there isn't an education requirement or experience needed to even become a trainer. As stated in the film, an individual just need the ability to swim with a good personality.Many horrific facts stand out in this film. The fact that after incidents with trainers and Orcas were solely blamed on the trainers to keep Orcas in captivity. Dawn Brancheau was formerly the head Orca trainer at SeaWorld until her death on February 24, 2010. Her incident was a prime example on how SeaWorld lies to insure the captivity of Orcas. Another fact is when this incident happened, Tilikum was put into isolation and still is in isolation to this day. Blackfish shows the viewer that Orcas are intelligent, social, caring animals. It also shows the viewer that they are capable of violent outbursts and do not deserve to be kept in captivity.Cowperthwaite does a successful job of engaging the viewer by making the film very emotional. She also does a good job of proving the inhumane treatment of Orcas in captivity through personal interviews with the former trainers. Without the trainer insight, Cowperthwaite would have had a difficult time engaging a viewer. The film targets the general public hoping that we can all grow awareness to the treatment of Orcas in captivity. I would personally recommend this film to everyone so that one day the inhumane treatment will be prevented or even better, stopped completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real SeaWorld</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Real Look at SeaWorldBlackfish is the eye opening documentary of SeaWorld, the theme park that we have known for most of our lives. This documentary leads a lot of insight to the grim way SeaWorld has made its fortunes. This film reveals many secrets, and deceptions about the theme park, and provides ample evidence of their improper techniques. The film includes several in depth interview with some of the company's most experienced and well trained animal trainers, whale catchers who brought many of the whales to the organizations parks, lawyers who defended SeaWorld and OSHA personnel that investigated the accidents and tragedies that happened at the theme park. As well as inside footage that is revealing to many hidden things about the theme park. All sources provide many eye opening facts about SeaWorld. They make you question SeaWorld's justifications of running their eccentric park. The film content is full of new information that many guest of the park, and fans of the franchise didn't know about. With all of the first-hand information it makes the content very reliable and valuable. This film is definitely a downer on the SeaWorld franchise as it should be. SeaWorld has had many mishaps to say the least. The tragic mishaps at their theme parks have involved around the biggest attraction they have: the killer whales. One in particular, Tilikum, and 12,000 pound killer whale that does exactly that. However I am not saying that Tilikum goes out of his way killing anyone who is in the water with him, but three deaths on his record, and several injuries on his account, doesn't give Tilikum a very good or safe reputation. In Tilikum's defense, being stuck in a pool all his life has caused him to suffer from some sort of psychosis. Tilikum has been living in a pool since he was two years old. He also has a collapsed dorsal fin, which SeaWorld trainers tell everyone that it is natural, and even happens in the wild. Which the film reveals is a big lie. They also reveal another lie about how long the whales live. There is footage from a guest who asks a trainer, and the trainer lies to the guests face saying they live longer in captivity. SeaWorld lies again and again. These examples don't even include the lies they tell the media when people are attacked, and killed. When the late Dawn Brancheau was killed by Tilikum, SeaWorld said that she drowned on her own, but in reality Tilikum pulled her under the water and shook her viciously until she drowned. Just more proof of how SeaWorld deceives its followers. SeaWorld had lies about how they got their whales. Killing several in the process, they round the babies up into nets and take them from their families. The whale catcher that was interviewed for this film also said that they anchored down the corps of the whales that were killed in the process. They put rocks inside the dead whale bodies and let them sink to the bottom of the ocean floor. These are just some of the few ill practices SeaWorld used to get their precious whales. Also when it became illegal to catch the whales off the American northwest coast, they immediately shifted their operations to Iceland where it was legal to retrieve their cargo. All SeaWorld cares about is making profits at the ticket booth, and money in the gift shops. Overall the documentary of SeaWorld's poor practices and park tragedies is shocking to say the least. The killer whales they have in captivity are not all fit to perform with trainers in the water. They are wild animals and that is where they belong, in the wild. The way SeaWorld handled all their park accidents has been poorly dealt with, and completely wrong to lie to the public. This documentary has opened a new view to the public to show insight in SeaWorld's dramatic past, and to hopefully raise awareness for the future. Blackfish is an excellent film, with first-hand accounts, plentiful facts, and mysteries revealed about the incidents that happened at their park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BlackFish Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is an emotional tug-of-war. You honestly need to go into the film with a totally unbiased point-of-view, and then afterward you can have whatever view you want. I'm going to try to speak unbiasedly about this documentary, but it's just a slap in the face with feelings. I might have cried just a tiny bit. The beginning is not what you plan to want to hear. It begins with what seem to make the whales seem like the bad guy. They say that one of the whales, Tilikum, has killed one of the trainers, Dawn Brancheau. Then we follow about six trainers and their experience with working with the whales and other animals at SeaWorld. The director and also the editors of the film made a good choice in how they wanted the film to look, but in a way it felt like it was missing something. More facts maybe? If you wanted to write a paper on this you might wanna look up a little bit more information, but it did really show a lot. We follow the life of Tilikum, the male whale that was captured in 1983 at two years old for SeaLand of Canada. We see with his reactions with both the trainers at SeaLand and SeaWorld and how the trainers treated Tilikum. We then follow his move to SeaWorld and his life within the facility. With the emotional point of this film, you really felt a connection between the retired trainers and the whales and how they felt about the whales, and also the people who actually went to go collect the whales as well. At one point you meet one of the men who use to capture the whales and see how emotionally sick he felt when he was forced to take the baby away from the mother. He explained that he didn't think at all about how it would effect both the mother and the baby. He continued that he cried the whole time cause he could feel what both the whales were feeling and all he wanted was to not take them away. He felt like he was taking away a child from a mother with everyone watching and he couldn't stop what he was doing. Also along with the trainers that we follow in the film we see how emotionally attached they were to the animals and how one male trainer explained that the only reason he stayed as long as he did was because he cared for the animals and didn't want anyone to treat them in a harmful way. He knew that if he left that the whale wouldn't get the same treatment as he treated it and so he stay for a while longer. All the people who were interviewed in the documentary all explained that it wasn't always the whales fault, but mainly how it was trainers not being careful and not truly understand that they are always at risk of death at any moment. After the many deaths they created Orca (1977) to show the fear of these poor creatures while Free Willy (1993) which created almost twenty years later show how loving these creatures really are. All in all, I thought it was a great emotional puller that makes you rethink about how animals are treated in captivity and what lies they are actually telling at Sea World about these beautiful creatures. If you ever plan on going to Sea World or any other place like it, do some research. Ask them questions. Cause you never know what's real and what fake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary "Blackfish" is the movie of choice if you are in the mood to be heart- broken and angry at hit theme parks that rake in millions of dollars a year by torturing Orcas. The main park that the documentary focuses on is SeaWorld, but the original home of the main attraction at Seaworld, Tilikum, was also documented. The idea of an Orca the size of three or four semi-trucks combined charging or landing on top of me is absolutely terrifying. The trainers embraced this fear everyday they went into work, yet were limited in regards to the suggestions they could make about the Orcas' safety and physical and mental health. For many this would seem to be common sense, but to many at SeaWorld I guess that is not the case; Orcas are supposed to have roaming areas bigger than a swimming pool. They also should not be caged up in small areas when sleeping or not performing. This creates agitation and they are not able to socialize with other Orcas. They also do not have the ability to experience the feeling of freedom when roped in to a ridiculously small living space. All of this is a recipe for disaster and is emphasized heavily throughout the film that it could be a reason for why many Orcas act up. There were also many disturbing scenes of which included a dozen Orca trainers or staff getting seriously injured or even killed by an Orca. This part of the film definitely reached out and touched the emotional side of viewers. Watching a human being killed by an Orca that does not know any better or simply messed up the routine is terrifying. Even more terrifying, the release of this film did not alter the thoughts and moral values of some fans because SeaWorld is still using the same methods they were using in the film for holding and training the Orcas. They were closely investigated following the release of the documentary and interviewed by many. Many former fans of the Orcas are still going out and paying money to watch them perform despite the shocking videos and controversy in recent years. It could almost be said that anyone who is a "fan" of a specific Orca or simply the idea of orcas performing under these conditions in general is actually not because by paying money to go watch the orcas perform or buying souvenirs like stuffed animals simply makes the entire situation worse because this money allows the parks to go capture even more orcas and raise them in the same captivity as the others. Gabriela Cowperthwaite, the director of "Blackfish", definitely achieved her goal of exposing the extremely horrifying reality of what Orcas go through in these parks, even since the very beginning of the idea to capture them at a young age and raise them up in captivity rather than the wild. To populate the parks in the beginning, the film showed video clips of boats cornering packs of Orcas and taking the youngest ones away from their families. The mother orcas screaming was talked about by one of the former workers at the park. He explained how, at the time, they were all told, and believed, that everything was good. But in the back of his mind he, and many others, realized how morally and socially wrong it was. "Blackfish", while not making a huge impact right now on the change of parks like SeaWorld, is spreading the message fast. More and more people are recognizing the dangers of the parks and taking a stand to stop supporting the captivity of these Orcas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save the whales!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't you just love going to Sea World and watching the orcas perform? Well what if the performance you attend goes wrong? What if an orca attacks his trainer? And after seeing the truth, hear that Sea World tried to sweep it under the rug? Blackfish is a film that tells you the truth and explains what led up to these horrific events.It is a chilling documentary about the harm done when orcas are forced into captivity and to perform for human amusement. It tells about the psychosis that the animals suffer from that ends up causing them to take the lives of several people who worked with them. Even after these tragic events, Sea World, whom are most notable for their orcas, changes the story multiple times. They try to blame the trainers involved in order to keep using the whales for their own monetary gain. Now it is not wholly against Sea World, it is against all of the marine parks with captive orcas. The reason they seem to single out Sea World is because it is the most well- known. I recommend this film to anyone, though it will make you hate Sea World. It hits you right in the heart with the truth of the sad incidents at Sea World and places like it. This made me want to go out and protest against these organizations. I believe the purpose of making the film was to cause that kind of action. The film is for everyone, not a specific audience, because it will take a great amount of people to do this. The music chosen was played at the best possible time to have the most impact with the testimonial it was paired with. The director of Blackfish, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, did a terrific job of grabbing your attention and making you want to keep watching. I have not seen any of her other films but this one was great. She did a very good job of building attachment to the whales in the beginning of the film by showing the testimonials of how majestic they are. Paired alongside with the music she chose it really evoked emotion from you. This causes you to have feelings for the orcas and by the end of the film want to help stop the horrible living conditions they are subjected to. Debatably the most depressing part of the film is not about an attack but the recounts and regrets of John Crowe, a former whale hunter. He tells of the heartbreaking reactions of how the rest of a pod react when their children are caught in a net and hauled away. The hunters drop the nets and surround the pod, then pick out the young ones. The rest of the pod could have left, but they didn't, they stayed and could be heard communicating and crying over their abducted young. John Crowe said, "that was the worst thing I could think of? I can't think of anything worse than that."Blackfish also pointed out that not only are people harmed when orcas are forced into captivity, but it does damage to the whales themselves. It tell of how they are captured in the wild, torn away from their families, and stored in small dark containers at the parks. This put them through trauma and causes psychosis as well as physical harm. In the wild if a whale is being attacked by another it can get distance, but not in these containers. About ninety-two percent of Sea World's orcas have not lived past twenty- five years. The average life span of wild orcas is thirty years for males and fifty for females, but they can live up to eighty to ninety years old. Yet, what does Sea World say about it? They say the orcas live stimulating lives and benefit from living in captivity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough Facts against seaworld</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Blackfish documentary acts as a critic against Sea World. If you're a fan of Sea World Park and want to stay that way, don't watch this film. This film is completely one-sided and biased. It shows various interviews and clips of attacks. It seems the sole central purpose this movie is to expose sea world and captivity. I honestly think they did a horrible job because none of their points were proved and they never had evidence for any of their claims. They made it seem as if sea world was all wrong doing and cruel.They used the pathos persuading technique. They tried to show all the whales in captivity and say they were all neglected and show the public all the attacks to hook the audience. While watching this film don't fall victim to all the emotional testimonies. This film can be very powerful and effective if you allow your emotions to get to you while watching. The clips form incidents and attacks are graphic and disturbing. People in the interviews are emotional and that allows the audience to connect with them. Be sure to notice that there is no evidence of most of the statements made. They also got ex-trainers to testify to build credibility, that's another technique to get the audience to think that the ex-trainers know everything and every word that comes out there mouth is true.Don't get me wrong, everything said in the film is not a lie but there is not enough proof that captivity is the direct cause of violent behavior of animals. Yes it's true that Orcas were kept in unfit cages and taken from they're pods and families, but there is no direct correlation between this and the attacks. In the film they liked to point out the huge whale named Tilikum and his recorded attacks. Upon research I have found out that out of the three incidents he was in stated in the movie; he was completely responsible for one and the cause of that one is said to be a trainer error. This documentary is 100 percent one-sided and the people who are testifying have no knowledge on orcas so it is no possible way they can tell the whole truth. All in all I feel as if this is a horrible documentary. The film its self is OK to watch if you want to know about incidents that have occurred in captivity with Killer whales Or if you want to hate Sea world. But the information in the film was not sufficient and there wasn't enough facts to support the main topic/ claim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish is an intriguing and heart wrenching film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is a great documentary film that portrays the repercussions of restraining killer whales that was once free, to captivity in Sea World. Also, the results of inhumane treatment towards the Orcas were portrayed. The Director of the film, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, depicts these repercussions through the insight of various former Sea World trainers and marine animals' experts. The interviewees provided an argument that the Sea World facilities and treatments toward the whales were completely inhumane and would eventually cause the Orcas to display aggressive behavior. The whales displayed aggressive behavior toward people that tried to interact with them. However, Sea World argued that the incidents caused by the whales, were completely the faults of the trainers and not the whales. The evidence provided in the film definitely proved otherwise. One particular Orca provided the most evidence out of all of the whales.The one particular whale was Tilikum. Tilikum is a 12,000 pound Orca that was captured at a very young age. He portrayed serious aggressive early on in his life; which led him to be moved to Sea World in Orlando. He was the cause of the deaths of three people. The death of Dawn Brancheau was the most famous case because of her popularity to the general public. Also, her death was filmed, but was soon removed from the internet. Exceptional insight was given to give some sort of reasoning behind Tilikum's madness. Of course, the main reason was the fact he was being held in captivity for years and forced to do tricks day in and day out.The former trainers and employees provided mind boggling information about Sea World. Some trainers experienced heart racing encounters with some of the Orcas. However, The Sea World Corporation decided to stick with the argument that the Orcas aren't at fault. Seeing that Sea World decided to stick with this ridiculous arguments, shows that corruption and irresponsibility were definitely at play. The way Blackfish surrounded this back-and-forth argument between former employees and the Sea World Corporation, provides a heart breaking film. Anybody that's concerned or even curious about the treatment and well-being of animals being held in captivity, should really watch this captivating and eye-opening film.Not only does the film provide in-depth information and a well-grounded narrative, it also depicts archive footage of the Orcas' performance and personal interviews. The viewer would be intrigued by the set-up of the footage portraying the trainers enjoying the company of the Orcas. The voice of those trainers explaining their opinion about Orcas while watching the archive footage, gives a somewhat contradiction. The footage shows the trainers, in some situations, enjoying the Orcas, while the opinions of the former trainers state otherwise. It gives the viewer a feeling of realization and disgust. Just hearing the criticizing of Sea World, will bring you to a point of hating the corporation and leave you not wanting to see any place that hold animals in captivity.Moreover, Cowperthwaite utilizes emotional footage of the communication between the Orcas to capture the intelligence and feelings that the Orcas hold. Also, Cowperthwaite shows the emotional connections instilled between the Orcas and trainers, which provide an insight to how the trainers and employees of Sea World might have felt when they realized that Sea World doesn't care about how the animals are treated. They just want the money.Overall, the film is informational, yet heart wrenching. The overall use of archive footage, interviews, and primary information, provides a well-grounded and exceptional film. The film is well put together and will keep you intrigued throughout the whole film. Even if documentaries might not be interesting to you, you should give this wonderful documentary a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a look at this film! It's very eye-opening!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Review: Black Fish Black Fish was quite the movie, I must say. It was informative as well as surprising. I highly recommend watching it. I was astonished by how it captures the Orca's (killer whales) beauty and intelligence, meanwhile telling some of the most brutal stories. That part was rather unpleasant to see. My deepest condolences go out to all those who lost their loved ones due to the unforeseen behaviors of the Orca's. Dealing with animals is a very risky thing, especially when you take them out of their natural habitat and keep them in captivity to do so. We have to take into consideration that animals process things just like we do, put them into perspective, and then decide how they are going to react. Their time frames of doing so and methods are just different than ours, of course. Black Fish shows us how people capture whales, keep them in insufficient environments, under mediocre conditions. This was within the first few years that whale entertainment came about. It also shows how the human and animal relationship can seem as if there is equal understanding and trust between the two, when there is really not. In reality, as well as in the film, we see how years of training and bonding are put into the relationship people build with the Orca's and still, they one day flip. I feel that it is more than likely because they are deprived of their freedom, space, and families. Whales are very emotionally attached. The film shows how it was discovered that these animals have an extra part of the brain that specifically enhances their emotions. That is the main reason why they migrate, and doing everything else as a family. When Orca's are taken away from that I'm sure it scars them. Whether their behavior shows it immediately or in the long run. That is built up emotion from detachment of their home, their families, and their freedom. There should be no surprise when incidents like the ones shown happen. It should be something that people who work with these animals make themselves well aware of. Tragedies have occurred, and most of them were not even spoke of. That was another issue in the film. There were so many incidents where the Orca's misbehaved and they would say it was "agression" or that the whales are just being "playful". After watching this film I'm sure we will all agree that that is not the case whatsoever. Their actions are well thought through, planned out, and put into action. The intelligence of these animals were very much underestimated. Although the trainers working with them meant no harm, and sincerely grew attached to the Orca's a few of them unfortunately still felt their wrath. In the worst cases, they did not live to tell the tale. I do not feel that the trainers are the ones to blame, they are simply doing their jobs in the most loving way they know how. The films shows that to be true. It's the lack of knowledge of the Orca's, and the fact that they are removed from their natural habitat and given less. That tampers with their instincts. It is the fact that an animal that massive in size should not be kept in a man-made pool, and that an animal that takes in such large portions of food is put on an eating schedule. I feel for the whales in this film. Sea World or any other form of a an entertainment setup where they are kept captive, is not the place for them to be. In a way it is inhumane whether the people involved in this realize it or not. Their love for the Orca's is clearly not enough to keep the tamed, because they are not meant to be tamed. I would suggest accepting the truth in that, and allowing the Orca's to be where they belong. Some animals are just meant to be admired from afar. All in all, this film was brilliant. I recommend watching it. It captures the beauty of the killer whale, shows their ability to respond and follow commands. However, it will also show how they are well aware of the choice they have to cooperate, or not to. Even that should be questioned: Is it that they are misbehaving or is it that this is just their natural behavior when their emotions have reached a certain height? Until research has proved otherwise, that is certainly something that will remain opinionated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is an eye-opening and brutally honest documentary of all the hidden truths behind Sea World and keeping whales in captivity. It will take all of those butterfly worthy nostalgic memories of going to Sea World as a kid and getting playfully splashed with water by the giant whales, and essentially beat them down until your stomach is churning. Blackfish is an intense and emotional film that I would compare to witnessing a car crash. You don't want to look, but you have too. It is an animal lovers worst nightmare due to its graphic content, and the deep sorrow you will feel for all the whales who are being physically and emotionally abused throughout the film. It is an extremely captivating documentary, and everyone should know of the dark realities behind the process of holding a wild animal captive. Throughout the film you will have a large number of facts spit at you, all of which are extremely insightful. You will see life displayed, as well as tragic death. All of which will turn your perspective on Sea World, and the whole theory of holding a wild animal captive, upside down. As a child I hopped in the car and impatiently waited to arrive at Sea World and go get splashed by the whales that seemed larger than life. After watching this documentary, it made me wonder how healthy and happy these seemingly spirited animals actually were, and what was actually going on behind the scenes. There are very few things more heart wrenching than having a piece of your childhood brought into light as essentially a lie, and this film is sure to break your heart. I approached the film nearly clueless towards what to expect, and I found myself absolutely furious about half way through. I don't know if I was furious at Sea World, or furious at my own ignorance, but I knew I was completely overwhelmed with emotion. You see sheer guilt and shame displayed from human beings who have taken part in capturing whales or working with them, and it is just raw emotion. That is something that is very appealing about the film. They hold nothing back, and you see such a widespread view of human perspective, and I think that is something that as humans, we kind of crave. A film should make us feel something, or make us go deep in thought about something, and that is why this documentary is so brilliant. The general theme throughout the film is just that we should be more aware of our surroundings. Sea world is completely exposed in this film, and for so long, we were all under the impression that everything they did was harmless and playful. It is really a film that just appeals to anyone who is in the dark. The purpose of the film was very apparent, and inevitably successful. All in all, as heartbreaking as Blackfish is, this documentary is necessary. With media and technology increasingly becoming more and more important in our society, there are a growing number of ways to make a difference. This documentary uses film to bring to light a problem that has been completely covered up by dancing whales and Shamu merchandise, and what a brilliant move that was. We are caught up in a time period where we are all adapting to find what works, and how we can get people to care about more than the latest iphone update and what sports team is playing that week. Blackfish chose to break everyone's heart for an hour and twenty three minutes to make us care about this problem, and it has made all the difference in the industry and the mind of people. I would encourage everyone to take the time to watch this film, because we shouldn't be in the dark forever. This film is important, and even though emotions might invade you, you won't be able to turn it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Free those Sweet whales! They deserve there families and to be wild, and free!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are always two sides to a story. In the movie, Blackfish, that is shown in numerous ways. SeaWorld is always thought of as a magic place for families to go and enjoy themselves. Where you can go see many sea life creatures like dolphins, piranhas, and a variety of fish. SeaWorld is known for having killer whales perform shows for you with their brave trainers. Blackfish shows a completely different side of SeaWorld. Killer whales are known to be at SeaWorld, doing tricks and jumps as their trainer instructs them to. Whales, just like humans, don't always response like they should. This movie is about a women whom was killed by a killer whale while performing a show. This movie is very eye-opening to the lives of killer whales in captivity and the lives of the trainers that work with them. This is a very dangerous atmosphere and should be taken very seriously. All trainer should know what they are getting into, and also be very well trained. Whales need time to get familiar with the trainers. Trainers need to be very cautious around these animals, because as friendly as the animals can be, they are also 300x bigger than human, and are known to be a little two-faced.Blackfish is more than a women getting killed by a killer whale. Blackfish shows the actions that SeaWorld took after the killings. They interview some of the "former" trainers at SeaWorld to get their take on what is going on inside of SeaWorld, and how they felt about their jobs there. They talk about their personal connections with the whales. Their opinions are given throughout the movie. They say whether or not SeaWorld betrayed this women after her death. Was it the whales fault? Was is her fault? What really happened at SeaWorld that day? What has been happening throughout time, with all of these attacks by whales? Blackfish is full opinions on the captivity of animals. They state that captivity of these killer whales is what is causing these viscous attacks to the whale's trainer. Most of the former trainer felt very strongly about what was being kept from them, and what they weren't told when beginning this job. You would think they would all quit after they found out about these killings, but instead they stay because they feel bad for the whales. Which seems odd, because they could also be killed at anytime.Most families that lives on this earth have a pet. Most of them just being cats, dogs, or fish. We don't go off and get grizzly bears, then try to train them. We all know that's very dangerous. Who says that SeaWorld gets the right to go off and kidnap these whales from their homes in the ocean and try to train them to be little show dog's. They are huge animals, of course everyone that come into contact with these whales are in danger. These whales are shown to hurt people while they live in captivity. No whales are shown to have hurt anyone while they are in the wild. What honestly makes sense about putting whales in large bath tubs with very little contact with other whales? Would it drive you crazy to be locked in a room, with only seeing a certain amount of people a day, while those same people ask you to constantly do tricks and jumps? I would personally go insane. That's what is happening to these killer whales. They are swimming around, slowly, going insane. Blackfish makes me feel like SeaWorld has been lying to me and everyone else for years. Now, I don't believe any of the stories about the "wonderful" whales. SeaWorld has been hiding stuff from us just as the government has. No one will ever know the true stories of these killings. What side of the stories are we supposed to believe? I honestly feel betrayed, just as the former trainers and people who have been killed by the whales. This movie shows the true colors of the place we all know as magical. There isn't much magic to it anymore.Though no one knows the truth about SeaWorld and the killings by the whales, this movie made it known that it is very possible that the whales at SeaWorld have viscously killed their trainers due to captivity. Killer whales are shown to be very friendly, and for all we know, the whales may have been just playing, not knowing what they are doing. Just like humans do, we all make mistakes. Again, there are always two sides to a story. It only makes since to do what's best for the trainers and the whales, due to the statistics that are given in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orcas, captured in the wild off Puget Sound and Iceland, are sold into captivity to be displayed at theme parks; one such killer whale, named Tilikum, is bought by SeaWorld from the closing Sealand of the Pacific in British Columbia, mainly for breeding purposes--and after Tilikum has already killed a trainer during a performance. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite's scathing indictment of SeaWorld and its unconscionable practices shows clearly the inhumane treatment Orcas endure just to be displayed for show, and the footage of aggressive behavior by killer whales towards unprotected, sometimes uneducated eager young trainers is horrifying. The film is enlightening not only as a cautionary tale, but also as a document of how greed blinds corporations from doing the right thing. Heartbreaking and hard to watch, though edited at times with manipulative fervor--to get an extra rise out of the viewer. Nevertheless, essential viewing. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a veggie, I make the conscious decision to not be directly involved in the killing of the animals for my pleasure. Zoos and aquariums have also been places where I found it depressing to watch sentient beings locked up so we can goggle at them, and watching Blackfish hurt my "soul". Gabriela Cowperthwaite clearly feels impassioned about the plight of these abused, neglected and misunderstood animals, and this comes across on the screen.First of all using the talking head's format gives a great deal of emotional weight to the topic. Cowperthwaite essentially distills the sense of frustration and helplessness of all those involved in capturing, training and maintaining the lives of the whales, and I found it especially difficult listening the labourer recounting how he captured whales. Having the interviewee staring down the lens of the camera as he sheds tears of anger should certainly melt even the coldest heart.Cowperthwaite also has a weight of live footage of the create a sense of gravitas. Watching a whale leap at its trainer as the trainer begs for their life is haunting, and I let out a few expletives in shock. Also splicing in news coverage of the deaths paints a sinister image of Seaworld; having corporate coverage contrasting with anecdotes shows that Seaworld have a lot to gain from covering up the many deaths and horrendous treatment of animals at their parks.Cowperthwaite, however, seems like an absent interviewer; meaning that he allows the people to speak until they are ready to stop, and he doesn't try to push the interview in a certain direction. Not having any difficult interviews, and people volunteering information under fraudulent terms are apparent in the film. For example: "After the film's release, former SeaWorld trainer Bridgette Pirtle said the final film was 'a complete '180' from what was originally presented to me.'" So there is some agenda pushing, and this is aided by Seaworld refusing to take part in the film.The film also ends cheese-ily. After the film spends the bones of 80 minutes trying to convince us to re-think our position on these abhorrent places, the message is undermined straight away by giving us a conclusion. Rather than leaving us with some difficult questions we need to answer, Cowperthwaite shows us, in a structural sense, that "everything worked out alright".Despite some qualms with this documentary, I still believe this believe this to be important one. If this film achieves one thing, it is to bring an esoteric topic in to the conscience of the public, which should be the goal of every documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of us have attended the famous "Sea World" where "wildlife" comes alive. Notice how I used wildlife as a quote. There's nothing wild or natural about captivating orca whales to mentally destroy them and cause them to attack instructors. "Blackfish" examines multiple orca whale attacks in amusement parks such as "Sea World" and how these whales are treated on a regular basis. It's not only depressing to see these magnificent creatures held captive for our pleasure, but it's terrifying on how these whales get so mentally tormented that they attack humans. Chilling true events are recovered with shocking real-life footage to capture what the intelligent and well-rounded narrators state. This isn't a bias documentary about animal cruelty where we'll get pictures of helpless dogs trap in cages (which is still wrong). This is a science-based statement reflecting the characteristics of one of the most powerful mammals in existence. Put together like almost a horror film with suspense to intoxicate the heart, "Blackfish" convinces us never to support the horrific mental and physical cruelty that orca whales face on a daily basis while being held in captivity. Hopefully this will convince the tourists not to go to "Sea World." It sure as hell convinced me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Blackfish tells the story of multiple killer whales in captivity, its main focus being Tillikum a massive killer whale captive at SeaWorld. The effects of captivity are highlighted, one Orca researcher himself even says "There is no record of an orca doing any harm to a human in the wild". This is a film that will rip your heart out and send you on an emotional roller coaster. Not only does it beg for the protection of the killer whales but it shows how detrimental that places such a SeaWorld are to the physical and mental health of any animal. It causes you to ask the questions, "What is morally right?" and "Are they taking animal captivity too far?" With a mixer of interviews, recorded footage of animals in captivity, and stories from people who have lost a love one due to an attack the importance of cutting down on captivity is expressed very well. If you love watching inspirational, moving films then you will adore Blackfish. It drives an unexplainable emotion in the watchers heart. You will not be able to stay the same and just let captivity continue. Blackfish will cause you to get off of your couch and be determined to make a difference. If you love places such as SeaWorld and local zoos this film may drive negative emotion. Experiences and memories that you had at those place may be ruined and stolen from you. You will either walk away after viewing the film and be angry with SeaWorld or feel like the film was too bias for you. Sadly, this film is has a lot of bias because it only shows one side of the spectrum, how awful the whales are being treated. It shows no positive things that could come along with places such as SeaWorld. The footage highlights things such as cuts and wounds on the animal. As a watcher you do not get to experience the full effects, negative and positive, of a whale being captivity. Then again, there could also not be a positive side to a whale being captured besides the animal being ill or hurt. Even if a whale has been captured, if it is able to heal well enough to be sent back into the ocean that is where he/she should go. There is nothing better for an animal than its natural habitat. The only good excuse to keep an animal in confinement is because if the animal was sent back into the ocean it could not survive there. It is awful to allow an animal to become dependent on humans and their easy sources for life when they were designed to be independent or be a part of a family that cares for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Free Tilly is not a lovable children's film from the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blackfish is a great documentary. At first, Tilikum seems like a star but quickly changes your opinion. The interviews with the trainers associated with Tilikum throughout his life to this point were excellent. There is a great story regarding Tilikum that needs to be heard. Blackfish is the tragic story of this whale and his many trainers. Unfortunately, there are no winners in this tale with the exception of those who may gain monetarily from Tilikum's life and his many performances. Tilikum's life is a sad one. Many trainers grow to love him but he has a troubled back story that leads to him acting out against people that do not do what he wants. Gabriela Cowperthwaite does an excellent job at compiling many stories together to give the viewer an idea of how killer whales live in the wild as well as in captivity. This helps the viewer develop an opinion of their own. Unfortunately, the end is where the agenda is pushed on the viewer with is the only reason why this documentary isn't perfect. I do agree with the opinions of Cowperthwaite but I don't like documentaries that push the filmmaker's opinions onto the viewers. The other issue I have is that Keiko, the enormously famous killer whale from Free Willy, was not brought up. That is a story that is also fascinating and would have made this documentary just a little bit longer instead of being a scant 83 minutes. The other thing that would do is show the other side of what might happen if a killer whale is freed. Keiko swam many miles to be around people because that what the whale is used to and wants to be around people. That makes the ultimate decision of what to do with Tilikum a bit troublesome as I'm not sure people would know what will happen if he were to be released. All of that being said, I am not sure why someone would contribute any money to any company that would put a whale through what Tilikum has been through in his lifetime. Such a shame.Blackfish was great but it was also extremely sad and makes the viewer feel bad for these whales kept in captivity. They are sweet animals with complex personalities. Tilikum is just one of those whales that probably should not be in a tank. He is just too big and has been through a lot of trauma. Sometimes even the sweetest dog who has been through trauma nips at the owner when in distress. Don't miss out on this documentary. It's well worth the 83 minutes and it will open your eyes.</fullReview>

After numerous recommendations I finally did one day.I actually found it troubling enough I had to play a video game during at least parts of it. Actual footage of people being hurt or killed by their creatures and screaming, no thanks. Some things I draw a line with what I can watch.I felt sort of heartless for this but even more disturbing then the trainers dying and Seaworld wanting to cover it up was when the daughter was taken away from the mom and just cried and cried after not having the daughter anymore. All for disrupting shows for little things, then staff is mocked for wishing they would not take the daughter away. I found this so horrible, made me in a sour mood and need to talk about it with people.I am glad Sea World is losing money due to the documentary. Can't say I will lose any sleep about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isaiah Hart 10/19/15 English 1010A very sad movie that shows the wrong doing of Sea World with the Killer Whale Tilikum who was mistreated by the people there. He was accused for killing three people ,but did it out of being done wrong. There had been videos of Tilikums first attacks, and all the trainers blame Sea world for Trying to cover up all the mistreatment the whales were getting. The first trainer was smashed together by two of the whales barely surviving by the skin of his teeth. The other one was being dragged down to the bottom of the pool repeatedly until he finally manages to escape and call for help. The after researchers had found that out they knew what the problem was. The whale were already thousands of miles away from their natural home. Now these social animals where designed to a theme park, and even smaller confinements in the theme park As for Tilikum this was definitely his problem and most people would say it was Sea worlds fault for making him that way. One CNN reporter said,"if you were confined to a bath tub for 25 years wouldn't you be a little crazy ?" This movie set a great message for viewer with all the real live footage and comments from different people. The movie is set up great from the beginning showing the process of how the animals were being caught. Then to the dark places that the fish were put in made many viewer very upset. The movies is told mostly through the eyes of 5 of the Sea world trainers. For the most part all they had to say about the movie was nothing but negative things. The thing that I didn't get is why they kept going back if they knew what was going on. The movie is a great movie but is also very biased. They only show the bad things about Sea World. The trainers and media never said what were the good things that Sea world did and why so many people came to watch the fish in the first place. Sea World is definitely not made out as an ideal theme/ water park should be. Other parks probably have similar policies when it comes to these mighty creatures and apparently someone decided to make a documentary about Sea World. After viewing all the review and looking more into the documentary, the story honestly doesn't seem that accurate from the movies perspective. However that still doesn't change the fact that you shouldn't keep animals in a confinement like that especially for that amount of time. It seems like the animals are more aggressive after being kept in captivity. This is also not good for the trainers since they are the ones having to deal with the animal who greatly out size them. The movies strongly suggest that this was the reason of Tilikums attack on the three trainers. Sea world is the obvious one to blame in this film,but this film cant really stop what they're doing over there. The movie also suggest the other guilty people are actually the people that go pay to see the shows in the first place. This didn't really make sense to me, but overall a very sad movie that shows the wrong doing of Sea world and how basically they were just worried about the money. This movie definitely will affect viewer about going to Sea world to watch the fish,especially after hearing about the death and the mistreatment of them but overall a great documentary.</fullReview>

And you'll never go to Sea World or attraction like it and see it in the same light (or more likely, this doc will make you never go again at all). This not only focuses on the abuse and mistreatment of Orcas in captivity, but also the danger in which the trainers are placed on a daily basis. After watching this documentary, I spent hours online reading articles. It's the type of movie that stays with you after it's over. My only criticism of this movie is that it was very one-sided. After additional research, I feel in agreement with the views presented in the documentary, but as a documentary, I feel like it should present more than one side of the argument. Though today, most documentaries no longer do that.</fullReview>

Animal abuse, isolation of whales, starving of whales, violence towards whales.The story sounds just like slavery. Praise to the people who made this documentary and animal activists who post on a regular to bring attention to the inhumane treatment of whales by greedy and selfish companies like Sea World. I can not believe that Sea World hides the truth from customers and use lies to cover their involvement in deaths of animal trainers. THAT IS A TOTAL INSULT TO THE WHALE TRAINER'S FAMILIES IF THAT WAS MY CHILD AND YOU PLACED THE BLAME ON HER AFTER SHE WAS KILLED BY A WHALE THAT YOU STOOD BY AND WATCHED IT BE TORTURED OR ISOLATED.

YES PEOPLE THEY RELEASE THEM BACK INTO THE WILD AFTER THEY ARE HEALED AND READY, unless they are so damaged they can't be released so they let them enjoy the remainder of their life at Sea World or another great center in Florida. You never gave them any credit for this big service they do day in and day out. Today they have been working for over 24 hours trying to free 19 manatees from a storm drain in Satellite Beach. I think their positive actions out way any negative things they do. If they did not have the funds to do these projects, who would do them?? Not a volunteer!

		<shortDescription>There's an unexpected amount of emotion and anger to be found in the back-end of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabriela Cowperthwaite, the documentary filmmaker of Blackfish, has said her project isn't to persuade people against animals in entertainment parks. She says it is to make us think about our relationship to them and what we will teach our children because animals are highly emotive creatures. In this context though, and knowing how poorly they're treated, are these two facets really that inseparable? The film channels its empathy towards mammals by focussing on Tilikum, a twelve thousand- pound male orca whale that was taken from the wild in the early 1980s. It was first captured under brutal circumstances by Sealand of the Pacific, a public aquarium in Canada. Sealand was closed in the 90s after Tilikum had drowned a female trainer. Despite his aggression, he was bought by SeaWorld in Florida and this resulted in the brutal death of a man who snuck in the water park one evening and a popular female trainer, Dawn Brancheau in 2010. Cowperthaite's investigation uses primary sources, such as people who worked for the aquariums at a young age and also professional whale researchers, to analyse the aggressive behaviour of the whales and the blatant cover-ups from SeaWorld.A key challenge faced by any documentary filmmaker is balancing both perspectives of their analysis or argument. Late in this documentary, it is revealed that SeaWorld declined to be interviewed. It would have been fascinating to hear their point of view. Outside the film, they eventually responded to the documentary through a CNN interview, claiming to have helped the mammals. Some of their other statements though are total bunkum, arguing that animals don't need to be able to travel long distances to be healthy. Comments like this are even more ridiculous after seeing the persuasive lengths Cowperthwaite's interviewees go to in describing the emotions of these creatures. They are characterised here as being more sociable than humans and that they are very capable of experiencing grief, like when an orca is separated from her kind and starts making noises her trainers hasn't heard before. They have their own languages and a repetiteur of vocals that we can never really understand. Contrary to SeaWorld's claims that they only live twenty to thirty years, the researchers argue they have a lifespan equivalent of any human being. The film is compassionate in the way that it is about the separation and the understanding of a similar species, which we might not understand but we can still empathise with.Another significant layer to the documentary is the commercialisation of the aquatic parks. A fascinating discovery is that the young trainers aren't chosen for having any experience or knowledge of mammals. Alarming, they are hired primarily on their personality and swimming ability. The former trainers interviewed are regretful and sorrowful for being so young and blinded by the facade put up by the parks. There are some hilariously dated advertisements for the water parks cut into film, allowing the parks to posture as a family friendly zone. The seriousness of this facade is expressed through one of the investigations into a trainer's death. SeaWorld argued that it was Dawn Brancheau's fault for being killed by the whale because her ponytail was loose but then changed its statements. One of the major accusations is, quite believably, that SeaWorld blames the trainers because they want to preserve the friendly images of the whales. They are the cornerstone and image of their business and financial success. No one would buy a fluffy whale toy if they knew the truth about a whale biting off a man's genitals or intentionally drowning a trainer by trapping their legs and then dragging them under the water. The form of the documentary is limited to the interviews and mostly archival footage. It is not the most cinematic documentary but its energy levels lift considerably when we are shown some of the real footage of the whales attacking their trainers. There is a terrifying sequence in which a trainer is pulled under the water several times but since he is an experienced diver he was able to hold his breath for a long period before escaping. The film raises powerful questions about the broader global ethics and culture of SeaWorld, not just in America but other countries like Spain, and the way they treat their staff and wildlife alike. How is it that in various parts of the world they are able to treat both with such disdain? How far are they willing to go to neglect safety and empathy in order to preserve their financial investments? There's an unexpected amount of emotion and anger to be found in the back-end of the film. It would have been invaluable to hear SeaWorld's defence front on. We're left as disorientated as some of the people who knew these victims and trained Tilikum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blackfish (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Eye-opening documentary about the killer whale Tilikum who has been seen by millions at SeaWorld but he got even more attention after he killed Dawn Brancheau, a top trainer at the park. This documentary shows the abuse that many killer whales face at such places and also shows why the Dawn attack never should have happened especially when you look at the violent history of Tilikum. BLACKFISH is without question a very intelligent documentary that manages to get its point across without much trouble. Using various interviews, old SeaWorld commercials as well as actual footage, the film manages to really grab your attention and at times shock you. I don't think anyone is going to be shocked about the abuse these whales are apparently taking inside the park. I think we've heard about this stuff for decades now but it's still fairly shocking to see the living conditions these huge creatures must live in. Even more shocking is how SeaWorld officials pretty much overlooked the behavior of Tilikum and allowed him to come into contact with not only trainers but sometime audience members. There's no question that one's blood pressure will raise while watching this thing because it's just so confusing why certain things were done and not done. There's also even more information about how these whales are captured and the various abuses that happen out in the ocean. If there is one flaw with the film it's the fact that it's pretty much one-sided. Many of the former trainers talk about how bad everything is but I think they should have known that there was a risk working with killer whales. Most make it seem that they felt there wasn't any danger but even someone like me knows there's a risk with certain jobs. The number of attacks or injuries from these whales are also discussed but it's pretty much overlooked that considering the number of shows there are really very few injuries. With that said, I'd agree that one life lost is too many.</fullReview>

I consider myself to be an animal lover, an I am not sure if Sea World is an improper place for whales. However, I am also sensitive to any "documentary" which presents activists and non-experts as scientists or veterinary experts, with the expressed intent of furthering a debatable point of view. As with any extremist group, meaningful debate is forfeited in this film, and propaganda is presented as fact. As always with PETA, the ends justify the means.</fullReview>

The filmmaker would have you believe that Sea World can do no good and is pure evil incarnate.Basically you need to do research on both sides before coming to conclusions yourself. I liked the film, but then felt like it was biased so went and saw what Sea World had to say. Then I realized just how biased the film really was, to the point where I can no longer look at it as anything other than BS with some nuggets of truth in it.</fullReview>

Some of the tactics were used simply to play into people's emotions. The footage does not necessarily line up with what they are discussing at the time. The talk of the mother/calf separations are ridiculous. Those calves were 4 1/2 years old and twelves years when they were taken. The older one had her own calf and that calf was moved with her. If you already disagree with whale captivity you will like this movie. Otherwise, expect to be lied to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watched BLACKFISH ..at first I thought this gona be another hypothetical melodrama..ones PETA do(which I support actually)..BUT not in terms with entertainment...BUT this film/documentary proved me wrong...it states the ordeal of orcas in human captivity..n how humans or a few "particular companies" abuse these beautiful creatures to squeeze every last drop of profit out of them...few of its scenes are so tear-jerking that it hits you right in the heart n you feel this rage against those bastards...N thus the flick is successful in its objective....NOW its screenplay is smart till the end with nice background score..BUT what this documentary lacks is documents..most of the real videos shown here are already public..they just focused on orcas rest of the creatures who go though the same sufferings are left(biggest weak point)..&amp; no matter what the reason is..its still a one sided story(with lack of documents/footage) STILL its a very touching film..n it can/ll affect you for good....I've given it a 6 BUT still its a _MUST WATCH_</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lies, deception, and a "killer agenda" cloud the otherwise enchanting documentary Blackfish. When watching a documentary, it is always important to maintain an open mind while also remembering who is making the film and the bias involved. The entire purpose of this film was to push an agenda that all animal captivity is terrible and that Sea World is hell on Earth for all of its animals. Blackfish tells the story of the Orcas that reside in Sea World. Centered on the killer whale, Tilikum and the tragedy of the death of Tilikum's trainer, Dawn. Tilikum began his captivity in a rinky dink park called Sea Land that housed him in horrible conditions. He was forced to stay in practically a tiny metal bathtub that was nowhere near adequate for Tilikum's size. This portion of the story culminates with the "big reveal" that Tilikum killed his trainer at Sea Land right before Sea World purchased him. This is an attempt to cover up the truth of the situation. Sea World acts as a sanctuary for a killer whale who has experienced horrible living conditions his entire life. I have no doubt that Tilikum killed the trainer, however, at the time I can certainly see how Sea World did not believe this. The only evidence was two little girls out of a huge crowd. Blackfish says that this is an example that Sea World is irresponsible because it purchases whales with little regard for their behavior.The argument against captivity as a whole is flawed. Many zoos and aquariums participate in conservation efforts. Sea World is a top notch facility with world-class trainers. Zoos help rehabilitate animals and are an amazing educational source. To argue that animal captivity is inherently evil is to argue that the consumption and use of animals in any form is also inherently evil. Using animals for educational and entertainment purposes is the exact same as using animals for food and clothes. The most concrete evidence against Blackfish is the revelations from one of the trainers used in the film, Bridgette Pirtle. Pirtle says that from the start the makers of the film said that Blackfish was being made to honor Dawn. She was under the impression that it was more of inside look at Sea World and an explanation of what went wrong that day. Pirtle says the actual film demands from the start was for Sea World to "free them all." A far cry from the original goal. It attempted to capitalize on viewer's emotions by using mismatched film and unexperienced trainers. Blackfish is quite the slick film. From the start you are drawn in. The filmmakers certainly knew what they were doing and used every trick in the book. Interviews from "whale experts" helped to further the storyline. The film captured the beauty of the orca seemingly effortlessly. From the start of the film I was drawn in and could not look away the entire time. ?&gt;Blackfish also certainly brings some reasonable points to light. There is bad captivity. A zoo or aquarium should be top notch facilities that give animals exemplary conditions. Sea Land is a perfect example of this. The owners of that park were in over their heads and directly contributed to the deaths of two people. Even certain shows at Sea World are a little over the top and should not be something that the animals are put through. Regulation of the industry, not destruction, is what is needed. As a future educator, I see the importance in education. A park like Sea World is a better option than most cheap thrill parks. History proves that Sea World has its animal's best interests at heart. I'm not ready to see a haven like that destroyed by a deceiving film. When Pirtle was asked what she thought the goal of the film was she quickly replied "To win an Academy Award." Thankfully, it didn't accomplish that goal. Hopefully, it won't accomplish its other goals either. 4/10 stars. All 4 stars for the actual filmmaking of the documentary. None for the content. I caution children viewers because there are choice scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blackfish" is a clever example of duplicity penned by sanctimony. This documentary is so brilliantly produced and directed that skillfully veiled falsities are easily absorbed as fact by those prone to cognitive lethargy. Alas, the onion skin can only be peeled back by those questioning entertainment's prelates, or those equipped with minimal common sense, or those just refusing to become mindless lemmings. With that being said, this is an important topic and I whole-heartedly agree this story should be told ? but honestly and even-handedly. Regretfully, but not shockingly, this documentary is a Tinseltown spawn, where a prosperous bottom-line is always the primary goal. It is paramount to understand that with any similar financial venture, only box office receipts accurately weigh the measure of success. "Blackfish" is no different. Once the target audience has been identified, pandering these tenets to the more puerile intellects, will normally transform promising individual thinkers to biddable fawners. This is a movie for some, but not for me. I am glad I did not pay to see this and will only see "documentaries" when I am in full control of an on/off button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part of me wanted to believe the film as why wouldn't I believe what they tell me but it's all little clips pieced together that animal activists combined to make SeaWorld look bad.They have changed how they interact with the whales and they no longer swim with them. The human to whale training is mainly about getting the whales comfortable with them so that there is less stress when it comes to veterinary care. So worried this will influence more and more people to be against the park. I believe there was issues decades ago but not now it's all about rescuing and if they can't rehabilitate then they stay at the park. Mother and baby are not separated. They never force them to perform as they jump out of the water when the whales want to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Working in film you can make anything seem true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, most comments that will come out of this film are based on misguided information. First off you are dealing with a corporation that has changed hands multiple times and during the filming of the movie it had been in the hands of Anhauser Busch company. The first company to start it was back in the 60's and there was no show just a place to see the animals and learn about sea creatures. In the late 80's a trainer named Dave Butcher began working with the animals to get them to play which became a show. The goal of the company was to get people to understand sea life and respect it. Their efforts and personal money was used to help with stranded and maimed sea life. They would rehabilitate the animals and return them to the wild. The few that were in captivity helps the public to understand the creatures world. Nothing in this movie reflects the millions spent doing just that. The place they talked about in Spain has NO affiliation with SeaWorld what so ever. The Orca in Mexico with a bent dorsal was also rescued by Seaworld and financed through them as well as Michael Jackson. To grind out misinformation and call it fact creates reactionaries to come out of the woodwork which it did. Just as much as everything is true on the internet would also make everything in the film industry true too. I have personally been able to see Seaworld come out when we called about a hurt sea lion which had beached itself. Within an hour there were there, moved the pup to their facility and tried to keep it alive. They kept us up to date on what was going on which was amazing in and of itself. The pup died but they did all they could. No money was given... it was their policy. No news camera, fanfare... nothing.. next you have the fact that it has been owned by 5 different companies.. Each has it's own way of doing business. Most people are looking to blame, hate and or distrust and it is abundantly clear as to why.. movies that are acting like it is truth, fact or tugging at your heartstrings to get reaction to line their pockets is usually the first clue. Look at Al Gore.. 5 years and all ice will be gone..really.. seems it gained some back.. Michael Moore is another sensationalist.. he wants your money.. learn the facts before judging something.. this movie to me was a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shamless Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a shameless piece of propaganda that spares no effort in seeking to bring down Sea World. The fact that it plays so well to an unthinking, uncritical, mindless bleeding heart public, is in and of itself both informative and disturbing. This is a completely one sided story which conveniently leaves out the success stories of Sea World and benefits it has given the public. This is not a documentary, it is pure propaganda designed to convince the public that Sea World is a hot bed of mistreatment and torture for animals. Blackfish is designed to gnaw at the public's conscience, laying a guilt trip on us for ever having even wanted to visit Sea World, yet alone actually go there. While it may appeal to the unreasoning Free Willy types, those with rational minds will hopefully see for what it really is, one big fish story.</fullReview>

I was very disappointed in the wrong and misleading content they showed just to get a reaction from the targeted audience, and of course to make money.After all, who would pay money to see a debate on captivity when that can be found anywhere on the internet.If you want to watch a one-sided movie, which shows lots of distressing scenes which don't comply to the information sold to you - this is the movie for you. If not, I thoroughly recommend you go else where.I beforehand rated this movie a ten and then after doing adequate research, I am rating a 1 - If I could rate 0 I would!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished the movie and have to say I am very disappointed with the bias shown by the film makers throughout. I am very sympathetic to these poor creatures who live the great majority of their lives in captivity. The truth shall set you free, not half truths or just total misrepresentation and manipulation of facts. The fact we see most of the film through the eyes of a handful of animal trainers without learning anything about their backgrounds and separation from sea world is in itself disturbing. The so called experts brought forth to enlighten us on the facts of the species added nothing but statistical manipulations. Bottom line this film is just so much chum in the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult film, worthwhile, but unbalanced.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!! I would definitely not allow young children watch this documentary. !! And I would only allow older children (particularly animal lovers or tender hearted kids) watch it with someone there to talk about it afterward. I am glad that I watched it because it was eye opening, but it was a painful film for me. My stomach hurt afterward because it was in knots for most of the film. I kept wanting to say, "OK! You had my sympathies after the first 10 minutes, quit beating me over the head with reality! I know what you think the facts are now and where to search on the Internet effectively on this topic now -- thanks -- but where is there a possible hopeful future?!" A documentary needs balance to be truly effective. I decided to stop watching it 3/4 of the way through because I'd already gotten the point and couldn't stand having it drilled into me more without anesthesia. I did zip to the end in case there was a change of tone, but to no avail. On the positive side: this was an eye-opening documentary, which gave interviews with the people who actually interact with Orcas (the film was one long collection of interviews). There were facts presented, which appear at first blush to be correct, and the OSHA perspective was a valuable counterpoint to the interviews with trainers (OSHA pushed to require trainers to be behind a barrier during the spectacles for safety reasons). It is unfortunate that Sea World did not give their perspective, and their silence is very damning. The biggest negative comment that I would make is that the documentary did a very poor job of finding hope in this situation. In documentary films "a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down." Some filmmakers use humor for that purpose but talk about better futures would have helped. -- If you are reading this review and happen to have been involved in creating the documentary, well kudos to you for a very thorough and effective job. But please watch some Jacques Cousteau before creating the next one. He had a real knack for creating beautiful, effective documentaries about difficult ecological topics, with hope. -- Finally, I couldn't help thinking, while watching this film, about the Indians who welcomed the Pilgrims to a new land, and what our ancestors did to them. Too close an analogy. What must Orcas think of us?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently, the message of BLACKFISH is that anyone who . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . has ever visited or otherwise supported Sea World deserves to burn in hell forever. Orcas, this flick implies, are more highly evolved than human beings. Sea World shortens the natural life span of "their" stolen Orcas by 65% through constant physical torture and emotional abuse. Every current Sea World employee shown in archival footage in BLACKFISH is documented as a probable perjurer in U.S. courts (where many Sea World employees seem to spend half their time). Sea World blames its employees for their own murders orchestrated by Sea World management. Due to the high turnover rate for its Orca "talent," within a few years 100% of all Orcas at all Sea Worlds will be direct descendants of three-time killer Tilikum (a family tree and footage of one of "free Tilly's" frequent "milkings" were used to illustrate this point; it's exactly as if beings from an alien planet came to Earth and kidnapped Charles Manson, and used his potential for cloning to open up "Human World" exhibits all over their home planet, leaving its inhabitants to view these mini-Mansons as illustrative of all humans and all human behavior!). Stunningly, this film states in the closing credits that Sea World declined ALL interview requests (though the bulk of the movie is devoted to the crying regrets of about 20 FORMER employees, with a few paying customer-murder witnesses thrown into the mix). Could Sea World be lying just to save face and make more money? In the country that has given us Lance Armstrong, Anthony Weiner, and Alex Rodriguez, is it fair to even ask such a question? The "facts" in this movie include news clips from about every U.S. media source except Fox. Perhaps we need to wait to find out WWBS (i.e., What Would Bill (O'Reilly) Say)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just another person with a personal vendetta to Sea World. Only 4 of the whales living at the parks were originally captured in the wild, and only 3 people have died in the last 50 years in Sea World that's a lot less than any job that I know. Obviously they are not the company that they used to be! Boycotting Sea World will only make the lives of these whales even more miserable, since the funding goes to the trainers, food, and the bills that help keep these whales and the other animals that Sea World alive and comfortable. Sea World is also very active in helping other animals in the wild as well. You can actually do a walk-through of Sea World and the trainers talk about what they do on a daily basis with the animals and how they treat them. People that watch this need to head directly to the Sea World site and watch their side of this. This is a BS movie.</fullReview>

I especially liked the moment in the movie when the man says their is no record of the KILLER! whales harming anyone in the wild, ha ha yeah right. This is the same logic that we used to make poor people pay for paper bags, and not getting rid of junk mail first, or removing elephants from zoos and circuses,while poachers hunt them to extinction in the wild, or the war on coal in this country that has poor people freezing because they can't afford to heat their homes.

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but full of fallacies and emotional appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be very informative and entertaining. While most of the reviews agree with this point, I think there are some details that people are glossing over and I would encourage movie-goers to recognize. Some of these problems are implied or perceived by most of the audience.1. Subjectivity: Like many documentaries, it is far from objective and offers a one sided argument. Intents of the filmmakers to include both sides do not change this fact.2. Fallacy: "SeaWorld declined to interview because they were the wrongdoers." SeaWorld's reason for not participating cannot be derived. SeaWorld's exclusion does not validate or further any claims made in the documentary.3. Emotional appeal: Emotion dominates reason as the primary method of persuasion.4. Fallacy: "The part of the orca brain that handles emotions is very large and active therefore it should not be in captivity." The right to liberation does not necessarily follow from an animal's emotional ability.5. Fallacy: "Whales have killed more in captivity then in the wild, therefore their captivity must be wrong." It is possible that the higher death rate in captivity is a result of much higher human interactions than in the wild. The ease of observing and documenting cases of aggressive behavior in captivity far surpasses that of the wild, biasing the results.6. Fallacy: "Because of the high risk of working with these whales, SeaWorld is wrong to allow it." This argument fails to take into account the possibility of trainer consent.7. Fallacy: "The aggressive behavior of Tilikum is a result of his being angry for being held captive." There is no evidence to support this connection that has any scientific value. It fails to take into account whales who are not aggressive, gene predisposition, and alternative reasons for the aggressive behavior.8. Fallacy: "Showcasing whales is unnatural and therefore wrong." Because X is unnatural, X is wrong, is a natural fallacy. Ethical wrongdoing does not necessarily derive from being unnatural. The dorsal fin collapse is also used to support this argument.9. Sampling bias: Over-reliance on Tilikum as representative of SeaWorld's show whales.I rated 6/10 because the park footage and overall entertainment aspect of the film was significant enough to overpower the logical flaws.</fullReview>

Be prepared to cry. Seaworld I guess takes baby Orcas away from their families, not just dolphins. I couldn't watch it anymore after hearing Seaworld "punished" and "raked" and "starved" their Orcas. Anyone who knew and didn't do anything deserves to be in jail or scalped or dead, regardless of them crying on camera and saying "how bad they feel". Seaworld is disgusting.

If you don't look at both sides you don't have the whole facts that is the best thing to do. Sea world keeps the mothers and children together. Have you looked at the baby at sea world in San Diego?
